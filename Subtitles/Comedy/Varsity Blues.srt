1
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,821
In America we have laws,

2
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,076
laws against killing,
laws against stealing.

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,414
And it's just accepted that
as a member of American society,

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,666
you will live by these laws.

5
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:30,298
In West Canaan, Texas, there is
another society which has its own laws.

6
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,765
Football is a way of life.

7
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,605
That's me as a kid,
playing ball with my best friends.

8
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,650
I'm Jonathan Moxon,
but most people call me Mox.

9
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,201
As a boy growing up
in West Canaan, Texas,

10
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,370
you never question
the sanctity of football.

11
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,875
You just listen to what the coaches said
and tried as best as you could to win.

12
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,420
Win at all costs.

13
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,891
Good morning, West Canaan.
Creighton Miles here,

14
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,352
looking forward to seeing you tonight
at Bud Kilmer Stadium

15
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,729
as the Coyotes take on
the Bingville Bulls.

16
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,689
Kick-off time 7:30.

17
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,858
There'll be a victory celebration
immediately following the game.

18
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,943
Think you'll play tonight?

19
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,820
- Do I ever play?
- No, but...

20
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,321
Lance is the best quarterback
in the state.

21
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,615
Why would we want anyone
but him to play?

22
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,911
Well, maybe if you guys are running
up the score, or what if Lance gets hurt?

23
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,871
Hey, don't even think about
Lance going down.

24
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,414
That would be a disaster.

25
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,834
In fact, as a man of the cross,
or in your case,

26
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,921
a man on the cross, I ask you to pray
for the health of Lance Harbor.

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,637
Son, did you pray for playing time?

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,807
- Yeah, I just spoke to Jesus upstairs.
- What?

29
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,268
The crucified 11 -year-old
living in my room.

30
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,020
- Is Kyle strapped to that cross again?
- Yup.

31
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,815
Kyle! Why is he so difficult?

32
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,360
Kyle, what is it with the cross?

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,737
I'm preparing to die for all of man's sins.

34
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,698
That's so sweet, honey.

35
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,659
I want it off, now!

36
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,079
How's your brother supposed to
concentrate on tonight's game

37
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,416
with you running around with
this whole deal strapped to your back?

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,878
- Dad, he's just experimenting.
- Enough! I'm serious.

39
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,548
Now, we all need to concentrate
on tonight's game!

40
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:40,177
- That's probably Billy Bob.
- Mo!

41
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:45,099
Hey, Mox, you skinny ass bitch, let's roll!

42
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,858
Come on, man!
Let's get in the truck! Let's go!

43
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,528
Come on, Mox, earn it!
Come on! You got it!

44
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,948
Come on. You're almost there!
Here we go!

45
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,994
You got it! Park it, baby, yeah!

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,539
You tell him, Bacon!

47
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,250
All right, Bacon, off in the flatbed.

48
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,920
Hey, hey! Come on, man. Hey, Billy Bob!

49
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,046
Good boy.

50
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,964
Billy Bob, I'm telling you, man,

51
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,342
this swine fucks up my new suit, man,
he's road ham!

52
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,261
I'm sorry, Wendell. Just kick him off.

53
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,265
Hey. I'm gonna toss your pig ass
out on the street! Move over!

54
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,394
- I love that dog.
- I think it's a pig.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,605
Yeah.

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,506
I love you, brother.

57
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,719
I had the most beautiful dream
last night.

58
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,346
Well, all right.

59
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,517
Hey, you need anything, big guy,
you let me know. Come on.

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,278
- Tweeter, let's go!
- Yeah!

61
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,489
Come on, Tweeter! Let's go, dog!

62
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,288
Good mooning, boys, good mooning!

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,336
I been up since the crack of dawn,
and I had to ask you a question.

64
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,799
- What is up with Carrie-Anne Baker?
- Darcy's friend?

65
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,427
Oh, my God! She's got this look!

66
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,138
Like, "I just fell out of
the I-wanna-suck-your-dick tree"

67
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,056
"and hit every branch on the way down."

68
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:54,020
- Relax, man, you got to focus.
- I can't focus. I need to get some ass!

69
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,147
I need to hit some ass!

70
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,483
I'm about to fuck your pig!
How about that?

71
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,112
Give me a kiss!

72
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,635
Tonight, we play Bingville.

73
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,181
Tonight, we beat Bingville!

74
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,153
In my 30 years of coaching
at West Canaan,

75
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:32,284
I have brought two state titles
and 22 district championships!

76
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,953
Count them!

77
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,629
And this year, God willing
with your support for this great team,

78
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,215
I will bring number 23!

79
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,552
- Go, pack! Go, pack! Go, pack!
- Yeah!

80
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,554
Yeah!

81
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,688
Now I present to you our captain,
quarterback Lance Harbor.

82
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,189
Let's hear it!

83
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,073
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

84
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,578
I swear Kilmer gets off on this.
He's made your brother a god.

85
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,290
I was lying in bed last night

86
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,298
and I drifted off to sleep,
and I had a dream

87
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,509
that we were beating Bingville 14-3.

88
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,931
But I woke up kind of sad,

89
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,812
but then I cheered up when I realized
it was only a dream, because

90
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,732
I know we'll beat Bingville
by way more than that.

91
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,199
Tell me this insanity is over
in a few weeks.

92
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,994
Five more games.
No more football, no more Kilmer,

93
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,456
and, if I get into Brown,
no more West Canaan.

94
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,500
No more games on Friday nights?

95
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,878
You don't like games on Friday nights?

96
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,796
I like trains better.

97
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,425
Really? You wanna watch trains tonight?

98
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,135
Sure.

99
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,223
Hi, everybody. This is Creighton Miles,

100
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,725
the voice of West Canaan
High School football.

101
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,853
And the Coyotes tonight will play
the Bingville Bulls

102
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,980
and then try the state undefeated.

103
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,901
Joining me in the booth is
Stubby "Stud Daddy" Tanner,

104
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,986
former defensive great for the Coyotes.

105
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,364
Welcome to the booth.
Do you have a few words for the folks?

106
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,824
Well, just one thing
for those Bingville fans.

107
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,869
If their granny lives in Bingville,
you better tell her to move,

108
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,330
'cause the Coyotes are coming
to burn her house down.

109
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,124
And yea though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

110
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,835
I will fear no faggots from Bingville.

111
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,338
And yea though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

112
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,008
All right. Stay loose, Mox.

113
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,844
You never know
when Kilmer might play you.

114
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,054
Yeah.

115
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,643
Bingville don't stand no chance
And Bingville can't see my dance

116
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,728
You wanna see the new Tweeter
end-zone dance?

117
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,522
Check it out.

118
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,817
- You know what it's called?
- Hell yeah, Tweeter!

119
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,444
- What?
- The new Tweeter end-zone dance.

120
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,322
Here I come.

121
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,702
Stick.

122
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,097
Set! Hut 18!

123
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,350
Hut 19! Go!

124
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,241
Lance Harbor, two-year all-state,
what a night he's having.

125
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,746
Twins right. Now get in there.

126
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,128
Come on down fifth!
Take it in now, yeah!

127
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,047
Come on, let's go!

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,304
Go!

129
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,829
Hey, Sammy. That's about
the most action your boy's seen, isn't it?

130
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,750
- Coyotes on the lip of the cup.
- We're punching it in for six.

131
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,752
Set! Go!

132
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,823
Billy Bob?

133
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,659
Billy Bob! Trainer!

134
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,541
Billy Bob, you all right?

135
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,552
- Did we score?
- Yeah, Billy Bob, we got the six.

136
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,429
How many fingers?

137
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,850
- Three?
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

138
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,101
It's got to be true or false.

139
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,438
Billy Bob, the man's holding up
some fingers, true or false?

140
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,565
True?

141
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,651
He's all right, Coach.

142
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,571
- Come on, boy!
- He's all right.

143
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,474
If your daddy hadn't played his heart
out for me, I'd cut your ass.

144
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,815
Well, that was a good thing tonight!
Good thing tonight!

145
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,485
Good pass, Bo. Johnny and Robert.

146
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,988
Defense in third quarter, excellent effort.
Where's the game ball?

147
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,242
The game ball goes to,
surprise-surprise, Lance Harbor.

148
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,922
Get yourself another shelf.
Pretty good running the ball, Wendell.

149
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,508
Really not bad, boy. How you feeling?

150
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,011
Dog tired. It's my knee.

151
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,223
Never show weakness.
Never show weakness.

152
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,683
The only pain that matters
is the pain you inflict.

153
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:16,730
Look at Billy Bob. He got enough heart
for all y'all. Look at this old boy.

154
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,738
- Four more games.
- Yup. Hang in there, man.

155
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,573
You're doing fine.

156
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,285
Hey, Tweeter. Hey, man, you got any?
My knee's killing me.

157
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,707
Sweetness. 500 milligrams?

158
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,044
- How many can I have?
- Keep them. I got more at home.

159
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,256
This team needs is a lot more effort...

160
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,301
What is this shit? I'm not interested
in your fucking muscles.

161
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,427
- Maybe that's what happened...
- Kilmer.

162
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,055
In the fourth quarter. You're
looking off in the goddamn stands!

163
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,890
What a fucking asshole?

164
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,892
I'm telling you, there's people here that

165
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,812
- are not focused on this fucking game!
- I'm getting fucked up tonight.

166
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,772
- Yup, I'm getting fucked up.
- I ain't just talking about you.

167
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,899
I'm talking to other people, too!

168
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,989
Come on, Bacon. That's it, baby.
Be a good dog, here you go.

169
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,866
There you go. You chug it! Chug it!

170
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,535
And what do you mean
is he a boy or a girl?

171
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,745
Of course he's a boy.
Look at the size of that sausage!

172
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,873
Isn't that right, boy? Hey!
Look at the size of that sausage!

173
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,918
Baby, I just got so excited thinking
about next year

174
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,920
and Florida State and the future.

175
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,882
I think I need to be your wide receiver.

176
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,676
Really, baby? Here?

177
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,055
Not here, here, but somewhere here.

178
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,935
Come on.

179
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,316
Now how come
you never dress like that?

180
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,984
Costs a lot of money to look that cheap.

181
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,445
Well, no, she's pretty sharp.
She pulls A's.

182
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,157
- That's not all she pulls.
- I'm just saying she's not stupid.

183
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,783
You shut up.

184
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,706
She broke my heart, so I broke herjaw

185
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,877
- So when did you graduate?
- I'm class of 1980.

186
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,339
Hey, he's class of 1980.

187
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,801
Yeah? Graduated 1980 and still come
to all these football parties?

188
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,136
I never miss these.

189
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,680
- Well, that's team spirit!
- Yeah, it is.

190
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,558
- Ain't it? That is team spirit.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,312
All right, you ready to be on America's
Hilarious Home Videos, or what?

192
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,563
Absolutely.

193
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,107
All right, put down that glass.

194
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,402
All right,
now pick up that there flowerpot.

195
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,364
All right, bring it up over your head.

196
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,951
All right, now close your eyes.
Think real hard.

197
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,412
- You getting this?
- You know I got it.

198
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,625
Then say, "I'm stupid
and I'm about to get hit in the nuts."

199
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,463
That's funny. Ain't it, buddy?

200
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,091
That's what I mean, see. They need to
change the name of the show

201
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,385
to America's Funniest Shots in the Nuts!

202
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,184
Baby, I don't know
if I can concentrate here.

203
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,522
Relax, let the dryer do the work.

204
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,072
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

205
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:24,418
All right, fancy boy.
You ready to show us your dinner?

206
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,676
Nothing but net!

207
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:47,315
- Billy Bob! Billy Bob!
- Billy Bob! Billy Bob!

208
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,285
You thinking about calling
some dinosaurs?

209
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:06,001
I figured I'd give them a holler.

210
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:14,092
- Billy Bob's gonna puke.
- Here he goes!

211
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,014
Move!

212
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,996
Hey, if you're hungry,
I left a few hot dogs in here.

213
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,584
I'm back! Puke and rally!

214
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,797
Give me a beer!

215
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,048
- Break!
- Break!

216
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,512
Set! Go!

217
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,896
There he is! There he is!
That a boy, that a boy, Lance!

218
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,314
You see that?
That's the way to ride them.

219
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,192
All right! First string
offense, take water!

220
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,570
- Give me a huddle! Give me a huddle!
- Dummieos! Dummieos!

221
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,824
Follow your dummieo QB to the mud
for a scrimmage.

222
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,493
- Think about it now.
- Moxon, pick it up!

223
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,206
Your attitude's earning you
laps right now, boy.

224
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,417
Keep smiling, shithead.

225
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:36,007
He used to hammer my ass
the exact same way 27 years ago!

226
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,676
Hell, it's good for him.

227
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,679
Shit, them boys is having
the time of their lives!

228
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,847
No doubt about it.

229
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,015
- Oop-dee-oop left, on one. Ready?
- Break!

230
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,851
Let's go, big Mox!

231
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,143
Shift!

232
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,275
What the hell kind of offense is that?

233
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,152
Kilmer gonna eat his ass.
Watch this. See?

234
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,948
In Jesus name, Moxon,
what are you doing?

235
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,200
What kind of lu-lu formation
you pulling?

236
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,160
- It's a secret.
- It's a secret?

237
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,413
Your dummieos can't even run
a simple draw

238
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,164
and you got secret formations?

239
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,708
Shit for brains,
this isn't no fucking sand lot!

240
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,794
- It's called a oop-dee-oop.
- It's an oop-dee-oop. Oop-dee-oop!

241
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,672
Nevada State averaged over 40 points
a game with this offense.

242
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,257
Overload the defense
on the strong side,

243
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,800
burn them one on one on the other.

244
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,762
You got a bad attitude,
and you don't listen!

245
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,225
We do things around here my way!
You understand that?

246
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,936
You think you're in some fancy school?
Bullshit!

247
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,564
You show me the kind of smarts,
makes me wonder if you know

248
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,483
the difference between a sneeze
and a wet fart!

249
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,445
You gonna be second string
all your life, boy!

250
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,740
Man! Kilmer loves
to bag on your boy, Sammy.

251
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,074
Been on him all season.

252
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,245
Oop-dee-oop! Give me a break!
Oop-dee-fucking-oop! Give me a break.

253
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,998
I stood up to it, so will he.

254
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,807
Yup, gonna hold our Troy back a year

255
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,477
so he'll be bigger for frosh try-outs.

256
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,271
Eighth grade isn't so bad, is it, Son?

257
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,608
Our Kyle's dying
to get into a Coyote jersey.

258
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,778
Had that ankle injury,
but he's ready to go now.

259
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,529
Ain't that right, Son?

260
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,198
Kyle?

261
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,993
Kyle!

262
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,538
He's very spiritual.

263
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,875
Shame nobody had the mind
to hold us back

264
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,294
when we was kids, eh, Sammy boy?

265
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,173
Hell, I didn't fair so bad.

266
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,053
Lance? Toss me one, Son.

267
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,640
Let's show them
your old pop's still got it!

268
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,061
Button hook right on three.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

269
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,318
Slow enough he could have mailed it.

270
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,237
Well, there you go, Sammy boy.

271
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,739
- Oh, no.
- Let's see it, old man!

272
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,408
Let's show them how it's done.

273
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,077
But, Dad, come on,
you're gonna fall on the barbecue.

274
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,789
Slant right on three.
Don't talk back to your father.

275
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,252
Set. Hut! Hut! Hut! Come on, boy, hit it!

276
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,262
Well, I guess bad hands
just runs in the family.

277
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,180
What's that supposed to mean?

278
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,767
It's just for grins,
don't get your panties in a bunch.

279
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,313
If Kilmer weren't such a prick,
my boy would be starting quarterback.

280
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:43,236
Is that a fact?
And you think he's first string?

281
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,032
- That's right.
- I smell a challenge.

282
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:53,621
How about you, Jonnie?
Do you think you're better than my boy?

283
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,543
Well, hell. It ain't multiple choice.

284
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,588
I think it's best
we settle this matter once and for all.

285
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,340
You all remember William Tell?
Get up, Lance.

286
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,510
Let's show them what it takes
to start for Kilmer's Coyotes.

287
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:11,389
- Stop it, Dad. This isn't funny!
- Knock off this here can.

288
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,102
- Show them what you're made of.
- Come on, Lance. Nail the can! Nail it!

289
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,399
You up, Sammy boy.

290
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,779
- Dad, come on, this is stupid!
- Throw it.

291
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,949
Sporting some 'tude now!

292
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:34,370
- Be a winner. Throw the damn ball!
- Come on, Jonnie, you can do it!

293
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,665
Sit on the bench!
Show us what you do best!

294
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,251
- He's chicken!
- Yeah, he is a chicken.

295
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,091
- Throw that damn ball!
- Hey, you feel like chicken tonight?

296
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,967
You can do it!

297
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,806
I raised you to be a winner.
So damn it, boy, win!

298
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,184
Fire that fucking pigskin!

299
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,606
Nice shot!

300
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,360
- Get some ice for him!
- Not ice, get him a beer.

301
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,155
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

302
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:37,225
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

303
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,691
We are adults,

304
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:51,948
and I think it's necessary that we move
beyond the common nomenclature

305
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,995
commonly associated with
sexual reproduction.

306
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:03,418
Now, I want everybody together
to go ahead and say,

307
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,423
"Penis, penis, penis,
vagina, vagina, vagina."

308
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,888
Come on, you all, say it.

309
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:21,561
Penis, penis, penis,
vagina, vagina, vagina.

310
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,439
Well, good! Great!

311
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,946
Now, I think it's also very important
that we discuss and discard

312
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:37,869
any slang terms
for different sex organs. Please.

313
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:43,458
Because today,
we are going to begin our study of

314
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,878
the male erection.

315
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,424
Hand down, Billy Bob.

316
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,053
Okay. So what are a few of
the slang expressions

317
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:59,766
for the male erection
we want to identify and discard?

318
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,978
Elliot?

319
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,898
Boner?

320
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,193
- Is boner one of them?
- Yes.

321
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,031
Boner is good. Boner is very...

322
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,492
What, Billy Bob?

323
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,036
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- Please.

324
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:26,834
Now, does anybody have
any others before we move on?

325
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,131
Mr. Moxon, care to share with us?

326
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,676
The male erection?

327
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:40,223
Pitching a tent. Sporting wood.
Icicle's formed. The march is on.

328
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,683
Thank you, Jonathan.

329
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:47,480
Stiff, stiff y, Mr. Mortis,
rigor mortis has set in, flesh rocket.

330
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,276
Jack's magic beanstalk,
tall Tommy, mushroom on a stick,

331
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,487
Mr. Mushroom head,
purple-headed yogurt slinger,

332
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,700
and Pedro.

333
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,536
Pedro?

334
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,556
- Billy Bob, are you okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

335
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,398
Call the nurse!

336
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,900
Go on now.

337
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:42,160
- How you feeling, son?
- Can't seem to hold down any chow, sir.

338
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,745
Must be nerves.

339
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,374
Don't you worry. You're gonna play
every minute of that game.

340
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,295
Nurse doesn't think I should play.

341
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,213
She doesn't, does she?

342
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,300
Because, well,
I got my head whacked last week.

343
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,137
Well, she don't have no division title
to win, does she?

344
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,431
I'm gonna ask you, son,

345
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,976
are you ready to go?

346
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,399
- Yes, sir.
- That's my soldier, William Robert.

347
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:17,153
Now you rest here. Take advantage,
see you at 4:00 practice.

348
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,614
Yes, sir.

349
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,577
Hut!

350
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,506
Fourth down, 1:49 to play, Greenville.

351
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,008
Stubby, leading 21 -17.

352
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,718
If they hope to win the ball game,

353
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:44,055
the Coyotes have got to stop
Greenville right here.

354
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,348
- Break!
- Break!

355
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,190
Hornets, come to the line of scrimmage.

356
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,276
James Cowboy pulls the quarterback
gives the football to Terry and...

357
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,736
He's stopped right in his tracks!

358
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:02,281
Yes! Our ball. He got the bastards!

359
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,325
That's ours to win now! Ours to win!

360
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,910
Get out there and win this ball game.

361
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,162
All right, 4-95. Let's go. Get out there.

362
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,622
Come on, Lance!

363
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,999
Let's go! Let's go!

364
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,252
Billy Bob,
I need you for one more series, Hoss.

365
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,546
Get in there! Get in there! Right deep.

366
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,173
Are you sure you're all right to play?

367
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,591
- If you're not all right, say something.
- Moxon.

368
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,636
Get your ass back on that bench!

369
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,184
Let's go, boys, let's go!
Ours to win now. Door's open, let's go!

370
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,353
- Break!
- Break!

371
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,572
Set! Blue 32!

372
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,783
Blue 32!

373
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,285
Go!

374
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,975
Lord, don't do this to me.

375
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:21,486
Stub, I'll tell you, I've hardly ever heard
this stadium this quiet.

376
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,155
Lance Harbor, laying there on the field.

377
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,282
And you see his future
going down the drain.

378
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,034
Committed to Florida State.

379
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,704
And now what must this do to
the Coyotes' football plans?

380
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,001
Oh, God.

381
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,801
Lance, please be okay. Lance.

382
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,137
Oh, God. It's my knee, man.

383
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,107
I'm sorry, man. Lance!

384
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,077
You're looking now coming in Lasala,
and you got Moxon looking to come in.

385
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,622
Yeah, and you've taken more snaps
than he's taken.

386
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,963
We got a game here. Let's go.
We got a game.

387
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,881
We got a game to win. Let's go.

388
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,515
Watch me for the signals. Stay focused.

389
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,561
And don't worry, son, I'm behind you.

390
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:44,026
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Well, there goes the season.

391
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,657
That Moxon isn't worth the Charmin
extra soft he wipes his butt with.

392
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:54,662
He's hurt bad, Mox. It's all my fault, man.
It's all my fault.

393
00:31:55,581 --> 00:32:00,293
All right, I right, 494, Z-post, on one.

394
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,421
I right, 494, Z-post, on one.

395
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,172
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

396
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,091
Here we go with Moxon as quarterback.

397
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,261
Yeah, they say this guy scratches
hisself better than he throws the ball.

398
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,889
Set! 2-80!

399
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,975
2-80! Go!

400
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,073
Yeah! En garde!

401
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:38,289
Jon Moxon with a 40-yard pass!
Where'd this kid come from?

402
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,541
Hey! That's my boy!

403
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:46,005
- Everybody on the ball! Get on the ball!
- He's got to stop the clock!

404
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,635
- Drag it. Drag it out.
- Stop play! Stop play! Stop play!

405
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,386
Give me the horny hex!

406
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,306
The clock's still running!
The clock's still running!

407
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,557
Go!

408
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,532
Huddle up!

409
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:23,167
I can't... Go again. I can't.

410
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,961
- You got it!
- Fuck it.

411
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,631
I don't know what play they're calling.
How's your arm?

412
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,007
- It's fine. I'm cool.
- All right.

413
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,176
- Last chance for the Coyotes.
- Set!

414
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,136
Moxon the quarterback.

415
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,098
This is not the formation!
That's not the formation!

416
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,349
Go!

417
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:43,354
Moxon hands off to Brown,
throwback pass, complete!

418
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,481
- He's got a chance!
- Moxon has the football!

419
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,775
- He's got a chance!
- What's the move? Heading for...

420
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,362
- Touchdown! Good grief!
- Touchdown! Touchdown!

421
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,533
Bud Kilmer pulls off another one!
Unbelievable!

422
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,798
Holy shit!

423
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,849
Mr. Harbor? Lance is out of surgery.

424
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,726
You should be able to visit him
in just a little while.

425
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,812
- How long's he out?
- Any chance for this season?

426
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,023
Look, Lance tore
every ligament he's got.

427
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,150
He's gonna need several surgeries

428
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,943
over the next few months
just to repair them all.

429
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,403
How long?

430
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,657
Minimum, year and a half, if ever.

431
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,287
No, no.

432
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,749
Lance's ride?

433
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,210
His scholarship to Florida State?

434
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,129
Jesus.

435
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,256
Look, I'm amazed
he hasn't had problems before this.

436
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,801
I removed a hell of a lot of scar tissue
from that boy's knee.

437
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,971
He shouldn't even have been playing.

438
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,098
Never said anything to me.

439
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,104
Moxon, get on home. Get some shuteye.

440
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,439
Harbors appreciate you being here,

441
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,192
but there's nothing more
you can do tonight. Get on.

442
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,658
You go on. I'll stay with them, okay?

443
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,077
- All right. I'll call you.
- All right.

444
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,378
Well, I guess
I should be going, too, then,

445
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,507
this being a family thing and all.

446
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,525
- Thanks again for the ride, Mox.
- No problem.

447
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,535
- What the hell are you doing?
- Changing.

448
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:08,165
Come on. I'm wearing underwear.
It covers up the same as a bathing suit.

449
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,335
Does it really bother you?

450
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,755
Whatever, I... You know, I can handle it.

451
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,385
This has been the worst night of my life.

452
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,014
You really aren't looking.

453
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,934
You're sweet.

454
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,019
Lance is gonna be all right.

455
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,355
His career is probably over.

456
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,234
No, you guys are gonna be all right.
You love each other.

457
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:40,698
Things change, Mox.
I don't wanna think about it right now.

458
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,118
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

459
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,205
I mean, what about you and Jules?

460
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,624
Is there a future?

461
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,044
Yeah, you know, I mean, she's great.

462
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,922
I got another year
until she's graduating but...

463
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,801
I mean, I love spending time with her,
you know.

464
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,470
Things change, Mox.

465
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,765
You're the starting quarterback now.

466
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,572
- Well, you're here.
- You're not coming in?

467
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,660
No. Not tonight. It doesn't seem right
with Lance all fucked up.

468
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,963
You don't always have to do
the right thing, Mox.

469
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,342
We'll continue this any time you want.

470
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,391
Shit.

471
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,939
Hey, girls.

472
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,782
- Hey, Tweeter. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

473
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:09,662
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Charlie Tweeter.

474
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,872
Yes, it is.

475
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,750
So how we doing tonight?

476
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,254
- How we doing? Well, we are doing fine.
- Congratulations.

477
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,884
- Well, congratulations to you, too.
- Congratulations for what?

478
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,305
Well, for getting to wear such cute
"mount me" hats.

479
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,766
- "Mount me"?
- Well, not right away,

480
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,810
I mean, after a couple of drinks, maybe.
I don't know.

481
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,269
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- All right.

482
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,814
We just wanna make sure
no one drinks and drives.

483
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,482
I was just kidding. Just kidding.

484
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,818
- You got a smart mouth.
- I know, I got a smart mouth,

485
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,321
and I got to watch it, and you know
what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go home.

486
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,407
I'm gonna give you these drinks.
Take this, please.

487
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,158
I don't want to drink and drive.

488
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,786
There'll be no drinking and no driving.

489
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,747
I think it's time for you to go home.

490
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,334
I think you're right.
I'm going home, all right?

491
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,294
- You go home.
- I'm going home.

492
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,755
- Bye, Tweeter.
- You know what? You hurt my feelings,

493
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,508
- and now I'm going home, all right?
- Where's Billy Bob?

494
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,553
I'm gonna go home,
and you can kiss my ass.

495
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,556
Haines, he's taking the car!

496
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,933
I'm gonna go to jail.

497
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,276
Son of a bitch!

498
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,827
Great game tonight.

499
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,872
Thanks. How much?

500
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,876
Your money's no good here.

501
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,215
Jonathan Moxon, you are under arrest

502
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,509
for not being naked
with some sophomore chick

503
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,552
who wants to bathe you with her tongue.

504
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,263
Now take off your goddamn clothes
and get in the car.

505
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,724
- Tweeter?
- Damn right, Tweeter.

506
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,436
They're about as sharp as a box of
marbles, but we're all naked in there,

507
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,272
and we got handcuffs
and cool shit to play with.

508
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,982
Now take off your clothes
and get in the car.

509
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,485
Mox, Tweeter threw my clothes
out the window.

510
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,238
- Will you come keep me warm?
- Shit.

511
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:57,704
I can't go with you. But, here,
I'll give you my jacket. Here you go.

512
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,123
Thank you.

513
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,627
- Sorry, Mox. I got to bail.
- All right.

514
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:08,090
Ladies. Shut up
and hold onto your nipples.

515
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,152
Hey, you weren't asleep, were you?

516
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:32,197
No. I was lying in bed
naming my unborn children.

517
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,158
How's Lance?

518
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,993
He's out of the first surgery.

519
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,871
They're gonna have to go back in there
again in a few weeks.

520
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,708
Man. I'm going to see him tomorrow.

521
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,713
- I heard you played a great game.
- It was strange.

522
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,757
Strange to be a god now?

523
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,971
I don't know. I mean...

524
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,892
We did win, you know.

525
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,314
I don't know, I've been...
I just been walking around for a while.

526
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,109
What's wrong, Jonnie?

527
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,861
Want me to get dressed
and come out there?

528
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:15,657
No. I'm just gonna go home.

529
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:27,794
It's been a really weird night.
I don't know. I'll see you tomorrow.

530
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,224
Well, they stole a state trooper car,

531
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:44,937
and then they exposed themselves
to the ladies' auxiliary.

532
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,523
I tell you, these players nowadays,
they just running around lawless.

533
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,650
There you go.

534
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:54,196
They're all hopped up on beer
and painkillers is what it is.

535
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,074
- Painkillers.
- They exposed theirselves?

536
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,618
Yup. Yeah.
They pulled out their wangers,

537
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,329
pressed them up against the glass
at the Alano Club

538
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,207
while the girls was rehearsing
the Christmas pageant.

539
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,000
Now that ain't right.

540
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,962
Wangers on the glass
at the Alano Club?

541
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,129
Yes.

542
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,548
No. No good.

543
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,677
You know, we never stole no cars.

544
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,513
I don't think I can just keep letting
these boys get away with this stuff...

545
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,515
Earl? Earl?

546
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,310
My boys too much trouble for you?

547
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,275
No, Coach. They just kids.

548
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,696
You know, Sam's boy
looked pretty good last Friday.

549
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

550
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,450
They all get theirselves
a sweet hand now and again.

551
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,203
Moxon sure ain't got what Lance has.

552
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,897
Set. Go.

553
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,502
So, now I wanna know
where Jon Moxon came from.

554
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,589
- Forty-yard scramble touchdown.
- What a great run.

555
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,634
Way to go, Jonnie.

556
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,264
- Go, Mox, Go!
- Go, Mox, Go!

557
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,143
Yeah, Mox.

558
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,697
- Hey, nice game, Jonathan.
- Well, thank you.

559
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,075
- See you in class.
- All right.

560
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:09,373
Yes, you will.
That's a nice car on a teacher's salary.

561
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,710
Look, I'm going with my dad
to see Lance. You wanna come?

562
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,338
This is Olin Buchanan of KPJT.

563
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,757
Mox, how does it feel to be
out of Lance Harbor's shadow

564
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,301
and showing everyone
that you've been underrated?

565
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,766
Gee, I mean, Lance Harbor
left some pretty big shoes to fill.

566
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,728
I don't know that I'll ever
get the job done like he did.

567
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,816
And we all want to know about you
planning to play ball in the lvy League.

568
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,401
Ivy Leagues?

569
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,364
Heck, I don't know. I don't know.

570
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:48,245
I just wanna thank God
and my teammates for the win today.

571
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,498
I mean, Jonathan Moxon's only one man,
you know.

572
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,459
I'm just one man.

573
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,090
- Thanks.
- All right, thank you.

574
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,641
"Gee"? "Heck"? You even thanked God.

575
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,062
- You know, you're a scary superstar.
- Come on, Jules.

576
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:18,692
You referred to yourself as one man.
You're really enjoying this.

577
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,361
Why not? It's a trip.

578
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,617
God. Look, I'm gonna go see my dad.

579
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,830
All right.

580
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,904
All right, let's razzle dazzle them
dummy D's with a little package six.

581
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,615
- The old hook and ladder.
- Man, that play don't work.

582
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,202
- Someone always screws up.
- Well, have a little fun, then.

583
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,163
All right. Hook and ladder left, on one.

584
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,623
Hook and ladder left, on one.

585
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:15,957
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

586
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:21,421
This ain't the one where I trot down field
and look like I'm lost, is it?

587
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,966
Guy, huddle them back up again.
Huddle up. Clayton, huddle them up.

588
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,343
Give me a huddle!

589
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,220
Billy Bob, this play is for you, all right?

590
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,555
- Tweeter's gonna pitch you the ball.
- Oh, no.

591
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,142
Oh, no what? Just catch the ball.
Look, a ball. I'm gonna catch it.

592
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:35,435
You big dummy. That's all.

593
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,562
But wait a minute,
but I'm no eligible receiver though.

594
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:40,357
- See what I mean, Mox?
- Just catch the damn ball, all right?

595
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,733
- Fine.
- Hook and ladder left, on one.

596
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,235
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

597
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,446
Go.

598
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:05,090
When did the damn circus
come to town?

599
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,591
I didn't see no trucks.

600
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,552
Would've been six
if he'd held onto the ball.

601
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,136
For which team?

602
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:16,434
You listen hard. Stick to the basics.
Stick to the basics. Stick to the basics.

603
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,565
We're a running team.
You only call what I tell you to call.

604
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,067
You hear me in there?

605
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,237
You are the damn
dumbest smart kid I know.

606
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,871
Come in.

607
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,045
No, don't sit. It won't take a minute.

608
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,426
You're dragging ass out there, son,

609
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,554
and it's fucking up my universe.
You understand?

610
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,849
You're fat, you're slow,
all of a sudden you're lazy.

611
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,768
And if it wasn't for you, I would
still have my starting quarterback.

612
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,979
I'm wondering what happened to you.

613
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,024
- My... Coach, my head...
- I don't want no excuses.

614
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,359
I want you to fix it.

615
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,492
Get out of here.

616
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,537
Get the hell out.

617
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,210
Hey, Mox, wait up.

618
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,381
- So, what time?
- What time what?

619
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,009
What time are you coming over tonight?

620
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,554
- Tonight?
- It's half price night at the gun club.

621
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,474
My folks never get home before 12:00.

622
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,063
Visited Lance today at the...

623
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,315
This is about you and me.

624
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,526
I've known you my whole life.

625
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:53,031
I'm not telling anyone
you're coming over.

626
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,452
Any time after 7:00.

627
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,759
Why be good? I'm always good.

628
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,429
Where's my upside to being good?

629
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,061
I'm 18 years old.
It's not like I'm married to her.

630
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,981
She invited me over.
I'm just being polite. Right, Kyle?

631
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,194
- Kyle?
- I only answer to one name.

632
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,281
I'm the great and honorable
El Ali Akbar Shabazz Da.

633
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,533
That's a bunch of names.

634
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,495
But there is only one God.
All praise be to Allah.

635
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,166
Yeah, but would Allah nail Darcy
if he had the chance?

636
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,297
I think he would.

637
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,094
Okay.

638
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,607
- Gave up on you.
- Am I too late?

639
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,819
No. Come in.

640
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,661
I'm glad you came.

641
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,457
I mean, it's kind of weird
to have you in my house, isn't it?

642
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,666
Yeah.

643
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,378
I feel like I'm doing something illegal.

644
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,839
Well, not yet.

645
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:41,139
Look at me. I'm a mess.
No one ever sees me like this.

646
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,684
I think this is the best
I've ever seen you look.

647
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,480
You're sweet, Mox,
but you know you are.

648
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,025
Nice house.

649
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,363
I was about to make
an ice cream sundae.

650
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,658
You want one?

651
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,453
Yeah, have one. I'll make it.

652
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,830
All right.

653
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,460
Do you want whipped cream?

654
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,087
- Sure.
- Okay.

655
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,749
Come here.

656
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:08,226
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait. I can't.

657
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:13,189
We can't. This is not...
I'm really sorry. All right?

658
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,984
What? You're sorry?

659
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,862
There's Lance and then there's Jules,

660
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,740
and I don't know if I love Jules
but I might.

661
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,494
What I do know is I don't love you.
But Lance, he might love you. I can't...

662
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,957
I don't love Lance.
It was never about love.

663
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,671
It's about me getting a better life.

664
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,091
Lance and I were gonna leave.

665
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,219
Now I know he's probably gonna stay
in West Canaan

666
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:47,181
and be the manager at Wal-Mart
and coach JV football.

667
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,474
Darcy.

668
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,812
I just wanted to go with you.

669
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:59,652
Look, you're gonna get out
of West Canaan on your own.

670
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,573
All right? You're smart.

671
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,496
Unbelievable.

672
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,333
What?

673
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,962
I usually fall for
the whipped cream bikini every time.

674
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:26,721
- Wendell?
- Hey, what's up, Mox?

675
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,600
- Meet at the Mini-Mart at 10:00 tonight.
- 10:00? For what, man?

676
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,061
- I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you.
- All right.

677
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,479
Hey, have you seen Billy Bob?
I can't find him.

678
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,272
I'm afraid something's wrong.

679
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,024
- Kilmer.
- Kilmer?

680
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,946
Come on, Mox. He's been riding
the fuck out of Billy Bob, man,

681
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,406
blaming him for Lance's knee and shit.

682
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,451
Look, man, I'm over this shit. I'm over it.

683
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,329
- I hear you, man.
- You don't hear me, man.

684
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,706
Kilmer's a fucking-ass racist redneck.

685
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,209
You know how many yards
I average a game?

686
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,878
- About 100?
- 133.

687
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,922
You know
how many touchdowns I have?

688
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,136
Three. That's only because
I broke for over 20 yards each time.

689
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,807
Every time we get inside the 10,
he gives the ball to Lance on a sweep

690
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,852
or some fucking roll out
to a white receiver. It's bullshit.

691
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:18,189
- I'm just Kilmer's black work horse.
- Kilmer.

692
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:22,068
You think he'd pick up the phone
and call Texas Tech or A&M for me?

693
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,197
Fuck no.
My mom's been doing my recruiting.

694
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,409
She's got Grambling coming to see me.

695
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,870
Damn, Mox, I thought you knew.

696
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,623
Shit is fucked up.

697
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,461
Fuck Kilmer, all right?
I'll get you in the end zone.

698
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,928
We cool, Mox. Hey.

699
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,810
You got shit to tend to.
See you at practice, man.

700
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,770
- What's up, Darcy?
- Hey.

701
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,565
Hey. How are you?

702
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,110
Tell me not to feel weird around you.

703
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,197
Look, Darcy, the last thing I need right
now is for anything to come between us.

704
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:12,869
Okay? Look, we're friends.
We're just a little closer now.

705
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,247
- Okay?
- Yeah, I guess we are.

706
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,002
- Thanks, Mox.
- No problem.

707
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,977
Wait, Jules. Wait a minute. Jules.

708
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,651
Would you listen to me, all right?
Bitches are all just panty droppers.

709
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,071
You understand? That's it.

710
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,239
What?

711
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:56,079
Listen, you give them a Percocet,
two Vicodin and a couple of beers,

712
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,373
and the panties drop. Very nice.

713
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,043
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

714
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,378
Tweeter, do you think
you'll enjoy prison?

715
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,756
I don't know. What?

716
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,346
- Where are we going tonight?
- That's a surprise.

717
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,640
Just make sure everyone's
at the Mini-Mart at 10:00, all right?

718
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,601
- I'm bringing Lance.
- Nice.

719
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:24,440
What the fuck is that?

720
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:46,712
Oh, my God.
It's star quarterback, Jonnie Moxon.

721
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,005
Somebody hold me up.

722
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,717
Look, there's nothing going on
with Darcy Sears. All right?

723
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,178
I've known her since kindergarten.
Nothing's ever happened.

724
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:58,182
You mean you've never seen her
in her whipped-cream bikini?

725
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,273
- No.
- Funny.

726
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,984
That's how she got Lance.

727
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,153
Come on, Jules,
are we together or what?

728
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,280
I don't date football players.

729
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,907
Come on, Jules,
I've always been a football player.

730
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,450
Number 26.

731
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:23,833
No, you were something different.
At least I thought you were.

732
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:33,718
What a Kodak moment.
Star quarterback Jonnie Moxon

733
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,554
having a gut-check minute
about who he really is.

734
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,016
- You don't think all this is hard?
- Hard? On who?

735
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,185
- Jules.
- Mox.

736
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,355
We had a thing and it was great, okay.

737
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,609
Things have changed a little bit,
and that's okay.

738
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:54,280
- Maybe you should go.
- You can't make me leave.

739
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:03,372
Oh, my God.
Everybody come meet Jonnie Moxon.

740
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,375
The Mox,
the star quarterback of the Coyotes.

741
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,294
He's at my window.

742
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,422
Good game. Good game, man.

743
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,667
- Bring it on.
- These are from Brett.

744
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,627
And you boys are on the house all night.

745
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,504
- All right.
- Oh, yeah.

746
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,174
Gentlemen, I'm gonna go nuts.

747
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,678
My gift to you. To Kilmer.

748
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,680
- Fuck Kilmer.
- Fuck Kilmer.

749
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,892
Hey, Tweeter. Take my shot, man.
You know I don't drink.

750
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:08,479
- Come on, you're drinking tonight.
- We got Elwood tomorrow, man.

751
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,649
- We can't be staying up all late.
- Relax.

752
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,485
Just chill, Wendell,
and look over your left shoulder.

753
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,903
What's up?

754
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,076
God damn.

755
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,705
Oh, yeah.

756
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,178
Yeah.

757
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,307
Come on.
Come on, keep your shirt on, Billy Bob.

758
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,393
It's a strip club, man. I'm here to work.

759
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,109
Shit.

760
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,988
Work it, Billy Bob. Let's go, dog.

761
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,287
Oh, no. Oh no, come on.

762
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,415
Here you go, have a beer. Come on.

763
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,084
Come on, man.

764
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,466
Go, Billy Bob.

765
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,013
- What a nut.
- Hey, you know of all these guys,

766
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,016
you're the only one that came
and visited me in the hospital.

767
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,768
You're a good friend.

768
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,688
And also, and I have to say that,

769
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:35,191
thank you very much
for dragging my ass out here.

770
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,277
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

771
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,238
You're not gonna try and hug me now,
are you?

772
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,799
Yeah, baby, take it off!

773
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,281
- Oh, my God. It's Miss Davis.
- Holy shit. It is Miss Davis.

774
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,451
- It's Miss Davis. Miss Davis. Yeah.
- No way.

775
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,895
I just want you to know that I am 18,

776
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,232
and I have had sex
with older women before.

777
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,193
It was topical. It was erotic.

778
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,822
I gave it a 9.5. I still got wood. Still.

779
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,241
I gave it a 10.

780
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,869
- A 10. A fucking 10.
- Gentlemen.

781
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,957
I'd like to propose a toast.
To Miss Davis.

782
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,959
- Miss Davis.
- Ten.

783
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,734
Fuck me. It's 7:00.

784
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,111
What'd you just say?

785
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,989
It's 7:00.

786
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:53,245
- God, what's that smell?
- That's us.

787
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,374
- Who we playing tonight?
- Shit.

788
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:08,928
10. 3-15. 3-15. Go.

789
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:17,353
Well, Jon Moxon finding out
how the other half lives here,

790
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,522
Stubby, as he gets crushed on that play.

791
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,525
I tell you, that was a true slobberknocker
on that. He took a whooping,

792
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,444
and Bud Kilmer can't be happy,
the way his team's playing tonight.

793
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,113
Why don't you let
the pom-pom girls play for you?

794
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,241
Goddamn worst game I ever seen.

795
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,202
I thought you said Elwood
wasn't that good.

796
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,746
They ain't. They're playing like shit.

797
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,332
Anybody wanna stop these guys
from planting my ass?

798
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,378
I got the squirts, Mox.
I think that liquor's still in my system.

799
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,421
And I cannot concentrate
because I keep seeing

800
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,925
Miss Davis' fat ass in my face,
bouncing and...

801
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,386
Look, I'm hung-over, too, all right?

802
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,055
We got to suck it up.
We got to put one in the end zone.

803
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,849
All right, 4-95. Curl, on one.

804
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,395
All right, 4-95. Curl, on one. Eyes up.

805
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,523
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

806
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:25,582
The hard work of so many is sacrificed

807
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,294
by the disrespect of the few.

808
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,801
Moxon,

809
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,888
you sacrificed the honor

810
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:43,642
of this football team
and the town that supports it.

811
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,979
Shit, you poisoned my team, son.

812
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,613
Hope last night was fun.
Hope it was fun.

813
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,492
Was it fun? Was it fun?

814
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,750
You think
you don't have to listen to me?

815
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,545
Your daddy was a no-talent pussy,
but at least he listened.

816
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,601
Little Billy Bob crybaby.

817
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:30,230
You cost me my perfect season.
How does it feel?

818
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:35,319
Cry me a river, you fat fucking baby.
You disgust me.

819
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:40,282
My star quarterback is dragging
his leg around, because of you.

820
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,744
And on top of that,
I got to sit and watch you cry about it.

821
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:47,790
Well, you know what?
Get the fuck out of here.

822
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,710
I don't wanna see your fat face. Get out.
Get the fuck out of here.

823
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,378
Get out of here.

824
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,401
People are saying you organized
an all-night drinking party.

825
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,529
It's why you boys dragged ass out there.

826
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:22,741
- Save it, Dad.
- Save it? Save what?

827
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,536
You got the opportunity of a lifetime,
you're treating it like...

828
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,288
Playing football at West Canaan
is not the opportunity of a lifetime.

829
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,999
Your attitude's wrong.
Your tone of voice is wrong.

830
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,335
- This is your opportunity...
- For you.

831
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,795
Playing football at West Canaan

832
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,673
may have been
the opportunity of your lifetime,

833
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,967
but I don't want your life.

834
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:46,974
What the hell's Bacon doing here?

835
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:51,103
Billy Bob dropped him off. Said
you'd know how to take care of him.

836
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,134
- Mind if I take a seat beside you?
- Don't move.

837
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,974
This is for most-improved player
at lineman camp.

838
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,144
I was 11.

839
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:42,988
- How'd you find me?
- What the hell are you doing?

840
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,369
Championship trophy. Steelers.

841
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,165
We were nine. Remember this shit?

842
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,795
- Playing Pee-Wee?
- Yeah. It was fun.

843
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,549
No, it wasn't.
I remember getting yelled at.

844
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:09,973
"You're too fat, Billy Bob!
Too slow and dumb!"

845
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:17,522
We were just little kids, Mox.
Just little kids.

846
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:21,151
It's like nothing was never good enough.

847
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,196
- It's almost over.
- No.

848
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:30,202
- It's over, man. This is so over.
- Come on.

849
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,913
- What?
- This is bullshit.

850
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,122
What?

851
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,708
You're gonna let fucking
football bullshit get you?

852
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,753
Fucking Kilmer?
You're gonna let Kilmer win?

853
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,130
What else am I supposed to do?

854
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,969
- Why don't you fucking tell me?
- Quit! Fuck it!

855
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,178
Who gives a flying fuck

856
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,847
about Bud Kilmer's
23rd district championship?

857
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,557
- I don't.
- I do!

858
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,353
I do.

859
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:01,817
Man, Coach loved me like a son.
Treated me like one, too.

860
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:07,489
He told me to protect Lance and I didn't.
I fucked everything up, man.

861
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:12,327
Kilmer fucked up and every single player
on that team knows it.

862
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:15,956
That's where you're wrong, Mox.
You're wrong.

863
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:23,338
Look. We got one more game left,
and we need you.

864
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,429
I need you.

865
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,434
Who the fuck's gonna protect my ass?

866
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,106
Come on.

867
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,237
Your bony ass?

868
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,119
I don't think I have a bony ass.

869
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,040
I think I have a very nice ass.

870
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,002
It is kind of nice.

871
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,267
Yeah! Yeah!

872
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,646
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on,
you son of a bitch!

873
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,945
Sam, we're a little worried
about the Gilroy game.

874
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,032
Yup. You know, this is their first year
to play in our district.

875
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,284
And they were Four-A all last year.

876
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:37,412
Since they dropped down to Three-A,
they've been killing people.

877
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:39,081
Hell, they've been hurting people.

878
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,751
Believe me when I tell you,
Mox will stick to the game plan.

879
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,754
- That's what we came to hear.
- Thank you, Sam.

880
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,967
Hey, hey.
What's the deal with these kids?

881
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,261
- These are my people.
- Your people?

882
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:56,431
- My people.
- Kyle, did you start a cult?

883
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,017
- Yup.
- That's so sweet.

884
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:02,979
Out! Out! Out!
Come on freakos, get lost! Come on!

885
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,650
Now that's it! No more religions!

886
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,568
You're healthy,
you're gonna play football.

887
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,861
You understand?

888
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,782
Hey, Jonnie,
this here letter came for you yesterday.

889
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,077
Brown.

890
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,340
"Dear Jon, I hope you're as pleased
to receive this letter"

891
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,217
"as I am to send it to you."

892
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,261
"You have been admitted
to the 235th class"

893
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:37,139
"to enter
the college of Brown University."

894
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,683
Jon. Great, Jon...

895
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:43,478
"Enclosed in this packet are details
about your university grant package"

896
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,272
"which covers your full financial needs."

897
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,399
Jon, Jonnie. I'm real proud about Brown,

898
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,193
but I need to talk to you about Gilroy.

899
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,698
- Gilroy?
- Yeah.

900
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,286
Tell me who wins.

901
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,337
- What are you so damn happy about?
- My cat's okay. I can play.

902
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,674
I took your advice, they scanned my cat.
I can play!

903
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,676
Scanned your cat?

904
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,511
- You got a CAT scan?
- Yeah!

905
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,513
The doctor said you have
a human brain and that it works?

906
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:22,058
- Yeah. Can you believe it?
- That's great!

907
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,105
Man.

908
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,734
Good news.
Damn, it's good to hear that.

909
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:35,280
Gentlemen. Now that none of us
are inebriated,

910
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:39,451
I just wanted to remind you
of our little conversation.

911
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,078
I really appreciate
y'all not saying anything.

912
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,206
We already made a pact
not to say a word.

913
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,958
- Really?
- Miss Davis?

914
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,504
Would you go to prom with me?

915
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,256
- One, two, three.
- Coyotes!

916
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:56,301
Jog it in! Let's go. Jog it in.

917
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,933
How you feeling, Jonnie?

918
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,518
All right, I guess.

919
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:11,942
You understand that by running the ball,
we control the clock.

920
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:16,029
And we can grind them
and the tempo of the game way down.

921
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,992
Are you hearing me?

922
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:28,875
You disobey me, and I will bury you.
I know about your scholarship to Brown.

923
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,712
I got your grades under review,
and don't you think for a minute

924
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,925
that I can't fuck with your transcripts
and get this whole deal blown for you.

925
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:48,520
I get what I want,
and you get what you want.

926
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:55,860
That's it.

927
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,876
- Hi.
- What do you want?

928
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,171
I'm really sorry.

929
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,049
I really need to talk to you.

930
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,219
- It's late.
- I got into Brown today.

931
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,556
Full academic scholarship.

932
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:28,852
Jonnie, that's great! I'm so proud of you.

933
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,064
What? What's wrong?

934
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,192
Kilmer's threatening
to fuck up my scholarship

935
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,862
if I don't play by his rules tomorrow.

936
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,197
- Then quit.
- Can't.

937
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,575
- Then play.
- You don't understand.

938
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,411
- It's just a football game.
- No, it's not.

939
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,914
If it was just football I'd play.

940
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:54,544
I love football when it's pure, but this...

941
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,007
This isn't pure.

942
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,093
You're right. I don't understand.

943
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,098
If I play for Kilmer tomorrow and we win,
he wins.

944
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:09,976
Everyone in West Canaan
will go on believing

945
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,063
- he's the best coach that ever lived.
- Yeah.

946
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,482
What about the next team he coaches?

947
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,443
And the one after that?

948
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,155
What if my little brother ends up
playing for him?

949
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,493
I would be buying into
everything that's wrong with this town.

950
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,622
You want some cheese with that whine?

951
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:34,000
- What?
- You're a whiner.

952
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,587
Why don't you just step up
and play the hero?

953
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,133
- A hero?
- Come on, Mox.

954
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,343
You're a football guy.

955
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,929
You're gonna tell me
you don't know about heroes?

956
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,598
Yeah, but heroes win.

957
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,062
What if I lose?

958
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,740
Our Father, who art in heaven,

959
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:09,494
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

960
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,498
thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

961
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:19,504
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

962
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,632
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

963
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:27,137
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

964
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:32,100
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

965
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:36,604
for ever and ever. Amen.

966
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:47,949
Listen up, people.

967
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,622
Everything you've all done to this point
means nothing.

968
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,625
All of them two a days in the heat
mean nothing,

969
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:01,838
all them games we won mean nothing
if you don't win tonight.

970
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:06,217
No district title, no shot at state.

971
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:13,349
This game is 48 minutes,
for the next 48 years of your life!

972
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,563
Okay, break it down!

973
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,357
Let's go. Coyotes, on three!

974
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,525
- One, two, three.
- Coyotes!

975
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,704
West Canaan versus Gilroy
for the whole megillah.

976
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,624
This is the game.
This is what it's all about.

977
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:47,675
Coyotes will receive the ball.
You gentlemen shake hands.

978
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,512
Let's have a good,
hard-hitting, clean football game.

979
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,681
Coyotes have won the toss.
Pass out the ammunition,

980
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,433
let's go to war!

981
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:14,410
I right, shift 52. We are a running team.

982
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:19,332
Remember what I said.
Now, go fetch me a championship!

983
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,209
- Go on!
- Let's go, Moxon!

984
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,627
Get down their throats now!

985
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,339
Blue 19! Blue 19! Go!

986
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,667
What a great drive.
Basically going to Brown the whole way.

987
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,169
You can stamp "U.S. mail" on his butt.

988
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,963
First and go from the eight.

989
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,173
You got to give it to Brown
and let him take it in.

990
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,134
Slot left, 35 dive.

991
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,137
Move your ass in, let's go!

992
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,764
Here we go. Slot left, 35 dive.

993
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,518
Fucking Kilmer! Shit's fucked up.

994
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,186
We'll change that to 25 dot.

995
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,105
- Don't be stupid.
- What? No way, man.

996
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,691
Does somebody have a problem with
Wendell putting one in the end zone?

997
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,901
- No, sir.
- I didn't think so.

998
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:34,032
Slot left, 25 dive, on one.
Slot left, 25 dive, on one. Ready?

999
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,366
- Break!
- Break!

1000
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,368
- Let's take it in.
- Go!

1001
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:50,965
Yeah!

1002
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:56,929
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1003
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,892
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

1004
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,983
Yeah! Yeah!

1005
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,196
- Thanks, Mox. Thanks, baby.
- Yeah! Let's go.

1006
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,990
Yeah, keep it up, asshole.

1007
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:20,495
Coyotes leading 7 to 0.
Gilroy with the football just at mid-field.

1008
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:24,165
Byron "Booger" Bosell gets the pitch.
He's at mid-field.

1009
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:29,128
- He's gonna go.
- 40, 35, he's at the 30, 20,15,10.

1010
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,714
Touchdown! Good grief!

1011
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,807
Ten!

1012
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:49,107
Green 15! Green 15! Go!

1013
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,993
What a hit on Brown.

1014
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:04,997
I tell you, that was about as ferocious
a hit as I've seen all year.

1015
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,375
He's in pain. And the bad thing about it,

1016
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:10,670
- if he can't come back in and play...
- What about the Coyotes?

1017
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:13,965
Get me off the field! Get me off the field!

1018
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,136
Lean on him. Lean on him.

1019
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,225
He tore something.

1020
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:29,021
- Can you fix him?
- If he'll let us.

1021
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:33,151
- Make him understand.
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,070
- How you feeling, boy?
- Feeling all right, Coach.

1023
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,573
Took a pretty good shot there.

1024
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:41,242
- Let the old trainer take a look at it.
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:44,746
Gilroy with the football,
Punkie Tyler, quarterback,

1026
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:49,459
he wants to throw.
Throws long, and it is caught!

1027
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,337
Touchdown! Gilroy!

1028
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,258
Hoofed down there by Mad Dog

1029
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,927
in the end zone,
and look at him dance with the football.

1030
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,387
Get some mustard.

1031
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:05,683
There ain't no room for that hully-gully
stuff down there like that.

1032
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:15,193
Kneel on it.

1033
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,320
Coach, there's a minute and a half left!
Let me throw something.

1034
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,948
I ain't interested in another turnover.
Get out there!

1035
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:30,416
Move it!
Thinks I'm here for his entertainment.

1036
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,588
Set. Go!

1037
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,763
Well, the clock winding down,
and I can't say that I understand this.

1038
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:47,642
- Moxon, kneeling on the football.
- That's gutless football.

1039
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,727
And listen to this crowd.

1040
01:25:56,527 --> 01:26:00,863
Well, at the end of the first half,
Coyotes trailing 14 to 7.

1041
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:07,662
You're a gamer, Wendell. Let's do this.
You'll be good to go.

1042
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,419
- What are you doing?
- He's getting back in the game!

1043
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,921
Close the door.

1044
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,258
- Wendell, don't do this.
- Hey, Coach, I heard a pop.

1045
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,802
- You know, I think he's hurt pretty bad.
- You get out of here!

1046
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:26,264
You all wouldn't know anything
about dedication, team play.

1047
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:27,807
But I would.

1048
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,228
Don't do it, Wendell.
It's not worth it, man.

1049
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,021
You gonna listen to that from a gimp

1050
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,691
who's praying that we'll lose,
so he can be the missing link?

1051
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,025
Maybe I shouldn't do it.

1052
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,986
- Get the hell out of here!
- Don't do it.

1053
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,320
Before I lose my temper! Get out!

1054
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:42,613
- Don't do it, Wendell.
- Get out of here.

1055
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,116
If that needle goes
anywhere near Wendell's leg,

1056
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,701
I swear to God on my mother's grave

1057
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:50,204
I will rip your arms off
and beat you to death with them!

1058
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:53,040
You stay the hell out of this, Billy Bob.
This has nothing to do with you.

1059
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:57,628
This has to do with all of us.
We kill ourselves for you.

1060
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,298
Year round, we play hurt, we play sick,

1061
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,550
and we spend most of that time
scared that we're gonna screw up

1062
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:06,429
and you're gonna kick our ass, because
you don't really give a fuck about us!

1063
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,141
All you care about
is your next district title.

1064
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,727
- Give him the shot.
- You give him that shot,

1065
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,354
you find yourself
another fucking quarterback.

1066
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,607
You about ready
to lose that scholarship, boy?

1067
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,525
If it keeps that needle out of his leg,
absolutely.

1068
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,860
Good.

1069
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,237
Fuck it, I'm out.

1070
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:26,657
That's good! That's good! Finally!

1071
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,661
- Tweeter, you take the snaps.
- No, I won't.

1072
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:33,372
No, I'm out, Coach.

1073
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,752
- What'd you say?
- I said, I'm out.

1074
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,754
I'm with them.

1075
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:43,716
The only way we're going back out
on that field is without you.

1076
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:50,556
- I'm gonna pull the shit out of you!
- Get him off! Get him off!

1077
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:04,737
All right, get your helmets on,
and take the field. Let's go, let's go!

1078
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,240
Let's go now! Let's go, God damn it!

1079
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:21,921
I'm walking out that door.
I want you all to trust me

1080
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,716
and follow me out there.

1081
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,388
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1082
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,934
Let's go after that time now.

1083
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,187
Let's go! Let's go. Let's go.

1084
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,034
Before this game started, Kilmer said,

1085
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,620
"48 minutes
for the next 48 years of our lives."

1086
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:40,624
I say, fuck that. All right?

1087
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:46,047
I say, fuck that. Let's go out there,

1088
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:50,134
and we'll play the next 24 minutes
for the next 24 minutes,

1089
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:53,054
and we'll leave it all out on the field.

1090
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,638
We've got the rest of our lives
to be mediocre,

1091
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:59,018
but we have the opportunity to play
like gods for the next half of football.

1092
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:05,149
But we can't be afraid to lose.
There's no room for fear in this game.

1093
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:10,488
Now, we go out there and we half-ass it
because we're scared,

1094
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:14,784
all we're left with is an excuse.
We're always gonna wonder.

1095
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:20,498
But if we go out there
and we give it absolutely everything,

1096
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,919
that's heroic.

1097
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:32,718
Let's be heroes. Come on.

1098
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:34,970
Who's ready? Give it up!

1099
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:37,848
Come on.

1100
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,687
What do you say, boys?
What do you say, boys?

1101
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,028
All right! All right! Go!

1102
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:35,823
Field goal for Gilroy. It is good.
Gilroy leads 17 to 7

1103
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:40,327
with 8:10 left in the ball game,
and still no Bud Kilmer.

1104
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:43,873
All right! Listen up! Listen up!
I need five wide receivers.

1105
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:47,710
We're running an oop-dee-oop.
No tight ends, no running backs.

1106
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,921
I want four receivers stacked left.
Tweeter, you on the right.

1107
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,214
We're gonna overload their left side.

1108
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:54,091
Force them to cover Tweeter
one on one!

1109
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:55,593
- And no huddles.
- What?

1110
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,220
I'll call the plays from the line.
Defense'll never know what hit them!

1111
01:31:58,305 --> 01:31:59,972
All right, let's go! Come on.
Break it down!

1112
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:01,807
Let's go! Let's go!

1113
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:04,518
- On three. One, two, three, Coyotes!
- Coyotes!

1114
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:12,902
- Let's go!
- Go!

1115
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:18,282
All right!

1116
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,952
Pass completed that time to Tweeter
for 16, and they're going again.

1117
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,537
Tweeter on the left!
Gonzales on the right!

1118
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:26,832
I don't know what you call this offense,
but look at all those receivers.

1119
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:28,375
Three, four, five?

1120
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,585
Go!

1121
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,548
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1122
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,885
Gonzales, complete! One more time

1123
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,472
and they hurry up for the line of
scrimmage. Look at all the receivers!

1124
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:55,736
Long pass this time, Moxon.
Touchdown!

1125
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,294
While the Coyotes celebrate,
the question I've got to you,

1126
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:15,089
where in the world is Bud Kilmer?
Did you hurt his feelings?

1127
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,258
Well, after the touchdown,
I was looking down on the sidelines,

1128
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:18,592
and he's nowhere to be found.

1129
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:23,180
- Come on! Let's go!
- Defense! Defense!

1130
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:58,215
- Defense, defense, defense!
- Defense, defense, defense!

1131
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,301
Let's go, defense!

1132
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,552
Go!

1133
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,233
All right, now, let's go!

1134
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,867
- They're punting it.
- Yup. And we're out of time-outs, too.

1135
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:28,912
- If we don't block this, it's over.
- Coach Lance, put me in there.

1136
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:32,833
- We'll block it.
- What, you wanna play defense?

1137
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,586
Put me in there! We'll block it!

1138
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,173
All right, get out there.

1139
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:43,344
Thirty-eight seconds left to go in the
ball game. Gilroy with the lead 17 to 14.

1140
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,764
Billy Bob has come into the ball game
for the Coyotes.

1141
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,134
Oh, yeah!

1142
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:28,806
Charlie Tweeter blocks the punt!
He blocks the punt! Charlie Tweeter!

1143
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:33,435
I tell you what, Billy Bob, man child,
got his own zip code, opens a hole up,

1144
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,397
Tweeter comes in, throws his hand up.
What a great job, big boy!

1145
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,732
Coyotes still have a chance.

1146
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,567
Twins right, Z out, on one.

1147
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,736
Tweeter, make sure
you get the hell out of bounds.

1148
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:44,905
Twins right, Z out, on one. Ready?

1149
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:45,989
- Break!
- Break!

1150
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,590
Get out! Get out! Damn it! Damn it!

1151
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:05,509
Oh, jeez! Come on!

1152
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,095
Pass was good to Tweeter
but he didn't get out of bounds!

1153
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,805
- He didn't get out.
- The clock is still running!

1154
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:11,473
The clock's still running!

1155
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,935
Come on, let's go quick! On the ball!

1156
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,563
Clock's on, get down!
Clock's on, get down!

1157
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,525
Safe! Go!

1158
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,381
Billy Bob? This is it!
The man who got us here.

1159
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:46,300
- You ready?
- You don't think that lame-ass play

1160
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,803
where I run downfield and act like
I'm lost is gonna work, do you?

1161
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:54,558
Split left 90. Hook and ladder, on one.

1162
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,518
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

1163
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:59,521
- Touchdown! Touchdown!
- Touchdown! Touchdown!

1164
01:36:59,898 --> 01:37:05,903
Touchdown! Touchdown!
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1165
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:42,708
Oh, my God! Billy Bob!

1166
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,600
Good gosh all mighty Joe Friday!
Billy Bob!

1167
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:04,396
Billy Bob! Billy Bob! Coyotes win!
Coyotes win! Coyotes win!

1168
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,441
Twenty-three district championships!

1169
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:13,530
Mox! Excuse me. Mox!

1170
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:20,120
- Mox.
- Hey! Down! Down! Down!

1171
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:27,336
Now wait a minute, wait a minute.
I thought you only kissed heroes.

1172
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,554
And for some of us,
it ended without us knowing.

1173
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:43,644
Maybe these were the last days.
I never played football again,

1174
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,814
but I will never forget that day.

1175
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,701
Billy Bob cried,
'cause he's a bit of a crier.

1176
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:06,792
And Tweeter drank beers,
because, well, Tweeter drinks beer.

1177
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,755
Lance is happy.

1178
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,342
He found his calling as a football coach.

1179
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:21,014
Wendell got his ride to Grambling.

1180
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:27,020
That statue still stands, but only
because it was too heavy to move.

1181
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:30,399
Kilmer never coached again.

1182
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:35,946
I took my scholarship, and I will
graduate from Brown University.

1183
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:47,207
The day was ours,
and no one could ever take it away.
