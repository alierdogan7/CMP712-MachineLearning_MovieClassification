1
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,046
The muggings were
confined to Cabot Street.

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,281
They began over
two months ago...

3
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:06,582
Just like this briefing did.

4
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,284
Please go to charisma class.

5
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:09,852
I'm here. I'm here.
Sorry, Charles.

6
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:11,120
No, Jake.

7
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:13,255
Never apologize for
making an amazing entrance.

8
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:14,390
My power went out last night,

9
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,524
and my alarm didn't go off.

10
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:17,626
Your alarm is power-dependent?

11
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,161
You brought this
on yourself, son.

12
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:21,030
The point is,
it will not happen again.

13
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,798
Carry on.

14
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:23,799
Sorry I'm late, Sarge.

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,833
No hot water this morning.

16
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,570
But I'm here, ready to go.

17
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,270
Will cause no
further distractions.

18
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,941
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Seriously?

19
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:33,376
What is your excuse today?

20
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:34,377
More bad luck.

21
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,578
My car ran out of gas,

22
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,713
and then my clothes
disappeared from the Laundromat.

23
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:39,749
I had to beg one of my neighbors
to loan me some of his.

24
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,650
You never told us Sinbad
lives in your building.

25
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:42,852
If Sinbad lived in my building,

26
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:44,019
I would have a tattoo
on my forehead

27
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,620
that said "Sinbad
lives in my building."

28
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:48,557
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,

29
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,359
and I'm a half an hour early.

30
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,496
That's right, my string of bad
luck has finally come to an end.

31
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,197
Peralta, you failed
your drug test.

32
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,366
There were traces
of cocaine and methamphetamines

33
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,177
- found in your urine.
- What?

34
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:21,357
Captain, this is insane.

35
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:22,558
I don't do drugs.

36
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,260
I mean, sure, a couple
of my teeth are loose,

37
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,362
but that's from dental neglect,
not meth.

38
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:27,763
Yeah, those tests
are unreliable.

39
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,565
Okay, let's not blame "tests."

40
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:30,633
I believe in you, Jake,

41
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,435
but come on,
he's going after tests.

42
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:33,436
Sir, listen:

43
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,204
the missing laundry,
the hot water,

44
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,204
the power, the gas,

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,273
now this?

46
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:38,941
This is not bad luck,
it's a pattern.

47
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,543
Someone's trying to sabotage me.

48
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,676
And who would want to do that?

49
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:42,812
Probably someone I put away.

50
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:43,879
It's the only explanation.

51
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,214
Or you didn't pay your bills

52
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,782
and you only put a quarter
gallon of gas in your tank

53
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:48,617
'cause you wanted to spend the
rest on mini-mart beef jerky.

54
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,119
Wrong, I buy my jerky online

55
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,654
from the world's
top jerkmasters,

56
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,789
so it looks like you need
to update your jerk Rolodex,

57
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,458
which is not as dirty
as it sounds.

58
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,060
Anyway, I can prove that I
filled up my tank, all right?

59
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,228
I even have a receipt,

60
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,164
because I keep all my receipts

61
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,899
like a mature adult person.

62
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,301
Laser tag,

63
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:06,802
wheelie shoes,

64
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,004
remote control monster truck,

65
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,005
aha!

66
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,006
Gas station.

67
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,006
Someone drained my tank.

68
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,409
Okay, I know you don't do drugs,

69
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,411
so maybe there is something
to what you're saying.

70
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,613
I'll talk to One Police Plaza
and arrange an appeal.

71
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:20,381
I'll also put someone
on this sabotage theory.

72
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,517
I got it.

73
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,918
Jake, when I find
whoever did this to you,

74
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,987
I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs
and fill their sockets...

75
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:26,455
I think you might be
too close to this.

76
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,456
Copy that.

77
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:29,157
Santiago, Diaz: look into it.

78
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,459
Noice.

79
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,927
In the meantime, Peralta,
you're suspended.

80
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,361
I'm gonna need you to hand in
your badge and gun.

81
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:34,864
All right, fine,
you can have my badge and gun,

82
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:36,098
but we're doing it
in your office

83
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,433
so I can slam them
down on your desk

84
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:38,801
and yell out,
"The system stinks!"

85
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,669
Actually, the procedure is
to bring your gun and badge

86
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,271
down to the equipment room
on the second floor,

87
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:44,640
fill out form 452-underscore-J,

88
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,675
hand said form in
to the inventory clerk,

89
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:49,278
and then receive a claim check
through interoffice mail.

90
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,046
The system stinks!

91
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,348
Hey, Boyle,

92
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,983
any progress with
that extortion case

93
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,351
you and Jake
have been working on?

94
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,786
No, I've just been
going over his notes.

95
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:00,456
Look how cool and illegible
his handwriting is.

96
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,258
Oh, I wish I could be that free.

97
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,059
But you know me,
ever the calligrapher.

98
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,696
Yeah, well, I thought you might
need a little more manpower.

99
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,697
Okay.

100
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,399
So I'm assigning you
a new partner.

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,935
Actually, partners.

102
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,170
Yep, there's definitely
something in there.

103
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,204
Looks like a peanut.

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,940
Bet it's a cashew.

105
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:18,941
You're on.

106
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,776
No, Sarge, come on!

107
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:21,911
They're terrible.

108
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,512
Stop exaggerating, Boyle.

109
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:25,447
They're good detectives.

110
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:26,448
They're fine.

111
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,449
Oh, no.

112
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,516
I pushed it in deeper.

113
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,287
They're all we got.

114
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,055
Sir,

115
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,591
Gina's dance concert
was last night.

116
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,293
Right.

117
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:39,361
The Dancy Reagan performance.

118
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:41,397
I've been so preoccupied
with Peralta's drug test,

119
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:42,531
it totally slipped my mind.

120
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:43,732
Me too.

121
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,234
But don't worry.

122
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:46,368
I told her we were there.

123
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,771
Was your favorite move
"The Gull"?

124
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,506
Or was it "Space Bubbles"?

125
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:52,308
Oh, I loved them both!

126
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,443
I'm a bubble man

127
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:55,677
and a gull man!

128
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:58,247
You lied to her?

129
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:59,248
Like a pro.

130
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,549
I couldn't hurt her feelings.

131
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,217
She really wanted
us to be there.

132
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:05,087
Well, I wish you hadn't
involved me in your deception.

133
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,357
I maintain a strict
code of integrity.

134
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,725
Come on, Captain.

135
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:12,093
You never told a white lie
to make a person feel better?

136
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,564
I only lie when someone's
safety is at risk.

137
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,533
Or if a juvenile aged
eight years or younger

138
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,034
asks about Santa Claus.

139
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:20,034
In which case...

140
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,904
I feed them some reassuring pap

141
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,673
about the logical impossibility
of proving a negative.

142
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,508
It's sentimental drivel,

143
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,143
but they eat it up.

144
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,346
So...

145
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:33,449
does this mean you're
gonna blow up my spot

146
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,817
and tell Gina the truth?

147
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,752
If she asks me, then yes,

148
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:40,755
I suppose I will have to
blow your spot right up.

149
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,959
Okay, this is
everyone I could think of

150
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,227
who would want to
mess with my life.

151
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,629
Perps,
people I've testified against,

152
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,830
the old guy
who lived underneath me

153
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,398
when I was learning
the Gangnam Style dance.

154
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,933
Wow, you've pissed off
a lot of people.

155
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:53,368
Well, that's what happens
when you live out loud, Rosa.

156
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,771
We need to look into
the power outage and hot water.

157
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:57,206
Do you have proof
you pay your bills?

158
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:58,307
Are you serious?

159
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:00,209
Guys, this is not my fault.

160
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,977
My reputation is being sabotaged

161
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,245
by some guy.

162
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,246
Or girl, you know.

163
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,648
Monsters can be women too.

164
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,149
Super progressive
attitude, Jake.

165
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,517
Look, we are on your side.

166
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,219
It's just, you're not
the most responsible person.

167
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,286
We have to do our job.

168
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,055
All right, fine.
You can see my bank records.

169
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,757
But I always pay my power bill.

170
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,058
Often late.

171
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,360
One time in person
with Canadian pennies.

172
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,995
Oh, my God, talking
about your finances

173
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:21,329
makes me sweat behind the knees.

174
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,364
Nice.

175
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,364
Hey, speaking of funky smells,

176
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,667
should we start this
investigation

177
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:25,934
at the urinalysis lab?

178
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,270
Hmm? Take a trip
to the old pee factory?

179
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,471
Jake, you're suspended.

180
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,306
Just go home, have a beer,
and smash something.

181
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,441
That's what I'd do.

182
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,909
Or take advantage
of this amazing city.

183
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,077
Go sightseeing.

184
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,512
MoMA has an exhibit
I'm dying to see.

185
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:38,013
It's all about
office chair design.

186
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,515
Oh!

187
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,684
Look, I know technically
I'm not supposed to help out,

188
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,384
but rules are made to be broken.

189
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,586
They were made to be followed.

190
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,688
Nothing is made to be broken.

191
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:46,689
Uh, piñatas.

192
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,089
- Glow sticks.
- Karate boards.

193
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,558
Spaghetti when you
have a small pot.

194
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,659
Rules.

195
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,094
Look, someone's messing
with my life here.

196
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:53,128
I thought you guys had my back.

197
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,396
We do.

198
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,031
But seriously,
you can't come with us.

199
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,366
Okay.

200
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,134
Fine.
I get it.

201
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,003
Protocol's protocol.

202
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,172
I'm gonna go check out
that office chair design exhibit

203
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,172
at the MoMA.

204
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,405
Rosa? Amy?

205
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:09,857
What are you guys doing here?

206
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,325
Our non-suspended jobs.

207
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:12,994
You're not supposed
to be investigating.

208
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,328
I'm not, I'm sightseeing,

209
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,763
just as Amy suggested.

210
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:17,163
At Brooklyn Urine and Blood?

211
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,566
Oh, yeah, the internet says

212
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,101
this is the number-one
urinalysis lab

213
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,202
in all of New York.

214
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,570
Fun tourist selfie!

215
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:24,405
Boink!
Not your best.

216
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:26,741
Anyways, I'm gonna take
a "walking tour" in here

217
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,409
while you guys ask
a couple of questions,

218
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,111
and also, I've been
waiting for 20 minutes.

219
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,312
Where have you been?

220
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,680
We had to find the addresses
of all 78 people

221
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:33,680
you said might want to hurt you.

222
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,882
Uh-huh.

223
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,725
And was there another
stop along the way?

224
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:37,752
We got coffee.

225
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:39,053
Those are cappuccinos.

226
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,755
You know how long it takes
to foam that milk?

227
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:42,256
Time you could have
spent on my case,

228
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,566
but I guess it's just froth
over friends with you two.

229
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:46,193
Anyways, let's do this.

230
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:47,295
Jake...

231
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,796
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

232
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,465
I really wish you could come
look at urine with us,

233
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,633
but you can't.

234
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,201
You're suspended.
Go home.

235
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,202
All right, fine.

236
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,304
If you guys won't help me,

237
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,806
I guess I'll just
get myself off.

238
00:06:58,807 --> 00:06:59,840
Context.

239
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,207
Context was
important on that one.

240
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,243
I get Greek yogurt,

241
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,477
'cause there's heritage there,

242
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,879
but Iceland?

243
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,715
No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,350
Hey, Gina!

245
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,519
What are you guys talking about?
Yogurt? Me too.

246
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,753
Let's keep talking about that.

247
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:13,854
Whoo!

248
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:14,956
Terry's out of breath.

249
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:17,307
Cool. I was just
dropping off some files.

250
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,893
Great, let's just
go out to your desk

251
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:20,694
and let's talk
about how that went.

252
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:22,096
Okay, Terry.

253
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,731
But first, I want
to ask the captain

254
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,933
for his impresh of my show.

255
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:28,985
Got any feed-b, or was it just
love, love, love?

256
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,638
Well, actually...

257
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,506
I thought it was amazing!

258
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:35,142
You were like a swan
who went to Juilliard.

259
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:37,345
It was so good.

260
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,914
Terry, I have already
received your praise.

261
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:42,290
I'm clearly fishing
in another pond right now.

262
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,667
I'm putting an end to this.

263
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:44,819
Sergeant Jeffords and I

264
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,089
were unable to attend
your performance.

265
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,790
Oh.

266
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,891
But you were so spot on
with your compliments.

267
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,760
Terry is a practiced liar.

268
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:55,637
I'm sorry we missed the show.

269
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,399
I know that dancing is
an important hobby to you.

270
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
Hobby?

271
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,142
You think my dancing is a hobby?

272
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,269
Oh, yes.

273
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,338
Like me and antique
globe collecting.

274
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,408
It's thrilling, but nobody is
ever going to pay me for it.

275
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,441
Ergo, a hobby.

276
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:09,777
I get paid...

277
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:11,479
in applause.

278
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,238
But apparently not yours.

279
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,702
I know that maintaining
integrity can be difficult,

280
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,154
but in the long run,

281
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:22,023
everyone is better for it.

282
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,661
Attention everyone.

283
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:30,297
The tragic sound you hear
is the shredding of my spandie.

284
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,866
Gina Linetti
will never dance again.

285
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,370
So those threatening phone calls

286
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,240
were being made to Tim Orsk

287
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,640
of Tim O's Limos.

288
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:41,942
That's interesting.

289
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,444
This Orsk guy's name keeps
cropping up in this case.

290
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,047
'Cause he's the victim.

291
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:47,682
You know, he's
the guy whose window

292
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:50,051
was smashed with this rock.

293
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,052
Okay?

294
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,736
He's being extorted for $10,000.

295
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,030
Sure, but what do
they want from him?

296
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,490
$10,000.

297
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,025
I just said that.

298
00:08:58,026 --> 00:09:00,827
We're trying to figure out
who's doing the threatening.

299
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:03,130
Wait.
I have a theory.

300
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,633
I think "limousine"
and "magazine"

301
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:06,966
come from the same word.

302
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:08,369
Just focus!

303
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,804
I'm sorry for snapping.

304
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:10,804
I interviewed Orsk...

305
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,206
Orsk!
There it is again.

306
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,607
Oh, you're useless!

307
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,009
You're completely useless!

308
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,244
You are without a doubt
the most incompetent detectives

309
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,646
I've ever seen.

310
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,514
And I'm including
that bomb-sniffing dog

311
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:21,806
who humps all the bombs!

312
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:26,420
You know your turning
signal's been on for 30 seconds.

313
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,354
I like to announce
my turning intention.

314
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,898
This isn't the Indy 500.

315
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:32,359
Well, when you finally change
lanes an hour from now,

316
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,761
we should go talk
to Jake's super...

317
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:34,961
see if there was a power outage.

318
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:36,330
What?

319
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,465
Oh!

320
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,782
Why would you do that?

321
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,834
I just broke into your car

322
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,368
and then
popped up without warning.

323
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,452
Not cool.

324
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:43,670
What the hell are you doing?

325
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,606
I thought I was hitching
a ride to Rikers

326
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,441
so we could interview
some convicts I put away,

327
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,843
but apparently you're still
wasting time investigating me.

328
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,713
Hey, it's your fault we have to
check up on your power outages.

329
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,048
You have three mini-fridges
plugged in to the same outlet.

330
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,300
Three mini-fridges are cheaper
than one regular one.

331
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,652
We're just doing our jobs.

332
00:09:58,653 --> 00:09:59,653
Why don't you trust us?

333
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:00,654
How can I?

334
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:01,756
You didn't even know a man

335
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,457
was lying
in the backseat of your car.

336
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,259
And while you two
were busy lolly-gargling...

337
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,827
I'm not familiar
with the expression...

338
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,196
I was investigating.
I'll send you some selfies.

339
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:10,598
Look, we're gonna
get to your list.

340
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,366
We just have to rule out
other possibilities first.

341
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,734
You know, there is a real chance

342
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,235
that no one is after you.

343
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,771
Yeah, but I'm telling you
that someone is.

344
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:17,737
That should be enough.

345
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,373
And we told you to trust us.

346
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,406
That should be enough.

347
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:21,709
All right, fine.
You don't want my help?

348
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,675
You're not gonna get it.

349
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,845
Dude...

350
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,455
In fact, I'm deleting
your numbers from my phone.

351
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:28,623
Just let us take you home.

352
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,117
See you never.

353
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:31,251
Fine.

354
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:36,524
Where am I?

355
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,333
Hello, Peralta.

356
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,627
Geoffrey Hoytsman?

357
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,228
You're the one
who's been sabotaging me?

358
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:56,298
I'm just ruining your life
like you ruined mine.

359
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,799
You never should
have arrested me.

360
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,835
But I basically got
your cocaine charges dropped.

361
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:02,003
You only had to do 40 hours
of community service.

362
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,640
Right, but I wanted to
get them all done at once,

363
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:07,676
so for energy, I did way too
much cocaine and meth.

364
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,877
Went on a prolonged
psychotic episode

365
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,947
involving assault,
public fornication,

366
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:13,882
and, apparently,
the touching of my scrotum

367
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,818
to every doorknob
in a synagogue.

368
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,018
And you know what happened then?

369
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,320
They thoroughly cleaned
the synagogue,

370
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,521
you landed on your feet

371
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,256
and pursued your true passion
of selling ice cream?

372
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,458
None of that.

373
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,227
I lost my job
and my wife and my home.

374
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,729
An ex-client lent me this truck.

375
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,963
He likes me
because I got him off

376
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:29,163
on a strangle-and-mangle.

377
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,732
You have a phrase for that?

378
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,135
I used to, when I was
an awesome lawyer.

379
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,436
Now I'm just another idiot
living in an ice cream truck.

380
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:37,438
So that's why you put
drugs in my urine.

381
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,408
Hey, that was <i>my</i> urine.

382
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,042
Your urine is in there.

383
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,510
Why would you keep my pee?

384
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,213
I need belongings, Jake,

385
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,314
to feel like a man.

386
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,215
Look, this is a bad idea,
Hoytsman.

387
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,417
People are gonna notice
if I disappear.

388
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,420
See? Someone's already
looking for me.

389
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,589
You're in big trouble, buddy.

390
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,025
Your e-coupon for Big Mike's
Calzones expires today.

391
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,160
You're damn right.

392
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,595
And if I don't redeem that,

393
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,929
Big Mike is gonna get
real suspicious.

394
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,499
Big Mike is a cartoon

395
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,434
with pizzas for eyes.

396
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:06,801
All right, fine.

397
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,936
Maybe not Big Mike,
but someone will.

398
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:10,638
Shut up, Peralta!

399
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:12,040
Oh, boy.

400
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:14,009
Captain Holt,

401
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,779
here's your CompStat report.

402
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,514
This is how I move now.

403
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,315
Walking is too close to dancing,

404
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,951
and there's no more dance in me.

405
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,554
Plus I'm hoping my leg
muscles will atrophy

406
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,789
so I won't be
tempted to use them.

407
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:36,431
I bet you feel real good about
calling her dancing hobby, huh?

408
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,933
Sarcasm...
the coward's lie.

409
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,101
I don't get it.

410
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,770
Gina's always
so sure of herself.

411
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:42,971
She usually doesn't care at all

412
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,338
what people say
or think about her.

413
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:46,642
Maybe not with
most people, Captain.

414
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,077
But she cares what you think.

415
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,715
Fine.
I regret what I said.

416
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:55,149
But now, I don't know how
to make it right with her.

417
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,552
Lie!

418
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:58,554
Look, yesterday I told my twins

419
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,355
there were baby bunnies
in their stomachs

420
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:01,789
to get them to eat lettuce.

421
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,092
And that worked?

422
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,360
Yeah, but then they refused
to drink their milk

423
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,229
because they thought
the bunnies would drown.

424
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,965
So I bought a couple rabbits
and told the girls

425
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,200
that they hopped out of
their mouths while they slept.

426
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,434
I've lost track of your point.

427
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,570
They ate their lettuce,

428
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:15,704
I'm stuck with two bunnies,

429
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,271
and lying works!

430
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:25,314
Pretty good gag, huh?

431
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,982
A prostitute taught me
how to make it.

432
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,484
Ugh.
Where were you?

433
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:30,052
You were gone for three hours.

434
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,887
I know because I sang "This Is
How We Do It" 143 times.

435
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:35,557
Okay, well, I had to grab a few
things at the art supply store.

436
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,626
Kidnapping is 90% crafting.

437
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,095
Jake, you're gonna help me
get my life back.

438
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:41,697
You're gonna confess, on video,

439
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,899
to framing me for everything
that got me in trouble.

440
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,333
And why would I do that?

441
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,702
Because I'm high on bath salts,

442
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:47,736
emotionally unstable,

443
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,036
and pointing a gun at you.

444
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,471
Let's make a movie!

445
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:52,975
Hey, Boyle,

446
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:54,876
guess who caught
the Tim O's Limos perp.

447
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:56,545
Jake?

448
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:57,546
Is Jake back?

449
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:58,547
No, we did.

450
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,715
Scully and Hitchcock.

451
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,650
Signed confession.

452
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:02,651
You called us useless.

453
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,186
You called us incompetent.

454
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,686
You called us zeros in the sack.

455
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:06,854
Never happened.

456
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,057
Well, someone said it
to me last night.

457
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,426
Oh, uh, must have been my wife.

458
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,860
How did you solve the case?

459
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,429
We listened to those
voicemails again

460
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,465
and noticed the sound
of parrots in the background.

461
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,267
Got a list of employees,
did door duty

462
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,434
asking neighbors
if any of them kept pet birds.

463
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,438
We finally found
one who did, and guess what.

464
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,407
The landscaping in front of his
building was covered with these.

465
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:29,111
Same type of rock that
was thrown through the window.

466
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:30,212
I can't believe it.

467
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:31,680
What, you don't think
it could break one?

468
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:32,680
Watch.

469
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,717
I meant I can't believe
you solved the case.

470
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:38,152
Well, you were
wrong on that too.

471
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:44,259
Hi.
My name is Jake Peralta,

472
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,726
and this is my confession.

473
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:48,262
I destroyed the good name
of an American hero...

474
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:49,497
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

475
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:53,735
I framed him
for drug possession,

476
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,070
I got him fired from his job,

477
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,705
and I planted his scrotal prints

478
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,639
on the synagogue doorknobs.

479
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,876
Great, now just eighty more
confessions to go.

480
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,044
You've been very naughty.

481
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,948
I threatened to blow
Mr. Hoytsman's head off

482
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,716
if he didn't quote-unquote

483
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,284
"really cheap out
on his dad's funeral."

484
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,287
And while he slept,

485
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,122
I logged in to
Hoytsman's computer

486
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,525
and flooded it with Thai
pornography.

487
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:17,592
Starts crying.

488
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,361
"Starts crying"
is a stage direction,

489
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,896
you imbecile!

490
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:24,066
Also, I fathered two children
with Hoytsman's cleaning lady,

491
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,834
and it was I,
disguised as Geoffrey,

492
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,569
who spoke against her
at her political asylum hearing.

493
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:29,670
God.

494
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,050
You did it, not me.

495
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:35,177
I am a horrible person
who has done horrible things

496
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:36,978
to a truly decent man,

497
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:40,816
which is why I've decided
to take my own life.

498
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,250
Wait, no, I didn't decide that.

499
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,484
Spoiler alert!

500
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,642
Decided to take my own life.

501
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,410
That last take sounded great.

502
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:51,712
You really brought
my words to life.

503
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:53,214
You know, I should write more.

504
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,215
What a rush!

505
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,183
Hoytsman, you don't
have to do this.

506
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,418
Your life's not so bad.

507
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,420
Living in an ice cream truck?
Never showering?

508
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,888
That was my childhood dream.

509
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,290
I had everything.

510
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,893
I had friends, a wife,
two beautiful children...

511
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:06,994
out of three total.

512
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,129
Not a bad ratio.

513
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,297
And now I have nothing

514
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:10,298
and no one.

515
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:11,399
Look, I get it.

516
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,867
I know what that feels like.

517
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:15,703
You've only lived in an ice
cream truck for part of one day!

518
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:17,305
How could you possibly know?

519
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:19,440
Well, I know no one's
coming to rescue me.

520
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,742
I was so concerned with saving
myself and my reputation

521
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,076
I pushed all my friends away.

522
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:25,713
Wow.

523
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,782
Sounds like you're
having a breakthrough.

524
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,082
You should act on this.

525
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,619
You still have time
to make it right.

526
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,087
Really?
You're not gonna kill me?

527
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,188
Oh, jeez.

528
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,556
I totally forgot.

529
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:37,692
Thanks for reminding me.
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

530
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,194
Drugs make me say
such silly things.

531
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:41,696
Drugs are so silly.

532
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:44,899
Ooh, I'm gonna do some
right now.

533
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
- Hoytsman.
- What?

534
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:46,901
- Hyah!
- Oh!

535
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:48,903
God!
That's my nose!

536
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,337
That's where I put the drugs in!

537
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,440
- Gyah!
- Oh!

538
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,077
So long, Hoytsman.

539
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,011
Hyah!

540
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:59,113
I can't move!

541
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:01,549
I'm turtling.
I'm turtling!

542
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,517
Nice try, Jake.

543
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:04,552
Get up!

544
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,685
I can't.

545
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,188
Oh.

546
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,455
Yeah. Okay.
My bad.

547
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,726
What's this?

548
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:15,696
I'm selling my smoke machine,
glitter cannon, and castanets.

549
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:17,064
I would've put my soul on there,

550
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:19,834
but that was shredded
along with my spandies.

551
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,569
Gina, I want to
tell you something.

552
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,305
Dancing is more than just
a hobby for you.

553
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:25,640
It's a profession.

554
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,541
Oh, so you're a liar
like Terry now?

555
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,844
No, I'm no bunny-buying coward.

556
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,779
You are a professional dancer,

557
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,215
because I'm paying Dancy Reagan

558
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:37,718
to perform two shows at
our at-risk youth program.

559
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,886
Congratulations.

560
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:42,056
Thank you, Captain.

561
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,824
You just made me
the happiest, prettiest,

562
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,359
most talented girl in the world.

563
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,695
This is the best $8,000
you ever spent.

564
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,129
It's $200.

565
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,231
I'm sure you're
good for the rest.

566
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,466
Captain loves my dancing.

567
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:02,143
This is why you're alone, Jake.

568
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:03,511
We were bonding,

569
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:04,545
talking about our pain,

570
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:06,414
and you pull a stunt like that?

571
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,548
You were gonna kill me.

572
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,183
Deflect, deflect, deflect.

573
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,652
This is why everyone hates you.

574
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,853
You open?

575
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,855
Okay.
You keep it shut.

576
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,389
I really need this sale.

577
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:21,327
Hello, ma...
whoa!

578
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:23,431
Don't hurt me!

579
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:25,399
I'm someone's little boy.

580
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,101
Geoffrey Hoytsman,
you're under arrest.

581
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,235
Ow.

582
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:31,739
Oh, I am so relieved
you guys found me.

583
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,939
Wait, how did you find me?

584
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,508
You hadn't done anything
super annoying to us

585
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,509
for, like, five hours,

586
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,711
so we knew something was wrong.

587
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,079
Oh, that's very insulting

588
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,513
but dead on.

589
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:41,816
We looked through those
irritating selfies you sent us,

590
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,284
and in the background
of three of them

591
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,385
was an ice cream truck.

592
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,287
We ran the plates
and put out an APB.

593
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:48,222
I'm sorry we doubted
anybody was sabotaging you.

594
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,824
No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

595
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,492
For some reason,
I have trouble believing

596
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:52,693
people actually have my back.

597
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:53,994
I don't know why.

598
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:56,430
Probably my dad abandoning me.

599
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,766
Maybe something I should work
out in therapy, but...

600
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,403
who has an hour to spare
once every two weeks, right?

601
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:03,404
Anyways,

602
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,971
I'm sorry I acted
like a jackass.

603
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:07,274
Wow, Jake, you're so sincere
since you got off coke.

604
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,143
And meth.
That was the hard one to kick.

605
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:11,345
No, the hard one to kick
is angel dust,

606
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,814
which is why I am
locked in for life.

607
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,017
Hey.

608
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:18,252
I double checked your evidence.

609
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,253
Everything looks good.

610
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,355
I got to say...

611
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:22,790
you guys are good cops.

612
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,658
Hyeah, no doy!

613
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:26,627
How do you think we got to be
the oldest guys here?

614
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:27,728
By never being promoted

615
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,430
and losing all
your money to divorces?

616
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,798
And bad investments.

617
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,200
Anyway, I'm sorry
for calling you useless.

618
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:35,102
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows you did good.

619
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:36,337
- Boyle, please don't.
- Don't?

620
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,738
The last thing we need

621
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,306
is to suddenly be
on everyone's A list.

622
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,341
The ones to watch.

623
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:41,342
The golden boys.

624
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:42,709
Pair of red hot dicks.

625
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,278
No one calls detectives
that anymore.

626
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,613
People call detectives that?

627
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:47,848
All that
investigating was exhausting.

628
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:50,117
Besides, we did our share
of that in the '70s and '80s.

629
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:53,020
Now we like to do paperwork
in our comfy chairs.

630
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,655
If we're away from
our desks for too long,

631
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:58,192
they'll update our computers,
and we'll lose Minesweeper.

632
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,827
So please, don't tell anyone

633
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,829
about the amazing work
we did today.

634
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,397
I never said "amazing."

635
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:05,299
You kind of just did your jobs.

636
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,134
There you go.

637
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,135
No, really.

638
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:09,369
I mean, you also broke a window.

639
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:10,637
Now you get it.

640
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,343
Your suspension
has been lifted, Peralta.

641
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,845
Well, that's great news, sir.

642
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:19,580
And now it is time
for the traditional

643
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:20,915
handing back of gun and badge

644
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,316
to the vindicated hero ceremony.

645
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:23,484
Everyone in!

646
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,118
I don't have your gun
or your badge.

647
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:28,622
Just take form 891-underscore-J
down to the equipment room

648
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:30,191
and retrieve your things there.

649
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,926
I'm sorry,
but that's unacceptable.

650
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,127
Come on, Captain.
I need this.

651
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,128
We all need this!

652
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,065
Fine. Fine.

653
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,899
If this will make you happy...

654
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:44,572
I believe these belong to you.

655
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:45,739
Congratulations.

656
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,677
That's very nice.
Thank you.

657
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:51,912
But as I've said before,
the system stinks,

658
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:53,180
and this isn't over.

659
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,516
I say we march down
to city hall!

660
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:56,917
Get out of my office.

661
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:57,918
Yup.
