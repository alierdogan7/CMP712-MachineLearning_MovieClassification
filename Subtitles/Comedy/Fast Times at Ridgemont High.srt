I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.

00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:38,152
of class quizzes
and the chapters they cover.

171
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:41,026
Please pass them
to the desk behind you.

172
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,655
Back, back, back.

173
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:54,065
[Everyone Sniffing]

174
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:57,545
Did you hear about this surfer guy
who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
this morning?

175
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,412
Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.

176
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:04,317
A dick? Oh, God.
People exaggerate so much here.

177
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:09,490
Linda, that girl
looks just like Pat Benatar.

178
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,222
I know. Wait.
There are three girls at Ridgemont...

179
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:15,526
who have cultivated
the Pat Benatar look.

180
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:17,725
Chanel Semlar,

181
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:21,669
Mary Ann Zlotnick
in the red tights.

182
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,763
Do you think guys find that
more attractive?

183
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,503
Stacy, please, give me a break!
You are so much prettier!

184
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:32,014
Yeah, I know, but do you think
they'd be better in bed?

185
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:34,709
What do you mean?
You either do it or you don't.

186
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:40,222
No. There are like... variables
that I might not be good at.

187
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,557
- Like what variables?
- Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

188
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,256
What's the big deal?

189
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:51,892
- I never did it.
- You've never given a blow job?

190
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:56,462
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
It's so easy.

191
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,603
Check it out.

192
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,779
Relax your throat muscles.

193
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,185
- Don't bite.
- [Laughing]

194
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,882
And slide it in.

195
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,792
[Gagging]

196
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:22,889
Try it again.

197
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:28,165
Good. Push it slowly in and out.
You got it.

198
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,365
Okay.

199
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,204
- Can I ask you something
and you promise not to laugh?
- Sure.

200
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay. When a guy has an orgasm,
how much comes out?

201
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,577
A quart or so.

202
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,948
[Laughing]
No, I'm just kidding.

203
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,317
Just practice.

204
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,796
[Girl] I'm not going to a morgue.
I'll get my mom to write a note.

205
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:00,063
Nobody's getting me into a room
with a bunch of dead guys.

206
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:03,230
You have to go.
I hear it's part of the final.

207
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,070
I hear it's really disgusting.
Do you know what they do?

208
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,736
- Have you heard?
- What?

209
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,177
The bodies are dissected
and Mr. Vargas...

210
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:14,478
pulls out parts of the dead body
and holds them up.

211
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,882
You mean, he reaches in
and pulls this stuff out?

212
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:21,185
- Like stomach and tumors or something?
- Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.

213
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:25,717
Good day, everyone.
My name is Mr. Vargas.

214
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,696
Look.
I'm a little slow today.

215
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:32,667
I just switched to Sanka,
so have a heart.

216
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,000
[Vargas]
All right, now.

217
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:40,031
The World of Life. That is the name
of the textbook we will be using.

218
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,075
I'm in love.

219
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:47,014
See the mustache comin' in, Rat?

220
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,381
You can almost cross it out.

221
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,087
- I'm in love.
- You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.

222
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,562
What do you mean wuss?
This girl is my... exact type.

223
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,326
- Where'd you see her?
- In my biology class.

224
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,526
- Did you get her number?
- No.

225
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,332
- Did you get her name?
- No! No! It's too soon.

226
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,396
It's never too soon, Rat.

227
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:15,376
A girl decides how far she's gonna
let you go in the first five minutes.

228
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:19,381
What am I supposed to do? Go up to
this strange girl in my biology class...

229
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,249
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to
take your clothes off and jump on me"?

230
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,116
I would.

231
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:28,351
I can see it all now. This is
gonna be just like last summer.

232
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,415
You fell in love
with that girl at the Fotomat.

233
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:34,759
You bought $40 worth of fuckin' film,
and you never even talked to her.

234
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,731
You don't even own a camera!

235
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,926
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?

236
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,596
This is what you do.

237
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:44,868
Start from the minute
you walk into biology.

238
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:48,775
I mean, don't just walk in.
Move across the room.

239
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,439
And you don't talk to her.

240
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,779
You use your face.
You use your body.

241
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:57,376
Use everything.

242
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,920
That's what I do.

243
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,218
I mean, I just send out
this vibe...

244
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,782
and I have personally found
that women do respond.

245
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:07,329
I mean, something happens.

246
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,558
Naturally something happens.

247
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:12,567
You put the vibe out to 30 million
chicks, something is gonna happen.

248
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:16,503
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.

249
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,665
- The attitude?
- Yeah.

250
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:22,302
The attitude dictates
that you don't care whether
she comes, stays, lays or prays.

251
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:25,347
Whatever happens,
your toes are still tappin'.

252
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:30,045
Now, when you got that...
then you have the attitude.

253
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:35,214
- Good night, Stacy.
- Good night, Mom.

254
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:45,056

255
00:16:55,945 --> 00:17:01,383
<i> Just look at that girl with the lights
coming up in her eyes</i>

256
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:08,413
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

257
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:13,053
<i> She must be somebody's baby</i>

258
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:16,360
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks. So do you.

259
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:18,866
Where do you feel like going?

260
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,130
I don't know.

261
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:25,504
- How 'bout The Point?
- Okay.

262
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:29,067
All right!
The Point it is.

263
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:32,205
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

264
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,408
<i> She's so fine</i>

265
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:39,046
<i> She's probably somebody's only light</i>

266
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:41,647
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

267
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:48,562
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

268
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,361
<i> She's gonna be somebody's only light</i>

269
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,838
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

270
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:03,777
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

271
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,354
That's a really nice jacket.

272
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:21,624
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

273
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:30,428
- It's warm.
- Yeah, it is. It's really warm.

274
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,997
I wonder how long it will last.

275
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,974
So...

276
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,780
am I gonna get to first base?

277
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:57,795
- Are you really 19?
- Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.

278
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:07,136
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

279
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,206
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

280
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:20,953
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

281
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,917
<i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

282
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:30,932
<i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

283
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:44,379
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight?

284
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,506
<i> Yeah</i>

285
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:53,112
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight</i>

286
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:56,957
So tell me, do you like Ron?

287
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,291
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.

288
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:03,025
Don't worry. Keep doing it.
It gets a lot better. I swear.

289
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,623
It better.

290
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,460
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

291
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:11,495
<i> Just an all-American boy</i>

292
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:14,600
<i> I got my favorite toy</i>

293
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,376
<i> I was
raised on the radio</i>

294
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:22,474
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

- Mom says to clean the pool.
- Why can't you do it?

298
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,854
Your friends use the pool.
Your friends messed it up.

299
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:41,198
- Your friends use the pool too.
- I take out the garbage!

300
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,008
Brad!

301
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:03,522
- Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these?
- They're not home yet.

302
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:06,288
- Brad?
- What?

303
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,330
What would you say if
I asked you to put these...

304
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,366
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
and get rid of them?

305
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:15,768
- I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?"
- Please.

306
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:18,997
[Stacy]
Thank you very much.

307
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:23,835
- Lisa's great!
- Yeah.

308
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:28,646
I don't understand why you want
to break up with a girl like that.

309
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:33,052
Me and Lisa have been going together
for two years. I love her and all.

310
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:36,216
I mean, she's great in bed.

311
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:40,490
It's just that...
I'm a single, successful guy.

312
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:47,494
And this is my last year in school.
This could be the best year of my life!

313
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:52,203
I just feel like I need
my freedom now, you know?

314
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,078
Okay, here's your preparation stuff.

315
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:02,311
You got your sliced tomatoes,
shredded lettuce, secret sauce.

316
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,149
- What's the secret sauce?
- Thousand Island dressing.

317
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,712
What's the secret sauce
at Bronco Burger?

318
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,486
- Ketchup and mayonnaise.
- Gotcha.

319
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,027
Order for you, Bradley.

320
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,493
- Were those flowers really for me?
- Of course!

321
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,797
- How much did they cost?
- Don't worry about it.

322
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,838
Want to go to The Point tonight?

323
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:26,007
What's there to do at The Point?

324
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:30,535
What do you mean? We've been
going out together for two years.

325
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:34,777
I don't want to have to use sex
as a tool, Brad.

326
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,786
Tool? Tool for what?
We've been going together for two years!

327
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:42,153
- I don't want to talk about it here.
- I wanna talk about it!

328
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,522
- Brad?
- Lisa!

329
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,993
Brad!

330
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,725

Great.

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,079
What are you people, on dope?

337
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,019
A piece of legislation was introduced
into Congress by Senator John Platt.

338
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:16,353
It was passed in 1906.

339
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,689
This amendment to our Constitution...

340
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:21,252
has a profound impact
upon all of our...

341
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,824
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier
today near the first floor bathrooms.

342
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:29,735
Is he still on campus?
Anyone? Yes, Desmond?

343
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:32,399
I saw him by the food machines.

344
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:35,103
- How long ago?
- Right before class.

345
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,407
Okay.
Bring him in.

346
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:41,709
What is this fascination with truancy?

347
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:45,618
What is it that gets inside your heads?

348
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:49,522
There are some teachers in this school
who look the other way at truants.

349
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:51,617
It's a little game
that you both play.

350
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:54,595
They pretend they don't see you.
You pretend you don't ditch.

351
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:58,360
Now, who pays the price later?
You!

352
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:03,664
Wait a minute.
There's no birthday party for me here!

353
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,202
- [Class Giggling]
- Hola, Mr. Hand.

354
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,745
What's the reason for your truancy?

355
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:13,043
Just couldn't make it on time.

356
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,743
You mean,
you couldn't or you wouldn't?

357
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,380
It was like a full crowd scene
at the food lines.

358
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,584
Food will be eaten on your time.

359
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,220
Why are you continuously late
for this class, Mr. Spicoli?

360
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:31,756
Why do you shamelessly waste
my time like this?

361
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,604
- I don't know.
- [Giggling]

362
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,858
I like that.
[Chuckles]

363
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:01,624
"I don't know."
That's nice!

364
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:03,927
"Mr. Hand,
will I pass this class?"

365
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,935
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
I don't know!"

366
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,528
That's nice. I really like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?

367
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:14,565
I'm going to leave your words on this
board for all my classes to enjoy.

368
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,111
Giving you full credit,
of course, Mr. Spicoli!

369
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:18,976
All right.

370
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:20,743

371
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:32,821
<i> Sleigh bells ring
are you listening</i>

372
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:34,658
- Mommy!
- <i> In the lane</i>

373
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,288
- Oh, no!
- <i> Snow is glistening</i>

374
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:40,893
<i> A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight</i>

375
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,167
<i> Walking in a winter wonderland</i>

376
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,465
How fucking long
do I have to wait?

377
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:50,676
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.

378
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:53,544
You gotta get used to working holidays.
People are always screaming.

379
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,846
I have to quit this job.
I'm gonna get so fat...

380
00:25:55,918 --> 00:26:00,821
- no one's gonna want to take me out.
- Ron hasn't called, huh?

381
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,588
- Not since November.
- What does it matter?
He's a stereo salesman.

382
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,425
What'd you wanna do, marry him?
Have kids with him?

383
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:11,762
Have this guy come home
50 years old and bald?

384
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:15,395
And have that little Pacific Stereo
sign on? Come on, Stace.

385
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,302
Hey, it's his loss.

386
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,434
Got any Blue Oyster Cult?

387
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,967
No, I don't have any
Blue Oyster Cult.

388
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:27,709
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?

389
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,115
I was that close to working
at 7-Eleven, you know.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,581
What?

391
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:39,359
- All right! Play me?
- Totally.

392
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,726
You got quarters?

393
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,701
When are those Earth, Wind and Fire
tickets comin' in?

394
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,864
Earth, Wind and Fire?
Geez, I haven't heard anything.

395
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,930
The minute I do,
I'll let you know.

396
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,533
I'm plannin' on taking
my little brother over here.

397
00:26:55,611 --> 00:26:59,274
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-lookin' kid.

398
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:01,316
Great.
Charles Jefferson...

399
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:04,750
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.

400
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,914
I'll let you know when
they come around, okay?

401
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,158
[Sighs]

402
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:16,254
Wow! Does he really live here?
I thought he just flew in for games.

403
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:19,061
Shit! He knows where to come
when he wants some tickets.

404
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,570
Go on. Get outta here.
You're messing up my business.

405
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,505
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.

406
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:27,508
Wow.

407
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,703
You ready for
your moment of truth?

408
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:32,542
Damone, I noticed I was starting
to get a pimple this morning...

409
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:36,948
Rat, the shyness routine
is really starting to aggravate me.

410
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,149
I mean, who is she, anyway?
She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.

411
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:45,592
Look at her. Look at you.
A member of the Honor Roll.

412
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:48,824
Assistant to the assistant manager
of the movie theater.

413
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:53,960
Rat, if this girl
can't smell your qualifications,
then who needs her, right?

414
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,197
- Right.
- All right. How do you feel?

415
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:58,239
- I feel good.
- Do ya? All right.

416
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,299
Now stop fucking around
and go get her.

417
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:04,868
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.

418
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:07,381
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All right, that's cool.

419
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:11,852
You look good. All right?
Go get her.

420
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:19,683
$1.10, and you get five cents back.

421
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,696
Thanks.

422
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:25,723
- Hi! Don't I know you
from biology class?
- Yeah!

423
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:30,602
- What can I do for you?
- I had a couple of questions.
I was curious.

424
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:33,539
What do you do with the
jackets people leave here?

425
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,806
- We keep 'em.
- You keep 'em?

426
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,371
In case they come back.
You can look through it if you want.

427
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:43,748
No, that's cool. It would take
too long to look through all that.

428
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:46,049
I'll pick up a new one.

429
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,849
What was your other question?

430
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:54,624
Oh, my other question is...

431
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,995
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?

432
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:02,469
- Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:17,275
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.

434
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,620
I've gotta go.

435
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,005
Lisa, I have something to tell you.

436
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:46,537
Look, I'm a senior now.

437
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm a single, successful guy.

438
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,682
And I've got to be fair to myself.

439
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:57,453
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

440
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:04,025
Oh, don't do that.

441
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:06,260
- Please, please don't do that.
- Brad!

442
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:10,396
- Can you cover me on register two?
- Okay.

443
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:16,104
- May I help you?
- Ah, yes.

444
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:18,510
This is not the best breakfast
I ever ate and...

445
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,607
- I'd like my money back.
- Okay. I believe
you have to fill out a form.

446
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:25,847
No. I'd like my money back now.

447
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:29,357
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.

448
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:31,858
Well, you ate most of it
already so...

449
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:34,987
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."

450
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:37,793
You know what the meaning
of guarantee is?
Did they teach you that here?

451
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:40,528
Sir, if you'd just wait a minute.

452
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:43,537
Look. Just put your little hand
in the cash register...

453
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:47,632
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.

454
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:52,203
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.
I'll take care of everything.

455
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:55,250
I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.

456
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,115
I am so tired of dealing
with incompetence.

457
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:01,212
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!

458
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,624
Mister, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.

459
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:09,130
Ah, is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?

460
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:14,225
You bet you have a problem.
Your employee used profanity
and threatened me with violence.

461
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:17,033
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time
and usually have good service.

462
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:22,099
All I wanted was my money back on this
breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.

463
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:25,010
And he threatens me with violence.
I'm gonna call your super...

464
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,311
I can take care of it.

465
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:34,015
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
customer or use profanity in any way?

466
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:39,220
Uh... he insulted me first.
He called me a moron, Dennis.

467
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:42,889
Answer me! Did you threaten
this customer or use profanity?

468
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,593
- Yes.
- You're fired.

469
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,433
I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll refund your money right now.

470
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,438
I hope you won't hold this against us.

471
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,202
You know how these young kids are
these days.

472
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:56,710
[Dennis] Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?

473
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:59,906
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!

474
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:09,924
[Announcer] The world's finest
surfers showed up today to do battle...

475
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:14,554
with what's turned out to be the biggest
waves to hit this coast since 1946.

476
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:17,063
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
and I'd like you to meet this young man.

477
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:21,125
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.

478
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:23,728
Things looked rough out there today.

479
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:27,332
I'll tell you, Stu,
I did battle with some humongous waves.

480
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,346
Just like I told the guy on ABC,
"Danger is my business."

481
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:37,374
A lot of people
expected Mark "Cutback" Davis,
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...

482
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:40,979
- would take the honors this year.
- Those guys are fags!

483
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:44,822
Let me ask you. When you get out there,
do you ever fear for your life?

484
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:49,489
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
It's a way of life. It's no hobby.

485
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:54,297
It's a way of looking at that wave
and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"

486
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,637
[Laughing]
Where'd you get this jacket?

487
00:32:56,705 --> 00:33:00,607
From the network. Let me ask you,
what's next for Jeff Spicoli?

488
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:04,668
Headed over to the Australian
and then the Hawaiian Internationals.

489
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:09,046
Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over
to London and jam with the Stones.

490
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:13,450
You guys are invited too.

491
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,752
[Boy Knocking On Door]
Jeff! Jeff!

492
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:19,021
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.

493
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:22,928
- Leave me alone.
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you butthole!

494
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,661
- Leave me alone!
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you booger!

495
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:30,501
Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!

496
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:36,135
We just want to say that
we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.

497
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,147
We always hated that name.
It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.

498
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,775
- It's just such a put-down!
- Really!

499
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:47,049
We know you've got a lot of spirit,
everybody, right?

500
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:50,455
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln
next week! All right!

501
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:57,563
You know, it takes a lot
of courage to get up here...

502
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,294
and do something that
you know people will make fun of.

503
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:03,565
- Yeah.
- Man...

504
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:06,334
I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.

505
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:10,367
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave
their jobs there in the first place.

506
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:13,346
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.

507
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:16,816
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.

508
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:22,587
I'm just glad
we're still together...

509
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:27,060
because a lot's happened,
and I really need you this year.

510
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,498
Look, Brad, I've been trying
to think of a way to tell you this.

511
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:37,204
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.

512
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:41,834
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free,

513
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,744
to go out with other people.

514
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:50,582
I still want to be friends.

515
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,678
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?

516
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:58,055
No problem, Rat. What you need
is my special five-point plan.

517
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,287
Come on, Damone, I need real help.

518
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,353
What'd you mean?
Men have died...

519
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,661
trying to obtain this
valuable information.

520
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,668
- But I'll give it to you for free.
- What's your five-point plan?

521
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:14,130
All right.
Now, pay attention.

522
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,070
First of all, you never let on
how much you like a girl.

523
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:23,242
Oh, Debbie... hi.

524
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:27,617
Two.
You always call the shots.

525
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:31,386
Kiss me, you won't regret it.

526
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:35,896
Three. Act like wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

527
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,123
Isn't this great?

528
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,726
Four.

529
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:45,000
When ordering food, find out what she
wants, then order for the both of you.

530
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:46,973
It's a classy move.

531
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:50,273
The lady will have
the linguine in a white clam sauce,

532
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,745
and a coke with no ice.

533
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,543
And five.

534
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:58,177
Now, this is most important, Rat.

535
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,346
When it comes down to makin' out,

536
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,413
whenever possible,

537
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,219

- This is a nice car.
- Yeah. It's my sister's.

540
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:21,101
Yeah?

541
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,472
Do you have Mrs. George
for English?

542
00:36:25,547 --> 00:36:30,041
- Yeah. She's pretty good.
- Yeah, she is pretty good.

543
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:41,027
- Have you decided?
- Um, yeah.

544
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:43,792
I'll have the knockwurst.

545
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,129
Excellent.

546
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,068
You work at Cinema Four, right?

547
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,970
That must be great.
You get to see all those free movies.

548
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,237
You get free popcorn.

549
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,677
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

550
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:01,181
Would you mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

551
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,410
Oh, no, go ahead.

552
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:06,010
Are you ready to order here?

553
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:11,052
She will have the knockwurst.

554
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:14,095
And you?

555
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:17,029
- I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

556
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:19,532
- Coke.
- Two Cokes.

557
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:22,661
Okay.
Thank you.

558
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:26,163
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

560
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,538
- Hello?
- Mike, it's Mark.

561
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:38,780
- What happened to your date?
- It's happening right now.
Everything's fine except...

562
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:41,888
I left my wallet at home.

563
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:43,947
Why don't you go home and get it?

564
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:47,153
No, I can't! I'm here.
The food's coming and everything.

565
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:49,822
Look, would you do me a favor?

566
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:54,631
Just borrow your mom's car, drive to my
house, get my wallet and bring it here.

567
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,796
Hello? Mike?

568
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:01,637
Mike?

569
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,543
Geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.

570
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:06,546
Just do me this one favor.

571
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:10,277
I swear I won't ask you for anything
again in this lifetime or any other.

572
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:13,480
- But just please do this for me.
- You owe me for this one.

573
00:38:13,555 --> 00:38:16,547
Okay, thanks.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

574
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:20,958
- [TV: Boy] Beaver, are you all right?
- What happened?

575
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,795
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can bring you?

576
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,807
Do you want another Coke?

577
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,968
Um... okay.

578

- Hey, Mark, is that you?
- Yeah, hi.

581
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,646
- You come here?
- Yeah. I come for the strudel.
It's great.

582
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:50,782
Hey, listen, I found your wallet
the other day. You want it back?

583
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:53,589
Oh, wow! Yeah.
I was looking for this.

584
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:57,688
Oh, Mike,
you don't know Stacy Hamilton.

585
00:38:57,766 --> 00:39:00,200
- Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
- Hi.

00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:03,135
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

587
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:06,036
See you later.

588
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:10,271
Right. Gotta be goin'.
See you later.

589
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:13,806
You wanna go?

590
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:16,350
Um... yeah.

591
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:33,064
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Me too.

592
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:36,103
I'm real sorry someone broke in
and stole your tape deck.

593
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,662
I never thought it would've happened
at such a fancy place.

594
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,834
I know.
You want to come in for a sec?

595
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:47,037
- Okay, sure.
- Good.

596
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:56,988
- Where's your brother?
- He's out tonight with some friends.

597
00:39:57,058 --> 00:40:00,050
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, that's... that's okay.

598
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:04,588
Oh. Well,
would you mind if I change?

599
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,657
No.

600
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:10,033
Okay. Could you get this for me?
It always sticks.

601
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,242
Thanks.

602
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,919
Where are your parents?

603
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:31,254
My parents are out of town
for the weekend.

604
00:40:31,326 --> 00:40:33,419
Brad and I are watching the house.

605
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:37,389
- This is a really nice picture of you.
- Thanks.

606
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:39,729
You can come in my room
if you want.

607
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:53,039
So, what do you want to do?

608
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,480
I don't know.

609
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,111
Um, you want to look
at a photo album?

610
00:40:59,187 --> 00:41:02,452
I keep a lot of pictures
from when I grew up and stuff.

611
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:04,719
- It's kinda stupid, huh?
- Sure! Yeah.

612
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,158
Yeah? Great.

613
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:13,229
Photographs.

614
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:15,496
This is the one that Brad took.

615
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,664
It's like double-image type thing,
you know. It's like a mirror.

616
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,301
This is me being stupid.

617
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:26,279
And this is my dog Gypsy,
and my cat Tullio.

618
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:29,942
- They're dead now.
- Remember him? Mr. Degan?

619
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:32,111
You had Degan?

620
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:34,450
- He always wore the same suit!
- The same suit!

621
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:37,980
- He must've had 500 of those suits.
- He was terrible!

622
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:40,789
No, I think it was one.

- What?

629
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:13,755
My sister is crazy
when it comes to her car.

630
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:15,693
- It's gotta be back by 11:00.
- Want to call her?

631
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:19,756
No. Look, l... She gets crazy.

00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,995

00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:03,333
No, he shows absolutely
no interest in me.

639

Mark Ratner is definitely somebody
you'd have to make the first move with.

Linda, I did. I made the first move,
I made the second move.

641

is what I did.

644

You have dated older guys. You work
at the best food stand in the mall.

645
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:28,226
And you are a close
personal friend of mine.

646
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:32,966
Yeah. But I was really
beginning to like him.

647
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:36,772
Yeah? If that's true,
you better find somebody else fast.

00:57:57,404 --> 00:57:59,338
Okay.

829
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:06,006
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's only light</i>

830
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,048
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

831
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:16,249
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

832
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:22,262
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

833
00:58:25,098 --> 00:58:30,126
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

834
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:35,472
- Wait.
- <i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

835
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:38,272
- <i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>
- M-Mike! Mike!

836
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:42,941
[Groaning, Sighing]

837
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:45,075
Are you okay?

838
00:58:45,152 --> 00:58:47,211
Ahh.

839
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:50,586
I think I came.
Didn't you feel it?

840
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,148
Yeah. I guess I did.

841
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:59,291
I gotta go, Stacy.

842
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:01,926
I've really gotta go.

843
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:18,984
- See ya.
- Bye.

844
00:59:20,187 --> 00:59:23,418
Linda, how long does Doug take?

845
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:26,391
- Doug takes forever.
- Come on.

846
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,157
He takes, uh... 20 to 30 minutes.

847
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,563
I thought you said
he took 30 to 40 minutes.

848
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:37,263
That's right. I'm sorry.
I meant 30 to 40 minutes.

849
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:39,362
How long did Damone take?

850
00:59:39,439 --> 00:59:44,877
Damone took, uh...
15 to 20 minutes.

851
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:48,711
That's not bad for a high school boy.

852
00:59:51,218 --> 00:59:54,312
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

853
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:56,948
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

854
00:59:57,024 --> 01:00:00,323
<i> Just like an all-American boy</i>

855
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:03,124
- Mike! Hi!
- Hi.

856
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:06,393
- God, I haven't seen you for a while.
- Yeah.

857
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:09,958
- In a hurry. Got stuff I gotta do.
- I'm in a hurry too.

858
01:00:10,037 --> 01:00:13,097
- I just thought I'd say hi to you.
- Hi.

859
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:19,210
Hamilton, I'll take over
the fryer for a while.

860
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:22,578
Those boys at I.B.M. Ordered a stack
of those Catch-of-the-Day boxes.

861
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:27,052
- I told them you would personally
deliver them within the hour.
- Aye, aye, sir.

862
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:38,427
Hamilton, come over here.

863
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:44,093
- What are you doing?
- I'm changing.

864
01:00:44,171 --> 01:00:46,139
You took off your Captain Hook uniform.

865
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:50,108
I thought I'd put street clothes on
for the drive to I.B.M.

866
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:52,111
The uniform's uncomfortable.

867
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:56,616
You're going there as a representative
of Captain Hook Fish and Chips.

868
01:00:56,683 --> 01:00:59,982
Part of our image, part of our appeal
is that uniform. You know that.

869
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:02,453
You want me to put
the stuff back on?

870
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:05,116
Yes, I do. Show a little pride.

871
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:07,820

Dina, can you honestly tell me
that you forgot?

883
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:27,630
Forgot the magnetism of Robin Zander
or the charisma of Rick Nielsen?

884
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:30,699
- That's kid stuff.
- Kid stuff?

889
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,894
Can I talk to you for a sec?

890
01:02:48,962 --> 01:02:53,831
Stacy, I'm doing business.
Call me tonight, all right?

891
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,802
No. I've gotta talk to you now.
Okay?

892
01:03:00,273 --> 01:03:02,264
Don't go away.

893
01:03:02,342 --> 01:03:04,310
Look at 'em.

894
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:09,840
I hope this is important
because I could be blowin' a big deal.

895
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,941
Mike, I just...

896
01:03:12,018 --> 01:03:15,454
I just want you to know
that I'm pregnant.

897
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:21,350
How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.

898
01:03:21,428 --> 01:03:24,397
I haven't been with anybody else.
I know it's yours.

899
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:26,728
Jesus!
It was your idea.

900
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,564
You wanted to do it.
You wanted it more than I did.

901
01:03:29,636 --> 01:03:31,934
No.
Take that back.

902
01:03:34,374 --> 01:03:38,208
All right.
I take it back.

903
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:41,611
[Sighs]
Look, we gotta do somethin' about it.

904
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:44,775
I mean, uh,
we gotta get an abortion.

905
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:48,617
My brother Art got his girlfriend
one once. It's simple.

906
01:03:48,688 --> 01:03:53,716
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah. I got that planned.

907
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:57,729
It's going to cost $150
at the Free Clinic.

908
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:01,494
Doesn't sound free to me.

909
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:04,230
I suppose you want me
to pay for it.

910
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:07,296
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.

911
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,842
Seventy-five dollars and a ride.

912
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:12,902
Okay.

913
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,243
Okay. Thanks.

914
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:21,320
Thank you.

915
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:24,357

916
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:28,994
[Damone]
Rick, I need that $50 you owe me.

917
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:33,590
- Don't have it.
- I know times are tight,
but I really need it.

918
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:37,831
- Don't have it now.
- When you needed the tickets,
I got 'em for you.

919
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:40,270
So close to stage
you probably scared the band.

920
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,774
I'm not the Bank of America.

921
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:45,902
I know you're not the Bank of America,
but I need my $50.

922
01:04:45,979 --> 01:04:49,745
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday's too late.
I need it tonight.

923
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:52,376
Can't give you what I don't have.

924
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:57,151
Just forget about it.
I'll get it from you Thursday, okay?

925
01:04:57,223 --> 01:04:59,623
All right.
See ya.

926
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,351

[Woman]
Hold on, please.

937
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:42,434
Stacy, he says he's helping
his father in the garage.

938
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:43,935
He'll call you later.

939
01:05:47,374 --> 01:05:49,069
Brad!

940
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:51,508
Wait a second.

941
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,377
- Yeah, this is it.
We're just going bowling.
- Okay.

942
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,384
- Thanks a lot.
- See you later.

943
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:01,386
Okay.

944
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:19,202
- How we doing in here?
Debbie, you ready to leave?
- Yes. Thank you.

945
01:06:20,607 --> 01:06:23,269
Stacy, I can't let you go
unless you have a ride home.

946
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:28,781
- Oh. I told my boyfriend
to meet me downstairs.
- Okay.

947
01:06:28,848 --> 01:06:30,839
Thanks.

948

Since when do you
go bowling anyway?

950
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:51,265
Okay, Brad.
Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

951
01:06:51,337 --> 01:06:54,602
Come on!
Who did it?

952
01:06:59,045 --> 01:07:01,980
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

953
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:08,951
Okay.
It'll just be your secret.

954
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:10,956
Okay.

955
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:14,357

- Yeah.

- You hungry?
- Yeah.

958
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:28,438
I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
Why didn't you tell him?

959
01:07:28,508 --> 01:07:30,874
Linda, he didn't show up.

960
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:32,673
That little prick!

961
01:07:32,745 --> 01:07:35,714
I called his house.

962
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:40,276
His mother told me he was
in the garage helping his father.

963
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:43,288
Mike Damone's
a no-brain little prick, Stacy.

964
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:45,324
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

965
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:50,658
Linda, please don't do anything.
I don't even like the guy.

966
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:55,030
Stacy, he's not a guy.
He's a little prick!

Hi, Mikey!
[Giggling]

972
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:41,740
Hi, Damone.

973
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:56,126
Damone, what went on
between you and Stacy?

974
01:08:56,196 --> 01:09:00,292
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes girls go haywire.

975
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:04,666
It happened a month ago.
I've been trying to think
of a way to tell you ever since.

976
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:08,605
We were out... messin' around,
and something happened.

977
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:11,473
It's over.
It's no big deal.

978
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:14,479
I never even called her again.

979
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:19,985
If you ask me,
she's a very aggressive girl.

980
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:22,886
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand.

981
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:27,325
- She never really was your girlfriend.
- Fuck you, Damone.

982
01:09:27,393 --> 01:09:31,921
There are a lot of girls out there,
and you have to mess around with Stacy?

983
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:34,523
What do you gotta prove, anyway?

984
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:37,369
I'm sorry.

985
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:40,065
I always stick up for you.

986
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:44,371
Whenever people say, "That Damone, he's
a loudmouth," and they say that a lot,

987
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:47,208
I always say,
"Hey, you just don't know Damone."

988
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,148
When they call you an idiot,
I say, "Damone's not an idiot.
You just don't know him."

989
01:09:51,217 --> 01:09:55,984
Well, you know something, man?
Maybe they do know you pretty good.

990
01:09:56,055 --> 01:09:58,182
Maybe I'm just finding out now.

991
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:00,192
Get lost.

992
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:05,397
You want to do something about it, Rat?

993
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:08,298
You want to do something about it?
Come on.

994
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:10,563
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay. Let's go, man.

995
01:10:10,637 --> 01:10:13,299
- I'll break your fuckin' head off.
- Do something, man.

996
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:16,934
- A big talker, man!
- Knock this crap off!

997
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,342
Take it somewhere else.

998
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:22,074
Not in my gym, buddy.

999
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:29,979
[Sighs]
Shit.

1000
01:10:32,992 --> 01:10:37,861
Woke up in a great mood.
I don't know what the hell happened.

1001
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:42,659
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

1002
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:47,900
Today we're going to explore
how this hospital preserves human life.

1003
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:52,308
We'll be visiting every floor
where these fine doctors and nurses...

1004
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:56,075
take care of us in life...
and in death.

1005
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:59,118
[Crying]

1006
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:07,319
Over 30 children
are delivered here each day.

1007
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,759
[P.A. System]
Dr. Kramer to the nurses' station.

1008
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:12,559
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi.

1009
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:14,566
Class, this is Dr. Miller.

1010
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:17,694
He'll be joining us
for the last part of our tour today.

1011
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,534
If you guys will follow me, please.

1012
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:25,477
I'd like to ask you one last time.

1013
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:29,276
Conduct yourselves
with the utmost maturity.

1014
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,979
- You in my class?
- I am today.

1015
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:47,823
- [Mr. Vargas] Yes, Greg?
- Who are these guys?

1016
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,334
Most of them are derelicts.

1017
01:11:50,403 --> 01:11:53,429
They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.

1018
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:56,942
- About $30, I think?
- Twenty-five.

1019
01:11:57,009 --> 01:11:59,273
Righteous bucks!

1020
01:11:59,345 --> 01:12:01,677
This gentleman here is named Arthur.

1021
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:05,047
Arthur was good enough
to die last week of heart failure.

1022
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:09,077
We are fortunate today
to view his body...

1023
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:11,646
in its pristine state.

1024
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:18,161
Here an incision has been made.

1025
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:20,290
The ribs have been sawed off,

1026
01:12:20,366 --> 01:12:25,235
allowing us to remove
the breastplate...

1027
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:29,832
and really observe the human organs
as they exist in their natural state.

1028
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:32,036
Here we have the human lungs.

1029
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,871
And here is the human heart
which, you can see,

1030
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:40,248
is actually located
in the center of your chest.

1031
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,787
Ohh! Gnarly!

1032
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,994
[Coughs]

1033
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:54,990
Are you okay?

1034
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:57,467
Yeah.
I'm fine.

1035
01:12:57,537 --> 01:13:01,234
- I just made a jerk out of myself.
- No, you didn't.

1036
01:13:01,307 --> 01:13:03,434
Can't go back in there.

1037
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:07,946
Sure. We'll wait until they come out,
and then we'll blend in.

1038
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:11,074
Here they come.

1039
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,175
You're so nice.

1040
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:19,089

1041
01:13:40,246 --> 01:13:43,738
<i> I don't know, I don't know
which way I should go</i>

1042
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:45,750
<i> I don't know</i>

1043
01:13:47,253 --> 01:13:49,414
<i> I don't know</i>

1044
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:57,628
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

1045
01:13:57,697 --> 01:13:59,688
<i> I don't know</i>

1046
01:14:01,234 --> 01:14:04,567
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

1047
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:06,127
<i> I don't know</i>

1048
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,074
<i> I don't know</i>

1049
01:14:28,094 --> 01:14:30,688
<i> I don't know</i>

1050
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:40,168
You should be comin' on pretty soon,
dude. How much did you smoke?

1051
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,868
This'll be
a little demonstration of that.

1052
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,877
Listen up.

1053
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:50,343
- What was that?
- That was my skull.

1054
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:52,816
- [Laughing]
- I'm so wasted!

1055
01:14:52,952 --> 01:14:55,512
[Laughing]
Oh, man!

1056
01:14:55,588 --> 01:14:58,785
- What is this stuff?
- [Indistinct]

1057
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:01,122
Doesn't that stuff
cause brain damage?

1058
01:15:01,193 --> 01:15:05,220
- Only if you take it
every day for a month.
- Bitchin'! [Chuckles]

1059
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:09,462
- Dude, I'll pick you up in
the van and go to the dance.
- Later.

1060
01:15:09,535 --> 01:15:12,299
Jeff, you have company.

1061
01:15:12,371 --> 01:15:16,307
Get out of here, Curtis.
I don't hear you unless you knock.

1062
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:24,138
- [Knock At Door]
- That's better. Entre.

1063
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:28,077
Mr. Hand!

1064
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:31,885
Well, were you going somewhere
tonight, Jeff?

1065
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,983
Yeah.
The graduation dance.

1066
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,255
It's the last school fiesta
of the year.

1067
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:39,162
Hmm. I'm afraid we've got
some business to discuss here.

1068
01:15:39,231 --> 01:15:42,325
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

1069
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:46,667
According to my calculations,
Mr. Spicoli,

1070
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:51,767
you wasted a total of, uh,
eight hours of my time this year.

1071
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:56,178
And rest assured,
that is a kind estimate.

1072
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:00,412
Now I have the unique pleasure
of squaring our account.

1073
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:05,753
Tonight you and I are going to talk in
great detail about the Davis Agreement,

1074
01:16:05,825 --> 01:16:10,524
all the associated treaties, and
the American Revolution in particular.

1075
01:16:10,596 --> 01:16:15,465
If you can turn to page 47
of Land of Truth and Liberty.

1076
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:19,800
Oh, I left that book in my locker,
Mr. Hand.

1077
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:24,104
In that case, I'm glad I remembered to
bring an extra copy... just for you.

1078
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:28,041

1079
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:53,403
<i> He was a hardheaded man
He was brutally handsome</i>

1080
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:57,238
<i> And she was terminally pretty</i>

1081
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,836
<i> She held him up
and he held her for ransom</i>

1082
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:05,350
<i> In the heart
of the cold, cold city</i>

1083
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,079
<i> He had a nasty reputation
as a cruel dude</i>

1084
01:17:07,153 --> 01:17:08,586
[Damone] Look, Mark.

1085
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:12,590
I want to apologize for
everything that's happened.

1086
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,683
I'm really sorry.

1087
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,819
A guy just doesn't do that to a buddy.

1088
01:17:16,896 --> 01:17:18,921
I understand.
You can't help it.

1089
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:21,296
You're just lewd,
crude and obnoxious.

1090
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:24,768
- I can deal with that.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,838
Are we still friends?

1092
01:17:33,245 --> 01:17:35,645
- Huh?
- Okay.

1093
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:37,649
All right.

1094
01:17:37,983 --> 01:17:41,350
[Jeff] What Jefferson
was saying was, "Hey!

1095
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,583
"We left this England place
'cause it was bogus.

1096
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:48,559
"So if we don't get some cool rules
ourselves... pronto,

1097
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,221
we'll just be bogus too."

1098
01:17:53,032 --> 01:17:55,091
Very close, Jeff.

1099
01:17:57,503 --> 01:18:00,370
I think I've made my point with you
tonight.

1100
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:04,569
Do you have a guy like me
in class every year?

1101
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:07,476
You know,
a guy who you make an example of?

1102
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:10,982
- You'll find out next year.
- No way!

1103
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,918
As soon as I cruise history, I'm not
coming near your side of the building.

1104
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:18,115
- "Cruise history"?
- Soon as I pass your class.

1105
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,216
Ooh. If you pass.

1106
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:23,693
You're gonna flunk me?

1107
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:27,221
Don't worry, Spicoli.
You'll probably squeak by.

1108
01:18:27,299 --> 01:18:30,325
[Laughing]
Yeah! Aloha, Mr. Hand.

1109
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:35,600
Aloha, Spicoli.

1110
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:46,174
Honey,
these are my two star students.

1111
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:48,948
Boys, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Mrs. Vargas.

1112
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,955
Hi.

1113
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,514

1114
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,136
Summer!
Yea!

1115
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:07,832
Totally!
[Yelling]

1116
01:19:10,643 --> 01:19:12,577
[Linda]
I wrote him a letter.

1117
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:16,081
Tell me what you think.
"Dear Doug.

1118
01:19:16,148 --> 01:19:18,378
"I received your message that
you weren't coming to my graduation.

1119
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,284
"Doug, this is not the kind of thing
that occurs between adults.

1120
01:19:22,354 --> 01:19:27,223
"Maybe you've found someone new,
someone more mature.

1121
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:31,354
"But if you ask me, Doug,
you're the one being childish.

1122
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:35,059
"Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna
sit around and wait for you, forget it.

1123
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:38,501
- Sincerely, Linda." What do you think?
- Uh...

1124
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:40,505
I have another version
where I call him an asshole.

1125
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:42,973
No, that one's better.
It's more...

1126
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,976
- Mature?
- Yeah.

1127
01:19:45,044 --> 01:19:47,444
- I don't have to sink to his level.
- Yeah.

1128
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:50,141
- I can go out with anyone I want,
practically.
- That's right.

1129
01:19:50,216 --> 01:19:54,118
Yeah.
Thanks for cheering me up.

1130
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:57,978
Come on.

1131
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:04,755
Hey, dude!
I know that song.

1132
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:18,043
Hey, I'm not.
I'm not.

1145
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,524
Linda, I finally figured it out.

1146
01:21:06,592 --> 01:21:10,892
I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.

1147
01:21:10,963 --> 01:21:14,490
- What do you want?
- I want a relationship.

1148
01:21:14,566 --> 01:21:19,003
- I want romance.
- You want romance?

1149
01:21:19,071 --> 01:21:23,098
In Ridgemont? We can't even get
cable TV here, and you want romance.

1150
01:21:25,477 --> 01:21:30,039
Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.

1151
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:32,106
It's not that bad.
Keep your eyes open.

1152

1164
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:14,816
I'm glad you came over...

1165
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:17,919
'cause I have this picture of me
that I wanted to give to you...

1166
01:22:17,997 --> 01:22:21,330
so that you'll remember
to call me over the summer.

1167
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,200
I don't know. I'm going to be traveling
a lot this summer and I'm not sure...

1168
01:22:30,642 --> 01:22:34,009
I'll give you a call sometime.

Uh-huh. [Laughs]
I knew it.

1172
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:24,591
Why don't you get a job,
Spicoli?

1173
01:23:24,663 --> 01:23:27,723
- What for?
- You need money.

1174
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,827
[Laughs]
All I need are some tasty waves,

1175
01:23:31,904 --> 01:23:34,099
a cool buzz, and I'm fine.

1176
01:23:36,175 --> 01:23:38,507
Thanks.
Can I use your bathroom?

1177
01:23:40,212 --> 01:23:42,146
Yeah, go ahead.

1178
01:23:42,214 --> 01:23:45,240

01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:49,219
First door on the left.

1180
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:57,257
Money, and I want it now.

Behind the doughnuts.

1184
01:24:05,304 --> 01:24:07,898
I've been watchin' this place.
I know what I'm doin'.

1185

- Oh, motherfucker!

1193
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:38,469
There goes your ride home.
