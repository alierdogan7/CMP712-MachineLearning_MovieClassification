Is this how I'm gonna spend
my Labor Day weekend?

my mother

11
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:41,968

with everything?

it's a normal day.

Get up on the table,
dance around,

15
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,434

28
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,133

on the way home.

29
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:34,499

your sweaty back

46
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,998

all the people who work,

so that all the people
who don't

is you'll be out of here

but Marcy and I
rarely eat red meat.

So would you mind fixing up
this salmon I brought?

Oh. No problem.

You want me to say
it's tough and chewy
