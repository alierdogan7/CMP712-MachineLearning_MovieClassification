Zachary Cowan, age 11,
and armed with a stick,

7
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,800
struck our son,

<i>No. Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.</i>

854
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,780

Honesty is just stupidity.

Killed.
I killed the hamster?

Yes. You do everything you can
to make us feel guilty.

883

You stake out the moral
high ground as your own,

884

Michael said this morning
that the hamster ran away.

[LAUGHING]

1325
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,397
Men get so attached
to their toys.

1326
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,483
It diminishes them.

1327
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,359
They lose their credibility.

1328
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,195
Oh, God. Ha-ha-ha.

1329
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,822
I dated this guy once,

1330
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,158
and then I saw him
carrying this bag,

1331
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,785
this rectangular bag
with a shoulder strap.

1332
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:52,830
It's a man's bag
with a shoulder strap.

1333
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,582
It was over.

1334
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:57,460
A bag with a shoulder strap,
that's the worst.

1335
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:00,338
But the cell phone
always at his fingertips,

1336
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,840
that's the worst too.

1337
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,968
Men should have
both hands free.

1338
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:08,596
They should have
both hands free.

1339
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:11,807
I've got a John Wayne idea
of manhood too.

1340
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,809
What was it he had? A Colt .45.

1341
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,978
Something that empties a room.

1342
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,481
Any man that doesn't give off
those loner vibes

1343
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:22,944
just doesn't come off
as having any substance.

1344
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:27,698
Oh. So, Michael, Michael.
I guess you're happy now, huh?

1345
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:31,369
Our little touchy-feely, whatever you
said, is coming apart at the seams.

1346
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:33,371
But, hey, you know what?

1347
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:37,833
This almost feels good,
in my opinion.

1348
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,296
In my opinion, some people can
handle their liquor better than others.

NANCY: I'm as normal as can be.
Yeah, right.

Yeah. I'm beginning to see things
with a pleasant serenity.

Heh. That's good.
A pleasant serenity.

yourself out in the open, Darjeeling.

PENELOPE: No cigars in the house.

You got your Hoyo de Monterro.

You got your Hoyo Coronacion.

Where did you get these?

1360

Heh. You don't wanna know.
Seriously.

1361
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:14,453
MICHAEL:
The Spanish connection.

1362
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,039
My cookware guy is going out
with a flight attendant.

1363
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,917
She brings home, like,
two boxes a week.

1364
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,170
You can't smoke in a house
with an asthmatic child.

1365
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,715
And why are you telling him
your whole life story?

PENELOPE: Our son.

1367

We had a goddamn hamster,
didn't we?

1368
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:32,263
NANCY: Oh, that's true.
Pets aren't good when you're asthmatic.

MICHAEL:
No. Not good at all.

1370

Even goldfish aren't
necessarily recommended.

Do I have to listen to this crap?

1372
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:45,443
I guess I'm the only one that doesn't see
things with a pleasant serenity. Heh.

1373
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,528
The truth is...

1374
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,280
I've never been so unhappy.

1375
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,282

I wish I could.
Believe me, I wish I could.

1489
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,949
Wow. Heh-heh-heh.

1490
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,453
Get a couple of drinks in her and,
bam, her true self comes out.

1491
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:33,290
What happened to that gracious,
demure woman with the soft eyes?

1492
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,876
I told you. I told you!

1493
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:38,128
What did you tell him?
That she's a fake.

1494
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,589
That woman is totally fake.
I'm sorry.

1495
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,634
When did you say that?
When you were drying your pants.

1496
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,804
You'd known her 15 minutes,
and you already knew she was fake?

1497
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:49,723
Yeah. Well, I pick up
on these things pretty quickly.

1498
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,558
She does.
PENELOPE: I got a nose for them.

1499
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,852
Fake. What does that mean?
I, uh...

1500
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,604
I don't wanna listen to this.

1501
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:57,982
Why do you put me
through this, Alan?

1502
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,817
Relax, Nancy.

1503
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:02,820
She's a phoney. She doesn't
care any more than you do.

1504
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:06,198
It's true. That's true.
It's true. He said it's true.

1505
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,367
They don't give a shit.

1506
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:12,121
It's so obvious right from the beginning.
They don't give a shit.

1507
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,415
She doesn't give a shit either.
It's true.

1508
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:16,166
Like you do?
Well...

1509
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,960
No, let him talk, honey.

1510
01:12:18,127 --> 01:12:20,921
Explain to me, Michael,
exactly how you care.

1511
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,673
What does that mean anyway?

1512
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,634
You're more credible when
you're being openly despicable.

1513
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,013
Truth is, nobody here cares,
except maybe Penelope.

1514
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,806
One must acknowledge
her integrity.

1515
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,225
I don't need your acknowledgement.

1516
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,394
I don't need your acknowledgement!

1517
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,730
But I do care. I really do care.

1518
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,525
Yes, Doodle,
we care in a hysterical way.

1519
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,862
Not like heroic figures
of a social movement.

1520
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:49,158
I saw your friend Jane Fonda
on TV the other day.

1521
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:52,703
Made me wanna run out
and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.

1522
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:55,414
Heh-heh-heh.
PENELOPE: My friend Jane Fonda?

1523
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:58,208
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1524
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:03,505
You're the same breed, the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

1525
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,257
Those are not
the women we like.

1526
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:09,344
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

1527
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,388
The gatekeepers of the world,

1528
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:14,725
the ones who wanna show off
how perceptive they are?

1529
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:16,685
Huge turnoff.

1530
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:20,731

your own husband, is turned off.

We don't give a shit
what women you like.

1533
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,280
Where do you get off
just spouting these opinions?

1534
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,700
You are the one man whose opinion
we don't give a shit about!

1535
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:34,411
She's screaming.
Heh, heh.

1537
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:39,333
She doesn't scream?

1538

She didn't just scream
that your little asshole

1539
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:44,296
was right to beat up ours?

1540
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:45,547
He was right.

1541

isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot.

Exactly.

of your stupid tulips!

1548
