What is the film?

Uh, well, the film is the story

of what happened when this guy

tried to make

interesting than I am,

is kind of about him.

I mean, it's not
Gone with the Wind,

in there somewhere.

"This guy" was Thierry Guetta,

54
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,265
a Frenchman who had been living
in Los Angeles

55
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,518
since emigrating
to the United States

56
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,562
in the early 1980s.

A regular family man,

59
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,027
Thierry owned
a vintage clothing store

60
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,072
in the city's most bohemian
shopping district,

61
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,408
and he made a good living
selling his wares

62
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,369
to L.A.'s more fashion-conscious
citizens.

63
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,703
At that time,

64
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,415
I used to buy old Adidas
and old things

65
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,084
and, you know, things
you couldn't find here:

66
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,961
shoes, bags.

67
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,047
And I had a warehouse
with big bales of these clothes,

68
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,591
and we used to buy these
for $50.

69
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,552
I used to take things that,

70
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,387
when the sewing was different,

71
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,389
I call it designer,

72
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,641
and I'd put the price
that is $400.

73
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,144
So from $50,

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,273
sometimes I could make $5,000.

00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,734
NARRATOR: But there was
one very unusual thing

76
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,571
about Thierry.

77
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:44,075
He never went anywhere
without a video camera.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,079
I don't know
how the video camera

79
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,581
came into my hand,

80
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,710
but I know the moment
it came inside my hand,

81
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,714
I couldn't let it down,
ever.

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,426
It was like more than any drugs
to anybody.

83
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,636
It was obsession.

I had cameras set up everywhere.

00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,175
I was completely maxed
with camera.

96
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,139

he would do it like...

even the picture camera

98

the video camera.

131
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,219

he was an artistic...

134
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,153
you know, he was putting

135
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,366
and trying to do the game
of Space Invaders,

136
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,244

kind of way.

137
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,038

It was kind of fun,

142
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,596
because he was, like,
doing some tile, very small,

143
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,682
and putting it on top
of couple building,

144
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,559

it was really nice,

in an explosive new movement

was driven by a new generation

posters, and sculptures

André has this character

183
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,172
that is a smiling face
that's blinking an eye

184
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,632
and, you know, with,
like, long legs

185
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,968
and walking everywhere,
you know,

186
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:59,265
like kind of
a cartoon character.

187
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,975
When I met Zeus,

188
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,145
he was, like, painting, like,
shadows on the streets

189
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,731
of different things.

190
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,524
I liked to capture those people

191
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,737
because I thought it was nice,
what they were doing,

192
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,447
and they really believe it.

193
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,073
You know, they really loved it.

194
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,412
I started to really see, like,
a gallery outside.

195
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,915
Don't walk all over the paint.

196
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm trying not to.

197
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,059
[atmospheric electronic music]

198
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:51,192
# #

199
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,704
I just loved it, you know,

200
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,289
filming at night
and street,

201
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,543
because it was, like,
a mix of fears

202
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,170
and getting something
that nobody sees,

203
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,966
and somewhere you
and... illegal,

204
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,802
and you can get caught,
you know?

205
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,305
So it was, like, that feeling
that it was, like, a danger,

206
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,474
and I like that.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,017
You know, I like the danger.

208
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,811
You know, it made me feel good.

209
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:32,817
# #

210
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,820

212
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,332
NARRATOR: Thierry had
accidentally found a focus.

213
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,459
The man who would film anything

214
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,463
had stumbled into
an intriguing underground world,

215
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,968
and now that he had found it,
he wasn't about to let it go.

216
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:08,227
# #

217
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,438
I guess Thierry
was in the right place

218
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,356
at the right time,
really.

219
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,276
I mean, the thing is
that most all art

220
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,862
is built to last, like,
hundreds of years.

221
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,741
It's cast in bronze,
or it's oil on canvas,

222
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,827
but street art
has a short lifespan,

223
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,913
so it needed documenting.

224
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,833
You know, we all needed someone
who knew how to use a camera.

225
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,711
[loud metallic clatter]

226
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,004
Fuck.

227
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,631
NARRATOR: A few months later,

228
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,342
Invader visited Los Angeles
for the first time,

229
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,678
giving Thierry the chance
to pursue his new passion

230
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,263
on home turf.

231
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,515
Uh-oh.
Quickly, quickly, it's the cops!

232
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,808
You can't do that here.

233
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,310
It's to take pictures.

234
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,645
Right.
Not here.

235
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,730
Not that, no.
That's graffiti.

236
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,357
That's not graffiti.

237
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,567
No, no, but that's not.
That's not graffiti.

238
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,277
Then remove it,
because you guys got to go.

239
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,612
That's an art.
That's an art.

240
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,238
You guys need to go.

241
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,991
But this is,
like, Space Invader.

242
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,701
You know Space Invader?

243
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,203
I know Space Invader.
Not here, no.

244
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,496
You don't know Space Invader?

245
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,081
Go!

246
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,793
I was filming Space Invader,
but I wanted more.

247
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,086
You know?

248
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,379
So I mean, it's like,

249
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,297
I could get him all the time,

250
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,633
so I wanted somebody
that I couldn't get.

251
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,552
NARRATOR: Thierry's opportunity
to meet someone

252
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,680
who could keep him
in steady thrills

253
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,933
came a few days later
when Invader arranged to meet up

254
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,893
with another
West Coast street artist.

255
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,438
His name was Shepard Fairey.

256
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,441
[hard rock guitar]

257
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:45,783
# #

258
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,952
One day,
Shepard would be famous

259
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,871
for transforming the face
of an unknown senator

260
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,792
into a universally
recognized icon.

261
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,169
But even back in 2000,

262
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,506
Shepard was the world's
most prolific street artist.

263
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,800
# #

264
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,053
Shepard's experiment
with the power of repetition

265
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,472
went back to 1989

266
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,891
and an image based
on cult '70s wrestler

267
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,477
Andre the Giant.

268
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:19,316
# #

269
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,987
Combining Andre's face
with a command to obey,

270
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,990
Shepard had already clocked up
over a million hits

271
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,408
around the world.

272
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,494
# #

273
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,038
And although
he didn't know it yet,

274
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,332
his world was about
to collide head-on

275
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,625
with Thierry's.

276
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:41,881
# #

277
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,676
Shepard Fairey
was at Kinko's on Vine,

278
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,013
and Space Invader had something,
a trouble with something,

279
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,682
and he couldn't make it
that moment.

280
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,311
But me, I wanted
to meet the guy,

281
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,439
so what I did,
I went and meet him.

282
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,733
- Invader.
- No, Thierry.

283
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,693
I didn't ask him;
I just filmed.

284
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,028
That was my thing.

285
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,654
I didn't ask him anything.

286
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,947
When I came,
I came with a camera,

287
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,449
and I start filming.

288
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,825
So why did you do him?

289
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,202
You don't know?

290
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,870
- Uh...
- Oh, you knew the guy.

291
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,163
He's funny-looking.
No.

292
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,956
Oh, you didn't know him?

293
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,042
- No, I didn't know him.
- Do you think he's dead, or...

294
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,543
Oh, he's dead, yeah.

295
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,003
Yeah?

296
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,380
So you have a partner works
with you, eh?

297
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,673
Yeah.
This is Amanda.

298
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,258
Amanda, how are you doing?

299
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,968
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

300
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,221
So how long
you been doing this?

301
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,848
10 1/2 years.

302
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,226
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of paper.

303
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,230
Yeah.
[laughter]

304
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,648
What do you do?

305
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,858
I film.

306
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,906
NARRATOR: That night when
Shepard did meet Space Invader,

307
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,244
he took him on a tour
of the city.

308
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,829
Thierry was there

309
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,373
filming everything
that Space Invader was doing

310
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,376
and then, of course,
once I was with Space Invader,

311
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,169
everything I was doing.

312
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,257
You should probably
put an invader

313
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,716
up on Hollywood Boulevard.

314
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,427
What do you think, Thierry?
Yeah.

315
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,139
NARRATOR: And when Invader
returned to France,

316
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,432
Thierry simply carried on,

317
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,934
tagging along
at Shepard's side

318
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,354
whenever the artist
went out in the streets.

319
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,357
- 2:00... if he's gonna be out
past 2:00,

320
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,650
he needs to call at 2:00.

321
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,360
Okay.
I'll make him.

322
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,988
Otherwise, he gets beat,
and he sleeps on the couch.

323
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,992
Amanda always thought
that he was weird,

324
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,827
but I said it's great

325
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,872
that we're getting
a lot of this stuff on tape.

326
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:43,377
And for me to have someone there
as a lookout was always good.

327
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,171
Keep your eye out for the cops.

328
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,507
I finally did train him
to not turn the light on

329
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,384
while I was on a billboard
or a rooftop,

330
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,677
where he was gonna
blow my cover.

331
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,970
No, no, no, don't use that.

332
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,805
Yeah.

333
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,808
NARRATOR: After ten months
of Thierry's constant presence,

334
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,810
the question inevitably arose:

335
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,272
What exactly
was Thierry filming for?

336
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,565
It's cool, though, right?

337
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,192
NARRATOR:
And that was the moment

338
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,402
Thierry came up with a big idea

339
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,321
that would dictate
the path of his life

340
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,114
for the next eight years.

341
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,908
In the beginning,
you're, like, thinking,

342
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,285
like, "The guy's gonna film me
one time, two times,

343
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,330
three times, five times,
ten times, twelve times,"

344
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,373
but after a while,
he's like,

345
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,167
"What you gonna do?"

346
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,504
Because usually people film
a day, two days, three days,

347
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,340
and they make something
out of it.

348
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,841
But I kept filming,

349
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,718
so he's like,
"What you gonna do?"

350
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,721
And I said, "I'm gonna make
a street art documentary,"

351
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,014
you know?

352
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,351
Take two.

353
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,978
[clapping]

354
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,981
[whimsical orchestral music]

355

# #

356
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,700
NARRATOR: In his new role
as documentary filmmaker,

357
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:02,706
Thierry now started traveling
the world with Shepard,

358
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,959
recording every detail
of the artist's life.

359
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,461
I knew that
couldn't be far away.

360
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,172
[laughs]

361
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:14,009
Even though
the Andre the Giant sticker

362
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,302
was just an inside joke

363
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,054
and I was just having fun,

364
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,475
I liked the idea of the more
stickers that are out there,

365
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,768
the more important it seems;

366
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,228
the more important it seems,

367
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,355
the more people
want to know what it is,

368
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,399
the more they ask each other,

369
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,944
and it gains real power
from perceived power.

370
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,988
Can I talk to you
for a second?

371
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,781
Police officer.
I'm not gonna arrest you.

372
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,074
I'm not gonna arrest you.

373
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,492
I just want
to talk to you, dude.

374
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,495
Don't film from that side.

375
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,788
Film from this side over here.

376
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,999
You understand why, right?

377
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,085
Because you're gonna
attract attention.

378
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,213
[car horn honking]

379
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,593
[whistling]

380
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,929
Oop! Whoa!

381
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,934
# #

382
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,355
It was like a big adventure
every night.

383
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,274
We were going
on top of buildings

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,526
and going on top of something

385
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,278
that was not just illegal;

386
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,696
it was dangerous.

387
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,115
But I would do it

388
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,201
because I wanted to show
that I could do it.

389
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,205
You know, it was not like,

390
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,207
I'm downstairs

391
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,376
and you are upstairs
doing your thing

392
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,669
and I'm filming.

393
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,962
No.

394
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,714
I would go upstairs,

395
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,303
and I would go even up, up more
to have the shot that is great.

396
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:47,436
# #

397
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,400
He just wanted to go
whenever I was going,

398
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,194
and he was always...

399
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,072
he was always very diligent
about climbing,

400
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,657
about helping move the buckets,
the ladder.

401
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,326
He was not only a filmer,

402
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,828
but in ways,
he was an accomplice,

403
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,499
and I don't know whether
it's just that he's passionate

404
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,000
or whether
it's that he's passionate

405
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,336
and he's kinda crazy.

406
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,630
But I respect passion.

407
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:20,636

408
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,887

[distant sirens wailing]

410
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,518
NARRATOR:
But it wasn't just Shepard

411
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,228
who caught Thierry's eye.

412
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,522
As he ventured further afield,

413
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,484
Thierry was constantly meeting
street artists.

414
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,902
And in my head,

415
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,612
I wanted to make a movie
about street art,

416
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,032
so I wanted to get
as much people as possible.

417
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:46,662
Even people who tell me,
"No, I don't want to be filmed,"

418
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,958
I find a way
of making the no as a yes.

419
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,292
Oh, cool.

420
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,586
I love the design of it.

421
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,799
So you draw.
You know how to draw?

422
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,134
It's a painting.

423
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,552
Yeah.

424
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,096
And I start to know one,

425
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,058
and one make me
meet another one.

426
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,061
Very important
when you put the poster

427
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,231
to see where
you're gonna put it.

428
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,985
Usually, I just...

429
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,196
I choose a wall
'cause I like it,

430
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,323
I like what it feels like,
you know?

431
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,159
The texture.

432
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,579
When I go with the artist,
I'm just living them life.

433
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,164
You know?

434
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,167
I'm a ghost
when I'm with them.

435
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,711
I'm kind of a ghost.

436
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,754
Don't you wish to be taller
sometimes?

437
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,423
- Shut the fuck up.
- [laughs]

438
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,383
So what name you are using?

439
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,759
Borf.

440
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,971
It was the name
of my best friend

441
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,098
who killed himself
when we were 16...

442
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,058
[spray paint can hissing]

443
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,603
And I just do it to...
I don't know...

444
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,730
commemorate his life.

445
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,607
You gonna hit that?

446
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,609
We're gonna do both.

447
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,402
- Are you gonna do both?
- Yeah.

448
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,905
But, like, I think it'd be cool
if you came up with us.

449
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,373
[distant sirens wailing]

450
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,502
[police radio chatter]

451
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,423
Excuse me, sir?

452
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,258
Can I have a quick word
with you, sir, please?

453
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,801
Excuse me?

454
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,720
Could I just have a quick word
with you, please?

455
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,139
If I can ask you to stop
any recording that you're doing.

456
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,016
- It's not recording.
- That's fine.

457
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,392
- Do you understand English?
- Yes.

458
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,436
That's fine, sir.

459
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,272
I'm sure you can appreciate
graffiti's a criminal offense.

460
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,941
Right?

461
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,026
NARRATOR: Thierry's documentary
was shaping up to be

462
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,614
the authentic inside story
of the birth of a movement

463
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,786
starring the biggest figures
in the street art world...

464
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,788
with one exception.

465
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,665
Now Tate Britain
in Pimlico

466
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,668
refused to discuss
security arrangements today

467
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,420
after a graffiti artist
known as Banksy

468
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,589
was able to leave
one of his own paintings

469
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,675
in the gallery's
landscape room.

470
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,843
[sneaky music]

471
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,846
I hear about this Banksy.

472
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,390
"Who's Banksy?
Banksy?

473
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,808
Banksy this."

474
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,185
And I said,
"I really like that guy."

475
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,478
You know?

476
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,980
And it's like,

477
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,191
"I want... I want... I want
to interview this guy."

478
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:29,324
# #

479
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,667
NARRATOR: Thierry
wasn't the only one intrigued.

480
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,878
By now, word about
this mystery provocateur

481
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,172
and his increasingly
ambitious adventures

482
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,177
was radiating far beyond
the world of street art.

483
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:53,599
Banksy had started out
as a provincial graffiti artist,

484
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:58,353
but before long, his stencils
were appearing all over Britain.

485
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,567
Through a series
of DIY art shows,

486
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:08,864
Banksy was now taking vandalism
in an entirely new direction.

487
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,701
So I ask Space Invader.

488
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,202
I ask everybody that I knew.

489
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,912
"How can I get this guy?"

490
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,914
They said, "It's impossible.

491
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,416
It's impossible."

492
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,294
But my focus in my head,
it was like,

493
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,505
"How am I gonna make it?
How am I gonna make it?

494
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,050
It's impossible,
but how am I gonna make it?"

495
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,218
NARRATOR: While Thierry schemes
to find a way

496
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,429
to the one missing star
of his film,

497
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,264
his other subjects carried on,

498
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,184
letting Thierry capture
every moment

499
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,269
of their creative process.

500
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,272
What none of them suspected

501
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,108
was that Thierry's
street art documentary

502
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,987
didn't actually exist.

503
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,666
[muttering indistinctly]

504
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,586
All the tape that I film,
even if it was good,

505
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:08,965
it was going nowhere.

506
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,468
It was going
in a box somewhere.

507
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,428
Sometime I don't
even write anything.

508
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,721
Sometime I write the year.

509
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:19,142
Sometime I write nothing.

510
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,977
But I would never watch it.

511
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:25,065
Never, never, never.

512
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,650
When it was filmed,

513
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,820
for me, it was done.

514
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,906
It wasn't important,
how it was made.

515
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,450
It was important what it was.

516
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:40,664
It was the capturation.

517
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,666
NARRATOR: Thierry's
extraordinary habit

518
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,167
of filming everything

519
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,254
and locking the unwatched tapes
away in boxes

520
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,882
had its roots
in his childhood in France.

521
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,890
I lost my mother
when I was 11 years old,

522
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,352
and the day that I find out
about my mother,

523
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,645
I was at school.

524
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,022
I remember I was
in the playground,

525
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,024
and somebody come up,

526
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,444
and he says,
"Oh, you're laughing, eh?

527
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,362
You're laughing, eh?
You're laughing, eh?"

528
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,905
Like, behind the gate.

529
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,241
"Your mother is dead."
Like this.

530
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,453
And after, I was like...

531
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,206
I didn't know, in reality,
and after I went back to class,

532
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,126
and I was crying,
and I didn't know.

533
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,545
And from that things,

534
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,047
they took me away.

535
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,008
I never went home again.

536
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,762
I went to a cousin or something
outside of what happened,

537
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,555
not to see anything.

538
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:44,102
You know, they just took me away
from everything happened.

539
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,229
NARRATOR: The youngest
in a large family,

540
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,107
his mother's illness
had been kept from Thierry,

541
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,734
and after her death,

542
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,737
the sense that he had missed
such an important event

543
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,531
stayed with him.

544
00:26:56,657 --> 00:27:00,327
Later, as an adult
raising his own family,

545
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,412
Thierry became
increasingly compelled

546
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,958
by the need to record the people
and events around him.

547
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,421
You know, I felt like I should
capture everything on film,

548
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,507
because I felt like everything

549
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,300
that I would capture
at these moments,

550
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,803
any time in my life

551
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,390
would be the last time that
I would see it the same way.

552
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,268
It was like a need
to be captured.

553
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,813
I would make them live forever,

554
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:32,275
those moments, you know,
forever and ever.

555
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,611
Making a documentary,

556
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:39,616
it was like having the key
of getting all these people.

557
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,743
That's why
I kept following them,

558
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,789
following them,
following them.

559
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,500
And because I never made
a movie before

560
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,086
and I don't know how to stop...

561
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:56,091
and I don't know
how to stop...

562
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,592
I kept going.

565
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,563
NARRATOR:
As Thierry persevered

566
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,232
with his quest to capture
the world of street art

567
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,733
in its entirety,

568
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,695
the profile of the one artist
who eluded him

569
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,989
was about to become
bigger than ever.

570

He faced Israeli army fire
to pull off his latest stunt.

573
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,809
Subversive graffiti artist
Banksy, whose work...

574
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,313
NARRATOR: By targeting
the world's most notorious wall,

575
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,691
Banksy turned a spot
of hit-and-run vandalism

576
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:58,612
into an international
news event.

577
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,071
Now it seemed everyone

578
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,533
wanted to know the answer
to one question:

579
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,870
Who was Banksy?

580
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,876
His work seemed
to be everywhere,

581
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:17,130
but the artist himself
remained as elusive as ever.

582
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,930
He was, like,
the only one that I don't have,

583
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,974
and people
that used to be in street art,

584
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,895
they all tell you,
"Yeah, he doesn't have a phone,"

585
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,773
or they...
even if they do have it,

586
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,025
they wouldn't give it to me,
you know?

587
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,278
I didn't know what way that
I'm gonna get this person,

588
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,780
you know,

589
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:45,075
what angel was gonna bring me
to that person.

590
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,787
NARRATOR:
With no leads to go on,

591
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,582
Thierry was forced to accept
that he may never find a way

592
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:56,086
to the mysterious Englishman.

593
00:29:56,212 --> 00:30:00,757
And then, miraculously...

594
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,636
So I went to Los Angeles
at about spring 2006,

595
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,972
and when I got there,

596
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,640
the guy that
was supposed to be helping me

597
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,141
got turned back
at immigration,

598
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:13,061
so I rang the only person I knew
in Los Angeles

599
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,689
and asked them
if they could help me,

600
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,108
and they said,
"Well, there's this French guy

601
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,110
"who's a cousin
of Space Invader,

"and he knows where
all the best walls are in L.A.

603
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,741
He can help you out."

604
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,577
I was in downtown
Los Angeles one day.

605
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:33,373
My phone rings.

606
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,666
"Hello?"

607
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,419
"Hello, this is Shepard Fairey.

608
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,004
How are you doing, Thierry?"

609
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,463
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

610
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,132
"Yeah, do you have any walls?

611
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:46,052
Because I have Banksy here,
and I would like"...

612
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,179
And I said, "What?
You have who?"

613
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,639
I'm like, "Uh..."

614
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,766
"Yeah, yeah,
there is Banksy here, and"...

615
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,436
I'm like, "Where...are...you?"

I stay.

619
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,570
I vrrr...
I go through red light.

620
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,780
[engine rumbling]

621
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,574
I was driving like crazy.

622
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,285
I mean, I'm lucky
I didn't get caught that day.

623
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,329
[tires screeching]

624
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,831
So this guy shows up

625
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,791
looking like something
out of the 1860s,

626
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,961
with these, like,
huge sideburns, sweating,

627
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,463
telling me
he could do anything;

628
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,797
he could take me anywhere;

629
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,716
he could get me
whatever I wanted;

630
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,885
he could fix it all up.

631
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:30,305
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like, what do you want?

632
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,639
"Anything you want.

633
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:32,974
What do you want?"

634
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,309
He said,
"Have you got a phone?"

635
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,727
And I said no,

636
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,228
so he went to a phone shop
over the road

637
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,521
and bought me a phone,

638
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,898
and he bought $100 worth
of credit

639
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,316
and punched his number in
and said,

640
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,734
"Right, this is my number.

641
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,653
You call me.
I have everything you need."

642
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,447
"I drive you
if you need to go anywhere.

643
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,366
"I'll take care of you,
whatever, whatever.

644
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,077
"I'll be your driver.

645
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,205
"I'm not doing anything.
"I'm not doing anything.

646
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:59,709
I'm not doing anything
at any time."

647
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,252
So on the understanding

648
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,129
that he would just help me
make some paintings,

649
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,049
we went out that evening.

NARRATOR:
Circumstances had conspired

651
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,553
to bring Thierry face-to-face

652
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,056
with the notoriously
secretive artist,

653
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,892
and fate remained
on Thierry's side

654
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,977
when he got his camera out.

655
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:21,564
Well, I'd never let anybody
film anything before,

656
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,025
but I said he could film me,

657
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,738
but only my hands,
from behind,

658
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,492
and on condition that I could
check the tapes afterwards.

[dramatic choral music]

660
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:42,460
It was magic that this person
let me film, you know?

661
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:48,842
I felt like I had the piece
that will finish the puzzle.

662
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:55,431
It was like getting something
in the daylight

663
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,727
that what you see
in the night light.

664
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,938
He was even more
than I expected.

665
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,275
I mean, he was, like,
just incredible.

666
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,568
He was cool.

667
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,237
He was...

you know, he's really
like what he represent.

You know, he's really, like...

672
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,335
I think he's really, like...

673
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,962
I really liked him.

NARRATOR: For the rest
of Banksy's stay,

676
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,639
Thierry made himself
indispensable,

677
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,309
leading the artist to some
of the best painting spots

678
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,685
in the city.

was the perfect host

if you're a graffiti rat
and you're miles from home.

682
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,863
He had no fear.

683
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,700
He wanted to keep going
all night long,

684
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,619
and he had a massive larder.

NARRATOR: A few weeks after
their chance encounter in L.A.,

688
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,680
Banksy invited Thierry
to England.

[metallic clanging]

00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,850
I always avoided cameras,

00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:26,147
'cause what I do is
in a bit of a legal gray area,

692
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,608
but I brought Thierry
over to London

693
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,026
because it seemed
like a good idea:

694
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,819
start videoing the work.

695
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,113
I mean, we had to,
'cause, you know,

696
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,741

to disappear the next day.

700
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,168
was horrified
by the sudden appearance

701
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,879
of this camera-happy Frenchman.

702
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,798
The first time that Thierry
was filming Banksy,

703
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,383
I was like,
"What the fuck is going on?"

704
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,427
I thought, you know, that nobody
was allowed to do this.

705
00:34:56,553 --> 00:35:00,223
I thought it was
a big breach of security.

706
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:01,683
Being the man of mystery

707
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,935
and being filmed
at the same time

708
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,436
is a slight oxymoron,
I think.

709
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,730
It's a very dangerous thing.

710
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,774
All the people
who was working with him,

711
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,234
they didn't understand.

712
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,152
They look at me like,
"Who is this?

713
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,862
Who is this guy?"

714
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,656
You know,
"What is he gonna do to us?"

715
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,907
You know?

716
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,576
And he didn't care whatsoever.

717
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,911
Two, three.

718
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,039
[motorcycle engine buzzing]

719
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,420
I guess Thierry
showed up at a time

720
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,298
when I realized
that the reaction to this stuff

721
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:37,468
was, you know, one of the most
interesting things about it,

722
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,429
because for me, it's
an important part of the job

723
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,973
to run away
as soon as we've done it,

724
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,349
but at least with Thierry,

725
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,059
we had someone hanging round
afterwards

726
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,978
who could capture some of it.

727
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:50,857
This is when I saw
that he was, like, a legend.

728
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:55,445
He was like kind of
a Robin Hood or something.

729
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,363
- You know Banksy?
- Yeah.

730
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,906
- You know Banksy?
- I don't know.

731
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,325
I mean, I heard about him.

732
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,619
He does
very, very good graffiti.

733
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,455
Looks a bit like Banksy,

734
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:09,167
but I know he's doing a bit more
installations at the moment.

735
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,085
I like it.
I like it.

736
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,545
What do you think of it?

737
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:19,135
Someone is annoyed
with BT telephones.

738
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,180
Yeah, we were, you know,
laughing like trains

739
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,307
at all this stuff
he got out of it.

740
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,602
So yeah, he proved his worth
on that project,

741
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,020
brought something to it

742
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,314
that we would never have had
otherwise.

743
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,570
NARRATOR: Over the rest
of his time in London,

744
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,864
Banksy took Thierry everywhere,

745
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,201
even allowing him to film
inside his studio

746
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:47,163
as he prepared
for his first big American show.

747
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,248
He opened his door to me,

748
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:54,128
and it was magic
kind of way.

749
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,423
You ask the question,
"Why me?" in the end.

750
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,219
"Why?"

751
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,304
I think maybe Thierry

752
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,307
was like a bit of a release
for me, you know?

753
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,892
Having spent years

754
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,145
of trying to keep everything
completely under wraps,

755
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,940
maybe I needed
to trust somebody.

756
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:18,444
I mean, I guess part
of the power of Thierry

757
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,114
is this unlikely...

758
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,032
the unlikeliness of it.

759
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,659
Yeah, you know?

760
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,869
I guess he became my friend.

761
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,586
Oh.

762
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,004
It's all money.

763
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,257
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

764
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,800
It is real?

765
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,266
It's Lady Di
instead of the queen.

766
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,600
It's so cool.

767
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,185
I made £1 million worth,

768
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,981
and I was gonna throw it
off a building, just like...

769
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,315
But I took some out,

770
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,610
and I handed some out
first of all,

771
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,987
and people spent them,

772
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,655
and people were like,
"Oh, yeah.

773
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,740
Two beers.
A couple beers."

774
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,200
Nobody noticed,

775
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,744
because when you
got them like this,

776
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,913
you can actually spend them.

777
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,457
And they won't know.

778
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,750
And when that happened,
it was like, "Holy shit.

779
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:19,464
We just... we just forged
a million quid."

780
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,509
And obviously, for that,
you go to jail for ten years.

781
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,927
So I have them up here,

782
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,971
but I don't know
what to do with them.

783
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,307
You find it here?

784
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,641
I made it.

785
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,018
Wow, you made this?

786
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,187
For fuck's sake,
I printed it.

787
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,856
Oh, my God.

788
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,944
NARRATOR: Back in L.A.,

789
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,363
Thierry struggled
to keep himself entertained

790
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,158
after the high
of his scoop with Banksy.

791
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,287
# If I don't get
my i-i-i-ice cream #

792
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,580
I'm like a bird.

793
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:53,873
I always thought of that.

794
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,291
I'm like a bird.

795
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,293
I never want to be
locked down anywhere.

796
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,838
I like to fly
from one artist to another.

797
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,798
You know,
that's the way that I live,

798
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,634
one life to another.

799
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,135
You know, I like to be free.

800
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,679
You know,
my wife was worried

801
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,265
because, you know,
bill to pays,

802
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,935
and me, the only thing
I wanted to do

803
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:18,940
was, like, buy some tape
and go somewhere, you know?

804
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,359
[children chattering]

805
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,529
I wasn't worried,
but I'm sure my wife

806
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:29,325
had a little problem
of sleeping sometime.

807
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,577
He was following the artists,

808
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,288
and he goes to here,
he goes there,

809
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,581
and I worry.

810
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,832
I worry for my kids.

811
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,209
I worry for everybody,
actually,

812
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,502
but he doesn't care.

813
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,836
He just goes and does.

814
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,630
And he forgets
he comes with a family.

815
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,675
You know, just...
we need him.

816

[car door closes]

00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,220

Bye!

819
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,640
I love you!

[car door chiming]

821
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,564
NARRATOR: For five years,

822
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,399
Thierry's family
had learned to cope

823
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,150
with his endless trips away,

824
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,903
but now there was
a new development

825
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,196
taking up his time.

826
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,698
The way it started,

827
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,617
I took picture
of me holding a camera,

828
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,870
and I asked somebody
to illustrate it,

829
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:19,000
and I liked it,
so I made a small sticker.

830
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:22,044
And I made it transparent,
you know,

831
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,046
because I never solid,
transparent.

832
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,718
A transparent looked
like a little stencil in a way.

833
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,178
And I liked it,
so I went to Kinko's,

834
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:33,931
because I learned from "Obey"
and things like this,

835
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,517
and I started making
that photocopy...

836
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:40,730
I don't know... 30 feet
by 40 feet high, you know?

837
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:47,612
And I went at 10:00 at night

838
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:51,365
until 8:00 in the morning,

839
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,826
and I made, like,
this image giant

840
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,494
of me with the camera.

841
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:01,584
That big image, I thought
it was kind of cool.

842
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,629
[jaunty accordion music]

843
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,297
And I start doing it

844
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,925
kind of the same story
of "Obey,"

845
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:15,306
following the movement
of street art.

846
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,643
I start to make copies,
make it bigger,

847
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,229
and starting to put it
all around the city.

848
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:25,608
The enjoyment
of taking the glue

00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,862
I was, like, addict.

851
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:35,785
It was like a spiral,
and I just fall in it.

852
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,787
I just fall in the spiral.
"Aaaah!"

853
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,539
I fall, like, making the art.

854

NARRATOR: A few months after
Thierry had seen him in London,

856
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,135
Banksy returned to Los Angeles.

857
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,804
He had arrived with his crew

858
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,473
to transform
a large run-down warehouse

859
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,352
into the venue for
his first major U.S. exhibition,

860
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,646
"Barely Legal."

861
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,940
Oh, my God.

862
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,775
It's really big.

863
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,529
It is giant.

864
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,239
Trippy.

865
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,866
It's the biggest elephant
I ever saw in my life.

866
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,203
Look at this.
It's really big.

867
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,458
NARRATOR: But Banksy
had more on his mind

868
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,502
than getting
the show's surprise guest

869
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,380
ready for her big moment.

870
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,425
[grim music]

871
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,927
We were right in the middle
of putting the show together,

872
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,595
and I had this idea

873
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:39,140
to make a piece
about Guantánamo Bay

874
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,225
and the detention
of all these terror suspects,

875
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,019
so I took Thierry with me,

876
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:47,398
and we didn't tell
anyone else about it,

877
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:52,236
and we just shot off, like,
the morning before the show.

878
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,654
I came, picked him up.

879
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,489
Just me and him.

880
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,701
You know, I'm kind of excited
I'm going to Disneyland.

882
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,665
In just a few moments,
we will begin our trip...

883
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,251
It was around the anniversary
of September the 11th,

884
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,046
so it was a pretty
high-temper moment.

885
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:15,217
Can I get two adults
just for Disneyland, please?

886
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,804
$2 is your change,
and your two Disneyland tickets.

887
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,140
Is Mickey Mouse
gonna be there today?

888
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,933
Yes, Mickey Mouse
will be there.

889
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,935
You go to Toontown,
and he's waiting for you guys.

890
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,228
Okay?

891
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,566
# #

892
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,610
So we've been wandering around
the park for a while,

893
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:36,280
and then there's this sign
with a picture of a camera on it

894
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,699
saying,
"This will be a great place

895
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,534
to take your souvenir photo."

896
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,289
So that obviously seemed
like the best place to put him.

897
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,375
He's like, "This is
where I'm gonna do it."

898
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:49,752
And I'm like, "Okay."

899
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,129
He goes in the corner

900
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:57,885
and starting to blow up,
through a pump, a doll.

901
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,054
Tssh, tssh, tssh, tssh.

902
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,809
And he goes,
and he start... put it in.

903
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:07,812
[frenetic bongo music]

904
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:15,945
# #

905
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,281
And he put it.

906
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,450
He attached it
to the metal bars,

907
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,327
and he takes time,

908
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,579
and it was kind of suspense,

909
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,081
because, you know,
it's Disneyland.

910
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,916
There is...
people comes.

911
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:36,465
# #

912
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,593
[people on ride screaming]

913
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,264
And then I walked off
one way

914
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,100
and left Thierry there
filming it.

915
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,810
And me, I'm filming,
taking pictures...

916
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,395
[imitating
camera shutter snapping]

917
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,063
Because it's like,
you know...

918
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,731
it's, like, the moment
that I'm here for.

919
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,442
[people on ride screaming]

920
00:44:56,945 --> 00:45:00,656
In one moment,
they stopped the train.

921
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,825
Sorry for the holdup, folks.

922
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,118
Ladies and gentlemen,

923
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,494
may I have your attention,
please?

924
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,121
All of our trains are stopped.

925
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,043
We start to see
some people coming in,

926
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,546
security and people like this,

927
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:20,009
but not dressed like security,
but look like, you know,

928
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,677
like people who's not
at Disneyland

929
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,178
to have fun, you know?

930
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:26,682
So I'm starting to feel scared.

931
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,852
I'm walking to leave.

932
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:33,689
One guy is behind me;
two guys behind me;

933
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:37,359
three guys behind me;
four guys behind me.

934
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,111
And one moment,

935
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,863
pom, pom,
pom, pom, pom,

936
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,032
from every corner,
they were on me.

937
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,533
I went in the toilet
to change my hat.

938
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,826
I changed my shirt.

939
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,369
Then I went out,

940
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,455
and I went on the,
like, Indiana Jones ride,

941
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,081
and then
when I came off that,

942
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,375
I tried calling Thierry,
didn't get any answer,

943
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:57,421
so then I went
on Pirates of the Caribbean.

944
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,382
[ominous music]

945
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,385
NARRATOR: While Banksy
went on the rides,

946
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,554
Thierry was being introduced

947
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,725
to a very different side
of the Magic Kingdom.

948
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,060
So they put me in a seat.

949
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:16,482
There is a guy here,
a guy there...

950
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:22,738
and they said, "You are
in big, big, big trouble."

951
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,950
So they actually started
shutting down parts of the park.

952
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:28,160
There was, like, walkie-talkies
crackling everywhere,

953
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,245
and all of sudden,

954
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,290
it seemed to be a very,
very serious thing indeed.

955
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,961
# #

956
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,004
NARRATOR:
Held in an interrogation room,

957
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,966
Thierry was questioned
by Disney's security people

958
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:47,096
and one man who claimed
he was from the FBI.

959
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,766
I'm like, "I don't know
what you have on me.

960
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:53,769
"I was there.

961
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,312
"You're, like, telling me

962
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,439
"that I have something to do
with this person.

963
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,401
"I don't have anything to do
with this person.

964
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,027
"I don't have anything
to do with it.

965
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,989
"I mean, it's...
I was there at the wrong time

966
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:07,199
"at the wrong moment,
you know.

967
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,326
I was taking pictures,"
and things like this.

968
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,161
And he says, "Did you take
a lot of pictures?"

969
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,163
I said,
"No, I took one picture,"

970
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,790
and things like this,

971
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:21,088
"but I even delete it
when you guys came to me."

972
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,799
No... the camera
is on the table.

973
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,802
It's full of pictures,

974
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,470
and I'm telling that
to the guy.

975
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,931
So I'm lying completely.

976
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,101
The only thing he has to do
is to turn on that camera.

977
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,645
So I tried Thierry again,
and this time he answered,

978
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,105
and I said, "Where are you?"

979
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,649
And he said,
"Hello, my chéri,"

980
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,818
and, "How are you,
my darling?"

981
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,237
and, "How are the children?"

982
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,489
And I thought, "Yeah."

983
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,325
At that point, I thought
I'd better leave the park.

984
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:52,327
He's like, "Okay,
show me the pictures."

985
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,497
I take the camera...
I take him...

986
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,750
I said, "Look."

987
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:03,338
I put it on, I go...
I go on Menu right away,

988
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,507
I go on Delete,
and I go, "Pffft!"

989
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,342
And the thing goes,
"Vvvvt!"

990
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,635
And I go, "Pom!"

991
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,012
I put it down, and I said,

992
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,056
"I don't have
any picture on him,

993
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:14,349
"and I don't have any proof
on you.

994
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:15,851
"I don't have nothing
with you guys,

995
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,853
"and I don't have nothing
with this guy,

996
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,521
because I don't know
who it is."

997
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,858
Like this, I don't...
you know, I'm clear.

998
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:26,737
NARRATOR: After four hours
of questioning,

999
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,823
with no evidence to hold him,

1000
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,910
Thierry was released.

1001
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,703
So after Thierry
withstood interrogation

1002
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,706
from the entire Mickey Mouse
security team...

1003
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:43,170
didn't fold,
didn't buckle;

1004
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:46,840
he did a really good job of
stashing the tape in his sock...

1005
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:50,010
I guess I trusted Thierry
with everything.

1006
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,262
He was my guy after that.

1007
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,555
Hey, man.
How are you?

1008
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,848
Good.
How are you doing?

1009
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,433
Yeah, yeah.

1010
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,895
NARRATOR: The day after
his close shave with Disneyland,

1011
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,023
Thierry,
along with half of Hollywood.

1012
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:08,028
Was at the opening party
for Banksy's show.

1013
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,030
It was an even bigger star,
however,

1014
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,991
who provoked
the real sensation.

1015
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:16,036
Banksy had camouflaged
his rented elephant

1016
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,248
with 12 liters
of children's face paint

1017
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:22,126
in an apparent statement
about how easy it is

1018
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,419
to ignore the things
right in front of us.

1019
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:28,006
But the American news media
could only see

1020
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,259
what was
right in front of them

1021
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:33,470
and came flocking to report
on the elephant in the room.

1022
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,763
I'm Angie Crouch.

1023
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,098
Coming up at 5:30,

1024
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,891
animal rights activists
are outraged

1025
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,102
over an art exhibit involving
a live painted elephant.

1026
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,645
"There's an elephant
in the room,

1027
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,605
a problem
that we never talk about,"

1028
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,941
says this small white card
given to visitors...

1029
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,651
What's the matter?

1030
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,069
Just say when.

1031
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,280
Um, you already
got your interview,

1032
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,739
so can you...

1033
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,201
NARRATOR:
The magical combination

1034
00:49:56,327 --> 00:50:00,956
of controversy, celebrity,
and the painted elephant

1035
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,459
turned the show into an event.

1036
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,629
[crowd chattering]

1037
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,965
We had the sort of attendance
that you get for a decent show

1038
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,633
at the Museum of Modern Art
or something,

1039
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:15,345
only over three days
and in skid row.

1040
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,265
So I think a lot of the people
in the art world

1041
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:24,271
were a little bit confused as to
how that would happen, you know?

1042
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,648
As were we, to be honest.

1043
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,400
NARRATOR: "Barely Legal"

1044
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,944
marked the point
at which street art

1045
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,447
was forced into the spotlight,

1046
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:37,242
attracting sudden interest
from the art establishment.

1047
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,911
In the months that followed,

1048
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:43,373
prices for work by
leading street artists rocketed,

1049
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,459
with collectors
rushing to get in

1050
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,836
on this exciting new market.

1051
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,839
Lot number 33A,
Banksy,

1052
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,591
the vandalized phone box.

1053
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,344
And I'll start the bid
at $100,000.

1054
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,346
$110,000, $120,000,

1055
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,723
$130,000, $140,000...

1056
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:03,101
NARRATOR: Street art had become
a white-hot commodity.

1057
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:06,647
Now no serious
contemporary art collection

1058
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:09,900
would be complete
without a Banksy.

1059
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:13,362
For $550,000.

1060
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,696
[gavel bangs]

1061
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,448
Those little bunnies
are Warhols.

1062
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,325
That's a Lichtenstein.

1063
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,994
And then that's Keith Haring,
who I'm not a fan of.

1064
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,288
The Andy Warhol "Mao" is
the first thing I ever bought.

1065
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,290
I was, like, 20 years old,
and I put it on layaway,

1066
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,875
and it's, you know,
the smaller "Mao."

1067
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,502
And it's beautiful.

1068
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:32,589
I mean, it's beautiful,
but it's in the closet.

1069
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,717
Oh, yeah, here's the Ba...
here's a big Banksy.

1070
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,177
That one's
from the show in L.A.

1071
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,221
I saw Banksy, and I thought
he was a genius,

1072
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,807
and every person I told
about him bought something,

1073
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:45,143
like people who have Picassos
and, you know, Mondrians

1074
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,645
and Paul Klee and...

1075
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,146
God, I don't even know
who else.

1076
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,357
They have...
I mean, serious collections.

1077
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,818
So then these
famous auction houses,

1078
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:55,279
all of a sudden,
they were selling street art,

1079
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:58,073
and everything
was getting a bit crazier,

1080
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,075
and suddenly, it had all become
about the money,

1081
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,827
but it never was
about the money.

1082
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,912
So I said to Thierry,

1083
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,164
"Right, you have the footage.

1084
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,542
"You can tell the real story
of what this art is about.

1085
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:09,876
"It's not about the hype.

1086
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,169
"It's not about the money.

1087
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,462
"Now is the time.

1088
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,089
You need to get your film out."

1089
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:22,431
NARRATOR: Banksy had put Thierry
well and truly on the spot.

1090
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:24,016
He now had to devise a way

1091
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:28,228
to transform thousands of hours
of unwatched tapes

1092
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,938
into the epic documentary

1093
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,359
he had been promising
everyone for so long.

1094
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,823
So we start working
in the back of my house,

1095
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,492
doing some editing.

1096
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,329
It was, like, kind of a vision
that I saw.

1097
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,664
And the way that I made it,

1098
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:51,960
I really did it
kind of the way,

1099
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,213
you know, like,
when you have a bucket

1100
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,466
and you have a lot of numbers

1101
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:58,967
and you said...

1102
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,927
you look in one,
and you open,

1103
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:03,096
and you said,
"This is the number 12."

1104
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,266
This is the way that I made it,
kind of way.

1105
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,019
I used to... couple tape here,
couple tape here,

1106
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,146
couple tape here,
couple tape here,

1107
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,773
take a little piece over here,

1108
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,649
a little piece of that,
a little piece of that,

1109
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,485
and this is the way
that I made it.

1110
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,071
Okay, now let's go back
a little bit

1111
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,114
and do a review,
because...

1112
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,366
Like, what I say:

1113
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,159
I'm playing chess.

1114
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:25,994
I don't know how to play chess,

1115
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,082
but life is a chess game
for me.

1116
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:36,505
[birds chirping]

1117
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:40,258
[springs creaking repeatedly]

1118
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:45,180
NARRATOR: The following spring,
Thierry returned to England.

1119
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,640
I'm gonna do a flip.

1120
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,016
NARRATOR:
All his years of filming

1121
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,851
and thousands of hours
of material

1122
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,854
had been crafted
into a 90-minute film

1123
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,859
with the intriguing title
Life Remote Control.

1124
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,569
He called up,
and he came to London

1125
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,446
because he said
he'd nearly finished the film,

1126
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,616
and he came round my house
and put the DVD on,

1127
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,951
and he said, "This is it.

1128
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,244
It's nearly finished."

1129
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,497
[loud banging]

1130
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:15,585
[record scratching]

1131
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,588
[bizarre percussive cacophony]

1132
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:26,721
# #

1133
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,869
Um...
you know,

1134
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,620
it was at that point
that I realized

1135
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,290
that maybe Thierry
wasn't actually a filmmaker

1136
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:56,751
and he was maybe just someone
with mental problems

1137
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,296
who happened to have a camera.

1138
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,965
[searing drone]

1139
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,258
[gunshots]

1140
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,511
It just seemed to go on and on.

1141
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,263
It was an hour and a half

1142
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:12,392
of unwatchable
nightmare trailers,

1143
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,644
essentially like somebody
with a short attention span

1144
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,062
with a remote control

1145
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:19,649
flicking through a cable box
of 900 channels.

1146
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,151
Peace to the whole world.

1147
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:22,444
[static hissing]

1148
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,778
[steel drums clanging]

1149
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,781
[jazzy piano music]

1150
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,617
You have to keep an eye
on the big picture.

1151
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,785
I told him I'd never seen
anything like it,

1152
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:32,287
and I wasn't lying about that.

1153
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,331
Yeah, I was faced
with that terrible thing

1154
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,666
when somebody
shows you their work

1155
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,127
and everything about it
is shit

1156
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,963
so you don't really know
where to start.

1157
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,217
He's like, "It's good,"
you know?

1158
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:48,345
"It's good," you know?
"It's good."

1159
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,431
I mean, the thing is

1160
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,475
that Thierry had
all this amazing footage

1161
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,143
of all this stuff that,
you know,

1162
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,686
in this tiny world
of street art,

1163
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,188
was kind of important,

1164
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,315
and it was
never gonna happen again.

1165
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,442
So it felt right
to at least make something

1166
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,819
that you could actually watch
about it.

1167
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,738
So I thought, you know,
maybe I could have a go.

1168
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,698
I mean, I don't know
how to make a film,

1169
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,867
but obviously,
that hadn't stopped Thierry,

1170
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,078
but I needed him
out of the way

1171
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,288
in order to do it,
so I said,

1172
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,415
"Why don't you go and put up
some more of your posters

1173
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:20,794
"and make some art,
you know, have a little show,

1174
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,673
invite a few people,
get some bottles of wine?"

1175
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,925
And off he went
back to Los Angeles,

1176
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,343
and he left me
with the tapes.

1177
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,058
NARRATOR: Thierry returned home
to Los Angeles

1178
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:39,354
full of enthusiasm for
his unexpected new assignment.

1179
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,897
Banksy had just given him

1180
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,942
what he considered
to be a direct order:

1181
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,195
to put down his camera

1182
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,615
and become
a street artist himself.

1183
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,701
I think he put me
into street art

1184
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,245
because I like what he did.

1185
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,915
Me, as respecting him,
you know,

1186
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,585
having him to push you
to do street art,

1187
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:04,879
I just went and, like...
it was not even a push.

1188
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:08,049
It was, like, an enjoyment
to get pushed, you know.

1189
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,845
NARRATOR: So now, using the
formula he had seen work so well

1190
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:14,723
for the world's
biggest street artists,

1191
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:18,226
Thierry set about creating
his own alter ego

1192
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,021
and iconic visual style.

1193
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:32,866
I came up with the idea
that the whole movement of art

1194
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:35,785
is all about brainwashing.

1195
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:39,247
"Obey" is about brainwashing.

1196
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:43,126
Banksy's about brainwashing.

1197
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,713
So I use MBW,

1198
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,966
and I am Mr. Brainwash.

1199
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:56,306
NARRATOR: But Mr. Brainwash
had some catching up to do.

1200
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,516
Many of the biggest names
in the street art world

1201
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,268
had moved on to gallery shows,

1202
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,936
so Thierry now started

1203
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:06,524
to plan the next phase
of his artistic career.

1204
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:08,652
[gasps]

1205
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,072
Fuck!

1206
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,948
Film! Film!
Come closer.

1207
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,909
Look at the pink.

1208
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:28,630
[suspenseful orchestral music]

1209
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:34,177
# #

1210
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,262
NARRATOR: When Banksy
had suggested to Thierry

1211
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,181
that he make some art,

1212
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:42,018
he could never have imagined
just how far things would go.

1213
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,561
We have a mountain of...

1214
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:45,647
NARRATOR: Thierry had now
remortgaged his business

1215
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,440
and sold off whatever he could

1216
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,528
to invest in a huge studio,
screen-printing equipment,

1217
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:55,240
and a full-time staff
capable of producing MBW pieces

1218
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,367
on a commercial scale.

1219
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,870
Just wait one second.
Okay.

1220
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,288
No.

1221
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:05,709
Yes.
Yes.

1222
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,502
When you have Damien Hirst,

1223
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:13,591
one of the most expensive
artists in our generation today,

1224
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,136
and having 100 people
working for him,

1225
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:21,015
do you think that he's gonna
come and cut little papers

1226
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:22,308
and start to glue?

1227
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:23,601
No.

1228
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,186
I'm not gonna make it.

1229
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,564
I'm just gonna come
with the idea and say,

1230
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:32,068
"This is what I want,
and I want this like that."

1231
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:37,866
Thierry's creative process,
I guess,

1232
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:41,077
he's inspired by other things.

1233
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,122
I guess who isn't inspired
by other things?

1234
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,373
We have, like...
look at this.

1235
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,000
Like, he goes, and he, like...

1236
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:50,044
four different-color Post-its
in here.

1237
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:51,921
That means... no, five,
I think.

1238
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,090
So he went through this book
four or five times

1239
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,800
and, like, selected
different pictures,

1240
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,469
wrote notes,

1241
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,472
and they're all in, like,
fairly bad English.

1242
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:03,433
Thierry goes through the books.

1243
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:05,268
He finds the paintings
that he likes,

1244
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:07,854
and he comes up with the ideas
on what to change them,

1245
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,149
and we scan the image,

1246
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,067
and then we Photoshop.

1247
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,444
This one is Elvis.

1248
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:17,071
It's, like,
a piece that I made.

1249
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:20,825
It's, like, I changed Elvis.

1250
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,911
He had a guitar,

1251
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:26,581
and I put in a toy
from Fisher-Price.

1252
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,752
You know, a toy
from Fisher-Price,

1253
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:35,048
and this piece called
"Don't Be Cruel."

1254
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,091
And this is what I create.

1255
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,594
It's, like, to trying
to do some lines

1256
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,348
that,
when you're close to it,

1257
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,141
when you're
really close to it,

1258
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,768
you just see lines.

1259
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,228
Any kind of people,

1260
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:49,979
they come to the market,
and what they see?

1261
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,272
Bar code.

1262
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,565
They come to the thing,

1263
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:53,858
so they leave with it.

1264
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,485
They brainwash.

1265
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,780
That's why I call myself
Mr. Brainwash.

1266
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:02,784
It's because everything
that I do

1267
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,912
somewhere brainwash your face.

1268
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,997
This is one piece
that I really like,

1269
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,290
kind of way,

1270
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:17,715
an it says, "Bat Papi, 1893."

1271
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,008
It's before Batman.

1272
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,802
It's Bat Papi.

1273
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:24,514
You know, the papi,
it's the father of...

1274
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,057
the grandfather of Batman.

1275
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,475
You know?

1276
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,228
That's who started,
you know?

1277
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,480
NARRATOR:
While most artists

1278
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,774
work their way up
from small beginnings,

1279
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,986
Thierry was determined
that Mr. Brainwash

1280
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,780
would arrive with a bang.

1281
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:56,296
The former CBS studio complex
covering 15,000 square feet

1282
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:57,547
in the heart of old Hollywood

1283
01:01:57,673 --> 01:01:59,173
had lain empty
for almost a year

1284
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,927
until Thierry decided
it would make the perfect venue

1285
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:09,017
for his debut show,
"Life is Beautiful."

1286
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:11,561
I didn't want
to disappoint Banksy.

1287
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:15,231
I wanted to try
to do something big.

1288
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:24,032
In the end, it's gonna become,
like, a big space

1289
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:26,117
with pictures all around.

1290
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,661
I want to make it
more like a show.

1291
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,371
Like, there is
a park amusement;

1292
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,874
I'm making it
an art amusement.

1293
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,877
You know, I change "park"
to "art."

1294
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:40,173
NARRATOR: Thierry's plan was
to emulate Banksy's L.A. show

1295
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,216
by transforming
the cavernous space

1296
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:46,054
into a street art spectacular
filled not just with paintings

1297
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,349
but sculptures
and installations too.

1298
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:53,019
And if he didn't know how to do
any of these things himself,

1299
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:56,356
he could always employ people
who did.

1300
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:59,400
I answered a nondescript ad

1301
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:07,575
looking for sculptors or artists
who could work in papier-mâché.

1302
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,244
He said he just needed
some things built

1303
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:11,871
and he wanted to know
if I could build him

1304
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,373
an eight-foot-tall
spray paint can,

1305
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,041
and I said, "Absolutely."

1306
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:19,003
And he said, "Can you build me
a monster out of TVs?"

1307
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,546
and I said, "Sure."

1308
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,549
And then he actually
got us into the space

1309
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,218
and had us working
on a day rate

1310
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:29,806
so that he could kind of
keep coming up with projects

1311
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,849
and change 'em around.

1312
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,270
NARRATOR:
With a growing workforce

1313
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:39,023
and Thierry adding new projects
by the hour,

1314
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,858
the scale of his production

1315
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,944
was now running far ahead

1316
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:46,239
of the little show
Banksy had suggested.

1317
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:51,494
I was so much focused on it
that I put all my money in it.

1318
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,122
Everything that I owned,
I put it in it.

1319
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:57,166
I was refinancing the house.

1320
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:01,587
I was putting my life on...

1321
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:06,009
on the border of losing
everything that I own.

1322
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,139
NARRATOR: And just
when it seemed that the pressure

1323
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,391
couldn't get any more intense,

1324
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,976
and with his grand opening

1325
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,895
now set
for just three weeks away,

1326
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:20,481
disaster struck.

1327
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,774
# Go! #

1328
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,777
[hammering drum and bass music]

1329
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:32,910
# #

1330
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,664
So basically,
this is the... called...

1331
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,166
this bone's called
your metatarsal,

1332
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,667
and this is the fifth one.

1333
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,919
It's all the way
on the side of your foot.

1334
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:44,005
And you fractured it
right through here,

1335
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:46,340
and this piece has been
pulled back a little bit.

1336
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:48,051
- You see that?
- Yeah.

1337
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,305
NARRATOR:
Needing an operation,

1338
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,974
Thierry was ordered
to slow things down,

1339
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:00,271
and now, under the influence
of pain-numbing drugs,

1340
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,940
he at last glimpsed the enormity

1341
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:05,651
of the enterprise
he had embarked upon.

1342
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:15,244
It's just so much work to do,
prices, and...

1343
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,414
it's like being an artist
overnight.

1344
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,168
You know,
that's what's happening to me.

1345
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:23,461
You know?

1346
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,963
I'm nobody.

1347
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:31,803
I never did an exposition
in a gallery, really.

1348
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,014
I never show any work anywhere,

1349
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,891
and I'm doing this big show,

1350
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:42,480
and it's all... it's all
a make-up kind of way, you know?

1351
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,318
I mean, it was all starting
to sound a little bit crazy.

1352
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,945
These reports are coming back

1353
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:51,364
saying that Thierry
had found this huge warehouse

1354
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,074
and then he'd broken his leg

1355
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,576
and it was all kind of going
a little bit wrong.

1356
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,287
You know, it sounded like
he needed a little bit of help,

1357
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,040
so I rung a few people

1358
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,875
that I thought might be able
to help him out.

1359
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:05,002
Like, this room looks cool.

1360
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:06,254
This room looks interesting.

1361
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,589
This room looks almost done.

1362
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:13,678
If this room stayed like this,
that's cool, but...

1363
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:15,596
But that's one
out of four, five, six.

1364
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,932
That makes the rest
of the rooms look bad.

1365
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:20,268
Myself and my girlfriend, Sonja,
went down there,

1366
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,271
and we figured out
what he needed

1367
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:26,399
along with a few
of the show's other producers.

1368
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,527
We made lists
of what needed to happen.

1369
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,028
What's the capacity
of this place?

1370
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,864
I don't know.

1371
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,074
Capacity's approximately
gonna be, like, 750 to 800.

1372
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,367
Got it.

1373
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,660
What about getting...

1374
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,120
I was very curious how the hell

1375
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,831
he was actually gonna finish it
and pull it off

1376
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,624
and realized
he didn't have a clue

1377
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,294
of a lot of the final logistics
that needed to happen.

1378
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,171
Like I saw in Banksy's show,

1379
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:51,841
mostly, the people
came and came back.

1380
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,718
He'd seen people
do big art shows.

1381
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,344
He'd been to them
around the world.

1382
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,806
He figured, "I want
to do something just as great."

1383
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,224
And the insurance?

1384
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,851
The insurance,
we're taking care of.

1385
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,394
NARRATOR:
With Roger and the team

1386
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,522
now taking care of
the practical arrangements,

1387
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,608
Thierry was free to spend time

1388
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,610
selecting which
of his many pieces to include

1389
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:11,903
in the show.

1390
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,697
Valet parking,
or they just go?

1391
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,949
NARRATOR: But instead,
Thierry busied himself

1392
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,162
with a different concern
altogether...

1393
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:23,456
hype.

1394
01:07:23,582 --> 01:07:27,335
[quirky woodwind music]

1395
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,588
He asked me
to promote the show for him,

1396
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,466
to give him a quote
for a press release,

1397
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:36,302
to send it to my mailing list,
to post it on my website,

1398
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:40,264
and really, to validate
what he was doing.

1399
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,642
And I was uncomfortable
with that,

1400
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,227
but I said that I would do it.

1401
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,023
So then I got a phone call
from Thierry,

1402
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:52,235
or Mr. Brainwash,
as he was now calling himself,

1403
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:56,322
asking if I would give him
a quote to promote his show.

1404
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:58,532
And I didn't think
there was any harm in it,

1405
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:02,828
so I wrote him a sentence,
and I emailed it off.

1406
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,500
NARRATOR: But Banksy
could never have guessed

1407
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:10,378
what Thierry had in mind
for his modest contribution.

1408
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:18,511
# #

1409
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,431
So this is gonna be
like a jail.

1410
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,892
It's gonna have bars here.

1411
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,644
I'm gonna put
some more cans all the way...

1412
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,104
NARRATOR:
The endorsements

1413
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,856
were immediately picked up
by the media,

1414
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:33,859
and within days,
Thierry was being interviewed

1415
01:08:33,986 --> 01:08:36,654
by the editor of the city's
biggest listings magazine,

1416
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,572
L.A. Weekly.

1417
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,366
The only thing
I want to do in L.A.

1418
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:44,704
is to show that Los Angeles
can have great shows.

1419
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:48,249
You know, it's like
a revolution kind of way.

1420
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,919
NARRATOR: A few days later,
Los Angeles awoke

1421
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,090
to discover there was
a new star in town.

1422
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:59,760
MBW was front-page news.

1423
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,179
- Okay.
- "Life is Beautiful."

1424
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,682
NARRATOR: The L.A. Weekly
also reported

1425
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:07,101
Thierry's
promotional brain wave:

1426
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,478
the first 200 people
to turn up

1427
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:13,774
would be given a free,
one-of-a-kind screen print.

1428
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,235
Do you think that people
is gonna wait and wait

1429
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,821
for the 200 free posters
or no?

1430
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:21,782
NARRATOR: So now Thierry
had to come up with a way

1431
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,535
of turning
200 identical screen prints

1432
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:30,958
into unique, collectible
MBW originals.

1433
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,835
[spray paint can rattling]

1434
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:35,838
[spray paint can hissing]

1435
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,841
[bass-heavy rock music]

1436
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:46,974
# #

1437
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,313
NARRATOR:
With a crew of 20 people

1438
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,647
working around the clock,

1439
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:55,149
the building was at last

1440
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,653
beginning to resemble
an art gallery.

1441
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,698
But the walls remained bare

1442
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,034
because Thierry
still hadn't decided

1443
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,330
which paintings
to frame and hang.

1444
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:13,209
So how did you like
L.A. Weekly?

1445
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,086
NARRATOR: Following
all the press coverage,

1446
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:17,713
private collectors
had begun to inquire

1447
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:21,300
about snapping up
MBW pieces ahead of the opening,

1448
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:25,805
giving Thierry his first insight
into the value of his work.

1449
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:29,517
The Campbell's Soup
with multi-ply colors.

1450
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:30,851
Yeah, it's very nice,
this one.

1451
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,312
I would say $24,000.

1452
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,315
"Scarface," is it a big one?

1453
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,859
Okay, cela $30,000.

1454
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,737
Prepare me
some canned olive paint.

1455
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:43,072
Just listen to me.

1456
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:44,615
I mean, make them work
to do something.

1457
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,075
There is nothing to do there?

1458
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,828
There is nothing to do?

1459
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,540
It's like gold, you know?

1460
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:56,210
'Cause you spray,
and, "How much is it?"

1461
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:58,796
"$18,000.

1462
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,256
$12,000."

1463
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:13,394
NARRATOR:
With his big day now upon him,

1464
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,896
Mr. Brainwash
still had plenty to do,

1465
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,898
because it was only now,

1466
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,776
just eight hours
before the doors opened,

1467
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:23,028
that Thierry's paintings
finally arrived,

1468
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,738
framed and ready to hang,

1469
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:29,493
almost 200 pieces
in a riot of themes and styles.

1470
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,080
I have never seen someone
with so much goddamn art

1471
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,041
in one art show
in my entire life.

1472
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:38,419
I haven't seen group shows
with that much artwork.

1473
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,880
Whatever elves Thierry
had making that stuff

1474
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,715
did a good job.

1475
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,431
NARRATOR: Outside,
the first eager art fans

1476
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:53,267
were already starting to arrive.

1477
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,436
We're here to see
Mr. Brainwash, bro.

1478
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,646
He's holed in L.A.
right now, bro.

1479
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,523
He's up on every corner.

1480
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,816
Come on, guys!

1481
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,568
Let's make the show go on!

1482
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:03,861
[metallic thud]

1483
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,154
[mutters]
Fuck!

1484
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,447
NARRATOR: But inside,

1485
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,782
the pressure
was starting to show.

1486
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,784
Okay, okay,
there is one thing,

1487
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,286
one thing, one thing.

1488
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,622
We're gonna have a meeting.
One thing.

1489
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:17,208
Starting with...
starting now, this second,

1490
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,792
I'm running the show.

1491
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,962
You're not giving order
to anybody right now.

1492
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,297
I'm running the show.

1493
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:24,924
You listen to me.

1494
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,717
Okay?

1495
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,844
Anybody's listening to me now.

1496
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,513
Okay?
Okay?

1497
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,223
So now you follow me.

1498
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:35,559
You're coming with me.

1499
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:41,607
This oil painting,
do you know where is the two...

1500
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,150
the two-tone metal spray
over there?

1501
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,485
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1502
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,987
You take off the two.
You hang down.

1503
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,156
The right.
Right.

1504
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,741
- Right. This wall.
- This wall?

1505
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,034
This wall.

1506
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,327
Okay, you show me,

1507
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:54,620
and I'll tell you a pile...

1508
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,288
a pile good
or a pile not good.

1509
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,706
You too.

1510
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,417
This one, good.

1511
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,419
This one, I'm not sure.

1512
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:03,754
[speaks indistinctly]

1513
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,130
This one, good.

1514
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,635
NARRATOR: By mid-afternoon,

1515
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,429
a crowd of almost 2,000 people
had amassed

1516
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,848
for what was now
widely tipped to be

1517
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:19,186
the hottest art event
of the year.

1518
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:20,854
How'd you guys find out
about this event?

1519
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:22,314
L.A. Weekly.

1520
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,941
Do you guys think
you still have a shot

1521
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,276
at getting a print?

1522
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:26,694
Yes.

1523
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,028
I'm expecting to see a mixture

1524
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,446
of street art and pop art
together.

1525
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:30,739
Really interesting stuff.

1526
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,449
Very modern.

1527
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,994
No one's really done it
the way he's done it.

1528
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,870
You know, it's one
of those kind of things, man.

1529
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:38,205
I'm not quite sure
what I'm in for,

1530
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,707
but I'm excited about it.

1531
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,126
[hammer pounding]

1532
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:49,341
NARRATOR: But Thierry
was still finding distractions

1533
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,302
from the task in hand.

1534
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,886
Who are you,
and what do you do?

1535
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:55,973
I'm Mr. Brainwash.

1536
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,266
I was a filmmaker.

1537
01:13:57,392 --> 01:14:01,437
I mean, I am still a filmmaker,
and...

1538
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:04,398
and I start filming,
I felt,

1539
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,358
like, because I love art.

1540
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,486
[drill whirring]

1541
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,243
Sometimes in life,
you have to go... to go...

1542
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,536
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

1543
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,912
Wait.

1544
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,247
No, you've got to come
right now.

1545
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,707
Or things will turn bad.

1546
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,417
You have to make some decisions.

1547
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,377
The whole big room is empty.

1548
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,255
Okay, can they unroll
all the canvas?

1549
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,466
I've done it.

1550
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,384
Now it's those other big walls
opposite...

1551
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,470
Okay, I need you
to just to take oil painting

1552
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,804
and put them in the small room.

1553
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,097
Yes, but I've done it.

1554
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,766
Put them in any order
in the room.

1555
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,726
That's done.
It's the other big space.

1556
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:42,561
Just put them all like that.

1557
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:43,979
And I'll come and decide.

1558
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:47,107
- In the big space?
- Put them all out.

1559
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:50,653
And get the canvases rolled out
flat, and I'll come in a bit.

1560
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,237
Okay.

1561
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:54,406
It's okay.
I can do another three minutes.

1562
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,033
It's okay.

1563
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,244
NARRATOR: Eventually,
with only three hours left

1564
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:00,537
to get everything ready,

1565
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:02,206
the crew started

1566
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,209
putting the paintings
up on the walls themselves.

1567
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:07,586
I brought in three
of my staff members

Why does that one reoccur

that it was so many people;

He's kind of the rightful heir
to Andy Warhol, in a way.

1654

Andy Warhol made a statement
by repeating famous icons

until they became meaningless,

in the way that he did it.

# But do you know that tonight
the streets are ours? #

1740
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,374
# #

1741
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:54,673
# Tonight the streets are ours #

1742
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,259
# These lights in our hearts #

1743
01:24:57,385 --> 01:25:00,345
# They tell no lies #

1744
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:07,769
# And no one else can haunt me
the way that you can haunt me #

1745
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,523
# I need to know you want me #

1746
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:14,901
# I couldn't be without you #

1747
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:20,282
# And the light that shines
around you #

1748
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:27,372
# No, nothing ever mattered
more than my darling #

1749
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:32,585
# But tonight
the streets are ours #

1750
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:42,178
# #

1751
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:49,311
# Tonight the streets are ours #

1752
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:56,776
# These lights in our street
are ours #

1753
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:03,950
# Tonight the streets are ours #

1754
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,745
# These lights in our hearts #

1755
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,955
# They tell no lies #

1756
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,919
