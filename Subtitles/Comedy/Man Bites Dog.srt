1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,100
I've just finished ballasting the corpse

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,700
That means you fill it
with certain things because..

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,900
You may not be aware that a corpse
under water, swells up with air, see?

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,400
So it tends to float to the surface

5
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,400
You have to load it with ballast so it sinks.
You weight it with stones and other heavy stuff.

6
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,800
There's a ballast ratio for corpses...

7
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,400
3 times body weight for an average
adult like this victim

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
But for children and midgets
it's different.

9
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,400
Kids are lighter. So it's 4 times
body weight.

10
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
- What?
- Never had problems?

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,200
No. Midgets are heavier,
so you double the weight.

12
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,300
For old people multiply by 5...
Old bones are porous.

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,300
- Hi, Mom!
- Goodness gracious!

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,000
How's my little boy?

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,900
This is Mom, that's Grandma,
this is the store. This is were i grow up.

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
- Grandpa's not here?
- He's out.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
He'll be back soon.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,900
What time is it?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,500
Guess what...
- My Grandpa.

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,800
I've put up with her now
for 53 years!

21
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,200
Imagine it!
- Imagine the effort it took him?

22
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Guess who made the effort
me or him?

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,200
Hats off! I've put up
with her now for 53 years!

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,300
He was such a cheerful little boy.

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
Full of pranks,
and blond as a field of wheat!

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't tease me, Papa.
-Stop it or I'll cry!

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,300
You ruin everything.

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Benoit was such a delight.

29
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,100
-A good boy?
-A darling!

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
He was affectionate and sweet.
Laughing all the time, all the time.

31
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,700
What do you mean, "he was"?
He's not anymore?

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
You don't understand me, Papa!

33
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,100
How they bickered!

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Like cats and dogs!

35
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,800
Lights!

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I usually start the month with a postman.
I get up in the morning

37
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,300
and spend it pinching pensions.
At the same time this allows me

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
to locate old folks with money.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,600
What I avoid are young couples.
They stink of poverty.

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,400
It's unpleasant! But old folks
are loaded, that's for sure!

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,600
I've never seen an old pauper.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,900
Stingy, yes,
but paupers, never!

43
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,300
You watching me... or the kids?

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
they have guns like me.

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
Not bad at all,

46
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,400
these gadgets!

47
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,400
Give me one.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Go on and play.

49
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,000
Hehe...

50
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
No school today?

51
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,300
That's the trouble with women.
Sure I've been hurt before.

52
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,700
I gave them something,
they gave me something.
53
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,241
But there comes a time...

53
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
when you start to ask questions.
All on account of that little door.

54
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,300
In a couple,
the door has to stay open

55
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,200
And when it's open it's either
to bring new nourishment...

56
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,900
or it's to let you out.

57
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,700
Either you add a little seed and that seed
can be a baby, a good time or a holiday...

58
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Or you get out,
lock, stock and seed.

59
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,900
With women, you can't always tell
if the door's open

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,100
and if it's time to add a seed,

61
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,400
or get the hell out.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been hurt because I'd open the door wide,
and they shut it.

63
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Love leaves a trail of sulfur...

64
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,300
like some lingering smell.
As soon as you meet someone you smell it.

65
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Like when you take a leak
your fingers smell.

66
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,200
You have to wash them two or three times
so you can forget you peed.

67
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,100
Watch me, I'll show you a trick.

68
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,000
As a kid they called me
The Octopus.

69
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,100
Know why? Because i could make any
part of my body

70
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,900
...move on it's own.
I'll show you.

71
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,100
All by itself. Watch my nose.

72
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
Look.

73
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,500
Now my ears.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Watch closely.

75
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,100
See that? Look!
Now the right one.

76
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Now the left...
See?

77
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,700
I can make something else move,...

78
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,400
but that's not for the camera!

79
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Turn it off, you jerk!

80
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Got home okay last night?
No problem.

81
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,400
I figure you guys
must have been bushed.

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Throw the keys down?
Or are you coming down?

83
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
I'll throw the keys.

84
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,200
It's not the right key.

85
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,400
It's not this one.
Must be the other one.

86
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Look who's here! Benoit!

87
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,100
I'm so glad to see you!

88
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
What a surprise! How've you been?
-Fine, Jenny.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm here with a camera...
They're doing a thing on me.

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
-Do you mind?
-Not at all.

91
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Come in.
Don't stay out there.

92
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,500
-So what's new?
-I had a rough time locating you.
94
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:33,560
I thought you still lived at Sablon.

93
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,700
We were evicted by urban renewal.

94
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,900
-Here's were we wound up.
-Maurice gave me the address.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm so glad to see you!

96
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Goat anything to drink?
My throat is dry.

97
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,500
What will it be?
-Some of your brandy.

98
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,800
What about your friends?
-Ask them.

99
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,800
What'll it be?
-Something cold.

100
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
And you, sir?
-A beer for me.

101
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
-Brandy as well.
-Coming up!

102
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
That's my Jenny.
That's her, this is her world.

103
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,400
That's her in her prime,
when she was a beauty.

104
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
She's still a beauty.

105
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
That's when I met her.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,100
This is Jenny's bed.

107
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'll show you someting.

108
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,900
You can tan while you make love.

109
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
When you are through,
you've got a brown ass!

110
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Ever seen anything like it?
Bet not!

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,900
What nonsense!

112
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
Baloney, baloney,...

113
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,900
Jenny used to live, I told you she moved...
that's why we had trouble finding her.

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,900
She lived 30 years in the Sablon
district.

115
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Then some real estate developer...

116
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,800
...I can't remember the name,
but the hell with it...

117
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,700
decided just like that

118
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
to move in! Sure they could...
The law's on their side.

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,300
We didn't own the house.
Anyway, they raised holy hell,
threw everyone out

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,100
But it was the way
they went about it.

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,400
So, they told Jenny
to move out...

122
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
There was this little smart-ass,
a vilgar little jerk,

123
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,900
...who had the nerve, to speak
and behave rudely with Jenny.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,900
The Sablon may have got a face-lift

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,400
...but one guy's no longer
around to enjoy it.

126
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,000
It's only fair, if a member
of the family is wronged...

127
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,700
So I went and had a little talk
with that fella...

128
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,100
Answer it, he...

129
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,300
I'll call you back, sweets,
I'm still working.

130
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Talk to you in a sec...

131
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,300
Those bastards! A black night
watchman! What a dirty trick!

132
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,900
So you can't see him!
Who'd ever sink so low?

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
They'll stop at nothing!

134
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,000
Poor kid, born under the sun!

135
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,600
I bet he grew up under the baobabs,
and here he is on a work site!

136
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,100
It makes me sick.
They try to get away with murder!

137
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,800
It's like this cement. Hungarian
probably. Made to last temporarily

138
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,600
You can be sure they use
more sand then cement, too.

139
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,700
They pinch pennies,
then the wall crack!

140
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,900
The whole building crumbles!

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,700
I once buried two Arabs
in a wall over there...

142
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Facing Mekka, of course...
In two years their assholes will see daylight!

143
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Let's sink this Mubutu.
A handsome fella to boot.

144
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,700
But I'm warning you,
I won't touch him.

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,100
Why not?
-AIDS, Remy...

146
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,900
AIDS. Green Monkeys!

147
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Grab him by the galoshes,
but I won't touch him.

148
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,100
But why's he in yellow if he's in camouflage?
At least he had no dogs,...

149
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,700
usually they have a pack of curs. I hate them.
Blacks have a way with animals, you know.

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's a fact.
They know how to talk to them.

151
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,700
Here's our golden opportunity.

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
To see if that legend
about their size is true.

153
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Remy, pull his pants down.

154
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,900
We'll know in a jiffy.

155
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
Good Lord!

156
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
He's really well hung.

157
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
You can wrap it up now,
it's disgusting!

158
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,300
The kid's barely 18
and already hung like a polar bear!

159
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,300
Kids like that often work
in nightclubs.

160
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,400
It's their livelihood. He must have
been a prude to take a job like this.

161
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,300
But some guys make a living
with their organ. Awful, isn't it?

162
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,000
What's so funny? It sure won't
make you a living!

163
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Here we are in a neighborhood
of mostly senior citizens.

164
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,600
Planners design so-called
low-cost housing.

165
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,100
Flats meant for young people,
newlyweds setting up house,

166
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,900
For workers, for housewives,
and maybe even the unemployed.

167
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's all part of the
district renewal plan

168
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,200
that aims to bring old folks out
of isolation by mixing them...

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,300
with the working population. It's a
great idea but what i don't like is

170
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,000
-and here's the rub- how can you
design low cost housing projects in

171
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,900
total disregard for aesthetics?
I can't accept that, I'm sorry!

172
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,900
They thought of planting Japanese
cherry trees along the lanes, see?

173
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,800
In the style of English beach resorts.
A truly grand idea, but did they do it?

174
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
-Did they do it?
-No.

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes they did!
But they didn't follow through.

176
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,100
That's the shame of it. It was purely
cosmetic. Just to dazzle them,

177
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,500
and people fell for it.

178
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,100
I followed it all,
I saw how far their bright ideas went!

179
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,700
What do you notice at first glance?
What stands out?

180
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The red bricks!

181
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,400
What's red bring to mind?
Red is the color of blood, of Indians!

182
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
It's the color of violence!

183
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,300
And the scourge of society -as
evryone agrees- is violence.

184
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Red is also the color of wine...
For wining and dining.

185
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
It's all about palm-greasing, dirty
politicans and wheeling and dealing!

186
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,100
It pains me!
Wherever you take your camera...

187
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Folks would love to stop and say,

188
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,300
"What a lovely flowerbed,
what powerful asymmetry!"

189
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,000
"What a beautiful red hue of brick!"

190
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,100
But they never get the chance. Instead
they sit in front of their TV sets.

191
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,400
If I'd been asked to design that
kind of a layout

192
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,300
I'd have planned ground-level homes

193
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,000
with spacious lawns,
a bit like Frank Lloyd Wright,

194
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,700
in the style of Japanese houses.

195
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,400
Despite their faults, those people
sure know how to live!

196
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,900
You know,...

197
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,800
emphasizing aesthetics is one thing,
stressing the functionality is another.

198
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,000
Those guys overemphasize the
functional unlike people like Gaudi

199
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
who had a magnificent
architectural style,

200
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,700
a very organic style, forms that grow
out of nowhere

201
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,300
Or Horta who did such fabulous things,
those great whiplash effects.

202
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Sorry to disturb you,
we're a television crew.

203
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,200
We're doing a report on loneliness
in high-rise apartments.

204
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

205
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course if it doesn't take too long.
I'll promise we'll be brief.

206
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Come in.

207
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,200
You'll hardly notice us.

208
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
This is the crew.
211
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,639
Sit down.

209
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,700
Go ahead.

210
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Don't let the camera intimidate you.
Just act and speak naturally.

211
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,700
It bothers me none.
I was filmed once in Mons.

212
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
There was an army band concert.
I enjoyed that!

213
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
That's fine, our subject
is used to the camera. Just fine.

214
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,700
-May I ask my first question?
-Of course.

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tell me, Madam, among your
friends and acquaintances,...

216
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,000
does anyone visit you regularly?

217
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,700
I have acquaintances...

218
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,700
but I get along with everybody.
They call me Granny...

219
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,500
Granny Snuff, ever been snuffed out?

220
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,700
This is a special case.

221
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,900
When I came in, I immediately
noticed the box of Sedocar.

222
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,600
You may not know this, but Sedocar
is a drug for heart patients.

223
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,400
So I just freaked her out,

224
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,800
...which saves me a bullet.

225
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,200
It's so much easier on the neighbors,
on me, and on her.

226
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,100
I like to try out new work methods.

227
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,800
She's fading fast now.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,800
We may as well go straight
to the heart of the matter.

229
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,600
Let's hit the jackpot.
Lift the tablecloth.

230
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm gonna have a drink.

231
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Help yourselves!

232
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,600
There's plenty for all. I know you're
filming on a shoestring budget

233
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I believe in sharing, no problem.
-Thanks, Ben.

234
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,600
Back to work, follow me
and I'll show you.

235
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,500
I bet there's something
under the bed.

236
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
I don't know, but I have
a feeling about this room.

237
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,600
The little hog!

238
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Bingo!

239
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,800
Now I'll show you something.

240
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,100
Here's the juwelry,
glassware and stuff...

241
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,700
The old lady whet my appetite.

242
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Know what I'd like, Remy?

243
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,600
A nice big plate of mussels, with lots
of veggies, sauce and fries

244
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,000
Where can you get mussels?

245
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,000
A restaurant by the sea.
You're my guests for seaside dinner.

246
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,800
It's a 2-hour drive.
A big plate of mussels,

247
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,800
...some drinks. It'll be a great
evening. Just to celebrate!

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,400
What's wrong?

249
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,500
What's the matter? Don't you like mussels?
-Sure I do.

250
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,300
Then why the blank look? Let's go.
-I think Andre has to be home tonight.

251
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,500
-You have to go home?
-I had other plans.

252
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Then call home and let's hit the road.

253
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Patrick?

254
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
What about him?
-Without Andre there is no point...

255
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm the guy who should be invited!

256
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Let's paint the town red.

257
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,700
What if we went another time?
-They have commitments.

258
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,600
It's okay if I plan in advance.

259
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,000
It's nice of you, Ben.

260
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Then come with me!

261
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I have no car.

262
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,900
We'll all go wome other time.
-Okay, forget it.

263
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,600
I'll find a restaurant nearby.

264
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,700
Never mind, guys.

265
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,900
Het kan toch wel een andere keer?
-Maar natuurlijk.

266
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,600
It'll be for another time.

267
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,600
Sure, no problem, another time.

268
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,700
We'll have plenty of opportunities.
-Sure we will.

269
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,800
Let me know when you need me.
-Do you want a lift?

270
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,000
Walking's good for the appetite.
-We'll give you a lift.

271
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,900
I'd rather walk, for the appetite.
Thanks anyway, guys.

272
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,200
Remy, Andre hinted earlier...

273
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,400
...that you might have trouble
financing the rest of your film.

274
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,700
I'm naturally ready to share
the cost of film.

275
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,300
-I'd be delighted.
-That's nice of you.

276
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,500
And if we have to work overtime,
we'll do it.

277
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,500
We'll turn this film into an epic!

278
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,400
A toast to the old lady.

279
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,800
White or red?
Shall I chose?

280
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,900
We'll have this one.

281
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm afraid that's not
the wisest choice today.

282
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,200
-If you allow me...
-I'll allow you nothing!

283
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Take care of your face case,
then you can make allowances!

284
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,200
At times, crafty as a fox,

285
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
...at times, a little rascal,

286
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
at times, a gangster,
but generous as they come.

287
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,700
Whatever the amount
you need, Remy,

288
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Benoit will always,
and I mean always, deliver.

289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
Thanks, Ben.

290
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
In a kingdom by the sea,

291
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,100
along clear gulfs,

292
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,900
and plump waves

293
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,700
to stop the waves,

294
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,600
and flying fish, gliding like gulls,

295
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,000
and plancton to your heart's content,

296
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,300
and red salmon leaping
from the heavens,

297
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
the sour yelly fish

298
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,400
and purple seaweed,
and the winter's kelp...

299
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,000
Nothing shall stop me
from calling your name...

300
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Sea, Sea, Sea,

301
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,600
O cruel mother,

302
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh can you see...

303
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,000
What are you waiting for, douchebag: high tide?
-We'd better go. Bring us a mop, please.

304
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,500
I'm all right.

305
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Must be bad mussels.

306
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,300
-You don't feel sick?
-I'm okay.

307
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Let's go home.
I'll pay and we'll leave.

308
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,100
Are you okay?

309
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,600
Meet Valerie, thanks to her many worldly
contacts she's given me a taste of various

310
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,500
artistic circles. Some of these circles are very
closed. Today we're in the world of painting.

311
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
I have a keen interest in that world.

312
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,900
This is a very nice Swedish exhibit.
Had a look?

313
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The Swedish are interesting...
intensely sensitive.

314
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,900
An artist I really appreciate is Bernard
Buffet. Know his work? You know who I mean?

315
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,800
He did a poster for Robert Hossein
Heard of him, no?

316
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,300
For a show called
"The Life Of Jesus."

317
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,800
It shows a big hand
reaching up to the sky.

318
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,300
And the hand's meant to evoke Jesus.
The scarification and all that jazz.

319
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,900
Big hands, big drawings...
A knockout!

320
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Hossein sure knows how to pick his
collaborators.

321
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,000
You like Hossein? His shows are great.
Seen any?

322
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
A great actor, too. He's made a lot of
movies. He used to play dark romantic types

323
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,800
in those old costume pictures.

324
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Do you know Ben's trade?

325
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,400
You can speak up, your silence is eloquent!
-Some trade!

326
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,900
Doesn't it bother you?
-I don't pry into his work.

327
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Everyone got to eat.

328
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
Besides, we are old friends.

329
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Talking about Buffet, here it comes!
Over this way.

330
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,500
Don't be afraid.
The camera makes him nervous.

331
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,900
Help yourselves to canapes.

332
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
I only eat the top part.

333
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
What note did you just play?
-Oh, it's an F sharp.

334
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,600
And what did you play?
-An F natural.

335
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,100
That's right, ducky.

336
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,300
In 4/4 time.

337
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,900
I met Valerie at the conservatory.

338
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,900
Keep in time.

339
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,900
You're playing too fast.

340
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
She must have been about 10.

341
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,900
She was... She had long dark briads
right behind her ears,
345
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:41,245
little white ankle socks
and a little skirt.

342
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,900
She was always smiling,
running here and there,

343
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,800
always late.
We used to laugh about it.

344
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I must have been 17 or 18,

345
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,100
and I toke her under my wing
right off.

346
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,900
She'd play minuets
and short pieces for me.

347
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
I'd try to accompany her.

348
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,500
She went on to make a career
for herself, as you know.

349
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,200
And I'm proud of her.
I changed instruments.

350
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,200
The piano?
-No.

351
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,200
The blunderbuss.

352
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,200
But it's like a horn,
it needs polishing.

353
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,500
I think I hit him
-Where'd he go?

354
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
In there.

355
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,500
He came this way.

356
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,100
Say, Remy...

357
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
...smell something funny?

358
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
-What is it?
-Chickenshit. We're warm. Doomsday is near.

359
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,000
Come and look.

360
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,400
Up there by the skylight.
Look, Remy.

361
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,800
Look, Patrick.

362
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
It's a pair. It's mating season.

363
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,000
Look at this feather.
It's oily.

364
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,900
The male secretes a pungent
greasy substance,

365
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,300
that lures the female.

366
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
That's Mother Nature.

367
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,600
Pigeon,

368
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,000
winged cloak of grey,

369
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,700
In the city's hellish maw,
One glance and you fly away,

370
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,300
Your grace holds me in awe.

371
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Shit, shit, shit!
-Got a problem?

372
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,400
I lost something.

373
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,100
-My I.D. bracelet.
-What?

374
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,000
I lost my I.D. bracelet!
Goddammit!

375
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,200
Sentimental value?
First Communion.

376
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
It's a pain losing it, huh?

377
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,900
It was a pain to steal. There aren't
many kids around with my first name.

378
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,800
It's worth a small fortune. I bought
it with Dad.

379
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Patrick?

380
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,500
See anything?
-Nothing down here.

381
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,200
Remy?

382
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Look over the railing.
To the left.

383
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,800
It may have slipped off
when i was holding the railing.

384
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,500
Here?
-Yes.

385
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Don't see a thing.
Move up, I see something shiny.

386
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Take a good look.
Go up two steps.

387
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,800
There's something shiny
to your right.

388
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,400
Here?

389
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,400
That's not it.
It's just a piece of metal.

390
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,700
This happened to me in Biarritz.
The only time...

391
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Find anything?

392
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
...I went swimming with my signet ring,
and lost it among the rocks.

393
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,600
No way of finding it, just like now.
I'd need a metal detector.

394
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Got a zoom lens?

395
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,400
Can you zoom in and find him?

396
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,700
You okay?

397
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,500
Sorry about your pal,
it was an accident.

398
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Stop it, kid, you start like that
and it becomes a habit...

399
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,900
That's revenge... Stop it.

400
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,500
Come on... I understand... Stop it.

401
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I'll buy you a drink at Malou's.

402
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,000
I completely forgot about this one!

403
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,500
Help me get him in the trunk.
Take his feet.

404
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We'll make it a quick one,
I'm beat.

405
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,100
Hi, Malou, how's life?
-Fine.

406
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Not much action.
Not for now. It'll pick up.

407
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
You got to have hope.

408
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Here you go.
-Thanks.

409
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,500
Seen anything worthwhile?
I saw a real good boxing match.

410
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,800
The Moroccan featherweight...

411
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,300
A massacre...
He clobbered little Freddy.

412
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,500
They wipe us out everywhere,
even in the ring! It's amazing!

413
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,200
It's awful! Real quick on his feet,
the little Moroccan...

414
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,900
And I mean little!
You weren't big in the ring yourself.

415
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,600
No, but I had a real wallop.
-You sure did!

416
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,200
Take the train station murder.
The restroom murder.

417
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Who got the headlines? Who?

418
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Come on, who got the headlines?
-The dental mechanic!

419
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
And the toilet attendant didn't
even get a single line!

420
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,300
Little guys don't make waves.

421
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,800
If you kill a whale, you get Greenpeace
and Jacques Cousteau on your back!

422
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,600
But wipe out sardines and you get
a canning subsidy!

423
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I go for small fry.

424
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,800
What?
-You're afraid of the big fish.

425
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,100
You don't get it!
Bug off! I'd rather talk to him.

426
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,700
I'm not afraid of big stuff, Remy,
honestly I'm not.

427
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,700
I just don't like to make a fuss.
I hate making waves.

428
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,400
I work small and reap big!

429
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,300
But I know the nice suburbs.

430
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,000
Any time you wanna go!
-Let's go then.

431
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Whenever you like!
-Not tonight.

432
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,800
Because we lost our soundman
and without him I don't feel up to it.

433
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,700
And I still have to dump the cabbie.

434
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,900
I'm going to the quarry,
the canal's a drag.

435
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
This one's on me.

436
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,300
Anyway...

437
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
The shooting is temporarily on hold.

438
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,000
Patrick, our...

439
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,000
...soundman...

440
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
...is dead.

441
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Things like that...

442
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,800
...are really hard to talk about...

443
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,600
...and it may sound like a cliche...

444
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
...but it's an occupational hazard.

445
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,800
We're all aware of that.

446
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,000
I think Patrick was.

447
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,400
And I think that we should continue
the film...

448
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,300
...because this is your film, Patrick.

449
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,200
That's all I wanted to tell you...

450
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,400
that we are all thinking about you.

451
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,200
and Marie-Paule,
the girl you just moved in with...

452
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
...and who's carrying your child.

453
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,900
So long, Patrick!

454
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,000
Bear up, Marie-Paule.

455
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,200
No, no, that one's much too big.

456
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Too near the street.
Hold on a bit...

457
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Stop here, Remy.

458
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You wanted a nice suburban home,
take your pick.

459
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,200
All we have to do is wait.

460
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,900
We wait nice and quiet until dark.
Hand me a beer.

461
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,200
Who shook up the beers?

462
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,400
I haven't always been...

463
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Check that out.
Ten years from now...

464
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,700
...she'll be sucking dick like
her mother.

465
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,400
Nature really does things right.

466
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Amazing! And she doesn't even know yet!

467
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,200
Doesn't even know the color of a cock.

468
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,000
Say, Remy, that reminds me...

469
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,900
Aren't there a hell of a lot
of gays in your trade?

470
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,200
In show bizz?

471
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,600
You oughta know, there are more in
your trade then in most normal trades.

472
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,000
You can say what you want.
You don't mind me talking about it?

473
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,100
Look at Charles Trenet.
Now there's a flagrant case for you.

474
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,000
Not?
-I wouldn't know.

475
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,300
I think they are all over the place,
you know...

476
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,800
It doesn't bother me personally.
You must know a few.

477
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Like Cocteau?
-No, that's Jean Marais.

478
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
You must know some gays, Andre?
-No.

479
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,200
I was watching you three the other day.
You wouldn't happen to be gay?

480
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,400
No kidding, Remy? Because
I don't mind if you are... No?

481
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,800
Close the door, Remy.
She'll calm down soon enough.

482
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Catherine?

483
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,200
Honey?

484
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Catherine.

485
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,700
Who was it, darling?

486
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,900
Andre, Remy? Does this remind
you of anything? Le Vieux Fusil.

487
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Philippe Noiret. A nice movie.

488
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,200
Franco, come here.

489
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,200
Stick the mike here.

490
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,200
That's my idea.
Fat Noiret didn't do that.

491
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,200
Noiret's put on weight.

492
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,800
Mommy! Mommy!

493
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
I lost him.

494
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,800
Kid!

495
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,000
Come on out!

496
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,800
It's just for fun, kid!

497
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Come on, kid!

498
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,200
You can't stay in the woods alone.

499
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Put out your spotlight.

500
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,200
Put it out!

501
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,200
Light, light.

502
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,200
Get him!

503
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,300
What the fuck are you doing?
Catch him, you morons!

504
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,500
Dammmit, he's as turbulent as
his mother!

505
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,800
Remy, gimme a hand,
get his arms and legs.

506
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Filthy kid, goddammit!

507
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,500
Hold his arms.

508
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,000
Do you kill many children?
-No.

509
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,500
You must have noticed, that I don't
really have the knack in this departement.

510
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,600
This must be my second or
third kid in five years

511
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,900
Why?
-I don't like infanticide.

512
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,400
Kid's aren't good business, Remy.
In theory, they're not bankable, understand?

513
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,600
You can still make something off him.
You mean kidnapping.

514
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,400
But I think it's more of a nuisance
than anything else.

515
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Especially when the media gets involved.

516
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,500
Now hold on,
I'm not talking about you.

517
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,500
You're pretty discreet.
Congrats!

518
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,000
That'll do it.

519
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,300
The little creep really
had us going!

520
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,700
Nothing here.We really blew it!

521
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,600
I warned you about suburban homes.

522
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,700
There are credit cards.

523
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,300
Ypu might as well call the cops right
now. Go on. There's the phone.

524
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,900
This is bullshit!
-We are running out of cash for film.

525
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,400
What?

526
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,400
And we are running out
of cash for film.

527
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,800
Th problem's not cash. That, I have.

528
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,800
It's those 3 innocents.
There oughta be a law.

529
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,000
Well I'm...I'm not...

530
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,800
I'm not a lunatic.

531
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,500
It's a shame to let big houses
fall into neglect like this.

532
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Throw a coat of paint on the walls
and mirrors - and it's Versailles!

533
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,900
Could be, but it'll take more coats
than you think.

534
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Your bad breath is
something awfull, Remy.

535
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,900
You shouldn't talk under people's
noses, because it's really unpleasant.

536
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Watch out for the window, Andre.
Stop bumping into things.

537
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,600
Really! I don't know why, but all day
long you stink like a billy-goat...

538
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,700
when you talk loud under people's
noses.

539
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,800
Don't mind the mess.

540
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,400
How much you need this time?

541
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,400
How much?
-10,000

542
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,300
-10,000! Dammit, you spend it faster
than I can make it, Remy.

543
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,200
Let me tell you something, Remy,
your spotlight gets on my tits.

544
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Sorry, but there's not enough light.

545
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,400
I know, but yesterday with the kid, it
blinded me and disrupted my work.

546
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,200
I'm sorry.
-Sure, you're sorry.

547
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,600
Here, for your bad breath -
have a candy.

548
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,200
Right before he died, I told him,

549
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,900
"Come on we've got enough footage,
we've got enough sound."

550
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
And he said,

551
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,100
"We'll never have enough."

552
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,800
He was a charming boy...

553
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,600
who wouldn't compromise...

554
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,400
We are all thinking of you, Franco.

555
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
And this film's dedicated to you.

556
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,200
And I'm thinking of Marie-Paule,
your girlfriend...

557
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,200
...who is carrying...

558
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,800
...your child.

559
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,200
Ricardo Giovanni, alias the Nightingale,
capable but dissolute, much too dissolute.

560
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,700
Like all Mediterraneans.

561
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,600
Come on out!

562
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,500
Holy shit!

563
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
A camera crew. Know'em?

564
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm a director. This is my team...
Holy smoke, Andre!

565
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
Get a load of the big camera!

566
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,800
This is fancy material. Not interested?
-No, it's video.

567
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,000
-And what's ours?
-Film.

568
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,400
Let's take advantage
of our luck, Remy.

569
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,200
This one is for you.

570
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,000
That makes 68 francs...

571
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,800
...and two times 23, is 46.
O nn, three times.

572
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,100
And one time 20.

573
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,200
Here you go.

574
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,400
Do you have any room, sir?
I'll give you a bag.

575
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,400
For once we have something
to celebrate...

576
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,100
Don't tell her! I'll have some...

577
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
Well, it's a French drink...

578
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,300
Malaga wine.
-There is none.

579
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,200
Some Muscat.
-There's no Muscat.

580
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,300
No alcohol?
-None at all.

581
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,600
-A Coke?
-That, I have.

582
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,900
Ice cold.

583
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,300
No thank you.

584
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,800
Grandma's not here?
-She's in the store.

585
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,200
But I can still have something else.
-What?

586
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,400
What I had with Hugues.

587
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,300
Port wine.

588
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,600
But that is...

589
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,000
Be carefull, he's not allowed to drink.
Don't give him a drink. He shouldn't.

590
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,100
Why not?
-He's been sick.

591
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,600
What did he have?
-He had vascular spasms.

592
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,200
He could get a heart attack.

593
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,300
So be carefull. He musn't overdo it.
One glass...

594
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,700
He forgets, too.
He forgets what he drinks,

595
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,600
and that makes it even worse.
Understand?

596
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,400
He doesn't realize it.

597
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,000
You promise?

598
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,500
I have two pairs of panties of
Brigitte Bardot's.

599
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The fellow was in raptures.

600
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,000
But I told him it's 200 francs
a pair.

601
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,000
In those days, 200 francs,

602
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
was a lot for the time.

603
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,300
So we make a deal.

604
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,400
But I still had to pick up the
panties at the department store.

605
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,800
I buy the panties, I rumple them,
I come back.

606
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,700
You bought 2 pairs?
-Two pairs?

607
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,200
No, just one...

608
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,700
So I give him one and I say,
"here are the panties."

609
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,400
And I get my 200 francs. So for 200
francs, I sold Brigitte Bardot's panties.

610
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,200
In those days, that's at least
1,000 francs nowadays.

611
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,700
He still thinks
it's her real panties?

612
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,300
I think he does. I recently asked
himm if he still had them.

613
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,800
He says, "I still got'em."

614
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,600
It's a true story.

615
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,200
I think the chubby one there
was Grandma's sister.

616
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,400
Switch on the lights, Remy.
These old films are just charming.

617
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,100
Just charming. Grandpa didn't do
so badly with his tiny material.

618
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,400
I love watching them.
You're gonna break'em.

619
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,100
Let's go downstairs before you break
everything. What did I tell you!

620
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,800
I think...
-I've had enough.

621
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,100
Do you want an orange?
-No, I don't like fruit.

622
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,300
They killed a child...
But just before they killed his parents.

623
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,600
So he saw his parents being killed.
Can you imagine?

624
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,200
I swear if they did that to a child
of mine, I'd slaughter him.

625
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,600
And with me, there'd be no trail.
I'd be judge and jury myself!

626
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,800
Has roger been around
the ring lately?

627
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,600
-Who?
-Roger!

628
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Haven't seen him in a while. Why?
I hear he's boxing again.

629
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,200
I don't know what happened.
-Kalifa?

630
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,200
Tell the gentleman how you got
your job here.

631
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,200
Mr Benoit got it for me.

632
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,400
You haven't come to see me
in a while.

633
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,000
What?
-I didn't know.

634
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,100
-I can't hear you.
-I didn't know where you were, sir.

635
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,600
And no kiss from Benichou?

636
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,200
He doesn't look happy
to see me.

637
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,000
The boy looks pale.

638
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,200
Come and see me after the fight.
I'll give you some money.

639
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,600
Buy him a new satchel. And buy yourself
some shoes. You look like a gypsy.

640
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,000
Thank you, Mr Benoit.

641
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Film lovers!
Film lovers, good evening!

642
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,300
Tonight, for one showing only...

643
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
My big dick!

644
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,500
You're not gonna start that again?
-Filmlovers, a slight change in program...

645
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,500
You're gonna see Malou's
great big tits.

646
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Malou! Your tits!
-Cut it out, Ben!

647
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
-You've gone far enough.
-Okay, okay.

648
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I've had it with your grossness.

649
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,500
What'll it be, Remy?
-Another one.

650
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,400
-A Dead Baby Boy.

651
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,500
No more beer,
you're having a Dead Baby Boy.

652
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,600
And the new guy?
-A screwdriver.

653
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,900
You're having a Dead Baby Boy
with the rest of us!

654
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,900
Malou! Four Dead Baby Boys!

655
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,600
What is it?
-A Dead Baby Boy?

656
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,200
It's dynamite!

657
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You'll see.

658
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,400
Make'em stiff!

659
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,600
You know your problem?
It's your temper, it does you wrong.

660
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,400
...it does you wrong.
-No, it doesn't.

661
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,200
It'll do you wrong soon.

662
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,400
Quit laughing, you half-wit!

663
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,200
Stop hitting me, creep!

664
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,100
Holy Jesus.

665
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,200
Are you ugly when you laugh!
It's unbelievable!

666
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,500
He's so ugly when he laughs!

667
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,600
You should have let me
film him, Andre.

668
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,100
Serve us up.

669
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,900
A tear of Gin.

670
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Just a tear.

671
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,000
A river of tonic...

672
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,900
And then the little victim:

673
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,200
...one part olive...

674
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,700
...one part sugar cube,
and one part piece of string...

675
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,200
And there's our Dead Baby Boy.
A quick ratio quiz:

676
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,600
How much ballast does it take
to sink a dead kid?

677
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,600
Remy? How many times the kid's body weight?
-Twice his weight!

678
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Shut up and let Remy answer.
Twice his weight, correct.

679
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,600
Why? Because his bones are...
-Porous!

680
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,700
If I'm boring you, just say so.
You're not even paying attention.

681
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,400
Now you take your Dead Baby Boy
and sink it.

682
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,300
And you wait and see

683
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,600
When the olive rises...
Whichever comes up first

684
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,700
is the loser,
and buys the next round.

685
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,500
It's as simple as that.

686
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,000
Goddammit!
I gte my jacket soaked

687
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
...every time I serve a drink.

688
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,600
You lose.
-Shit!

689
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,600
Malou.

690
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Set up another round.

691
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,200
Andre's second...

692
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,900
Remy's third. That was a nice
little package, Vincent. Sucker.

693
11:00:01,700 --> 11:00:07,100
I'll buy the next one.
I think...

694
11:00:11,200 --> 11:00:13,200
I'll eat my Dead Baby Boy.

695
11:00:13,600 --> 11:00:15,800
Waste not, want not.

696
11:00:24,800 --> 11:00:26,700
Never swallow the string.

697
11:00:34,400 --> 11:00:37,600
That was a great one!

698
11:00:39,600 --> 11:00:43,200
Get out! I've had it with you!
-Just say I disgust you!

699
11:00:43,400 --> 11:00:46,300
All because I have  some faults!

700
11:00:46,400 --> 11:00:48,400
No?

701
11:00:48,700 --> 11:00:50,500
Cinema!

702
11:00:50,600 --> 11:00:54,900
I'll go because I am cinema!

703
11:00:55,000 --> 11:00:57,000
Cinema!

704
11:00:57,200 --> 11:00:58,900
Cinema!

705
11:00:59,000 --> 11:01:03,000
From screen to screen,
film to film,

706
11:01:03,200 --> 11:01:07,200
I gave you my life,

707
11:01:07,600 --> 11:01:09,700
And you, Gabin,

708
11:01:09,800 --> 11:01:12,200
son of Lucien,

709
11:01:12,300 --> 11:01:15,500
it made you a good boy again!

710
11:01:15,600 --> 11:01:17,600
All together now!

711
11:01:20,600 --> 11:01:24,300
Get a shot of me while I piss,
that's it!

712
11:01:24,400 --> 11:01:26,400
Come on, you jerks!

713
11:01:28,000 --> 11:01:30,800
In the port of shadows,

714
11:01:31,200 --> 11:01:34,600
sings Michele Morgan

715
11:01:35,200 --> 11:01:40,500
Got a great pair of eyes on,
he put it so nicely, that Jean.

716
11:01:40,600 --> 11:01:44,300
Cinema, o Cinema

717
11:01:44,400 --> 11:01:49,200
From screen to screen,
from film to film,

718
11:01:54,000 --> 11:01:57,600
Ivan Rebroff,
Yuletide child,

719
11:01:58,300 --> 11:02:00,200
sometimes

720
11:02:14,600 --> 11:02:19,600
and you, lvan,
sing Noel!

721
11:02:31,400 --> 11:02:36,200
Hush, not a sound, it's the
night round. Hush, not a sound,

722
11:02:40,600 --> 11:02:44,900
it's the night round. With diligence,

723
11:02:45,000 --> 11:02:49,500
keep the silence,
onward without a sound.

724
11:02:49,600 --> 11:02:51,600
Your turn.

725
11:02:52,400 --> 11:02:54,800
Don't move!

726
11:02:54,900 --> 11:02:57,400
Don't move around. Stay calm.

727
11:03:05,200 --> 11:03:07,200
Weg met die camera.

728
11:03:15,500 --> 11:03:17,900
I'll blow his brains out!

729
11:03:19,800 --> 11:03:21,800
What's your wife's name?

730
11:03:23,000 --> 11:03:25,000
What?
-Martine.

731
11:03:25,600 --> 11:03:28,000
I like to know a woman
before making her come.

732
11:03:28,200 --> 11:03:31,900
You're all beasts.
It takes a little gentleness.

733
11:03:32,000 --> 11:03:35,600
Like a little bird
coming home to roost.

734
11:03:35,700 --> 11:03:37,600
Like a little piggy.

735
11:03:38,600 --> 11:03:42,600
Filthy slut!

736
11:03:45,800 --> 11:03:48,600
See that?
She's moaning!

737
11:04:53,200 --> 11:04:56,000
After my tour,
the concierge gave me this.

738
11:04:56,200 --> 11:05:00,200
It'd been in a box for 3 days.
it began to stink.

739
11:05:00,300 --> 11:05:05,100
I had a shock! I didn't know if
I should wait to show you.

740
11:05:05,400 --> 11:05:08,800
You did the right thing.
Put it away now.

741
11:05:08,900 --> 11:05:12,800
-I had to show you.
-You did right.

742
11:05:14,000 --> 11:05:17,100
-Know what it means?
-Don't worry, I know.

743
11:05:17,200 --> 11:05:18,800
You see, Remy...

744
11:05:19,000 --> 11:05:22,800
...iat that hideout I wasted
an italian named Giovanni.

745
11:05:23,000 --> 11:05:26,900
Well, this is a warning
from his brother.

746
11:05:27,000 --> 11:05:31,700
I knew he'd turn up some day,
but it's just a warning.

747
11:05:31,800 --> 11:05:36,400
Don't worry, Valerie,
just burn it and forget about it.

748
11:05:37,400 --> 11:05:39,600
What? O no, no.

749
11:05:40,400 --> 11:05:43,400
They're just Italians...
Small-time.

750
11:05:49,700 --> 11:05:52,400
He hasn't been working out
regularly.

751
11:05:52,500 --> 11:05:54,600
Paul, go and work with Karim.

752
11:06:02,200 --> 11:06:06,100
Does it hurt?
-A bit. But that's normal.

753
11:06:08,000 --> 11:06:10,500
I'm starting to get
some movement again.

754
11:06:10,600 --> 11:06:13,300
Are you?
-Sure. Just look.

755
11:06:13,400 --> 11:06:15,200
Good for you.

756
11:06:15,300 --> 11:06:17,900
Don't exert yourself.

757
11:06:18,000 --> 11:06:22,300
Don't overdo it.

758
11:06:22,400 --> 11:06:24,400
Good, right?

759
11:06:25,200 --> 11:06:28,100
I'll be on my feet
in a couple of weeks.

760
11:06:28,200 --> 11:06:31,800
When you're young,
you're in shape soon enough.

761
11:06:31,900 --> 11:06:35,100
When you got your youth,
you mend quickly.

762
11:06:35,200 --> 11:06:38,900
You can be sure of that.
-Mordern medecine works wonders!

763
11:06:39,000 --> 11:06:41,000
The things they can do today!

764
11:06:41,100 --> 11:06:45,400
I always warned him
this would happen.

765
11:06:46,300 --> 11:06:50,800
It was a great match.
-That's the way sports are.

766
11:06:50,900 --> 11:06:54,600
All that running around,
it's like soccer, you murder each other.

767
11:06:54,700 --> 11:06:56,900
Mom got a rat in the mail.

768
11:06:57,000 --> 11:06:59,600
A skewered rat!

769
11:07:00,900 --> 11:07:05,200
I know who sent it.
It's those Taviers again.

770
11:07:05,800 --> 11:07:11,200
Guess what they did just recently?
They pissed in Madam Joquet's mailbox!

771
11:07:11,300 --> 11:07:16,400
All her letters soaked through,
everything ruined.

772
11:07:16,600 --> 11:07:18,600
Unreadable!

773
11:07:19,400 --> 11:07:21,600
Why, did you read them?

774
11:07:21,700 --> 11:07:23,600
It hurts to laugh.

775
11:07:25,200 --> 11:07:28,800
When you see something like that...

776
11:07:29,000 --> 11:07:31,600
...but look at that poor man there

777
11:07:32,900 --> 11:07:36,500
His children don't even come to visit!

778
11:07:38,200 --> 11:07:40,900
What a shame.
-It's a shame.

779
11:07:41,000 --> 11:07:45,500
Does he have kids?
-I think so.

780
11:07:45,600 --> 11:07:49,600
He must have children,
but he never gets any visits.

781
11:07:49,800 --> 11:07:51,800
It's a shame.

782
11:07:51,900 --> 11:07:53,800
Don't you smell something?

783
11:07:54,800 --> 11:07:56,700
A bit.

784
11:07:56,800 --> 11:07:58,400
What's it?

785
11:07:58,600 --> 11:08:00,600
Chickenshit?
-Not, that!

786
11:08:01,000 --> 11:08:03,600
-It smells like shit!
-Could be.

787
11:08:07,800 --> 11:08:09,700
Did you make ka-ka?

788
11:08:10,000 --> 11:08:11,900
Did you make ka-ka?

789
11:08:12,200 --> 11:08:16,200
Thank you. That's kind of you,
but don't bother.

790
11:08:16,500 --> 11:08:18,500
You did make ka-ka!

791
11:08:18,700 --> 11:08:22,500
I'm all right!
It's fine like that!

792
11:08:22,600 --> 11:08:24,900
-It's all right.
-I'll ring for the nurse.

793
11:08:26,000 --> 11:08:28,000
What for?

794
11:08:30,200 --> 11:08:32,900
He shits all day lonh.
-It doesn't bother you?

795
11:08:33,000 --> 11:08:36,900
It's like that all day,
and he sings too!

796
11:08:37,300 --> 11:08:39,700
He shits and sings,
that's all he can do.

797
11:08:39,800 --> 11:08:42,000
It's a shame.

798
11:08:42,400 --> 11:08:44,300
He's a pharmacist.

799
11:08:44,800 --> 11:08:48,400
I think...
-O Mr Rouland. You agian?

800
11:08:48,600 --> 11:08:52,300
You're just in time
for a real treat

801
11:08:52,400 --> 11:08:56,100
We did a big ka-ka!
-I did it just for you.

802
11:08:56,200 --> 11:09:00,900
I shit for nights, I shit for days,
I shit all over, I shit always.

803
11:09:01,000 --> 11:09:04,000
If you'd only behave.
Behave!

804
11:09:04,700 --> 11:09:08,300
I you don't have the looks,
at least the manners.

805
11:09:08,400 --> 11:09:13,700
You want to repeat that?
I'm here to do my job agreably!

806
11:09:13,800 --> 11:09:18,800
If you call that work...
You enjoy it! You love shit, eh?

807
11:09:18,900 --> 11:09:23,700
You sure raise a stink over crap!
I give you plenty, but you're never happy.

808
11:09:23,800 --> 11:09:27,600
I'll change you.
Count your blessings!

809
11:09:27,700 --> 11:09:30,900
You could leave me as I am.
-Wallowing in shit?

810
11:09:31,000 --> 11:09:35,800
You enjoy it. You'd be mad if there
wasn't enough!

811
11:09:35,900 --> 11:09:39,600
Lucky they're not all like him!
-You'll get your money's worth.

812
11:09:39,700 --> 11:09:42,300
Let's go, my girl?
-Okay, because...

813
11:09:42,400 --> 11:09:45,500
It's late, he.
-You are going home?

814
11:09:45,600 --> 11:09:49,500
It was great to see you.
-I shit for nights, I shit for days,

815
11:09:49,600 --> 11:09:52,400
I shit all over, I shit always.

816
11:09:52,500 --> 11:09:56,500
No, i understand it.
-She's alone in the store.

817
11:09:58,200 --> 11:10:02,600
It was great to have seen you.
-Thanks for the oranges.

818
11:10:02,800 --> 11:10:08,300
Take care of yourself. And we'll go out
and have a drink when you're out.

819
11:10:12,200 --> 11:10:14,200
See you, Hector.

820
11:10:48,800 --> 11:10:51,000
Talk about surprises,

821
11:10:51,800 --> 11:10:53,700
this takes the cake!

822
11:10:53,800 --> 11:10:56,300
Were you in on this?
-Sure.

823
11:10:56,500 --> 11:10:58,200
Hi, Jenny.

824
11:10:58,400 --> 11:11:00,600
This is a hell of a surprise!

825
11:11:01,500 --> 11:11:04,900
Hello, Val?ie.
-Great to see you.

826
11:11:08,000 --> 11:11:09,900
Already rolling?

827
11:11:13,400 --> 11:11:17,400
It sure is nice to see people
in the pink.

828
11:11:17,600 --> 11:11:19,900
You're all fixed now.

829
11:11:20,000 --> 11:11:22,900
How's the hip, Jenny?
-Getting better.

830
11:11:23,000 --> 11:11:24,900
Watch yourself.

831
11:11:25,400 --> 11:11:28,400
You too, Valerie,
with all those drugs you take.

832
11:11:28,500 --> 11:11:30,400
Especially the Pill!

833
11:11:33,300 --> 11:11:36,400
Let's have some cake.

834
11:11:37,400 --> 11:11:42,200
Just a small piece.
I already ate at the hospital.

835
11:11:42,300 --> 11:11:46,300
For me, a big piece,
like my piece.

836
11:11:47,000 --> 11:11:48,900
It's worth tasting.

837
11:11:50,000 --> 11:11:51,900
It's excellent.

838
11:11:55,100 --> 11:11:57,000
Here's to Ben!

839
11:12:13,900 --> 11:12:15,700
For me?
-From the whole crew.

840
11:12:15,800 --> 11:12:17,900
Een bom.
-How thoughtfull.

841
11:12:18,500 --> 11:12:21,700
Thanks Andre, Vincent.
-Happy Birthday, Ben.

842
11:12:22,300 --> 11:12:23,900
What is it?

843
11:12:24,000 --> 11:12:29,400
I'll know it, if you've unpacked it.
-It's not very heavy, it can't be a bomb.

844
11:12:29,500 --> 11:12:31,400
I'll open it.

845
11:12:34,400 --> 11:12:36,700
That's a great idea!

846
11:12:37,400 --> 11:12:42,000
A holster! just the right color!
Who picked it out?

847
11:12:42,200 --> 11:12:44,100
Andre.
-Thanks so much.

848
11:12:44,200 --> 11:12:48,600
It was the perfect choice.
Help me put it on, Remy

849
11:12:50,700 --> 11:12:55,200
It's just what I needed, but never
thought of it myself.

850
11:12:55,300 --> 11:13:00,700
Quality leather, too. Can you get me
my revolver? I'll try it right now.

851
11:13:03,700 --> 11:13:05,700
Found it, Valerie?

852
11:13:07,700 --> 11:13:09,900
It's superb.

853
11:13:10,100 --> 11:13:14,700
What a freedom of movement,
what a difference!

854
11:13:14,800 --> 11:13:18,000
You can really move aroung
in a thing like this.

855
11:13:18,100 --> 11:13:20,000
No, that's me.

856
11:13:49,200 --> 11:13:51,200
May I have some more bubbly?

857
11:14:19,900 --> 11:14:22,300
Another present.
-Please.

858
11:14:23,000 --> 11:14:25,000
You are spoiling me!
-Aren't we?

859
11:14:25,200 --> 11:14:27,100
What is it?

860
11:14:37,700 --> 11:14:39,800
It's a beauty, Jenny!
-I thought so.

861
11:14:39,900 --> 11:14:43,600
It's a real pleasure.
It's a splendid seagull.

862
11:14:43,700 --> 11:14:45,600
Got it in the frame?

863
11:14:48,400 --> 11:14:51,100
Isn't it nice?
-A fine gull.

864
11:14:53,000 --> 11:14:57,000
Have some more cake.
-I haven't finished my first slice.

865
11:14:57,800 --> 11:15:00,300
Anyway, I'm not that hungry.
That's sweet of you, Jenny.

866
11:15:01,800 --> 11:15:03,900
Heel lief van je, Jenny.

867
11:15:06,200 --> 11:15:08,100
You're welcome, sir.

868
11:15:08,700 --> 11:15:12,700
If you like it.
-You don't have to call me "sir".

869
11:15:13,800 --> 11:15:16,400
What's this "sir" business
all of a sudden?

870
11:15:16,600 --> 11:15:21,100
True, I don't always say "sir".
How can I say it...

871
11:15:21,200 --> 11:15:23,900
You're moved?
-I'm moved...

872
11:15:25,200 --> 11:15:27,200
By that pretty creature!

873
11:15:57,600 --> 11:15:59,500
We can forget it.

874
11:16:02,400 --> 11:16:04,300
Take a look.

875
11:16:33,200 --> 11:16:36,800
What the hell are you doing?

876
11:16:36,900 --> 11:16:39,300
I can still see a huge bundle
from up here!

877
11:16:39,400 --> 11:16:43,000
Do I have to come and do it myself?
Cover all that up!

878
11:16:43,200 --> 11:16:48,300
Remy, I can see legs sticking out!
Don't just stand there!

879
11:16:48,400 --> 11:16:52,700
You have nothing better to do than
film, Andre? You faggot!

880
11:16:55,400 --> 11:16:57,300
Am I on television?

881
11:17:22,400 --> 11:17:24,400
Look, look.

882
11:17:28,800 --> 11:17:33,800
Shouldn't have done it like that. I should
have thrown him on the crates and hit him.

883
11:17:34,000 --> 11:17:39,200
He had me waltzing like a skirt!
He had time to kick me in the nuts.

884
11:17:44,200 --> 11:17:49,300
I can't move in this thing.
He got out of that nicely.

885
11:17:53,200 --> 11:17:55,800
You could have given me
a hand there.

886
11:18:02,000 --> 11:18:04,200
I didn't expect...

887
11:18:06,300 --> 11:18:09,500
Teamwork means being able
to count on your colleagues.

888
11:18:09,600 --> 11:18:13,600
But I couldn't count on you
this time,right or wrong?

889
11:18:13,800 --> 11:18:15,700
Right.

890
11:18:18,800 --> 11:18:20,700
It's a shame.

891
11:18:27,100 --> 11:18:30,500
And stop making faces behind my back.

892
11:18:41,800 --> 11:18:44,200
The jury handed down its verdict
late this afternoon.

893
11:18:44,300 --> 11:18:48,000
For the last time, Benoit Patard
stood in the dock,

894
11:18:48,200 --> 11:18:53,500
a sardonic grin over his brace, and his
usual smug arrogant glint in his eye.

895
11:18:53,600 --> 11:18:57,100
Don't talk to me about other murders
until these are proven.

896
11:18:57,200 --> 11:18:59,800
A harsh verdict for such evidence?

897
11:19:00,000 --> 11:19:04,400
Yes. I will be consulting my client,
to decide if we'll appeal.

898
11:19:04,500 --> 11:19:07,200
That's all I have to say. Thank you.

899
11:19:16,100 --> 11:19:18,700
What would you like me to bring you?

900
11:19:21,900 --> 11:19:25,900
Nothing.
-Don't say that.

901
11:19:26,200 --> 11:19:30,500
We always need something. What
can I bring you from the store?

902
11:19:30,600 --> 11:19:35,800
I'll come and see you often,
I promise. How often can I come?

903
11:19:36,800 --> 11:19:40,200
I have no idea.
-They didn't tell you yet?

904
11:19:40,300 --> 11:19:43,100
Bring cigarettes.

905
11:19:43,200 --> 11:19:45,700
Smoking's allowed?
-Yes, it's allowed.

906
11:19:46,100 --> 11:19:49,600
I'll bring some,
but you need food...

907
11:19:50,100 --> 11:19:52,400
Cigarettes aren't enough...

908
11:19:53,100 --> 11:19:56,100
I don't believe it.

909
11:19:56,800 --> 11:20:01,200
I don't believe anything
they say. I really don't.

910
11:20:03,300 --> 11:20:05,200
I'm so sad,

911
11:20:05,700 --> 11:20:09,700
but whatever happens
I'll always come.

912
11:20:28,800 --> 11:20:31,500
Remy, it's Ben.
I escaped.

913
11:20:31,900 --> 11:20:34,700
Meet me in 2 hours.

914
11:20:34,800 --> 11:20:39,500
First pick up Valerie.
Meet me where we met the first time.

915
11:20:39,600 --> 11:20:43,100
I'd written a poem about autumn.

916
11:20:43,700 --> 11:20:46,400
A thousand leaves mingle

917
11:20:46,600 --> 11:20:49,500
In the misty breeze

918
11:20:49,800 --> 11:20:52,900
Plump brown chestnuts

919
11:20:53,100 --> 11:20:56,700
Pummel the ground,
Yet I remain unharmed.

920
11:20:57,500 --> 11:21:01,900
Th cold spews scorn
At summer's dying twitch,

921
11:21:02,300 --> 11:21:05,000
Which with a last lazy stroke

922
11:21:05,100 --> 11:21:08,600
warms my limbs aching
from another assault

923
11:21:08,700 --> 11:21:12,700
Without trumpets or banners,
See it, here it comes.

924
11:21:13,200 --> 11:21:15,500
The splendid autumn.

925
11:21:17,200 --> 11:21:19,700
Valerie's not with you?
-She was to meet us here.

926
11:21:19,900 --> 11:21:22,600
But I haven't seen her.

927
11:21:30,600 --> 11:21:32,900
Can I have a cigarette?

928
11:21:41,600 --> 11:21:43,500
How did the jailbreak go?

929
11:21:45,700 --> 11:21:48,300
Take off, Remy.
-Where to?

930
11:21:49,300 --> 11:21:51,200
To Valrie's.

931
11:21:58,700 --> 11:22:00,600
Valerie?

932
11:23:37,900 --> 11:23:43,200
Water's no good for flutes.
-Think shit's good for scales?

933
11:24:57,000 --> 11:24:59,000
Is het ernstig, Ben?

934
11:25:03,100 --> 11:25:05,600
Is it serious?
-Yes, yes, yes.

935
11:25:05,800 --> 11:25:09,700
Mom wasn't a musician!
Is that what you want to know?

936
11:25:09,800 --> 11:25:13,200
She got hers with a broom!

937
11:25:17,300 --> 11:25:20,700
Sorry, Remy...
I'm sorry, kid.

938
11:25:30,900 --> 11:25:34,500
I want to get some things
out of the closet.

939
11:25:38,300 --> 11:25:41,100
It was a great hideout!

940
11:25:41,200 --> 11:25:44,700
I said, it was a great hideout!

941
11:26:02,700 --> 11:26:05,500
What'll you do now?
-What?

942
11:26:06,600 --> 11:26:10,300
I don't know
Leave, in any case.

943
11:26:10,400 --> 11:26:14,400
Got a place to go?
Where you know somebody?

944
11:26:17,600 --> 11:26:19,600
So you're here, too.

945
11:26:20,700 --> 11:26:22,600
Let's recite, Remy.

946
11:26:23,000 --> 11:26:24,500
Pigeon...

947
11:26:24,600 --> 11:26:28,300
winged cloaked of...

948
11:26:28,700 --> 11:26:31,500
Grey. In the city's hellisk maw...

949
11:26:32,400 --> 11:26:35,100
One glance and you fly away...
You've got it.

950
11:26:35,600 --> 11:26:39,400
Your grace...

951
11:28:11,800 --> 11:28:15,600
We hope you enjoyed this QiX release!
