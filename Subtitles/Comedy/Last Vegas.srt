336
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,429
Look, just throw some things in a bag.
The flight leaves in a couple of hours.

337
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,097
Come on!
We're not leaving without you.

338
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,936
Either you come with us,
or we move in.

339
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,896
Hold on, hold on.
You show up out of nowhere,

340
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,777
you say we're going to Vegas.
You know what?

341
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,109
- This smells of Billy Gherson.
- Oh, Paddy, Billy Gher--?

342
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,694
This-- This has nothing to--

343
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,985
Billy, we want him to come,
of course.

344
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,653
But then he--
You know, he's got a big

345
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,617
- important thing he has to do.
- Of course.

346
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,123
He always has something important.

347
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,000
That's the problem.
It's always about him, him, him.

348
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,207
- What's that about?
SAM: That's just Billy!

349
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,963
- Put it behind you!
PADDY: That's right,

350
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,589
he's got more important
things to do.

351
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,546
I have more important
things to do right here.

352
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,881
What's with the pictures of Sophie?
They're everywhere.

353
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,092
Everywhere I turn,
that's all I see: Sophie!

354
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,052
It's getting a little morbid,
don't you think?

355
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,717
- Don't-- Don't touch those.
- Oh.

356
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,635
PADDY: Jesus.
SAM: Okay, sorry.

357
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,554
- I like looking at her.
- Okay.

358
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,393
That stays there,
this stays here.

359
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,729
Okay.
But you come with me to Vegas.

360
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,693
Paddy, you have got to come
with us to Las Vegas.

361
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,822
If you think
I'm leaving this apartment,

362
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,198
you're dumber than that hat.

363
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,032
Say what you want to me,
but leave my hat out of this, okay?

364
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,741
My hat has never done
a thing to you.

365
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,657
- I'm not going to Vegas!
- Paddy!

366
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,747
(WHEEZING)

367
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,417
What, are you--? Are you nuts?

368
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,377
You're gonna give yourself
another stroke!

369
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,541
Archie, you okay?

370
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,005
(WHEEZING)

371
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,795
- Is he--?
- The stairs. Paddy.

372
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,714
You got to come.

373
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,598
You got to come
to Vegas with us.

374
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,389
- Please, Paddy.
- Okay. Okay.

375
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,145
Okay! All right, I'll go!

376
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,522
I'll go! I'm going!
I'm going, okay?

377
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,604
- Great.
- I got to pack.

378
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,860
- Prick.
- Asshole.

379
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,362
That was well done.

380
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,207
PADDY:
So Billy was so busy,

381
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,414
he couldn't spend the weekend with
his three oldest friends in the world.

382
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,669
Typical.

383
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,172
Once a selfish bastard,
always a selfish bastard.

384
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,674
Never changes.
Never, never changes.

385
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,256
You know, that's the thing
about him, he's just the way he is.

386
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,888
What was so important that
he couldn't spend it with us?

387
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,093
So important?

388
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,304
I agree with everything
you've said, Paddy.

389
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,889
For the last four hours.

390
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,678
PADDY:
Him, him, him.

391
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,438
He didn't even call.

392
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,350
You know, he-- A disappointment.
He didn't...

393
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,860
He didn't even call.
All I can say is, if I ever,

394
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,363
ever run into that son of a bitch
again, that prick, I'll...

395
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,864
Forget it.

396
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,775
- He'll regret the day...
- Hey!

397
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,534
Ha, ha! Well!

00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,740

Hey, hey,
what's that hair color?

402
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,619
- Hazelnut?
- Have you got more hair

403
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,833
than you used to have?

404
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,214
- Oh, stop it, will you?
- You've got more hair than--

405
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
Where'd you get the extra hair?

406

Hey, look, don't be upset
with them, Pat.

408
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,888
- It wasn't their fault.
- I'm going home.

00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,049
Paddy, look,
I'm getting married, okay?

410
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,184
This is a bachelor party,
I needed you here.

411
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,811
- I'm going home.
- How many times

412
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,186
do I got to tell you I'm sorry?

your block off like I did in fifth grade.

Now we're here together,

We're here to celebrate
Billy marrying an infant.

420
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,166
- She's not an infant.
- Shut up, Billy!

421

Archie, blood pressure?

422
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,372
I need this.

to be civil with each other,

- Huh?
- Yeah.

I'm gonna go find some damn water
and take all my damn pills.

Then we gonna get
this damn party started.

ass-hair on your head,

do you wash your hair,
or do you just wipe?

come up when you made
the reservation?

No, because you insisted
on making the reservations.

When we were kids,

we were in love
with the same girl.

it was just two best friends

1382
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,053
but as we got older, it got
a little more complicated.

1383
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,264
One day, Paddy told Sophie

1384
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:03,102
that she had to make a choice
between the two of us.

1385

She was young.

saw me first.

she belonged with Paddy.

Look, Billy, you don't know women
the way I know them.

1678
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,880
You haven't shared
a full life with anyone.

1679
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,965
You don't know what that is.

1680
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,264
You can't tell a woman who to love.

1681
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,347
Especially Sophie. You can't do it.

1682
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,346
I know what I had
with my wife, Billy.

1683
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:48,855
Thanks to you.

So I'm gonna ask you one more time,
you miserable prick.

you are about to marry?

You end it, or I will.

Hey, hey, you stay out of this, all right?
It has nothing to do with you.

1691
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:14,214
Hey, babe!

1692
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,547

- Aah!

Although that imbecile in the pool there

1694
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,182
started calling me Paddy
when we were kids and it stuck.

1695
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,347
Oh, right. Paddy!
It's so great to finally meet you.

1696
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,516
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Billy's told me so much.

1697
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,025
Why did you throw him in the pool?

1698
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,152
Ah, that's just an old game
from the neighborhood.

1699
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,188
Listen, dear.
Can I tell you something?

1700
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,323
- Yeah.
- Fifty years ago,

1701
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,576
Billy did something for me

1702
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,613
that allowed me to marry
the only woman I ever loved.

1703
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:47,702
And now it's my chance
to return the favor.

1704
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,165
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- He's not in love with you.

1705
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,164
He likes you.
I know he likes you a whole lot,

1706
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,174
but he doesn't love you
like the way that he should.

1707
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,169
I can't let him marry you.

1708

I can't let him marry you.
