00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,591
BORDERLINE: If it has a bearing on the
Wolfmann case, then we may have to disagree.

687
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,580
Look, I really wish
I could help you guys out, but...

688
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,460
if you're so focused
on the Black Panthers...

689
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,550
then what's with your interest
in Mickey Wolfmann?

690
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,543
Is somebody playing Monopoly, uh...
with federal housing money?

691
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,900
Are you figuring Mickey's kidnapping
is a Black Panther operation?

692
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,500
They put the snatch on Mickey,
trying to prove a political point...

693
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,182
or maybe a nice shot
at some ransom money?

694
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,700
Maybe you've thought of putting that forward
as a cover story for whatever did happen.

695
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,382
Do you realize how thoroughly
we can fuck your life up?

696
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,226
Huh. Uh-huh.

697
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,220
Right.

698
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,820
Can I be frank a minute?

699
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,100
- FLATWEED: Why stop now?
- BORDERLINE: Please.

700
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,700
All right. You be Dino.
You be the other guy.

701
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,300
And tell Penny Davis, Jr.
what a lovely day we had. Thank you.

702
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,580
As a COINTELPRO informant, you could
be making up to $300 a month, Larry.

703
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,340
Just consider that.

704
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,820
U.S. dollars?

705
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,860
And we'll throw in a Book of Mormon.

706
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,107
Free.

707
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,140
PETUNIA: Doc, a mysterious,
young oriental cutie...

708
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,822
just dropped off a package
for you at the front desk.

709
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,146
Well...

710
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,020
it's dark and lonely work,
but somebody's gotta do it, right?

711
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,020
JADE: Heard they cut you loose.
Need to see you about something.

712
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,780
I'm working weeknights
at Club Asiatique in San Pedro.

713
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,108
Love and peace, Jade.

714
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,541
[WHISPERING]
P.S. Beware the Golden Fang!

715
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,020
I can't stay out here long.
This is Golden Fang territory.

716
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,460
A girl don't necessarily wanna get
into difficulties with those folks.

717
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,500
What is it? A band?

718
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,820
You wish.

719
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,660
I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
I felt shitty about what I did.

720
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,500
- Which was what again?
- I'm not a snitch.

721
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,580
The cops said they'd drop charges
if we put you in the scene...

722
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,940
which they already knew you were.

723
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,260
- I'm, like, so sorry, Larry.
- Call me Doc. It's cool, Jade.

724
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,460
- That copper?
- Mm, Bigfoot?

725
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,100
He's a warped sheet of plastic.

726
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,820
Mm. So was it Bigfoot who put me
on the Buenos Noches Express...

727
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,181
or did he subcontract it?

728
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,300
I missed all that, man. Last thing
I remember was eating Bambi's pussy...

729
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,420
and Puck Beaverton's tattoo,
like, it was pulsating.

730
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,660
Puck...? What's a Puck Beaverton?

731
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,740
He's a baldheaded asshole
with a swastika tattoo you don't wanna meet.

732
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,945
We were so freaked with the BadAss Brigade
stomping in there, we didn't stick around.

733
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,660
There's somebody who wants to talk to you.
He thinks you can help each other out.

734
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,229
He's a new face. I'm not sure of his name,
but I know he's in some trouble.

735
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,140
I would've come by your office, man...

736
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,220
but I thought
there might be unfriendly eyeballs.

737
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,700
Hi.

738
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,660
Well, is this safe enough
for you out here?

739
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,340
Let's light this and pretend
we came out to smoke.

740
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,900
- All right.
- I'm supposed to be dead.

741
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,100
There's also a rumor that you're not.

742
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,220
That don't come as such great news.
Being dead is part of my job image.

743
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,024
Like what I do.

744
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,580
You working
for these people at the club?

745
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,820
I don't know. Maybe.
It's where I pick up my paycheck.

746
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,300
Where are you staying?

747
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,340
House in Topanga Canyon.

748
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,580
Band I used to play for, The Boards.

749
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,820
But none of them know it's me.

750
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,940
How can they not know it's you?

751
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,540
Even when I was alive,
they didn't know it was me.

752
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,220
- The sax player. The session guy.
- Mm.

753
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,380
Plus, over the years, there's been
a big turnover in personnel.

754
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,500
Like, The Boards I played with...

755
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,740
most of them have gone off
and formed other bands.

756
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,740
Only one or two of the old crew left...

757
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,580
and, luckily, they're suffering
from heavy Doper's Memory.

758
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,020
DOC: Mm.

759
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,420
Story is you came to grief
behind some bad smack.

760
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,140
You still into that?

761
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,580
No.

762
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,466
No.

763
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,228
I'm clean these days.

764
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,180
I spent my time rehabilitating up in...

765
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,700
- You know, I...
- It's okay.

766
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,500
How can I talk about what I don't hear?

767
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,906
Yeah.

768
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,620
The thing I wanted to see you about...

769
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,020
I was wondering
if you could check on people.

770
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,180
A lady and a little girl.

771
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
See if they're okay,
without bringing me into it.

772
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,900
It's down in Torrance.
Just see if they're still living there.

773
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,380
See what's in the driveway.

774
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,100
Law enforcement in the picture,
any details you find interesting.

775
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,984
All right, I'm on it.

776
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,581
I can't pay you right now.

777
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,260
When you can.

778
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,620
Unless you believe
information is money...

779
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,940
in which case,
I could ask you something.

780
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,740
Bearing in mind that either
I don't know...

781
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,511
or it's my ass if I tell you...

782
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,580
what is it?

783
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,700
Ever heard of the Golden Fang?

784
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,660
Sure. It's a boat.

785
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,340
- A boat?
- A big schooner, somebody said.

786
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,545
Brings stuff in and out of the country,
but no one wants to talk about it.

787
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,585
Because?

788
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,065
That was it.

789
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,860
How do you know?

790
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,189
Saw it sail in when I got here tonight.

791
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,020
DOC: I don't know what I just saw.

792
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,710
COY: Me neither.

793
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,389
Fact, I don't even wanna know.

794
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,540
- SORTILÈGE: Okay.
- Coy.

795
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,620
SORTILÈGE: Doc figured it might
have been easier to let Coy know...

796
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,900
that Hope and little Amethyst
were doing just fine.

797
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,820
But he had a rule against getting
involved in matrimonials...

798
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,220
which had just gone up in smoke...

799
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,740
like the Asian indica in the joint
they'd been smoking...

800
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,300
creating an extra layer of fog on top
of the one Doc was already standing inside of.

801
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,020
SAUNCH: Meet the schooner Golden Fang,
out of Charlotte Amalie.

802
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,666
- DOC: Where is that?
- U.S. Virgin Islands.

803
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,500
- Bermuda Triangle?
- Close enough.

804
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,623
Sizable vessel.

805
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,620
She has a tendency to show up here
in the middle of the night...

806
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,340
no running lights...

807
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,140
no radio traffic.

808
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,300
See, the problem with this vessel
is trying to find out anything.

809
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,027
People back off, change the subject
and get real creepy.

810
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,946
The owners are listed
as a consortium in the Bahamas.

811
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,780
Her real name isn't really
the Golden Fang.

812
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,060
She was originally a fishing boat
named Preserved.

813
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,980
Then after World War II,
she was bought by Burke Stodger.

814
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,380
Burke Stodger. Burke Stodger the actor?
.45-Caliber Kissoff Burke Stodger?

815
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,945
The movie star.

816
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,111
What?

817
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,700
He gets blacklisted because of his politics
and branded a communist.

818
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,260
So he takes the boat,
splits the country...

819
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,420
which is where
your Bermuda Triangle comes in.

820
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,544
Hi. I'm Chlorinda. How can I help you?

821
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,180
Uh, well, I'm gonna have
the house anchovy loaf to start...

822
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,300
and, um... the devil ray filet.

823
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,820
Can I get that deep-fried
in beer batter?

824
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,060
It's your stomach.
What can I get for you, little buddy?

825
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,340
Mm, I'll take the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the eel Trovatore, please.

826
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,220
Okay. And to drink, gentlemen?

827
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,540
You'll wanna get fucked up
before this meal.

828
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,740
That's for sure.

829
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,380
I have some recommendations.
Maybe the, uh... Tequila Zombie.

830
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,900
- Make it two.
- All right.

831
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,511
Thank you.

832
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,069
So Burke's blacklisted, takes the boat,
splits the country.

833
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,060
Somewhere between San Pedro and Papeete,
the boat disappears...

834
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,900
till one day a couple years later...

835
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,220
the boat and the owner
suddenly reappear.

836
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,460
- You dig?
- Mm-hm.

837
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,028
The Preserved is in
the opposite ocean, off of Cuba...

838
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,060
and Burke Stodger on the front page
of the Daily Variety...

839
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,940
in an article reporting
his return to pictures...

840
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,462
in a major motion picture
called Commie Confidential.

841
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,580
Whoa. So Burke's working again.

842
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,300
And his politics have
miraculously changed.

843
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,547
And the ship?

844
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,060
Man, they removed any traces
of soul that she once had.

845
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,500
It's a horror story.

846
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,309
Are you emotionally involved?
With the boat?

847
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,141
She's not just a boat, Doc.

848
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,148
She's much more than that.

849
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,820
All right.

850
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,467
Well, I know why I'm so interested.

851
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,420
But why are you?

852
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,908
