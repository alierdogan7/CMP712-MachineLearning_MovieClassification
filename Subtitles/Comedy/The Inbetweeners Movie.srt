1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,673
So, you see the thing is, Dad,
I could reapply next year,

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,473
but if I defer and try again for Oxford,
I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,509
Mm...

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,278
which is a good university
but not my dream.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,753
Do you think
it matters in the long term,

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,189
or is the subject and standard of degree
more important?

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,673
So, I got married.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,756
- What?!
- To Suzy, we got married.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,835
You mean remarried.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,677
This time it's for keeps, though.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,517
- When did this happen?
- A few weeks ago.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,949
I was going to invite you,
but I know how you are around people.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,672
How am I?!

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
Awkward. Weird.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,709
I don't live in a cave.
I live in suburban London.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,432
I spend my entire life around people.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,630
Much as I'd like to,
it's almost impossible to avoid them.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,159
See, this is what I mean.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,634
Well... Was it a big wedding?

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,275
No. Couple of hundred close friends
and family.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,833
- And it was perfect.
- Mm.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,835
I can't believe you didn't invite me
to your wedding.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,075
So, what are you up to this summer?

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,348
Oh, you're changing the subject?

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,753
- Mm-hm.
- Fine.

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,030
I dunno.
I guess I'll be going on holiday.

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,435
Oh, this should be good.
What have you got planned?

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,711
Trans-Siberian Express?
Fossil-hunting in Dorset?

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,478
Or maybe something even weirder.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,877
No, actually. Something normal. I'm going
somewhere normal, with my normal friends,

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,148
to a place full of normal people.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,559
And you, of course.

[WILL]: In case you were wondering,
that was me with my father.

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,118
And this is where I live -
not with him, but with my mother.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,674
It's a long story. Well, not that long.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,836
He shagged the work experience girl
and then left us.

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,552
So, just clichÃ©d, really.

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,512
Plus, it only happened two years ago,
so I don't even get the luxury

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,233
of blaming my various personality defects
on their divorce.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,671
Anyway, that's how I ended up here -
the very definition of suburbia.

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,953
Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -
and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,436
Maybe that's unfair, as they do say
that you never know what goes on

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,436
behind the net curtains of suburbia.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,950
Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's
case, you can have a pretty good guess.

Mmm.

I'm feeling sexy!

Take off mask, baby, let me see you.

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,357
Nah.

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,710
Do you promise this'll be
properly filthy, yeah?

Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.

Oh, yes, you also make me erect.

Now, put in card details.
Oh, I'm so horny.

Ooh, excuse me.

Hello?

Ohh...

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,039
It's a bit over, is that OK?

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,069
Not really.

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,628
- Excuse me! My prawns?
- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,679
Cheers for that.

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,871
- You don't have to thank me every time.
- Oh, right. Cool.

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,319
You're so fit.

77

Simon, we need to talk.

78
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,158
Oh, not talking!

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,192
- Look, it's been great so far...
- It's been amazing.

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,789
Literally the best year of my life.

And I'm definitely getting better
at kissing, aren't I?

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,074
I think we should break up.

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,758
What?

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,030
We're both going away to uni soon,

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,355
and it'll be too hard to keep it going
long-distance.

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,311
- It won't be fair on either of us.
- I don't mind.

You will mind, though. You will.

I bloody won't!

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,476
Plus, I'm going on holiday soon,
so there's that.

Why? What are you planning to do
on holiday?

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,595
Maybe you should just go home.

I just need some space to think
at the moment.

[WILL]:
It was our last ever day of school,

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,198
something my new stepmum had
experienced only four years ago herself.

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,595
So the head of Sixth was going to say
a few inspirational words.

112
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,350
And if ever there was a man for the job,
it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,676
I will forget each and every one of you
almost immediately.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
So, if you do find yourself
at a loose end next year,

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,471
and think it might be nice to pop in
and see how we're getting on,

116
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,954
don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Society

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,470
and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two
who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,036
I especially don't want to hear about
how well you're settling down at uni

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,469
or how much growing up you've done
in the past 12 months.

120
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,149
At best, I am ambivalent
towards most of you,

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,395
but some of you, I actively dislike,

122
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,557
for no other reason
than your poor personal hygiene

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,558
or your irritating personalities.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,070
I hope I've made myself clear
on this point.

125
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,078
And in case any of you think
I'm joking... I'm not.

126
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,714
I assure you
that once my legal obligation...

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,796
to look after your best interests
is removed,

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,389
I can be one truly nasty fucker.

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,034
Good luck with the rest of your lives
and... try not to kill anyone.

130
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,991
It reflects very badly on all of us here.

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,352
Slightly more upbeat
than I was expecting.

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,517
[WILL]: They say your school days
are the best days of your life.

133
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,993
But the only way
that would be true for me...

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,918
would be if I went straight from school
to prison and stayed there until I died.

135
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,837
How many times is that
she's caught you now?

136
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,757
Four. But this was the worst.

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,394
Mask, snorkel, ham.

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,998
OK, one last one for luck.

139
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,871
Ooooh!

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,718
Good. Old-school wedgie.
To be admired, in a way.

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,708
Mark! What the fuck
do you think you're doing? Put him down.

144
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,239
All right, calm down.

145
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,111
Just saying goodbye to Bender Squad.

- Oh, grow up! God!

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,992
- Are you OK, Will?
- Fine! Slightly chafed arse crack,

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,998
- but, no, basically fine, thanks.
- Hi, Simon.

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,552
OK, well, bye, then.

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,679
Fucking bitch.

151
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,709
Is she?

No.

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,119
Oh, God... I just really miss her.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,793
It's all right, mate. I understand.
Anyone would miss those tits.

156
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,990
- It's not that, Neil.
- Is it her lovely snatch?

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,553
- No.
- I know it feels rough now, Si,

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,352
but you just need to give it some time.

159
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,834
I'm just worried I'll never get over her.

- Can you?

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,673
Yeah! From now on, every time
you mention the Moanatronic 5000,

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,188
- you get a slap in the balls.
- Do you mean Carli?

163
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,276
Ow! For fuck's sake, Jay!

164
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,276
- [NEIL]: You were warned.
- How's that helping?!

165
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,276
Stopped you from crying like a baby,
for one.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,198
So my life is still ruined,
but now my balls ache too. Thanks, Jay(!)

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,312
No, your life is just about to begin,
mate!

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,557
Now you've been dumped, we can all go
on a mental holiday together.

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,912
Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,952
sex, minge, fanny and tits.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,069
And booze.

172
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,473
And sex!

173
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,630
He's put it horrifically,
but he's probably right.

174
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,113
A holiday would definitely
take your mind off her.

175
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,991
[JAY]:
Plus, it's the perfect time to go.

176
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,508
[NEIL]: Yeah, they say the summer is
the perfect time for a summer holiday.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,551
[WILL]: Come on, Si, what do you say?
The lads on tour!

178
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,398
- [NEIL]: And you.
- [WILL]: Yes, and me! One of the lads.

179
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,635
Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.
Maybe it will help.

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,398
Course it will!
And, I promise you, Si,

181
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,196
we'll go somewhere
so full of fit birds,

182
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:03,797
it'll be like shooting
clunge in a barrel.

183
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,831
What a lovely image(!)

184
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,316
[WILL]: So, that was it.
We were no longer schoolboys.

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,634
And to prove our independence,

186
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,558
we were off on the holiday of a lifetime
without our parents...

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,238
after we'd made them pay for it.

188
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,189
I know this is the first time you've ever
been away from me, but don't go crazy.

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,355
When have I ever gone crazy?!

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,312
That time you drank all that shandy
at Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!

191
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,669
- I was seven years old!
- He was running round, his pants down,

192
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,119
shouting, "I've got a white slug!"

193
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,436
- Mum!
- Oh, hello, Kevin!

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,040
Looks like just Jay
we're waiting for, then.

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,311
Yes, it does "look like" that,
doesn't it? God! Sorry about her.

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,713
Are you all right, Neil?
Your face is a bit weird.

197
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,116
Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister's
fake tan on, get it started, you know.

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,354
Just on your face?

199
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,630
Well... It's on my hands now too.

200
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,398
All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?

201
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,512
Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.
Nice to meet you.

202
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,358
Where's Neil been hiding you, then?
The church? (LAUGHS)

203
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,914
- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?
- No, no, I'm not a vicar.

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,918
No, I know that. But you look like
a vicar and you talk like a vicar.

205
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,679
A bloody gay vicar, or something!
(LAUGHS)

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,439
Well, I'm not a vicar and I'm not gay.

207
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,198
No, I'm saying you look gay.

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,915
But you can't be, can you? Cos old
soppy bollocks here come out your pipe.

209
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,316
Right, I see.

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,476
Well, gotta get going.
Don't want you to miss that flight.

211
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,232
Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. Love you, mwah!

212
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,710
Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spend
your grandad's money chasing skirt,

213
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,594
two things. One, make sure she's not
a hound like the last one.

214
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,633
And two, try to be a man when she dumps
you for someone with a bigger cock...

215
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,189
...which is everyone! (LAUGHS)

216
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,356
Dad!

217
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,358
[WILL]: Dads are like arseholes.
Everyone's got one, yes,

218
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,836
but also, they're arseholes. Which is why
they make excellent cab drivers.

219
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,030
Takes me back, all this -
cheap flights at ungodly hours.

220
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,548
Where is it you're headed to again?
Simon never tells me anything.

221
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,989
- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.
- Can't say I've heard of it.

222
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,598
Of course you haven't,
it's a cool place to go.

223
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,073
And it's got a Subway's.

224
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,156
Oh, right. In my day,
it was all about Spain.

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,316
Me and my mates went to Magaluf
this one time.

226
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,715
- Shagaluf, we called it!
- (NEIL LAUGHS)

227
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,469
Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.
Anything that moved.

228
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,238
We had a system.

229
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,316
Always left a hat on the bedroom door
when one of us got lucky.

230
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,793
Was usually me.

231
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,909
Oh, Dad, please shut up!

232
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,949
I don't know what it is,

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,434
but you'll find girls just seem to
let themselves go a bit more abroad.

234
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,358
It's like as soon as they smell
the sun cream, they get wet.

235
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,437
- Your mother's the same, even now.
- Oh, God, just drop us here!

236
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,516
[WILL]: I was learning a lot
about holidays.

237
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,028
And not just what they did
to Mrs Cooper's front bottom.

238
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,230
I was also learning
that on a lads' holiday,

239
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,635
it's compulsory to wear
"hilarious" matching T-shirts.

240
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,113
Here y'are.

241
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,272
Nice!

242
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,790
Right, you owe me 12 quid each.
Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.

243
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,513
Right, so I've got to pay more money
for a T-shirt I didn't ask for

244
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,835
and I'm not going to wear, cos it carries
a nickname I didn't know I had?

245
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,074
- Yes.
- Great(!)

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,553
(THEY LAUGH)

247
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,112
# Come on, come on, come on, come on

248
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,958
# Got my peeps standing with me
at the bar doing shots

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,798
# Cos now we're so fucking plastered
we don't know when to stop

250
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,752
# I got my peeps standing with me
and I'm having a blast

251
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,633
# I'm feeling so fucking good right now
I want it to last

252
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,240
# I'm at the bar and I see this chick
checking me out

253
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,431
# From afar, yes, she wants my dick
There ain't a doubt

254
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,358
# Now I'm in a lift, getting lips
How dumb is this girl?

255
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,678
# But do I care? Do I fuck!
I'm on a roll! Yo! #

256
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,551
Malia flight?

257
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,669
Yep.

258
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,914
Delay, seven hours.

259
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,350
And please remove those T-shirts,
or we won't allow you to board the plane.

260
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,358
[WILL]: Despite Neil offering... twice,
they didn't let him drive the plane.

261
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,994
Finally, though, we'd made it on holiday,

262
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,430
and Jay's thoughts on the beautiful isle
of Crete, birthplace of Zeus,

263
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,879
were as insightful as ever.

264
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,915
- I'm hot.
- It is well hot.

265
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,439
- Might be too hot.
- Might be.

Carls!

269
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,554
Oh.

270
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,158
Sorry.

271
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,396
(BUZZ OF CONVERSATION)

272
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,475
Oi, Jay, Jay...

273
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,919
Tidy minge, ten o'clock.

274
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,391
Jay? Jay!

275
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,635
Didn't you see them girls?

276
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,874
Why don't you chirps 'em?

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.
- Really? What about that netball team?

278
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,877
Yeah, that was all right,
cos that was a luxury caravan.

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,399
But this coach is way too small
for my moves.

280
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,873
Ah, course.

281
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,480
Right, so, the plan is
get to the apartment, unpack,

282
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,112
get some sleep,
then head out fresh tomorrow.

283
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,799
First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.

284
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,193
[JAY]: Have you come on a lads' holiday
by mistake?!

285
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,498
We haven't come
halfway round the world...

286
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,199
to look at some boring fucking
Greek ruins.

287
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,117
Yeah, you can see that shit
anywhere.

288
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,835
We go there, drop the bags off,
then go straight out and get spasticated.

289
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,029
Simples.

290
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,752
But I've not slept for 37 hours.

291
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,836
Shut up and try and get
some sleep on here, then.

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,598
Fine, good idea.

football, I say yes. I do like football.

300
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,918
But not Burnley.

301
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,916

how the dog died.

I can only presume it threw itself
in the well, rather than stay here.

- Are you stopping here?
- Yes. We are.

Bad luck. I've just come back
from Afghanistan,

323
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,316
and conditions there
are better than this shithole.

in a dusty trench,

it's my fucking fault.

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,798
if our human rights
had been breached,

333
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,671
I couldn't help thinking
a shit on the floor...

334
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,995
might have
cheered the place up a bit.

335
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,396
- [JAY AND NEIL]: Shotgun this room!
- Shotgun the sofa bed!

336
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,714
Well, where am I gonna sleep, then?!

337
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,354
Not really my problem.

338
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,311
What's that? Is that the bath?

339
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,670
Course it's not the bath,
you fucking idiot. There's the bath!

340
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,312
That's the... kids' toilet.

341
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,509
- Is it?
- Yes!

342
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,437
Why's it got a plughole and a tap, then?

343
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,675
Cos it's for checking your kid's shit
before you flush it.

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,392
- Urgh, that's grim!
- Yeah, I know.

345
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,635
That's the Continentals, innit?
They're dirty.

346
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,750
See? That looks nice!

347
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,439
I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtub
for two weeks, Simon!

348
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,799
We'll have to share the sofa bed.

349
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,989
(HIGH-PITCHED) Ooh, 'ello!

350
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,828
Right, well, while you two decide
who gets first go on each other's cocks,

351
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,279
I'm getting ready and getting out there.

352
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,878
The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,
you know.

353
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,831
Charming(!)

354
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,596
(JAY SCREAMS)

355
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,911
[WILL]: Finally, smelling like an
industrial accident at the Lynx factory,

356
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,270
and looking like the world's
shittest boy band, we hit the town.

357
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,398
- Ooh, heads down, boys.
- [NEIL]: Shit.

358
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,273
What? Why? We haven't done anything!

359
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,311
- Foreign police, innit?
- So?

360
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,873
Don't you even know about foreign police?

361
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,797
What, short-sleeved uniforms?
Chunkier truncheons?

362
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,434
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Mate, they're all corrupt.

363
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,870
Basically, if you misbehave
and don't have the money to bribe 'em,

364
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,433
they take you up
to these shepherds' huts in the hills,

365
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,198
beat you up and bum ya.

366
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,912
And if they don't kill ya,
you kill yourself,

367
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,269
cos of the shame of getting a boner
whilst you was being bummed.

368
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,153
Right, couple of things. Firstly,
the hills here are full of timeshares,

369
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,474
not deserted shepherds' huts.

370
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,432
Secondly, Crete's in the EU,
so I think the standard of policing

371
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,516
probably goes beyond bumming
and forced suicide.

372
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,632
Believe what you want. I'm keeping
a bribe up my arse just in case.

373
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,877
You're gonna spend the whole holiday with
20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole?

374
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,150
It's been up there since
the seatbelt signs went off, mate.

375
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,034
All right, lads! Holiday, is it? I'm out
here on my own, having a mental time!

376
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,832
Can I have a beer?

377
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,916
- Oh, here you go, mate.
- No, you can't!

378
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,951
All right, which is it?
You say yes, he says bloody no.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,638
He's not your boss, is he? Eh?

380
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,319
Well, it's been great talking to you,
but we've really got to get a move on.

381
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,793
Can I come round yours for a shower?

382
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,353
Um, no.

383
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,789
No? Cool beans. See you later, lads!

384
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,308
Richard, yeah? Richard!

385
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,476
[WILL]:
Well, Richard was clearly mental.

386
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,398
But as we were about to discover,
so was everything else here.

387
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,871
# This place about to blow

388
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,432
# Blow

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,234
# This place about to blow

390
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,231
# Blow

391
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,316
# This place about to blow

392
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,678
# This place about to blow... #

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,554
[WILL]: While Simon was seeing
Carli everywhere,

394
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,717
- Jay was seeing some very lucky ladies.
- She'd get it.

395
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,398
[NEIL]: Most definitely!

396
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,839
Oh, and that one. She'd get it!

397
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,190
- And that one! And that one.
- And that one. She'd get it.

398
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,559
Right in the bumholey.

399
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,670
I can't believe I've already got a bird.
Gutted.

400
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,191
So fucking what?! All birds know -
what goes on tour stays on tour.

401
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,549
No, I couldn't do that to Nicole.
I think I love her.

402
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,556
And I never loved anything before
apart from a car or a sandwich.

403
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,431
All right, lads!
Are you up for a good time?

404
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,833
Yeah, we're always up for a good time.

405
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,199
We're the Pussay Patrol.

406
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,753
All right. Well, if you really are
the Pussay Patrol...

407
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,552
- Which we are.
- You're obviously going to Marco's.

408
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,898
It's the most
buzzing bar out here.

409
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,799
Always packed
with a chilled-out, sexy vibe.

410
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,991
- Know what I mean?
- I don't really know what you mean.

411
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,235
When you say "sexy vibe",
do you mean girls?

412
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,349
Course! Loads of girls.

413
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,676
I'll sort you out half-price drinks
and a free fishbowl.

414
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,199
Cool, cool, cool.

415
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,390
So, will you be in there,
with your sexiness,

416
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,150
making the vibe all... sexy?
Being all sexy, and that, sexy?

417
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,599
Say "sexy" more.

418
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,870
Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,
you saucy bugger!

419
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,070
Come on, then!

420
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,715
Here you go, these four. I'll see you
in a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.

421
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,909
Large one?

422
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,190
Saucy! See you later.

423
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,834
Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!

424
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,509
Yep! He shoots, he scores.
Right up the vag.

425
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,755
Oh, my God, if she's outside,
imagine the birds inside!

426
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,554
Ah. Interesting.

427
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,431
Well, it must get going a bit later.
She did say it was amazing.

428
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,516
And why would she lie?!

429
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,069
All right, mate. Four pints, four
JÃ¤germeisters and a fishbowl, please.

430
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,309
Hello.

431
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,397
- When it good here?
- Sorry?

432
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,398
Er, when here party good?

433
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,634
In normally about an hour or two.

434
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,875
Oh. Well, as we've paid,
maybe we should hang on, then?

435
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,353
But this year... never.

436
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,119
- Thanking you, very much.
- OK, let's go.

437
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,116
Fuck off! My bird'll be down in a minute.

438
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,232
Do you mean the woman who's clearly
on commission to trick people

439
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,269
into this empty bar?

440
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,992
No, I mean the little hottie outside
that I was flirting with.

441
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,075
I'll take that as a yes, then.

442
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,758
I'm going nowhere
till she's sucked me off!

443
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,394
- So you're going nowhere.
- [WILL]: Jay, we're on holiday!

444
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,113
I'm meant to be out there, trying to
hit on girls I think are beneath me

445
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,720
but who, for their part, won't give me
the time of day! So, let's go!

446
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,469
Ooh! Hello, hello! It's those little
lovelies from the coach!

447
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,670
- That one's not so little.
- I think they're looking at us.

448
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,280
And not in a weird, terrified,
"leave us alone" way. Amazing!

449
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,753
Jay, you're drunkest.
Go over and talk to them.

450
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,712
Nah. Not me, mate. None of them
are as fit as my one outside.

451
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,433
Why go for hamburgers
when you've got steak at home?

452
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,711
If, like you, you have neither anywhere.
It's up to you, then, Si.

453
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,193
Oh, shit, really?
I don't know if I'm over Carli.

454
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,789
- Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!
- Yes, I can.

455
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,831
When you stop being
such a pussy about your ex.

456
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,950
It's time to get back
on the horse now, Si.

457
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,558
And those little ponies need feeding.

458
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,437
Feed the pony.

459
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,631
Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,
but we've all got to go over together.

460
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,114
- Great.
- You fucking sad cases.

461
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,748
You don't just walk up
to a girl in a club...

462
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,949
and introduce yourself!
That's creepy.

463
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,718
Clubs have different rules,
you dick.

464
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,514
Look, you dance over near them, make
the eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.

465
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,629
Really?!

466
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,910
- Annoyingly, that does sound right.
- Thank you!

467
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,996
And then, after a bit,
you stand up behind them,

468
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,951
pretend to slap 'em
and fuck 'em up the arse.

469
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,877
- That might be a bit much.
- Yeah, I dunno...

470
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,459
- Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.
- - What about Nicole?

471
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,035
It's only dancing,
she likes my dancing.

472
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,718
Stick with me,
you'll be fine.

473
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,309
Right, then, Si.
Looks like the holiday starts here.

474
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,319
[# YOLANDA BE COOL]:
We No Speak Americano)

475
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,238
Am I doing it right? Am I in time?

476
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,033
Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.
Copy Neil.

477
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,192
Sorry. Do you mind
if we come and talk to you?

478
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,198
Cos you look nice, and, frankly, this is
just humiliating for everyone involved.

479
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,310
Um...

480
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,237
Sit down, Specs.

481
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,072
Hello. I'm Lucy.

482
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,476
Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon!
I'm Simon.

483
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,678
I'd better not get stuck
with the fat one.

484
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,631
So, when Alison
initially suggested Malia,

485
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:06,232
we all thought,
yeah, why not?

486
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,475
It'll be ironic.
Then we had a reality check

487
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,239
and we thought, do we honestly wanna
spend 2 weeks somewhere being ironic,

488
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,158
and obviously the answer was no,
so then we looked at other places,

489
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,328
but we realised, actually,

490
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,729
we just wanna have a laugh
and go clubbing and get drunk...

491
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,556
and be silly, and that this might
genuinely be a good place to come,

492
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,794
so fuck it, here we are.

493
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,230
Just so you know, I've met a really
fit bird, and she'll be along any minute.

494
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,829
OK. She won't mind you talking to me,
then, will she?

495
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,520
[WILL]: If our dancing was bad...
and it was bad...

496
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
then our small talk was even worse.

497
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,189
They were useless. It was up to me, and
so I dived in with my best chat-up line.

498
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,196
- I'm Will, by the way.
- Alison.

499
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,630
So, do this place hire you out as
some sort of avant-garde dance troupe

500
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,999
to scare the customers off?

501
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,112
No. I lost my mind and agreed to come
here on holiday. What's your excuse?

502
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,513
Sort of similar.

503
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,233
I came out here earlier this summer and
fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,

504
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,919
- so now I'm back.
- Hilarious. Course you did.

505
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,313
What was he, a barman or a waiter?

506
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,669
- Waiter.
- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?

507
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,631
- Nicos.
- Too good.

508
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,874
I bet he's different to all the boys
back home!

509
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,309
Yeah. He understands women, for one.

510
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,032
I'm sure he does.
Must get enough practice.

511
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,833
[WILL]: Not only had Jay not offered
to buy Jane a drink,

512
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,075
he'd now stopped paying for his own.
Meanwhile,

513
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,509
Simon had finally found a subject
he was sure Lucy would love.

514
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,518
It was devastating cos she's definitely
the most beautiful girl I've ever met.

515
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,393
She's so fascinating,
she's really funny, you know.

516
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,908
Oh, right. In what sort of way?

517
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,951
Just like, you know when something's
funny and people get it?

518
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,319
Yes?

519
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,113
So in that way. And also in a comedy way.

520
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,831
Neil was a man of few words.

521
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,677
But even for him, this was ridiculous.

522
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,075
Luckily, he had a trump card to play.

523
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,599
D'you wanna dance?

524
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,956
[WILL]: Meanwhile,
Alison didn't seem to be enjoying...

525
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,672
my hilarious Greek waiter impression.

526
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,076
So, I presume he wooed you with the old,
"Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!

527
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,079
"You hh'only girl for me!
There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!

528
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,680
"Oh, wait, here comes the next plane
from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby".

529
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,314
Sorry, you do realise
I'm not playing along with the joke.

530
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,193
I do genuinely have a Greek waiter
boyfriend called Nicos.

531
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,559
No, of course you do.

532
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,195
Brilliant. Nicos.
You've really nailed the clichÃ©s.

533
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,633
- You are joking, aren't you?
- No.

534
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,309
His grandmother has as moustache
as well if that makes the stereotype...

535
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,310
even funnier.

536
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,557
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not like
every other waiter out here.

537
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,352
It's fine. You don't know
what you're talking about.

538
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,470
Your accent was pretty good, though.

539
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,751
Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to miss
my stereotypical Greek boyfriend.

540
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,119
He might get angry and smash some plates.

541
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,151
Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.

542
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,673
You're not normal, are you?

543
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,437
So then Carli said we needed some space.
And uni's coming up,

544
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,074
- so maybe she's right.
- Sorry, who's right?

545
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,314
- Carli?
- Who?

546
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,349
Carli, my ex?

547
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,949
You went out with a girl called Carli?
You should've said(!)

548
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,752
What? I did!
That's all I've been talking about.

549
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,869
Oh!

550
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,911
Yes, I was joking!

551
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,032
Sorry for going on about her. I usually
get a smack in the balls to stop me.

552
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,195
What?!

553
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,355
Um, nothing.

554
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,070
You all right, Lise?
Where's that bloke you were dancing with?

555
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,078
# I've got nothing but love for you

556
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,873
# I've got nothing but love for you

557
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,832
# I've got nothing but love for you... #

558
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,553
Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,
and I don't want to miss him.

559
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,478
So, shall we all hang out again sometime?

560
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,353
Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.

561
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,109
If I hear another bloke out here
refer to women as "gash", I'll scream.

562
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,134
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that is horrible
- It's awful...

563
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,235
- when men do that. Disgusting.
- Really bad.

564
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,033
Do you fancy coming to the all-day
boat party, Friday?

565
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,390
I know it's meant to be sold out, but
our rep reckons he can still get tickets.

566
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,032
All-day boat party - what's that?

567
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,794
Well, it's a party.

568
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,989
OK.

569
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,917
- All day.
- Yep.

570
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,430
- On a boat.
- Oh, right.

571
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,478
Well! Now that's been cleared up,
we should go.

572
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,999
See you later, Will.

573
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,148
Amazing.

574
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,237
Do you realise, we just danced over,
chatted up some girls,

575
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,918
they loved it and you didn't fuck it up!

576
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,552
- Me?!
- Are we players?

577
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,479
I'm starting to think that here, unlike
at home, we might actually be players.

578
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,318
Maybe. I'm not really sure
what that means.

579
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,794
However, cos I've not slept now
for two days, I'm going to bed.

580
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,193
Yeah. My eyeballs feel like
they've got paper cuts.

581
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,674
- Jay, are you coming?
- Fuck that!

582
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,517
There's a fit bird up there
who's so wet for me,

583
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,198
I can hear the waves breaking
in her fanny.

584
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,312
I'm gonna down this, then take her down
the beach and fuck her brains out.

585
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,749
Right, well, we've established
that isn't happening.

586
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,598
Fine. Watch me.

587
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,319
Mm. Classy(!)

588
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,078
We'd better get Neil.

589
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,676
- Neil...?
- Oh, God! We're off.

590
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,278
Right. Won't be a minute,
I'll just finish up here.

591
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,038
Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?

592
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,672
Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.

593
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,473
Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?

594
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,839
Right.

595
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,598
Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.

596
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,439
He's definitely picked up the pace.

597
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,556
[WILL]: While Neil picked up
his finger-banging speed,

598
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,717
we picked up Jay - and he had
a chilling prediction to share with us.

599
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,354
She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.
You watch.

600
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,550
I'd rather not watch,
if it's all the same to you.

601
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,953
Shit, is that Carli?

602
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,389
Look, Si, it's normal
that after a break-up,

603
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,477
you'll think you see her everywhere,
but she's not here.

604
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,953
Yeah. I suppose.

605
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,877
- Could be her.
- What?

606
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,717
Could be her.
She is out here at the moment.

607
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,909
What?!

608
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,030
Well, we weren't sure where
the best place to go was,

609
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,514
and her and her mates are pretty cool,
so I asked them where they was going

610
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,834
and when, and that's why I booked Malia.

611
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,269
You fucking idiot!
I came away to try and get over her!

612
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,197
- Did ya?
- You know I did!

613
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,593
Oh, yeah, course.

614
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,037
Oh, God, look at her.

615
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,356
Do you think this is fate?
Her being here, me being here.

616
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,958
No. I think Neil asked her
where she was going

617
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,718
and then booked the same place,
like he just said.

618
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,193
Let's go before she sees us!

619
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,639
No, no. I've got to go and talk to her.

620
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,319
If there's even the slightest chance
of us getting back together,

621
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,429
I've got to take it.

622
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,959
Carli!

623
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,069
Carli?

624
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,109
Simon?!

625
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,593
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

626
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,119
Stalking you abroad.

627
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,549
No. The opposite, actually.
Just a mix-up by my friends.

628
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,716
My stupid fucking idiot friends.

629
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,512
Well, whatever. It's great to see you.

630
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,709
Is it?!

631
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,079
Yeah, it is. Course.

632
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,190
Course.

633
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,630
So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?
How about right now?

634
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,150
Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll be
at the boat party on Friday, right?

635
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,670
The boat party? I was literally
just talking about the boat party.

636
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,870
It's gonna be amazing. The best way
to round off our holiday.

637
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,639
What? Why are you going? Don't go.

638
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,557
I've got to go.
My flight leaves on Saturday.

639
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,431
The boat's our last chance to party.

640
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,550
Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,
then.

641
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,431
For total, one million per cent.
Definitely.

642
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,357
Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.

643
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,753
- I've missed you.
- Hmm?

644
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,358
Argh, Jesus!

645
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,595
- Fuck it!
- Sorry, mate.

646
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,589
- James! Are you all right, Simon?
- (WHIMPERS) Yeah, fine. Argh!

647
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,358
I'll walk it off.

648
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,550
Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,
we've gotta go.

649
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,919
Oh, do you two know each other?

650
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,075
Yeah, James is our rep.

651
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,238
Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out club
nights. A bit of party organising, PR...

652
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,670
Just make sure everyone's having
a good time, you know what I mean?

653
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,234
- Are you sure you're all right, mate?
- All good...

654
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,271
Cool. Carls, come on.

655
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,757
Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.

656
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,394
See you, mate. Mind that leg.

657
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,912
I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.

658
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,188
Oi, baby, you stood me up!

659
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,310
Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.

660
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,679
Come on, kiss me.

661
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,948
I'm working, darling.

662
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,752
I love your boobs.

663
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,915
What?!

664
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,791
What gives you the right to touch me,
you fucking prick?

665
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,829
Wha...?

666
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,836
Sorry, I think he might've had
a little too much of the old drink.

667
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,758
I am sick of every dickhead
thinking he's got touching rights,

668
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,315
just cos I smiled at him.
It's my fucking job, you cretin!

669
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,395
Are you on the blob?

670
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,318
Sexy. I like it.

671
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,511
- No, Jay. Time for bed.
- Fuck that!

672
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,915
You two can bum yourselves to death
on the sofa bed.

673
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,996
I'm going to get another drink.

674
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,917
Jay, don't be insane.
You're too drunk already.

675
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,838
I'm on fucking holiday.
You can't be too drunk!

676
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,599
- You coming, Neil?
- Nah, I like it in there.

677
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,200
And not sleeping for two nights is pretty
much the same as not sleeping for one.

678
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,992
Right, fine.

679
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,268
Fucking knobheads.

680
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,349
How was your chat?

681
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,109
Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's what
she was worried about, us being apart.

682
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,832
That's why we split up.

683
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,359
But we're not apart,
because we're both here.

684
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,879
I just need to get on that boat.

685
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,718
Actually, can one of youse help me?
I think she might be a two-man job.

686
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,035
What happened to your leg?

687
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,038
- Oh, I got a little bit run over.
- "A little bit run over"?!

688
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,756
(WHOOPING)

689
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,030
[WILL]: The next morning,
I was woken up...

690
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,709
by what sounded like
Bigfoot having an asthma attack.

691
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,159
(WHOOPING)

692
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,270
Simon...

693
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,878
Simon!

694
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,354
Christ, it's like a sauna in here.

695
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,118
Have you got any water?

696
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,639
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

697
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,477
What the fuck is that noise?

698
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,033
I think it's Neil.

699
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,435
Oh, no, not the dinner lady
from last night!

700
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,869
[NEIL]:
I cannot understand a thing you say.

701
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,036
[WOMAN]:
Spunk all over me bastard tits.

702
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,469
Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.

703
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,274
[WOMAN]: Fucking smack it!
Smack it, you little prick!

704
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,072
[WOMAN]:
Is that all you've got?

705
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,599
- [NEIL]: Shall I bite it?
- Interesting question.

706
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,393
This is beyond creepy.

707
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,317
[WOMAN]:
Twist it right fookin' off!

708
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,952
OK, I'm getting out of here!

709
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,831
[WOMAN]: Harder!

710
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,474
How can I have spent 100 euros?

711
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,353
Holy shit,
I only budgeted 15 euros a day!

712
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,231
Great,
so I spunked all my money...

713
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,599
- in one night.
- All right!

714
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,629
Oh, Jesus, Neil!

715
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,035
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's on the way down.

716
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,911
- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?
- Who?

717
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,598
Nicole, the girlfriend
you've just cheated on?

718
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,838
Oh, no, no, cos we weren't kissing
and only the tip went in.

719
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,838
Any more than the tip is cheating, and I
would never do that, cos I've got ethics.

720
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,189
- Right...
- Anyone want breakfast?

721
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,318
No, I'm going to go
to the Palace Hotel.

722
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,019
It's where those girls we met
are staying.

723
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,778
Well, at least you've found
someone to stalk,

724
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,956
other than Carli.
Ow! Not me, Neil!

725
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,560
Lucy reckons their rep can still get boat
party tickets, actually.

726
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,068
Yeah, I'll come. Alison was nice. Neil?

727
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,953
Can't, I had a nightmare.
I left my trunks in England, didn't I?

728
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,479
Wear your Calvins.
They're practically the same.

729
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,115
- Can I, Will?
- Um, yeah, I suppose.

730
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,311
- And can I bring a ball?
- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.

731
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,476
Cool. Oh, have you guys seen Jay?

732
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,635
Shit, no, not since last night.

733
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,716
No, I mean have you seen him?
He's over there.

734
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,118
(GROANS)

735
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,034
[WILL]: So Jay had slept
face down in the dirt.

736
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,435
But I'd woken up listening to Neil
getting sucked off.

737
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,516
As far as I was concerned, he won.

738
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,478
Urgh, ohhh!

739
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,229
Face...!

740
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,793
Yeah, you've got something on your face.

741
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,509
It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.

742
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,278
Argh! Pain!

743
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,191
Tongue...

744
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,551
It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.
Not now she's been fed.

745
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,556
Hey, lover?

746
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,993
What the fuck was that?!

747
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,312
[WILL]: Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotel
was nicer than our hotel.

748
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,670
There are North Korean prison camps
which are nicer than our hotel.

749
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,278
But, like a North Korean prison camp,

750
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,470
it was overcrowded,
so we had nowhere to sit.

751
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,909
- What about there?
- They've got towels on them, Neil.

752
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,076
- So?
- That means people have bagsied them.

753
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,872
- We can't take those.
- Fuck that!

754
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,912
- No, Jay, we can't!
- Watch me!

755
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,279
It's probably just a load of Krauts

756
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,151
that got down early in the morning
to reserve 'em.

757
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,872
That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.

758
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,070
What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?

759
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,516
- Jay!
- Besides, I really need a lie down.

760
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,790
My head's more fucked
than Neil's dad's arsehole.

761
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,159
Jay, please!

762
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,918
[WILL]: Jay and Neil were off to,

763
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,349
as they put it,
"check out the chicas".

764
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,072
But I had a serious problem.

765
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,350
In the absence of my mother,
or a teacher,

766
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,118
I needed help with my sunblock.

767
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,434
Simon, will you do my back?

768
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,277
- No.
- No?!

769
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,232
- I don't want to touch you.
- Unbelievable.

770
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,633
Fine, I'll do it myself.

771
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,199
Look all right,
I'll do it with one finger.

772
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,832
Thank you.

773
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,628
You've got too much here.
And here. I'll scrape it off.

774
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,433
OK, but don't try and be funny and draw
a cock on my back or something.

775
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,754
No, course not.

776
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,638
Right, all done.

777
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,830
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

778
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,155
No, that was fine.

779
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,395
[WILL]:
I was really enjoying my book,

780
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,989
blissfully unaware of the crudely drawn
phallus burning itself onto my skin.

781
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,077
Meanwhile, Jay was having trouble
with his emergency funds.

782
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,078
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.

783
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,396
Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,
we've been spotted.

784
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,759
Seen 'em.

785
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,835
Look cool.

786
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,511
(LAUGHS) Manchester.

787
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,630
Manchester!

788
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,875
- Who's this little twat?
- You from Manchester?

789
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,955
You like Manchester?

790
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,150
- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.
- No, you aren't.

791
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,156
Shut up, Neil,
the birds are loving it.

792
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,232
- Goal!
- (LAUGHS) Goal!

793
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,748
Goal to Manchester! Yeah!

794
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,119
No. Manchester, down.

795
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,435
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

796
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,357
Yeah, hilarious.
Now, get out the way.

797
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,555
Whoa!

798
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,068
(LAUGHTER)

799
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,556
Right. You're fucking dead,
you little shit!

800
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,115
Mate, just leave it, the chicas
are looking, just laugh it off.

801
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,839
(FORCED LAUGHING)

802
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,434
No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.

803
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,629
(CLEARS THROAT)

804
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,910
Oh! Alison. Hello!

805
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,394
Hello. You know you've got
a spunking cock on your back?

806
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,795
What?

807
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,478
Oh, no.
Thanks, Simon, very funny,

808
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,839
very mature. So I've been lying here
with a cock on my back, have I?

809
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,432
Not for the first time.

810
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,950
I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makes
you feel less self-conscious.

811
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,479
It would, actually.
We'd make quite the pair.

812
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,476
You've got a really good spot here.

813
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,192
Yes, Jay, um...
sort of, um...

814
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,071
Did he use some of his boyish charm?

815
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,553
In a way, yes.

816
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,592
I think I might start drinking again.
Anyone fancy joining me?

817
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,993
Um, yes, I will!

818
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,234
Oh.

819
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,714
Lucky me(!)

820
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,716
Oh, I'm knackered.

821
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,911
- Fishbowl hangover?
- No. Nicos was over last night.

822
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,757
Does not stop talking.

823
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,438
No, we were having sex.

824
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,198
Right.

825
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,272
Sorry, does it make you uncomfortable
when I mention sex?

826
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,835
No! No, it's good,
it's great that you're so...

827
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,313
sexually active.

828
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,079
Yeah, I suppose it is.

829
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,398
- What's the best sex you've had, Will?
- Well, um... hard to say, really.

830
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,714
Come on, you can tell me.

831
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,796
Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.

832
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,558
Don't be boring, just tell me.

833
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,636
Look, I'm going to level with you,

834
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,558
I have never...
put my penis in a lady.

835
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,716
That's all right, you're a virgin,
that's cool.

836
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,320
It's definitely not cool.
If anything, it's famously uncool.

837
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,395
Well, it's cute, then.

838
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,919
Oh, God, that's even worse.

839
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,599
- You're funny, Will.
- Well, that's something.

840
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,551
Can I get a girl into bed for sex
just by making her laugh?

841
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,749
Course you can.

842
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,597
Wow! Great.

843
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,517
If she's a clinical moron.

844
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,237
Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.

845
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,714
What a welcome.
Nice to see you too.

846
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,796
Yeah. Good. Now, can you
still get boat party tickets?

847
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,513
I'd have thought so,
I'd just have to go and find the rep.

848
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,788
So are you coming along, then?

849
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,478
Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.

850
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,509
Great.

851
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,471
Cos Carli's here. In Malia.

852
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,669
And she's going to be
on the boat tomorrow.

853
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,870
If I can just get five minutes
alone with her,

854
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,717
I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.

855
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,593
So, can you go and get those tickets?

856
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,949
You really know how
to make a girl feel special, don't you?

857
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,752
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

858
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,119
Carli is going to love it.

859
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,149
Can you hurry up?

860
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,954
[WILL]:
Simon's plan was coming together.

861
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,675
Meanwhile, Jane was about to experience
the full force of Jay's boyish charm.

862
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,199
Can you move? You're blocking the sun.

863
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,559
Charming!

864
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,272
What's happened to your face, Jay?

865
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,594
It's a food allergy.

866
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,438
I could do with one of those,
maybe an iced-bun allergy.

867
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,993
Yeah. You could.

868
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,998
Meanwhile, Neil had
a surprise in store for Lisa.

869
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,918
Forgot my trunks.

870
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,110
Fancy a swim?

871
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,718
Oh, leave it out, you little prick.

872
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,076
Right, that's it!
I'm going to fucking kill ya,

873
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,792
- I'm going to fucking kill ya!
- Oi!

874
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,319
Those are our sunbeds.
And where's our towels?

875
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,998
Oh, good.

876
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,871
Well, there weren't any towels
when we arrived

877
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,114
and we've been here for the last hour.

878
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,469
I didn't ask to read your fucking diary,
love. I said, "Where's our towels?"

879
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,238
Now, there's no need to be abusive.

880
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,838
If you look around,
there are signs everywhere

881
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,074
saying you can't reserve sunbeds.

882
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,553
So you moved our towels?

883
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,592
The point I'm making is,
whatever the fate of the towels,

884
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,993
these cannot be your beds.

885
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,792
What have you done
with my fucking towels?!

886
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,229
Sir, I get you nice other beds.
Please, take up your stuff.

887
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,872
Me?! What?

888
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,955
Why should we move?

889
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,069
Because he's made a scene?

890
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,509
Because his family are too lazy
to walk 20 feet to the pool?

891
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,629
Seriously, mate, I am warning you.

892
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,159
Why have a rule
if you aren't going to enforce it?

893
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,156
The signs are redundant.

894
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,269
(WHIMPERING)

895
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,118
My towel! (CRIES)

896
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,513
Disabled. Course she is.

897
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,549
Here you go.

898
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,272
- Happy now?
- Well, obviously not.

899
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,117
(SCREECHES)

900
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,793
And that isn't helping.

901
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,637
You lot have got five seconds
to get off my sunbeds.

902
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,113
Right, come on, Will,
we'll just find somewhere else.

903
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,559
But I still don't see
why we should move.

904
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,511
Yes, his daughter
has a serious condition,

905
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,232
but it's not like the whole family

906
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,032
are therefore entitled
to pool-side seats for life.

907
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,311
Plus, strictly speaking,
she doesn't even need another chair.

908
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,359
Are you guests at this hotel?

909
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,199
Ah! No! I no swim!

910
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,118
Please, mister, I no swim, I beg you.

911
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,878
Not pool!

912
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,239
Argh!

913
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,269
All right. All right.

914
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,550
It's just a joke! We're... We're mates!

915
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,592
(GASPING AND LAUGHTER)

916
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,870
So little, so little!

917
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,909
Ah!

918
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,716
Great.

919
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,314
And with a rough grab
from a BO-ridden security guard,

920
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,477
Simon's perfect plan came crashing down.

921
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,475
- Thanks a lot, Jay.
- Me?! What have I done?

922
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,919
Oh, I don't know... Oh, yeah!

923
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,552
Fucked everything up for me,
like you always do.

924
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,955
I had to teach him a lesson, Si,
he was mugging me off.

925
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,752
He was nine years old and couldn't swim!

926
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,519
- Now my life is ruined. Thanks.
- Is this about the tickets?

927
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,596
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!

928
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,278
So, you don't get to go
to the boat party, so what?!

929
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,072
So I don't get back together
with the woman I love!

930
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,031
Look, it's not my fault
Carli thinks you're a prick.

931
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,399
You want to watch me more closely, mate,

932
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,793
- you might actually learn something.
- Oh, yeah?

933
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,068
And what would I learn?

934
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,155
How to bullshit about having sex?

935
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,519
How to sleep in an ants' nest?

936
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,552
- How to be scared shitless of my dad?!
- Oh, come on, Si, calm down.

937
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,830
Maybe you'd learn not to be such
a massive tool over that miserable cunt.

938
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,598
Don't call Carli a cunt!

939
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,235
(PANTING)

940
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,792
- You had enough yet?!
- Have you had enough yet?

941
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,432
- I asked first!
- Ah...

942
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,833
- Uh!
- We should do something.

943
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,313
Yeah, do you want to go
and get a Subway?

944
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,954
No. I meant about the fight,
we should break it up.

945
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,672
Yeah.

946
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,153
All right, come on, you two.

947
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,474
No!

948
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,953
Uh!

949
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm sick of his bollocks,
I'm going to fucking do him.

950
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,795
Oh, you're hard, Si,
I didn't see you do me just now.

951
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,592
- Come back here, then, you prick.
- Let's go for a walk!

952
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,073
- Don't cry, Si.
- I'm not crying!

953
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,190
- You're crying!
- Don't look like it, you're crying!

954
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,310
- Come here, then.
- See you later, then, Will.

955
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,632
Honestly, I'm done with that arsehole.

956
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,272
I mean, why do I even
hang round with him?

957
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,198
Well, yeah, obviously
we all wonder that at times.

958
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,152
Look, it's been a tough couple of days,
the Carli thing is weird,

959
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,349
but just cos you were
in a fight with Jay,

960
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,628
- you don't have to leave.
- I'm not leaving.

961
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,069
But you are aware
you're packing your suitcase.

962
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,119
- I've never liked him.
- You've been mates since primary school.

963
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,639
He's a little crybaby poof.

964
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,114
And his hair,
everyone took the piss out of that.

965
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,878
But not me, I didn't.

966
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,035
Fucking wish I had now.

967
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,469
- You did a bit.
- Well, no, course, a bit.

968
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,158
But... not enough.

969
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,519
He's a total twat!

970
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,472
Oh, that's harsh, mate.
He can be a knob, but he's not a twat.

971
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,954
- I'm going to sell my clothes.
- Oh, you're having a breakdown.

972
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,673
She means so much to me, Will,
I don't care about anything else.

973
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,709
If I can get enough money together,

974
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,193
I can buy a ticket
for the boat party off someone,

975
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,232
somehow, whatever it costs.
Money is all I need.

976
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,918
I agree with you on money,
but who's going to buy your clothes?

977
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,678
No offence, but you dress appallingly.

978
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,551
Are you going to help
or just constantly undermine me?

979
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,797
- Bit of both, I'd imagine.
- Fine.

980
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,319
Do you think Alison likes me?

981
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,794
13 years he's been dragging me down.

982
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,273
Well... fuck him.

983
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,548
- What's that?
- Boat party tickets,

984
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,669
I bought four the other night

985
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,915
before I passed out.
Cost a fortune.

986
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,393
I thought I'd surprise him.

987
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,839
Well, here's his fucking surprise.

988
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,711
- Oh, no, Jay, don't.
- No, fuck him!

989
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,035
And fuck that dick Will too.

990
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,791
What shall we do now, then?

991
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,836
Now we have the best holiday ever...

992
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,440
- and do what we came here to do!
- Get better at swimming!

993
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,913
No.

994
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,520
Go on Pussay Patrol!

995
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,959
Unfortunately for him,

996
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,515
Simon wasn't the only person in Malia
trying to sell shit no-one wanted.

997
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,629
- Looky, looky. Hello?
- Hello!

998
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,477
- Looky.
- Nice lady, good price.

999
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,839
Clothes? Looky, looky.

1000
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,189
Top clothes for sale.
You want clothes? Good price.

1001
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,550
I think you'd have more luck
selling the big glasses.

1002
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,953
Isn't that Carli's friend?

1003
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,592
He's a rep,
I don't think they're really friends.

1004
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,834
All right, mate?

1005
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,313
What's this,
the world's shittest boot fair?

1006
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,749
Ha! No, just selling my clothes
for some money.

1007
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,789
I need money, desperately.

1008
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,910
All right! Well, as luck would have it,

1009
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,552
I've got a mate
who's had his apartment broken into.

1010
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,556
Fuckers nicked all his clothes.

1011
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,397
I reckon he'll be interested,
I'll call him.

1012
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,078
That'd be amazing, thanks so much.

1013
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,395
No problem, mate.
All part of the service, yeah?

1014
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,793
- See?
- All right, mate?

1015
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,876
Yeah, yeah. Got some clothes.

1016
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,354
Yeah. Um...
got some girls T-shirts.

1017
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,231
- These are girls', right?
- No.

1018
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,759
Hoodies like your mum would buy you.

1019
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,313
The sort of jeans Jeremy Clarkson wears.

1020
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,033
Oh, yeah, yeah!
It's all shit, yeah. Hold on.

1021
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,559
He says he'll give you
100 euros for the lot.

1022
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,353
Amazing! Totally! Cool!

1023
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,439
Coolio! Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Thanks so much, man.

1024
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,629
Including what you're wearing now.

1025
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,750
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the deal.

1026
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,551
Obviously he's not going
to take his clothes off.

1027
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,192
Oh, nice one.

1028
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,832
Oh!

1029
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,235
He's going to need your pants too.

1030
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,633
What, these?

1031
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,829
Fuckin' thieves stole everything.

1032
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,952
Gimme your pants, I'll be back
before you know it with your 100 euros.

1033
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,309
Sorry, this has gone too far.
Simon, do not take your pants off.

1034
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,635
Stop always telling me what to do, Will,
I'm an adult!

1035
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,989
James is doing me a favour,
what are you doing, eh?

1036
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,158
(SNIGGERING)

1037
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,469
Here you are.

1038
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,431
- You'll be right back, yeah?
- Course I will.

1039
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,072
I'll see you very soon.

1040
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,431
Thanks, James.
Thanks so much, man!

1041
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,791
Yeah. Cheers, Abdul, good luck, mate.

1042
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,119
James isn't coming back, is he?

1043
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,195
Don't think so.

1044
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,309
Brilliant.

1045
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,875
So we made Simon some makeshift pants
and headed home to get changed.

1046
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,911
- (FARTS)
- Simon,

1047
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,428
- please, don't fart in my T-shirt.
- Sorry.

1048
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,477
In just 24 hours, Malia had pretty much
broken me and Simon,

1049
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,238
so in a way I had to admire
Jay and Neil

1050
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,271
as they rolled up the sleeves
on their offensive T-shirts

1051
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,356
and dived straight back in.

1052
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,516
(POUNDING DANCE MUSIC)

1053
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,309
This place is mental.

1054
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,079
It's decadent, Neil,
that's what they call it.

1055
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,792
This is what we came here for.

1056
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,274
You wouldn't find those other
two muppets in a place like this.

1057
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,197
They'd just shit themselves
and run away.

1058
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,196
[ANNOUNCER]: And now all the way
from Privilege in Ibiza,

1059
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,310
we have a very, very special act.

1060
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,238
It's probably some fit dancer
who'll take one look at me...

1061
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,633
and wanna bang me all night.

1062
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,874
Yeah, and we've got the best view.

1063
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,638
I bet you'll be able to see
right up the snatch from here.

1064
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,955
This is it, Neil,
this is a fucking holiday.

1065
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,991

(CHEERING)

1068
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,109
Must be like a cage fighter
or martial-arts type thing.

(CHEERING)

1070
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,630
Whoa!

1071
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,595
Is this a bit gay?

1072
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,433
No, it's decadent.

1073
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,278
Let's have a big cheer for Fernando,

1074
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,039
the master of self-fellatio!

(CHEERING)

1076
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,516
I don't know if I like decadent things.

1077
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,157
[WILL]: Jay and Neil never told us
how close they came to Fernando's cock,

1078
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,758
but they did say they could smell it.

1079
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,756
And they were still having
more fun than us.

1080
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,668
Last two, shall we pretend
they're pudding?

1081

00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,674
Romantic dinner, is it?

1083
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,836
I've just had a 'mare, right?

1084
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,235
Some massive body-building geezer
came running out the bushes at me,

1085
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,953
God knows why. Anyway,
I've lamped him, he's gone flying...

1086
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,274
(WHISPERS) I think I might
have killed him.

1087
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,554
OK, well, it's been lovely
to chat, Richard...

1088
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,192
- Can you lend us 50 quid?
- Um, no.

1089
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,992
Simple and clear. 30?

1090
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,951
- No, we're going.
- Are we? Where?

1091
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,319
Terrible bar I know.
See you later, Richard.

1092
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,271
10? 10?

1093
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,039
10? 10? 5?!

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,515
Here, look, it's that James bloke
Carli's sucking off.

1095
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,549
Oh, yeah.

1096
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,636
See, now that looks like a proper laugh.

1097
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,389
Neil, I think it's time the Pussay Patrol
recruited some new members.

1098
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,069
You all right, mate?

1099
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,069
Do I know you?

1100
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,599
Yeah, we're mates of Carli's.

1101
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,675
Ah, yeah.

1102
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,789
Carli Cling-on.

1103
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,068
Nice girl, bit keen.

1104
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,314
Yeah.

1105
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,349
Our mate's in love with her,

1106
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,674
- the fucking dick.
- Oh, is he?

1107
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,314
Well, tell him he can have a sniff
on these if he's lucky.

1108
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,828
Yeah, well, no, he's not really a mate.

1109
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,916
We ditched him, yeah, he's too tragic.

1110
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,871
It's a wicked place, this. Nice vibe.

1111
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,434
What, you think a bloke
sucking his own cock is wicked?

1112
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,469
Are you bent?

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,438
No, course not.

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,913
We're the Pussay Patrol.

1116
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,949
Pussay Patrol?!

1117
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,116
More like the Bumming Brigade.

1118
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,599
The only pussy you'll get will be a cat.

1119
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,959
Oi!

1120
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,912
I said, the only pussy they'll get
will be a cat.

1121
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,350
You know, like one of them stray cats
you get round here.

1122
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,436
- Oh, good one!
- Fuck you, you lanky prick.

1123
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,078
You two are fucking me off.
Get out of my face.

1124
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,793
Oh, no, come on, we're having a laugh,
we're all right here.

1125
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,400
You're not fucking all right anywhere,
you scrawny little shit.

1126
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,908
Now fuck off before I put
a glass in your throat.

00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,913
You all right, Jay?

1128
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,712
Yeah. (SNIFFS)

1129
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,749
Are you crying?

1130
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,473
No, it's just the smoke in here.

1131
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,509
There isn't any.

1132
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,790
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1133
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,398
Do you want to go somewhere
not decadent?

1134
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,838
So what happens now?
It's probably a bit far

1135
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,871
for my dad to come and pick us up.

1136
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,679
- Oh, great.
- [WILL]: Be nice,

1137
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,199
maybe he's come to apologise.

1138
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,509
All right?

1139
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,629
We were just leaving, actually.

1140
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,796
- Oh, don't cry, Simon.
- I'm not crying.

1141
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,829
No, Jay, it was you that was crying,

1142
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,074
- remember?
- Neil!

1143
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,270
Come on, Si, sit down,
let's all share a fishbowl.

1144
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,117
- We're totally out of cash.
- Yeah.

1145
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,673
We're not all lucky enough
to have had a relative die.

1146
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,472
Well, you're clearly fucked without me,

1147
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,999
so I was going to offer
to pay for your drinks,

1148
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,359
but if you're going
to be a baby about it,

1149
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,958
- then fuck it.
- Were you really?

1150
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,794
Well, I'm not arsed either way,
but if I have to... yes.

1151
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,114
Si?

1152
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,078
All right, thank you, Jay.

1153
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,953
Shake.

1154
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,356
Group hug?

1155
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,672
(NEIL GUFFAWS)

1156
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,995
Oh, go on, Neil,
just one more suicide shot.

1157
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,189
Fuckin' hell.

1158
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,109
Right. Tenner, please.

- Sorry, mate, had my fingers crossed.
- Oh, not again!

1160
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,794
[WILL]: Oh, my God!
I never expected to see them again.

1161
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,876
Doesn't matter, though, does it?
Cos even if Lucy

1162
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,229
can get a ticket for the boat party,
I now can't afford one.

1163
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,158
Yes, but incredible as it may seem,
Simon, I wasn't thinking about you.

1164
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,235
[JANE]: Hi, guys.

1165
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,555
Taking a break from drowning children?

1166
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,589
We are.

1167
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,153
And welcome back to Malia's
least-cool bar.

1168
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,394
We're regulars, obviously.

1169
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,998
Surprised to see you here again.

1170
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,600
Well, it's the only place we've been
where the blokes weren't total animals.

1171
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,676
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hello, by the way.

1172
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,869
Hello, Spectacles.

1173
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,036
Still going to get shit-faced, though.
Shots only?

1174
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,310
- Are you man enough, Jay-bo?
- Course.

1175
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,634
Thought you would be.

1176
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,069
Clearly, Alison was out of my league.

1177
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,792
But then all girls I like
are out of my league.

1178
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,070
Look at me. Imagine my league.

1179
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,758
It had to be worth a go.

1180
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,950
So I've been thinking, about us...

1181
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,195
- What, the four of you?
- No, me and you.

1182
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,229
Well, there is no "us",

1183
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,714
so that must have been a weird
thought process, but go on.

1184
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,433
- I'm not sure Nicos is right for you.
- Interesting.

1185
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,278
Why wouldn't my sexy, charming,
caring boyfriend,

1186
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,072
who is also a sensational lover,

1187
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,236
- be right for me?
- You'd say sensational, would you?

1188
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,077
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1189
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,350
It was nice of Richard Branson
to lend you an outfit.

1190
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,719
It's Neil's. Is it really that bad?

1191
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,758
Well, at least you look fantastic.
Right, there's only one thing for it,

1192
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,789
we're going to say "fuck it"

1193
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,115
and do shots until one of us is sick
through our nose. My money's on me.

1194
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,037
Four monkey brains, please.

1195
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,150
I like this Simon, he's fun.

1196
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,792
Thanks very much.

1197
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,034
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

1198
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,308
Oh, actually, can you pay?

1199
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,915
Right, next!

1200
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,393
No, no. I can't have another one.

1201
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,271
I'm sorry, didn't realise
you were a lightweight.

1202
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,709
- What?
- Lightweight. Light-weight.

1203
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,159
You're one to talk about lightweights.

1204
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,519
What do you mean?

1205
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,391
Oh. Cos I'm fat?

1206
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,998
No.

1207
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,430
What I... mean, Jane, is...

1208
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,038
I'm gonna drink you under the table.

1209
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,308
You're trouble, aren't you?

1210
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,959
You're funny.

1211
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,753
That is why I know you don't have
to worry about getting laid.

1212
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,472
Um, did I say I was worried?

1213
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,158
No, but it's obvious that you are,

1214
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,918
and you think
that somehow I'm the answer.

1215
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,712
Well, I am not, and you will be fine.

1216
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,320
I think you might be, though.

1217
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,713
Nonsense.

1218
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,593
You know, in fact, I am so confident
I will make a pact with you.

1219
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,313
If you still haven't had sex
by this time next year,

1220
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,509
I'll have sex with you.

1221
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,915
As long as I'm not with Nicos,
of course.

1222
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,188
Of course.

1223
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,514
Um...

1224
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,879
this is a joke, right?

1225
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,549
A handshake's good...

1226
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,591
is it possible to get it in writing?

1227
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,312
See? Funny.

1228
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,352
Yes, ha-ha-ha. Hmm.

1229
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,039
You all right, Lise? Where's Neil?

1230
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,637
He is literally incredible.

1231
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,273
Come on, Lise,
we're getting out of here.

1232
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,038
Let's go for a swim. Come on, you.

1233
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,469
You coming swimming?

1234
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,476
Oh. I can't cos I haven't brought
my swimming costume.

1235
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,193
Oh, no! I haven't brought mine either.

1236
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,639
Really? What are you going to go?

1237
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,592
Well, I'm going to go in naked. Are you?

1238
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,235
Oh, right. Yeah, me too.

1239
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,713
Totally naked.

1240
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,317
Are they really going skinny dipping?

1241
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,351
- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.
- Really?

1242
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,233
- Fucking hell, really?!
- Yes.

1243
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,918
And...

1244
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,189
...what about you?

1245
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,869
Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.

1246
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,319
Course.

1247
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,032
So I reckon I've got time
for a quick dip.

1248
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,435
Obviously, Alison and me
was never going to happen.

1249
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,357
And yet, and yet...

1250
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,913
No, I had no fucking chance.

1251
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,873
(GIGGLING)

1252
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,640
Come on. What are you doing?

1253
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,908
Get it off.

1254
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,269
No, yeah. Good. I will.

1255
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,833
Go on, then.

1256
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,393
All in good time.

1257
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,678
I'll look away, if you like.

1258
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,439
Um, yeah, that would be nice, thank you.

1259
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,393
OK, so, I'm looking away now.

1260
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,636
And so, for only the second time today,

1261
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,875
Simon was tricked into getting naked.

1262
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,878
Further along the beach,
for the first time ever, Jay was close

1263
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,832
to seeing some naked women
not on a computer screen.

1264
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,037
Come on, Jay, don't be shy.

1265
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,911
I'll take it all off if you will.

1266
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,599
Um, all right, just...
give me a minute.

1267
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,108
Are you scared that you won't be able
to control yourself?

1268
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,470
[MAN]: She's a big girl.
She is a big girl.

1269
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,353
Can't take it any more,
just give us a snog.

1270
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,436
Um... all right.

1271
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,109
But... let's go somewhere secret.

1272
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,513
Secret?

1273
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,834
Just give us a snog here.

1274
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,279
Nah.

1275
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,959
Let's go somewhere
people can't see us.

1276
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,912
- OK?
- Fucking whale on the beach.

1277
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,919
Actually... forget it.

1278
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,520
I've already seen your cock,
and it wasn't pretty.

1279
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,115
All I'm saying is that, logically,

1280
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,037
we might not have to wait
a year to have sex.

1281
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,479
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1282
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,149
I mean, once you remove Nicos from the
equation and think, as I say, logically,

1283
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,952
it really makes no sense
to wait that long.

1284
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,878
Do you find that your logic
talks a lot of girls into bed?

1285
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,353
Well, no.

1286
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,389
I was just curious to know

1287
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,149
whether this kind of relentless, pedantic
chat is a big hit with the other chicks.

1288
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,749
- Well, obviously it isn't.
- Thought not.

1289
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,756
What are you waiting for?

1290
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,592
Um... I don't know.

1291
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,268
OK.

1292
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,076

Ah!

1299
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,234
That's right,
let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?

1300
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,840
It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.

1301
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,632
Right, how's this for a wet look, then?

Just getting my glasses!

You're not wussing out on me, are you?

1312

Nope! As soon as I'm not blind,

1313
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,200
I'll be right over with you
and the other naked ladies.

01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,759
Donna, I just need you to be a little
bit quiet for five minutes, please...

1330
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,835
Who the fuck is that?!

1331
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,474
Come and sit down with me,
I want to talk to you.

1332
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,080
We're supposed to be meeting up
in 15 minutes,

1333
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,076
- you utter, utter scumbag!
- Glasses?

1334
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,394
- Glasses?
- It's OK, it's OK.

1335
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,919
Glasses? Ooh!

1336
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,313
There they are.

1337
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,796
Alison, I love you, I love you,
you are the only girl for me,

1338
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,558
there no other girl in my life.

1339
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,192
Now, where have we heard that before?

1340
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,798
Oh, just shut up, Will!

1341
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,671
Baby, you know this weirdo?

1342
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,790
I am not your fucking baby!

1343
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,070
Alison, wait!

1344
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,917
Simon.

1345
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,518
Are you swimming naked?

1346
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,754
Hell, yeah.

1347
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,756
- That's not like you.
- Well, I'm on holiday,

1348
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,597
so who knows, maybe it's a new me?

1349
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,073
Oh, right.

1350
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,872
I like the old you.

1351
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,512
Hmm.

1352
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,869
OK, well, I'm off to bed.

1353
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,909
Can I come?

1354
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,359
To bed?

1355
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,153
- No, sure. I'm all wet anyway, so...
- Look,

1356
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,431
I'm knackered, I've had a shitty night,
I just want to be alone.

1357
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,677
But I'll see you at the boat party.
We can catch up properly there, OK?

1358
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,870
Yeah, course.

1359
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,195
- See you at the boat party.
- Great.

1360
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,275
See ya!

1361
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,834
- I miss you too.
- Sorry?

1362
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,199
You said it the other night?

1363
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,037
Oh, yeah.

1364
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,231
Lucy! Lucy!

1365
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,919
Alison, wait! I'll come with you!

1366
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,349
- I want to be on my own!
- Um...

1367
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,628
You're not expecting me
to hit him or anything,

1368
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,318
- are you?
- No!

1369
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,395
- Good.
- I don't expect

1370
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,192
anything from anyone
but disappointment.

1371
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,798
You'll love me, then.

1372
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,276
And I will never have sex
with anyone again for as long as I live,

1373
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,469
and certainly not with you.

1374
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,794
So just fuck off!

1375
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,637
All of you, just fuck off!

1376
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,557
Does this affect our deal?

1377
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,158
Fuck your deal!

1378
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,437
- Ahhhh!
- (MUTTERS IN GREEK)

1379
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,349
Lucy.

1380
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,311
Oh! Are you getting out?

1381
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,432
- Yes.
- That was Carli, did you see her?

1382
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,829
Yeah.

1383
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,154
It was dark, but I saw her.

1384
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,474
Isn't she beautiful?

1385
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,431
Yes, she's very beautiful.

1386
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,391
I'm going now.

1387
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,078
Oh. OK!

1388
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,634
- All right?
- I've been better.

1389
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,955
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

1390
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,479
About how shit the holiday is?

1391
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,432
Partly that. Partly I'm thinking
about putting stones in my pockets

1392
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,674
and chucking myself in the pool.

1393
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,154
Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.

1394
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,189
Right.

1395
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,559
Also, if you put stones in your pockets,

1396
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,239
you'll sink, so... better to not
have the stones, really.

1397
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,998
I'll bear that in mind, Neil.

1398
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,079
I stopped believing in God when
I realised it was just "dog" backwards.

1399
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,553
What?

1400
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,309
Well, when you think about it...
G/O/D, D/O/G.

1401
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,510
It's like an anagram,
but a backwards one, innit?

1402
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,788
Right.

1403
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,434
And then, after that,
I just stopped worrying about stuff.

1404
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,597
You only get one go round, I reckon.
When you're dead, you're dead.

1405
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,074
So you can spend your time thinking
about how things haven't gone perfect

1406
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,918
or you can just get on with it,
have a laugh and that.

1407
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,518
That's what I do, I'm pretty happy.

1408
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,549
You are, aren't you?

1409
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,749
Yeah!

1410
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,360
Thanks, Neil. Thanks for that.

1411
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,551
Just remember, it's D-O-G backwards.

1412
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,953
No, not that.

1413
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,116
No offence, but that's moronic.
No, thanks for coming to cheer me up.

1414
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,513
I didn't come to cheer you up,

1415
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,437
I come to say I did a shit
in the children's toilet

1416
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,708
and I can't get rid of it.

1417
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,079
Oh, God!

1418
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,834
Cos I thought I'd try something
different, you know? As a treat.

1419
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,879
- Oh...
- Oh!

1420
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,319
Oh!

1421
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,952
Neil, what the fuck has gone into that?

1422
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,797
Have you been eating tear gas?

1423
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,319
No, it's just a bit beery.

1424
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,157
And that meatiness
is probably the kebabs.

1425
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,316
OK, that's it. Neil, you were right.

1426
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,395
It may not be paradise,

1427
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,271
but we can at least try and enjoy
this place for exactly what it is.

1428
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,514
A shithole?

1429
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,312
Yes, but it's our shithole,
so let's get out there

1430
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,999
and get royally fucked up
on Jay's dead grandad's money.

1431
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,598
It's what he would have wanted.

1432
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,359
If we get fined 50 euros, Neil,
you're paying it.

1433
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,550
- But it's not on the floor.
- Some of it is on the floor.

1434
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,192
Well, yeah, some of it.

- Boat party ones.

1498
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,677
Yeah, but I really want to go,
so you see, actually, I can't.

1499
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,790
- Take Jay's ticket.
- No, I think he needs it.

1500
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,034
What, cos of Jane?

1501
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:51,039
No, in case the captain dies
and they need me to drive the boat.

1502
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,753
(GROANING)

1503
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,156
Eased up on the vomiting,
mainly retching now.

1504
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,031
For the record, they don't clean
that toilet floor very often,

1505
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,071
lots of pubes on hands, knees...
and my face

1506
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,317
when I had a little lie-down.
I cannot believe we've been eating here.

1507
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,349
Wow, they look hot!

1508
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,914
- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?
- Behave.

1509
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,315
Lucy. Lucy!

1510
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,750
Alison! Aliso...
Oh. I give up.

1511
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,592
All right, boys? Who killed Will?

1512
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,789
(GROANS)

1513
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,910
- What's up with Lucy?
- I don't know.

1514
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,952
If you ask her rather than
talking about your ex the whole time,

1515
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,912
- you might find out.
- Oh, God, really? (SIGHS)

1516
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,837
Fine.

1517
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,592
- You coming to the boat party, then?
- You try and stop me.

1518
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,234
We just saw two hot fellas
dressed as firemen getting on board.

1519
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,396
Might need a hand with their hoses.

1520
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,000
Might have to set fire to my knickers.

1521
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,190
- I'll come with you, if you like.
- No, thank you.

1522
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,434
Come on, Lisa.

1523
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,390
You look as bad on the outside
as I feel on the inside.

1524
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,876
Oh, don't worry,
I feel like shit on the inside too.

1525
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,353
Although...

1526
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,197
I don't have a pube on my cheek.

1527
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,673
Oh, God.

1528
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,713
Anyway, seeing you in such a mess
has at least cheered me up a bit.

1529
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,749
Glad to be of service.

1530
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,712
You know I have a penis
sunburnt on my back too.

1531
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,194
Must be reassuring to know
that however bad life gets,

1532
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,229
you're not me.

1533
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,269
It is.

1534
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,437
Good. That means every time you're down,
you have to come and hang out with me.

1535
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,595
Yeah, I think I might.

1536
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,993
Starting with today.

1537
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,237
I've got Nicos's ticket for the boat
party. Do you fancy joining me?

1538
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,713
Um, yes.

1539
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,954
More than anything.

1540
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,150
Great. On one condition, though.

1541
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,519
Anything.

1542
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,154
At no point are you allowed
to say, "I told you so".

1543
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,760
Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.

1544
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,439
So it's not that I'd rather go
to a party that infinitely heightens

1545
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,630
my sense of being out of kilter
with the rest of the world,

1546
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,478
it's just that Alison is sort of
the fittest girl I've ever met

1547
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,397
- and maybe...
- It's fine, Will, honestly.

1548
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,238
Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spot
and hang myself.

1549
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,430
Great. Lucy, make sure
he doesn't hang himself.

1550
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,119
I'm off. Look at me,
following my cock like a normal person.

1551
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,874
Sorry for saying cock.

1552
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,356
I didn't realise
I was being such a dick.

1553
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,115
You were.

1554
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,079
- I'm trying to say sorry.
- Well, say it, then.

1555
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,599
Sorry.

1556
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,278
For being a dick.

1557
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,912
Sorry for being a dick.

1558
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,031
And for having too much gel
in your hair.

1559
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,752
I don't think I've got that much...

1560
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,519
OK, I'm sorry for having
too much gel in my hair.

1561
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,556
You should probably get going.

1562
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,079
I'm not that bothered.

1563
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,109
Really?

1564
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,354
Yeah.

1565
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,233
If you like, maybe we could hang out,
the two of us.

1566
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,191
I quite fancy just staying by the pool.

1567
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,915
Yeah, I mean, why spend the day
having unbelievable fun on the party boat

1568
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,430
when you could be taking a depressed man
swimming at a family hotel?

1569
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,515
I'm serious.

1570
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,993
I don't mind.

1571
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,997
I might even cheer you up...

1572
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,871
if they let you back in.

1573
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,559
I honestly don't think
I'll be very good company,

1574
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,192
but thanks for the offer.

1575
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,356
You go, I'll be all right.

1576
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,831
Look...

1577
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,394
it's obvious how much
Carli means to you.

1578
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,237
She's lucky...

1579
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,315
I think.

1580
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,992
I'm sure you'll sort it out.

1581
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,032
She goes back tomorrow.
I can feel her slipping away.

1582
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,309
Simon...

1583
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,033
if she really means that much to you,

1584
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,718
I want you to take my ticket.

1585
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,349
Lucy...

1586
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,517
If you really want to go, take it.

1587
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,589
If you really want to go.

1588
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,359
God, you'd do that for me?

1589
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,152
Yeah.

1590
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,197
Thanks!

1591
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,549
I'll see you later,
enjoy the pool! Will!

1592
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,158
Will! I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

1593
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,758
Will!

1594
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,472
I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

1595
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,193
# We are go!

1596
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,755
# The time has come to leave this place

1597
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,634
# Leave it all behind

1598
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,275
# There's so much more here to envision

1599
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,959
# Out of your mind... #

1600
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,434
[WILL]: The boat party
was Jay's promised land...

1601
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,119
sun, sea, booze, and who knows,

1602
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:18,153
maybe even some sex, minge,
fanny and tits... and booze... and sex.

1603
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,235
Mental!

1604
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,714
- Cheeky shot to get us started?
- You are kidding.

1605
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,795
Oh, come on, it's the best cure.

1606
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,193
Fair enough, what are we toasting?

1607
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,470
To the Pussay!

1608
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,192
[ALL]: The Pussay!

1609
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,152
Neil?

1610
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,553
To being playas!

1611
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,238
[ALL]: Playas!

1612
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,915
Si?

1613
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,995
To me and Carli!

1614
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,871
- No, you're all right, mate.
- Fuck off.

1615
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,236
Fine. Well, I'm going off
to find her, anyway.

1616
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,748
- Oh, Si, I forgot something.
- What?

1617
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,756
Ah! For fuck's sake.

1618
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,711
You know I should probably find Jane,
I promised her a dance.

1619
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,832
- What?
- Well, no, just a dance.

1620
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,791
And then we can get
some proper fit gash.

1621
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,990
But Jane's all right, you know.
She's a laugh.

1622
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,234
The fat ones are always jolly.

1623
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,158
Neil, what a horrible thing to say.

1624
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,674
- Just you and me, then, Will.
- Oh, no.

1625
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,188
Oh, God.
What was I thinking, tequila?!

1626
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,469
Shit, sorry!

1627
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,794
Sorry!

1628
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,069
Make your bloody mind up, you wally!

1629
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,395
(SIGHS)

1630
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,798
Richard! All right, mate?

1631
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,989
- All right!
- How's it going?

1632
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,270
Yeah, not too bad.
Anyway, the other day, right,

1633
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,151
I started crying and couldn't stop,

1634
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,715
so yeah, my mum and dad have flown over
to take me home. Pretty cool.

1635
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,392
Yeah...

1636
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,555
Come and say hello?

1637
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,192
All right.

1638
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,796
Dad, Mum.

1639
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,035
Hiya.

1640
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,594
Back off, bitch!

1641
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,437
Not this time.

1642
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,435
Jane?

1643
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,436
- Jane!
- Oh, hello.

1644
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,357
Sure you want to be seen with me?

1645
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,231
Yeah, I do. I really do.

1646
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,475
Can we have that snog now?

1647
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,988
What? Now? Here?
Right in front of everyone?

1648
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,191
Um... yeah. Yeah.

1649
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,832
Yeah? Well, I'm not that kind of girl.

1650
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,279
Oh.

1651
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,392
(POSH VOICE) So, I suggest
we find somewhere a little more private.

1652
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,670
- I don't mind.
- I told you,

1653
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,633
I do. And, to be fair, in private
you might get a blow job out of it.

1654
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,072
- Simey!
- Oh, hi!

1655
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,189
Carli!

1656
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,314
Where have you been?

1657
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,874
- I've been looking all over for you.
- I need to tell you something.

1658
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,717
Ssh! I know.

1659
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,549
Get it all up.

1660
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,875
Little easier
on the sunburnt cock, please.

1661
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,035
Sorry.

1662
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,115
It's fine.

1663
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,909
I mean, what a total twat!

1664
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:47,949
Me?!

1665
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,151
No, Nicos, the total
and utter Greek twat.

1666
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,235
Did you see her?

1667
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,475
She was hideous,
she must have been at least 30.

1668
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,239
I told you so.

1669
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,111
You arsehole, you had to say it,
didn't you?

1670
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,798
Even in the fucking state you're in,

1671
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,276
- you couldn't resist.
- Sorry. But at least I'm consistent.

1672
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,668
Yes, you are, aren't you?

1673
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,110
OK, so I think I'd like
to revise my offer.

1674
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,993
How about instead of having sex
with you in a year,

1675
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,270
I have sex with you all year?

1676
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,275
What?

1677
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,232
- It's a one-time offer.
- To confirm,

1678
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,475
do you mean like a girlfriend
or like a prostitute?

1679
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,988
I was thinking more like a girlfriend.

1680
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,909
- Could you write it...
- No! I am not going to write it down.

1681
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,151
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
I like you.

1682
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,237
Despite myself, I really do like you.

1683
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,278
If you like me too, then we're on.

1684
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,596
Um... but not till you've
brushed your teeth.

1685
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,675
Oh!

1686
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,951
- That should do it.
- You know we could do this for ever.

1687
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,991
Yeah, I know, yeah.

1688
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,792
Oh, God, Carls, I thought I'd lost you.

1689
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,159
I thought I'd lost you!

1690
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,509
And no matter how many times they hit me
in the balls, I knew I was right.

1691
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,755
And I've worked it all out,
it was so simple.

1692
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,279
I'll just get a job near your uni
for three years,

1693
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,551
four if you do an MA,
and then we can be together for ever.

1694
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,033
For ever.

1695
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,149
Just like we should be.

1696
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,032
Carli...

1697
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,638
...what's wrong?

1698
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,398
Did you hear what I said?

1699
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,919
Something about being hit in the balls?

1700
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,598
Well, yeah, but...

1701
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,710
mainly about being together for ever.

1702
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,115
Sorry, Simon,
could you just kiss me again?

1703
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,315
Sorry, Carls, this is wrong.

1704
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,588
What?

1705
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,437
I've made a bad choice today.

1706
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,594
I honestly wish you
all the best with your life,

1707
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,676
but right now, I have to leave.

1708
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,319
I don't think you'll ever see me again.

1709
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,238
But I'll see you at your mum's birthday
in two weeks' time.

1710
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,111
Well, yeah, but then after that.

1711
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,634
And then your brother's 16th
the following week.

1712
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,955
Yeah, it was more
of a metaphorical thing.

1713
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,468
- Anyway, I'll see you around, Carls.
- Yes,

1714
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:13,398
- at your mum's.
- Please, can I just...

1715
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,509
Thank you.

1716
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,916
Below deck, Neil was being as faithful
as ever to his girlfriend...

1717
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,838
by aggressively dry-humping Lisa
to within an inch of her life.

1718
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,389
Neil...

1719
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,238
Neil, stop.

1720
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,952
What's up? Is it my zip?
I can undo it, if you want.

1721
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,514
No, it's not that.

1722
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,118
I just think this is wrong.

1723
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,196
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

1724
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,232
- No, it's fine, we aren't kissing.
- Yeah, but...

1725
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,157
look at what we are doing.

1726
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,228
I mean, how do you think you'd feel
if you saw her doing this with a guy?

1727
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,555
I wouldn't want to be treated like this.

1728
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,034
- I've got ethics.
- Yeah.

1729
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,799
Yeah, you're right,
it's just that, um...

1730
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,710
...Nicole dumped me
before we got out here

1731
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,593
and I didn't want to say anything
to the others cos I was embarrassed.

1732
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,676
- Oh, Neil...
- Yeah.

1733
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,759
She sent me this text, saying like,
"You dance like a twat, you are dumped".

1734
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,950
It broke me up.

1735
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,675
So... this is fine and, if you want,
we can even kiss.

1736
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,517
Oh, Neil!

1737
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,118
Is that true? Really?

1738
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,912
Yeah, course.

1739
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:20,949
If you like.

1740
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,869
That was just... I mean...

1741
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,753
Did it not taste funny?
Cos it looks funny.

1742
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,028
All right, mate, who's this, then?

1743
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,354
Hi, I'm Jane.

1744
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,436
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, is she?

1745
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,119
Fuckin' hell, you want to be careful
she doesn't fall overboard

1746
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,354
- cos...
- Cos I'll get harpooned?

1747
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,630
Cos they might think I'm a new island?

1748
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,636
Cos all the water will splash out
onto the land?

1749
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,557
I've heard them all, take your pick.

1750
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,114
Fuckin' 'ell, tubs, all right,
it was only a joke.

1751
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,197
Anyway, seeing as you're coming
out there like a naughty boy,

1752
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,312
how about you do me a favour?
I need a note for the old toot.

1753
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,158
We weren't doing drugs, actually.

1754
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,758
Christ! For his sake, I hope you were.

1755
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,598
There are laws against fucking cow,
mate, even in Greece.

1756
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,236
Now, I'm going to need to take that note
off you. Well, you're a mate.

1757
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,236
You don't mind, do you?

1758
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,679
Give.

1759
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,554
No, no, not at all.

1760
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,151
There you are, mate, already rolled.

1761
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,997
Cheers. I'll keep this, yeah?

1762
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,234
No problemo.

1763
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,355
[WILL]: I think the Government's
anti-drugs campaign

1764
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,197
would be more successful
if they pointed out

1765
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,309
that every now and again,

1766
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,158
there's a small chance you might
accidentally snort some poo.

1767
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,475
(RETCHES)

1768
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,268
Simon?

1769
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,799
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1770
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,310
Yeah, for the first time in my life,
I think I actually am.

1771
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,475
I'm clear, anyway.

1772
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,555
How'd it go with Carli?

1773
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,431
Long term - good. Short term - horrific.

1774
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,516
Have you murdered her?

1775
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,516
No, but I am starting to think
that maybe Carli's not all that.

1776
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,754
Well, it's taken a while.

1777
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,995
- Better late than never.
- I think Lucy might be the one.

1778
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,076
Yes, obviously.

1779
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,111
Lucy's much nicer
and actually likes you.

1780
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,116
But I'm worried I might have been
a bit of a dick to her.

1781
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,535
You've been more
than a bit of a dick to her.

1782
01:24:10,536 --> 01:24:12,336
You've been a massive dick
to her.

1783
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,552
- She still likes you, anyway.
- Good,

1784
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,874
that's really good.

1785
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,275
Does he always strip when he's happy?

1786
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,309
Yeah, normally.

1787
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,510
Simon!
You can't go up there, there's a sign.

1788
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,788
Oh, sign(!)

1789
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,796
Alison, will you text Lucy
and tell her I'm coming to get her?

1790
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,955
Course I will.

1791
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,228
Brilliant!

1792
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,349
All right?

1793
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,469
Yeah.

1794
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,635
What are you doing up there, then?

1795
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,989
I'm going to swim back to shore
and tell Lucy how I feel.

1796
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,359
How romantic.

1797
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,833
It is, isn't it?

1798
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,999
Is it a bit far?

1799
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,634
Nah, bollocks. You can see the shore.

1800
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,318
I've swum further than that underwater.

1801
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,112
Do it! Just swim there

1802
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,116
and show her what she means to you
and then kiss her.

1803
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,149
On the fanny!

1804
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,394
- Jay!
- Sorry, darling.

1805
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,555
Right, fuck it, you only live once.

1816
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,510
Oh, I think I've shit myself.

1817
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,910
Lucy, it's normally bigger, it was cold.

1818
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,916
[WILL]: One of us should probably have
gone to hospital with Simon.

1819
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,793
But, to be perfectly honest,
we had more important things to do.

Said that she didn't care

Oh, but all she wanted

1870
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,629
# Was to be left alone

1871
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,714
# He said he missed bliss
Smiled and left a kiss

1872
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,150
# And I said this isn't it
But, baby, please come home

1873

Cried when she got cross

# And all that she had was lost
Yeah, she sold it all

1885
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,598
