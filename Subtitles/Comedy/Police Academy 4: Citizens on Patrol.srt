1
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,920
Take it, brother.

2
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,520
Let me break you.

3
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,720
Man, that was funky.

4
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,000
-Fore!
-Well, I guess the meeting's started.

5
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,160
-Howdy, sir?
-Mahoney! Jones!

6
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Thank you, Sweetchuck.

7
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,400
I've had the most wonderful news
about my new program.

8
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
-What new program is that, sir?
-My citizens on patrol.

9
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,160
I call it C.O.P. for short.

10
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Has a nice policey ring to it,
don't you think?

11
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,040
What is C.O.P., sir?

12
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
What is the most frustrating thing
about police work?

13
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,040
-Not being able to carry hand grenades.
-Separate locker rooms, sir.

14
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Icky blue uniforms.

15
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,840
I always thought
that the most frustrating thing was that...

16
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,760
we couldn't be everywhere at once
to solve every crime.

17
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
So the public ends up
thinking of us as enemies.

18
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,440
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could all be friends?

19
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,800
Officer Mahoney, please come in.

20
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Have some lemonade. I love lemonade.

21
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,600
-Not too tart, not--
-Too sweet, just good.

22
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,160
So C.O.P. is
a community action program, sir.

23
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,360
-Like Neighborhood Watch?
-More. Much more!

24
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
We show the community that we care.

25
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,640
We train volunteers in crime detection,
in first-aid and....

26
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,520
-And it's a great idea, sir.
-But we need citizen support.

27
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,760
With all this neighborhood crime,
I'm sure you'll get it.

28
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,120
-Fore!
-Right. What if we were to....

29
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
What was that?

30
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
I believe brother Sweetchuck
is suggesting...

31
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,960
we recruit in our old neighborhood.

32
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Excellent. We have the full support
of the Mayor...

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
and best of all, the Governor of the state
wants me to unveil the program...

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,520
at the end of
the International Police Seminar...

35
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
next month in England.

36
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,760
While I attend the seminar...

37
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,760
you, my good friends...

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,840
will put C.O.P. into action.

39
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,400
It will change community relations
all around the world.

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
The Lassard Method.

41
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,800
It rolls nicely off the tongue,
don't you think?

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
Hi! What did I miss?

43
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960
Hi.

44
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Capt. Harris,
Police Commissioner Hurst is here.

45
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,960
You want to see him?

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,760
No. Send him packing.

47
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,600
-Proctor!
-Yes, sir?

49
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,200
Send the Commissioner in immediately.

50
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
-I thought you said to send him packing.
-Immediately!

51
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Nincompoop.

53
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600
Commissioner.

54
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,920
-You have a problem, Capt. Harris?
-Yes, sir.

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,640
Commissioner, I am extremely concerned
with this memorandum from Lassard...

56
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,320
about his C.O.P. program.

57
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Citizens doing police work?
An asinine idea.

58
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,760
If this goes through, no policeman's job,
no policeman's paycheck, will be safe.

59
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Are you through, Captain?

60
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,800
The Governor of this state thinks
that this program is absolutely brilliant.

61
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
So until he changes his mind,
that's what you and I think, too.

62
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,040
Agreed?

63
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,160
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

64
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,200
You were right.
You should have sent him packing.

65
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
I don't give a damn
what the Governor or the Mayor thinks.

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,800
Lassard's program is a mistake...

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,520
and anyone who thinks otherwise
is wrong.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
Pure and simple.

69
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't touch those!

70
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,640
Don't you ever touch my balls
without asking!

71
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,920
You're gonna have to leave.
I'll call the police. I mean it.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,160
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

73
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
Wait a minute. I am the police.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,640
-No, you're not.
-That's me. I'm here to speak about C.O.P.

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm sorry. I didn't....
Without the uniform on--

76
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,600
Regular human clothes
make people more comfortable.

77
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,920
Hi, ladies. Let's do some poetry!

78
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,360
I got to go to my in-laws'
for dinner tonight.

79
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
You want to come?

80
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,200
Officer Hightower,
I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program.

81
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
Do I know you?

82
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,040
Yeah, you used to
bounce me on your knee.

83
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,360
-I did?
-Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin.

84
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,960
-But now they call me House.
-Tommy Conklin.

85
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Sure. Welcome aboard.
You can register right over there.

86
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,960
"Blind mouth that scare themselves

87
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,560
"know how to hold a sheep-hook

88
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,240
"Or have learned aught else at least

89
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,800
"that to the faithful Herdsmans
art belongs! "

90
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,960
That was exciting.

91
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,360
We have an Officer Zed,
who's here to tell us...

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,840
a little bit about a new police program.
So won't you....

93
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
Thank you very much.

94
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,800
I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional, sensitive guy...

95
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
and that part about the sheep-hook
just tore my heart right out.

96
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,960
I have my own poem
that I prepared for you today.

97
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
"Gene, Gene made a machine...

98
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,440
"and Joe, Joe made it go.

99
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,120
"l blew a fart
and blew the whole damn thing apart."

100
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,720
What is he saying?

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
I didn't write it.

102
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,520
Okay, I'd like to talk to you
about what we're here for...

103
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
and that's for me to pitch
the new C.O.P. program to you.

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,000
Perhaps a few of you ladies
might be interested in it.

105
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,320
So the bartender asked the organ grinder,
"Hey, does your monkey sing any opera?"

106
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,200
And I said, "Nope.

107
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,400
"But if you hit me on the head,
I'll sing Yankee Doodle. "

108
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
It's so nice to have my family
all back together again.

109
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,120
-Can you pass the lettuce, Pop?
-Sure, honey. Here you go.

110
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,400
-Thanks, Pop.
-You're welcome. Hey, listen...

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,320
did I tell you I'm gonna join
that Citizen On Patrol thing?

112
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,840
That would be a great idea.
I'd be proud to have you at the precinct.

113
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,040
I'll take some more greens, Bud.

114
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,320
-Dad.
-Yeah?

115
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
I don't think you should sign up.
There are already three of us on the force.

116
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
-It's going to look like favoritism.
-That's not it.

117
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,520
That's not it at all. You just don't think
I'm fast enough anymore, do you?

118
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,120
I don't think that's it, do you, Tack?

119
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,000
It has nothing to do with being fast.
Now, that was fast.

120
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,360
You know, that was fast.

121
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,400
But that's hard.

122
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
Excuse me.

123
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,840
I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings.

124
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
Oh, you two.

125
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,520
Oh, well, who wants pie?

126
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
-I was just trying to help.
-You hurt my arm.

127
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,400
-I'll hand the rest out. Hi.
-Hi.

128
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Could I interest you
in the new citizens program?

129
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
-No, I don't think so.
-No, thanks.

130
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,800
-We'll take the stairs.
-Thanks, just the same.

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
Excuse me!

132
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
Would you be interested
in the new citizens program?

133
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,800
-Yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right.
-Sure, here.

134
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,920
-Why don't you hand the rest of them out?
-Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.

135
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,960
-Arnie, where are you going?
-Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do.

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,960
I got a term paper due tomorrow,
and a history test.

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,120
I got to help my father clean the cellar,
and I have to do the dishes tonight.

138
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
What are you doing?

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,440
-I'll get the guys and hang out at the mall.
-Let's go.

140
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,720
I thought I told you guys,
no skateboarding in my district.

141
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,640
This isn't skateboarding, Sergeant.
This is carrying skateboards.

142
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,040
This is skateboarding.

143
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,800
-We got to check this out, you guys.
-Take it easy.

144
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,440
We'll see you later.

145
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,600
I'll see you later.
I want to check out these guys.

146
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
All right, I'll be back.

147
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
Hey, Sarge, look at that.

148
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Kyle, that skateboard punk. Let's nail him.

149
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,640
Boy, you sure give them a hard time.

150
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah. Fun, isn't it?

151
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,400
You don't listen, do you, Kyle?

152
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,000
I was shopping
for Capt. Harris' birthday present.

153
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,600
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

154
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
Shop somewhere else.

155
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,240
Your Honor....

156
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,440
Here, Judge. Stop him! Hold up!

157
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,400
Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, my fault.

158
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,160
-Watch it!
-Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it!

159
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,400
I can do that, that handstand stuff.

160
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,240
I just hate it
when the change falls out of my pocket.

161
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
Hey, man,
I think these guys want to talk to you.

162
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Hold it!

163
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,920
Capt. Harris will hear about this!

164
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
Come.

165
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
-Sir.
-Copeland, what the hell happened to you?

166
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,600
Some skateboard punks
started a riot at the mall.

167
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
Bring them in here.

168
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
-They got away.
-They got away?

169
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,720
-I did the best I could, sir.
-It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland?

170
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,240
-No, sir.
-I'll handle these punks personally.

171
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
-Yes, sir.
-I want three patrol cars...

172
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,360
dissecting the neighborhood.
Copeland, my hat!

173
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,560
-Yes, sir.
-You, radio-alert all motorcycle units.

174
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
I want a chopper in the air.
Spot these boys on the ground.

175
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,960
Proctor, ride with me.

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,200
-Now, Proctor, move it!
-Coming, sir.

177
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
Be right there!

178
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
There they go!

179
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,640
Back it up. Quiet!

180
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,040
I said quiet, dickhead.

181
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
We've got them now.

182
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,640
I know they came in here.

183
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Unit 6 to Capt. Harris.
We've got them at the end of the alley.

184
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
I got you now!

185
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
You hold them right there. We're coming.

186
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,120
Copeland, have you got them?

187
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,120
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Carey Mahoney of the Police Academy.

188
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please. Thank you. You're too kind.

189
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,760
It's Harris. Haul ass. Go.

190
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,640
I got you, you little punks.

191
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,520
Freeze, you little hoodlums.
Get your hands off my ass, Proctor.

192
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,320
Get away, Proctor.

193
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,440
No. Don't shake the fence.

194
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,520
Oh, shit. No!

195
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,960
The purpose of this program...

196
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,840
is to develop a better working relationship
between us, the police...

197
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,720
When he says, "Okay, boys and girls,"
we're all gonna....

198
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,240
...and you, the community.

199
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,400
Stop! Stop right there!

200
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,560
You see, the great thing is, this is a first.

201
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,120
The Police Academy has offered to train
you citizens to better protect yourselves.

202
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
-You'll be trendsetters.
-Do we get to pack heat?

203
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,400
Heat--

204
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,920
Stop those little punks! Stop them!

205
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,720
You're under arrest!

206
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,360
Are you all right?

207
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Who's laughing now, you little twits?

208
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,800
And your clothes make me want to puke.
I'll tell you that right now.

209
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,800
-Capt. Harris!
-Well, well, Mahoney.

210
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,760
-It's been a long time, sir.
-So it has.

211
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,720
Well, Motormouth Jones.

212
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,240
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a great tailor, sir?

213
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
I mentioned that just last week.

214
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,120
Has anyone told you, Mahoney,
that you're still a little pissant?

215
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,440
-No one whose opinion matters, sir.
-What did Arnie and Kyle do?

216
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,360
You know those clowns?
I should have figured.

217
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,040
Your little pals wrecked a police car,
destroyed a shopping mall...

218
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,520
harassed citizens, resisted arrest.

219
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,000
Go easy, Captain. They're just wacky kids.

220
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,000
We'll see how those wacky kids
like it in jail.

221
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,600
In all my years on the bench,
I have seen all sorts of public disorder.

222
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,040
Young people must learn to conform...

223
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,000
to the standards and laws
of civilized society.

224
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,640
In reviewing the testimony
and taking into account...

225
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,960
your disregard
for public and private property...

226
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
I can reach only one decision:

227
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
Guilty as hell.

228
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,560
You flushed me down the toilet!

229
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,760
Before you pass sentence--

230
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,960
They're gonna send me to jail,
and some fat, hairy guy is gonna--

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,960
-May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
-Yes, Sergeant.

232
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,760
Sir, do we want to expose these boys,
these children to a prison environment?

233
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,200
-Yes.
-May I run my own court, Captain?

234
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
-You've got a better idea?
-Yes, I do, sir.

235
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
Comdt. Lassard has initiated
a new community relations program.

236
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,160
Why not assign these kids...

237
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
to that program
as a form of alternate sentencing?

238
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,240
-That's ridiculous!
-I'll be the judge of that.

239
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,960
I.... Excuse me.

240
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,560
I like the sound of this
community relations gig.

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,240
Milt Butterworth,
defender of the common man.

242
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,720
Your Honor, look at this list of complaints.

243
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,560
And I quote you directly, sir, when I say--

244
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Gee, sir, I thought you only got
contempt of court for opening your mouth.

245
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,960
Mahoney, I'm warning you.

246
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,160
You keep Lassard's C.O.Ps
out of my precinct.

247
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,040
You don't understand
what I'm trying to do.

248
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,360
I understand
exactly what you're trying to do.

249
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,840
Just keep them out,
especially these two little buttwads.

250
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,440
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not planning to attack us...

251
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
with any more of your bodily functions,
are you?

252
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,640
You just make sure
that we never meet again. Ever.

253
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,600
You know, with those two idiots
in Lassard's program, it'll never work.

254
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,400
Excuse me, sir.

255
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,600
We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman.

256
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,520
-Do you know her?
-Yes.

257
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,120
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know a Mrs. Lois--

258
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,000
-Where can we find Lois Feldman, please?
-There.

259
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,040
Thank you.

260
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
Mrs. Feldman?

261
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
-Who's asking?
-Police.

262
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Is it about those damn library books?

263
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,960
We're following up on your alleged
interest in the Citizens On Patrol program.

264
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Then I'm Mrs. Feldman. Come on in.

265
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,640
Callahan, cover your rear.

266
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,840
I admire your taste.

267
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,800
Yes, well, I do all my own decorating.

268
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,840
You have a talent for it, ma'am.

269
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,040
I'll be with you in a moment, Sarge.

270
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,560
Perhaps you'd like to discuss
the program first, ma'am.

271
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,120
What's to discuss?

272
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,640
Think I want to hang out here
and listen to arteries hardening?

273
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,000
Where did I put that bulletproof vest?

274
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,840
All right, fall in! Come on, please, line up.

275
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,200
Come on, I need a lineup here.

276
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400
Hello, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen--

277
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,960
-Thank you, Miss....
-Mrs. Feldman.

278
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,120
I want to welcome all of you
to the Academy.

279
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,800
You are part of a new
and exciting program that I call...

280
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,360
-C.O.P.
-C.O.P.

281
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,440
-Citizens On Patrol.
-Citizens On Patrol.

282
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,520
-Citizens On Patrol!
-Citizens On Patrol!

283
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,320
You will work and train with the police.

284
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,920
The police will work and train with you.

285
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,640
Working and training,
training and working.

286
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Excuse me, Commandant.

287
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,840
But do you expect the community
to do the job of the police force?

288
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
There are many, many jobs
for many, many people.

289
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,560
Sir, I'll take care of this.

290
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,600
Excuse me, young lady,
what the Commandant means...

291
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
is that this program
will promote understanding...

292
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,120
between the community and the police...

293
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,560
and make the community
more active in crime prevention.

294
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,520
Active in crime prevention?
Won't that be dangerous?

295
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,720
No. We just want to teach citizens...

296
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
to prevent crimes from taking place.

297
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,240
It sounds fine in theory.
Let's hope it works in practice.

298
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,000
I like him. He's a really nice fish.

299
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,440
He looks a little like you.

300
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,640
I will attend
an international police seminar in London.

301
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,120
It would be
the crowning achievement of my career...

302
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
if I could close this seminar...

303
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,600
by bringing instructors
from all around the world...

304
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,960
here to watch
the C.O.P. program in action.

305
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,160
I'm counting on all of you
to make that possible.

306
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,400
In Comdt. Lassard's absence...

307
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,040
I've appointed a very able-bodied
and experienced officer...

308
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
to run the Academy.

309
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,000
Perfect timing. Here he is now.

310
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,560
Attention!

311
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
Two weeks of Harris? Damn!

312
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,600
Damn.

313
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,320
Deodorant? Thanks.

314
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,640
Straighten this mess up.

315
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,200
-What mess?
-Now!

316
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,840
I want all of you dirtbags
and that group of C.O.P. people...

317
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,640
out in front of this dormitory
at 1400 hours.

318
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,840
Move it!

319
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,000
Sir, we were just commenting
on how you'd mellowed.

320
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,320
-Captain?
-What is it, Mahoney?

321
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,760
I hope you're gonna
give this program a fair chance.

322
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,040
This program, Mahoney,
is just like you: a bad idea.

323
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,720
That's your opinion, sir.

324
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,840
But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea,
and his Academy.

325
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,000
Things can change, Mahoney.

326
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,360
Yes, things can change.

327
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,560
I'll see you out front.

328
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,160
I bet that was refreshing, sir.

329
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
Over the next two weeks...

330
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,840
you'll go through
a modified training program.

331
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,360
You'll learn many, many keys
to crime prevention.

332
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,920
Keys you can teach many, many others
in your community.

333
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,920
Modified? Modified nothing.
I want the works.

334
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,720
-Yeah.
-Madam...

335
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,840
I think it's time for a dose of reality.

336
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,600
You can forget Lassard's hype.

337
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,640
You people do not belong here.

338
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,640
Especially you and you.

339
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,440
Community action groups mean one thing,
and one thing only.

340
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
I hope that wasn't gum.

341
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,560
You heard the Captain. Is it?

342
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,240
It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum.
Cherry, I think.

343
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
-Thank you, Proctor.
-You're welcome, sir.

344
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,960
These groups only mean
citizens getting in the way of the police.

345
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,320
Now, I don't get involved
in your business...

346
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,200
and I don't want you involved in my--

347
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,320
Now, if you were smart...

348
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,000
you would go home
and forget this stupid idea....

349
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,640
Are those wedding bells I hear, sir?

350
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,920
-Whose damn mutt is this?
-It's my damn mutt.

351
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
I want him out of here!

352
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,040
-But, sir--
-Out!

353
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,040
I am not getting rid of Clarence.
He's my pet.

354
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,800
Why should you?
After all, Harris has Proctor.

355
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,800
I'll take him.

356
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,400
I have a big house, nice yard.

357
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,840
See, he likes me. We'll get along fine.

358
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,040
Me, too? I'm housebroken.

359
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,760
Come on, C.O.Ps,
let's step up to the white line!

360
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,160
Let's line ourselves up with a slot,
then let's listen to Mr. Jones.

361
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry.

362
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,920
This is a standard police issue.38.

363
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,240
Examine this weapon carefully.

364
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,440
You must be sure
this weapon is not loaded.

365
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,720
You will be responsible for the loading
and unloading of this weapon yourself.

366
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,840
Now, Sgt. Tackleberry.

367
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,040
You want to become one with the gun.

368
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,720
Feel the gun, caress the gun...

369
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,800
until it's a living, breathing, vibrating...

370
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,120
extension of yourself.

371
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,840
I look for the same in a woman.

372
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,800
This sucker's not loaded.

373
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,960
You won't be using live ammo.

374
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,800
Tack, how about letting me squeeze off
a few rounds of that baby?

375
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,320
Tack?

376
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,920
Affirmative, Mrs. F.

377
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,000
Now, be careful
because a.44 magnum has quite a...

378
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,520
kick.

379
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
Damn, that was fun!

380
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,800
Rescuing the drowning victim.

381
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,800
Now, when approaching
a potentially dangerous...

382
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,120
and out-of-control victim,
use this stroke only.

383
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,920
Arms out of the way for protection.

384
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,720
Now, when you get the victim in control,
you slip your arm across his chest...

385
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,240
under his opposite arm.

386
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,720
Rest his head and his neck
against your shoulder.

387
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,240
Kick with your feet.
Now, your victim could be struggling.

388
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,600
Struggle, House. Good, House....

389
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
House!

390
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,760
Really swift! I'll get him!

391
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,960
Arnie, get out of the pool! You just ate!

392
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,840
Get him out of here!

393
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
Thanks, pal.

394
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,840
Now we have an opportunity
to start our water safety lesson.

395
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,640
I will play the drowning victim.

396
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,000
Now, who's going to save me?

397
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,760
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

398
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,800
That was mighty brave. I admire that.

399
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,840
That was nothing.

400
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,120
You don't have a hair dryer,
or perhaps some mousse?

401
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,400
No. Your hair looks nice. It's very stylish.

402
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,720
Moi?
Stylish?

403
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,640
I think I'd better be going.

404
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
Mickey!

405
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,160
He's dead! He killed him!

406
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,320
-I'm sure the Academy will pay for it.
-What about the sentimental value?

407
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,320
This is a family heirloom here.

408
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,800
This is the last thing I ever stole
before joining the Academy.

409
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,600
What the hell is this? Cadets in heat?

410
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,400
No. We were just, like, talking.

411
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,120
Just, like, talk somewhere else.

412
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,320
This is not a spawning pool.
I want discipline.

413
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,760
Do I make myself clear, Zed?

414
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,640
Discipline!

415
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,720
-Jerk.
-What?

416
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,360
He said bye.

417
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,640
No. I said jerk. I think it was pretty clear.

418
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,440
-I said, "Jerk."
-Jerk.

419
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,320
Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you...

420
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,640
something that will be
vital for you to know...

421
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,200
when you're, like, out there on the job
as a police officer.

422
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,160
And that's the correct way
to eat a doughnut.

423
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,040
-A doughnut--
-Attention!

424
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,240
Capt. Harris.

425
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,560
From this moment on, anyone
who misplaces their canister of Mace...

426
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,640
will be reprimanded and fined.

427
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,960
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

428
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Bye.

429
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
As Citizens On Patrol...

430
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,120
endurance and longevity
should be very important to you.

431
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,200
Aerobic activity will keep you in shape...

432
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,800
and keep that heart rate up.

433
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Music, however,
makes it a little less painful.

434
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,440
Hooks, cassette.

435
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,840
I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks
has chosen the appropriate music.

436
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
No cassette.

437
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,840
Let's go.

438
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,440
Nice selection, Hooks. All right.

439
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,600
Slow walk. Slow start.

440
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,760
Keep your arms moving. That's good.

441
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,240
Into a nice slow jog. Okay!

442
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,040
Arms moving. Keep breathing.
Don't forget to breathe.

443
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,760
Tuck his tummy, Hooks. Attagirl. Let's go.

444
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,320
Now, this whistle can be very valuable...

445
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,800
when walking through
a bad neighborhood.

446
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,720
If your purse gets snatched,
blow this whistle...

447
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,240
to alert your neighbors and the police
so they can help.

448
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,960
Now, Mrs. Feldman,
would you play the victim?

449
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
-Yes.
-Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher.

450
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,840
-Okay.
-Go.

451
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
Any questions?

452
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
Now, practice.

453
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,800
You had him for, like, a minute.
He was scared. He was, like, flinching.

454
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,400
His face went....

455
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,040
Sorry.

456
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,920
Citizens On Patrol. What a joke.

457
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,600
-You know what C.O.P. really stands for?
-No, sir. What?

458
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,920
-Collection Of Pissants. That's not funny.
-No, sir.

459
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,320
This citizen-action crap is a disaster,
a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it.

460
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,520
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,000
Excuse me, everyone.

462
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,440
I mean, not everyone.

463
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,800
Attention! Excuse me. Move it!

464
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,440
-Everybody, come over here!
-Hooks.

465
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,960
Stop embarrassing the Police Department
and join your civilian buddies.

466
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,120
May I have your attention, please?
Hooks, the tank!

467
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,120
-I'm so sorry.
-You dimwit!

468
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,400
Today, Hooks, today.

469
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Now, take your little munchkin voice
and go away.

470
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
Listen up!

471
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,360
This is the proper procedure
for administering oxygen.

472
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,200
You place the mask securely
about the face of the patient...

473
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,640
and then have them breathe deeply.

474
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,440
Now, that is the way it's done
in Capt. Harris' precinct.

475
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,560
What the hell? Hooks!

476
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,920
So you gentlemen think
you're on a vacation?

477
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,560
You're no better than anyone else,
so let's go, let's get to work.

478
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,520
Come on, dudes, chill out.

479
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,360
You dudes are setting a bad example.

480
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,600
Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see
I'm getting my beauty sleep?

481
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,800
Move it!

483
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
You sure told them.

484
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,040
Did you ever think about
maybe getting some contact lenses...

485
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,240
or something, like, you know?

486
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,720
You'd look good in them.

487
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,000
Proctor, this is an alley.

488
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,720
I know, sir, but these are the directions
Mahoney gave me.

489
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
-Mahoney?
-Yes, sir.

490
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,240
He says this restaurant
has the best salad bar in town.

491
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,200
It damn sure better have.

492
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,600
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir?

493
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,800
I don't see a salad bar.

494
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
Look, maybe they serve seafood.

495
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,800
That's not funny, you idiot.

496
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,000
What are you looking at, you peckerhead?

497
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,440
Nice uniform.
Makes me wish I'd worn my sailor outfit.

498
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,640
I'm getting out of here. Move it!

499
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,440
I don't think cutting in is allowed, sir.

500
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,040
Nice collar.

501
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Here we go again. Next round.
Mahoney weaving his way through...

502
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
looking pretty good.
Gets past the main defense.

503
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,360
And, under the leg!

504
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,960
Nice shot!

505
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,560
That man is a hot dog.
The crowd's gone wild!

506
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,720
The ball's brought in.
Here we go. We have the play going.

507
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
Throws to Zed.

508
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,120
A little bit of a steal there.

509
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,200
Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower.

510
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,840
And then Hightower he....
The Doctor of Dunk scores!

511
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,240
You killed it. Really swift!

512
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,720
Some community action.

513
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite!

514
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,520
Thank you very much.

515
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,640
I'm honored to be--

516
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,520
You know,
Capt. Harris isn't gonna like this...

517
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,720
goofing off.

518
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,360
-Come on. This is community relations.
-No, Mahoney.

519
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,760
I'm an expert in goofing off,
and this is goofing off.

520
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,000
And I'm gonna have to tell him.

521
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,800
-I have an urge to break him in half.
-Why fight it?

522
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,440
No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy.
The creep's not worth it.

523
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,200
-You through in there?
-Sure, go ahead.

524
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,400
Thanks.

525
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,640
Excuse me, Silvio?

526
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,800
I wonder if you can help me.
I need some help over here.

527
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,840
-Right there.
-No problem.

528
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,520
Hold your horses, I'll be out in a minute!

529
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,200
Okay, like, bring it in.

530
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,120
Just, like, bring it in a hair.

531
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,120
Watch out for the plane!

532
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,600
Oh, the humanity!

533
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,440
Okay, that's perfect. No, that's fine.

534
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,920
-Metro police.
-Special assignment.

535
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,800
Ladies and gentlemen...

536
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,520
please rise for our national anthem.

537
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,440
-Read that part about me again, Arnie.
-What part?

538
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,200
You know, the part about
the dynamic leader of the C.O.P.

539
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,800
Get real! That's me they're talking about.

540
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,520
Good evening, gentlemen.
I congratulate you on another good day.

541
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,960
Sleep well.

542
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,400
Count, getting worried
we're gonna be taking over soon?

543
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,840
We're ready.

544
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,440
You're improving, guys. But you're still
way down in the food chain.

545
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,440
As we vampires say, "Lights out, suckers."

546
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,920
This C.O.P. bit is a breeze.

547
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,000
-We are ready.
-I concur.

548
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,720
I think we're ready to bust
some truly major criminals.

549
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,200
Maybe we should go out and find some....

550
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,400
-Maybe we should become vigilantes.
-Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes.

551
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,240
Wake up, men! We need you. Now!

552
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,120
Come on.

553
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,400
-What's going on? Where are we going?
-Why are we here? What's happening?

554
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,400
You're here because you're ready.
You said you were ready.

555
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,720
-One thing l--
-You're ready, now.

556
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,640
Could you be a little more specific
concerning our current mission?

557
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,360
-We're apprehending two known felons.
-I'll be going home now.

558
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,040
-Where are the rest?
-What rest? We're it.

559
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,000
-We'll flush them out of the building.
-You stay behind, cut them off in the alley.

560
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,120
Stay.

561
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,960
What about guns and shit, man?

562
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,440
Guns? No, you won't be needing them.

563
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,920
We're pretty sure they're not armed.

564
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,200
They can handle this without us.
We'll just get in the way, you know.

565
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,720
Good thinking.

566
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,240
We got them, men!

567
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,400
It's all right, men. Come on over.

568
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,360
All right, you three
will be riding in the back with Badula...

569
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,720
and his late brother.

570
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,640
You guys keep him subdued.

571
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,240
Let's go.

572
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,560
Don't let his voodoo
mumbo jumbo scare you.

573
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,320
Fools. To think
they can kill the brother of Badula.

574
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,160
I never thought that.

575
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,720
That I could reach into the belly of a yak
and rip out his heart.

576
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,600
That would bring him back to life?

577
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,040
No, man. I'm hungry.

578
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,640
Listen, we're going for some burgers
and fries. We'll be right back.

579
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,440
Out of my way!

580
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,600
I guess they weren't as ready
as they thought they were.

581
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,040
You can take the mask off now, Tack.

582
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,400
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir?

583
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,120
-Who are all these people?
-They're here for the party, sir.

584
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,960
What party?

585
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,240
A few of the Citizens On Patrol members
invited a few of their friends...

586
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,960
and they invited a few of their friends.
You know how it goes, sir.

587
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,600
-A party?
-Yes, sir.

588
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,440
A party? Why wasn't I told?

589
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,160
Hey, Callahan. Hey, Hooks.

590
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,040
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

591
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

592
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,400
I'd like to thank you all for coming!

593
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,160
Let's party!

594
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,600
-Move those patooties.
-Excuse me.

595
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,320
All police officers out of the pool!

596
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,320
Let's go! Out, everybody out!

597
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,320
Sir, why don't you just
let everyone enjoy themselves?

598
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,760
Why don't you just
kiss my rosy red ass, Mahoney?

599
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,040
Rosy?

600
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,360
Get out of that pool now!

601
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,040
Just look at yourself.

602
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,360
You are a disgrace to the uniform!
Go get changed. Move it.

603
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,840
-What are we looking for?
-This.

604
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,840
-Why, Capt. Harris.
-Miss Mattson.

605
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,360
-Hello.
-How are you?

606
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Have you seen Clarence?

607
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,440
Don't you let that fleabag near me.

608
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,000
Clarence is crazy about you, Captain.
Let me just call him over.

609
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,520
-No.
-For a second?

610
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,240
-No.
-Okay. Bye.

611
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,640
Wipe those grins off your faces,
buttbreaths! Dismissed!

612
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,000
Dr. Berman, please pick up line two.
Dr. Berman, line two, please.

613
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,040
-You shouldn't be in here.
-How is Capt. Harris?

614
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,440
-We'll do all we can.
-Please, be gentle.

615
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,640
I heard what Harris said, and he's wrong.

616
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,200
It happens to me all the time.
People just don't understand me.

617
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,000
Maybe if you talked a little slower,
a little softer....

618
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,000
That's not what I meant. I meant
people don't know who I really am.

619
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,520
Now I got to worry about my diction, too?

620
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,840
-How's my sentence structure?
-Perfect.

621
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,320
In fact, I think you're just about perfect.

622
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,960
I think I'm going to puke.

623
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,920
Hi, sir. How are you feeling?

624
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,360
I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

625
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,800
I didn't catch that.

626
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
Was that, "the dim shoot to snare off"?

627
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,600
I said I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

628
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,040
So I asked her,
"Do you always work under podiums?"

629
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,640
Commandant?

630
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,920
Why, Chief Hurst,
this is a splendid, splendid surprise!

631
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,600
You remember Nogata?
He's part of our Japanese contingent.

632
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,400
This is Chief Hurst.

633
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,040
We have heard many, many
wonderful things about you and your city.

634
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,000
I've been helping them with their English.

635
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,440
-Please, sit. Please.
-Thank you.

636
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,520
I hope you'll find the time
to see our beautiful city firsthand.

637
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,360
In fact, I've just flown here personally...

638
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,560
to extend the Mayor's invitation...

639
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,320
to see my....

640
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,520
To see Comdt. Lassard's
community program in action.

641
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,840
We are convinced
that this program will serve...

642
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,120
as a model for cities around the world.

643
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,120
We would be honored
to accept your invitation.

644
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,560
-Wonderful.
-Please, come.

645
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,520
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Arrivederci.

646
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,840
Bonsoir.

647
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,560
I see you've been teaching them
something other than English.

648
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,120
I do what I can.

649
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,520
-So my program is really, really working?
-Hell, yes.

650
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,840
Starting tomorrow,
C.O.Ps will be working the streets.

651
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,840
C.O.P. emergency. Feldman here.

652
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,840
Meet me at the corner of
Clark and Main Street at the warehouse.

653
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,360
10-4, Mrs. F.

654
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,240
-$40, we're agreed?
-Okay, $40.

655
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,800
Snap off a few shots for evidence.

656
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,120
Get closer.

657
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,360
I saw this on Hill Street Blues.
It's a fencing operation.

658
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,760
You're gonna love these.
We just unloaded a van full of them.

659
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,320
Okay, bring in the rest of it.

660
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,760
Next case.

661
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,720
Nice camera.
Don't let that crook give you less than $80.

662
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,000
Freeze, you scuzzbuckets!

663
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,160
This is a citizen's arrest. Get them, boys!

664
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,320
You're not moving till the cops get here.

665
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,640
I am the cops, lady.

666
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,000
Three months' work
out the window, down the drain.

667
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,360
Your Citizens On Patrol just screwed up...

668
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,360
the single biggest
undercover police sting operation...

669
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,440
in the history of this city!

670
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,640
Tell them the good news, sir.

671
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,440
-Thank you, Proctor.
-You're welcome, sir.

672
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:04,800
As of now,
the C.O.P. program is suspended...

673
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,640
pending a full investigation.

674
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,120
Attention!

675
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,520
Mahoney, I'm so, so proud
of the job you've done.

676
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,200
Nice work, men.

677
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,200
The eyes of the world are on this program.

678
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Excuse me, sir. I think we should talk.

679
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,640
This precinct must deal with
every type of criminal...

680
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,200
from pickpockets to armed robbers,
felons of all kinds--

681
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,160
Capt. Harris. Excuse me.
Don't forget the gang of ninjas.

682
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,640
They're my personal favorites.

683
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,400
Why don't you go pay them a visit?

684
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,800
This precinct is run on discipline
and organization.

685
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,040
Simon says, "Pull your left ear."

686
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,320
Simon says, "Hop on your left foot."
Come on, guys.

687
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,800
Simon says, "Hop on your right foot."

688
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,160
It's a little too noisy in here, gentlemen.

689
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,120
We have important
police officials visiting...

690
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,720
and I think you'd better show
the proper respect.

691
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,760
Come on, Lieutenant.
We're almost finished.

692
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Come on, Lieutenant,
join us in a friendly game of Simon Says.

693
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,320
There's nothing to it.
Now, Simon says, "Touch your toes."

694
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,600
Come on, Lieutenant.
Simon says, "Clap your hands."

695
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,160
Come on, get in the spirit.

696
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,520
Simon says, "Two steps right."

697
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,440
Simon says, "Five steps back."

698
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,640
Put your hands up!

699
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,160
Simon didn't say.

700
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,200
No, but Smith & Wesson does.

701
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,720
The high-security cell area
is used to hold criminals...

702
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,600
awaiting trial or transfer
to state or county facility.

703
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,200
Any convictions involving felons...

704
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,240
perverts, thieves, people of that nature,
are held in this area.

705
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,040
-You will notice the steel construction.
-What the hell is he doing in there?

706
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,720
I think that explains it, sir.

707
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,720
Come on, hurry up!

708
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,200
It's getting to the point now
when I'm with you

709
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,040
I no longer want
to have something stuck in my eye

710
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,040
Your mother, my mother
ain't never looked like Florence Henderson

711
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,920
I wrote that for you.

712
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,040
I hope now that C.O.P. is over...

713
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,800
it won't mean that we won't
be seeing each other anymore.

714
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,400
Shut up! Not you. I meant the ducks.

715
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,560
Attention. This is Mrs. F.

716
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,720
-There's been a jailbreak.
-Zed, 10-4!

717
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,240
Tack, you pick me up at Main and Maple.

718
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,600
Move it! Over and out.

719
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,960
Commandant!

720
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,320
-There's been a jailbreak, sir.
-Get in.

721
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,640
-It is so wonderful to see you again, baby.
-It's wonderful to be seen.

722
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,440
-Just like old times.
-ln America, talk is cheap.

723
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,720
There's been a jailbreak!

724
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,520
Look, there's a stolen police car.
That's got to be it.

725
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,400
I think we got a robbery in progress.

726
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,840
Stay here, Mrs. Feldman.

727
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,360
-Freeze!
-Good idea.

728
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,640
All right, I want everybody
to get back in that vault.

729
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,920
Book them, Tack.

730
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,560
-There's a ninja now.
-I see him.

731
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,920
Come on, let's get him. Let's go.

732
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,360
Do you see him?

733
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,160
Shit.

734
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,240
All right. If it's a fight you want,
a fight you'll get.

735
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,160
Damn you. You're gonna pay for that.

736
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,240
Shut up!

737
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,160
Will you two morons, knock it off!

738
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,040
We've got an international incident
going on here!

739
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,640
-I knew you'd come.
-Ja, danke.

740
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,120
-You may thank Mrs. Feldman.
-Who is Mrs. Feldman?

741
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,400
You know Mrs. Feldman,
a member of the defunct C.O.P. team.

742
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,960
This is Sgt. Mahoney
in pursuit of a stolen police car.

743
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,040
I'm headed towards
the Williams County air show.

744
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees
toward the Williams County air show.

745
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,800
Now, folks,
making his second appearance...

746
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,160
at the Williams County air show....

747
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,000
-Look out for that car!
-What car?

748
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,560
That car! Come on, get out!

749
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,560
Come on!

750
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,560
Let's get out of here!

751
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,760
Hurry up!

752
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,640
This is where I draw the line.
I'm not going up in one of those things.

753
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,640
-No way. No, sirree.
-You don't have to.

754
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,200
You can open your eyes now.

755
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,360
How can you like this
better than my driving?

756
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,640
Because you can't do this in a car.

757
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,560
Grab that balloon!

758
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,000
We commandeer this balloon
in the name of the law!

759
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,720
-No, wait, you can't!
-You can't do that. We need it for the race.

760
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,520
Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car.
Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me.

761
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,720
Guys, wait up! Tackleberry.

762
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,600
-What do I pull?
-Take it up!

763
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,040
-They're getting away! Let's go!
-We are going up, sir.

764
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,760
Come on! Drop the parachute!

765
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,000
Stop screwing around!

766
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,000
-Come on! Drop the parachute!
-Come on!

767
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,720
If he doesn't want to do it, don't push him.

768
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,040
He's gotta, like, wanna help himself.

769
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,120
You land that balloon right now!

770
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,760
This is Capt. Harris! You are under arrest!

771
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,400
Land that balloon now!

772
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,320
-I'll just blast them out of the sky, sir.
-No! Not yet.

773
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,120
You're right.
I should give them a warning shot first.

774
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,240
lmbecile! Are you happy now?

775
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,240
At least it looks like
we're coming down in the river.

776
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,800
It won't matter
because you're going to be dead!

777
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,040
Pretty view--

778
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,920
I hate water!

779
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,000
Help!

780
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,640
-They're in the river.
-Hurry. Maybe we can catch them.

781
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,560
I'll pull alongside Tackleberry.

782
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,840
Look, I see my house!

783
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,000
Look, the crooks!

784
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,120
Let's go get them, okay?

785
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,400
Hang on, sir!

786
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,640
-Hurry, before they go over the falls!
-There they go!

787
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,160
Get a rope!

788
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,040
Hang on. Hang on, sir!

789
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,720
Hang on, we'll come and get you!

790
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,000
Grab it!

791
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,800
Try to relax!

792
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,960
There's the balloon! Now I've got them.

793
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,240
There's only one way to do this
and it's up to me!

794
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,040
-Take over!
-He was talking to you!

795
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,440
If you're coming back, bring some beer!

796
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,120
-No. He was talking to you.
-No, I heard him.

797
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,520
-He said, "Sweetchuck, take over."
-No, he did not.

798
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,800
-Get off of my foot!
-Shut up! Why are you always whining?

799
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,600
Leave me alone!

800
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,400
Gentlemen, may I see your license
and registration, please?

801
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,000
There they are. Take it down.
I want to get close. Get closer.

802
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,240
Mahoney, what are you doing?

803
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,040
Get in closer!

804
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,840
What do you think you're doing?

805
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,440
I'll take care of you, copper!

806
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,160
Get off my wing! Get off of there!

807
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,200
What will you do about them?

808
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,360
Pal, it's over. Let's go home.

809
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,400
-I hate you.
-I'm not really thrilled about you!

810
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,800
-Why don't you lose some weight?
-Why don't you get out and walk?

811
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,720
-I'm going to be sick!
-I don't have a parachute!

812
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,760
-Shut up! I'm going to be sick!
-Don't be sick on me!

813
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,840
-I don't have a chute!
-Break your fall!

814
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,000
-Hit the kids!
-No, I need a chute!

815
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,160
Get your own! Get away from me!

816
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,840
Come on!

817
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,920
Let go!

818
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,800
I'll break you in half, you dweeb.

819
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,320
There, I opened the chute.
Are you satisfied? Leave me alone!

820
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,400
-I'm going to kill you!
-Shut up and enjoy the flight!

821
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,760
Get off me!

822
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,120
Commandant, they say
your Citizens On Patrol group...

823
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,200
does many, many
wonderful and crazy things.

824
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,160
I think Sgt. Mahoney
deserves a special bow.

825
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,200
-Mahoney?
-All right!

826
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,960
-Mahoney?
-Way to go!

827
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,040
Get up! Look, it's Mahoney!

828
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,960
-Where?
-Sorry.

829
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,840
-To the Academy.
-To the Academy.

830
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,560
You know, you look
a little like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.

831
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,360
-Yeah?
-No!
