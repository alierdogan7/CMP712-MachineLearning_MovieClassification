- But it's the same with us, Harry.
- What do you mean?

357
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:08,326
I mean we've got two children,
and we've had sexual intercourse twice.

358
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:11,806
That's not the point.
We could have it any time we wanted.

359
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:14,689
- Really?
- And what's more, since we don't believe...

360
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:17,687
in all that papist claptrap,
we can take precautions.

361
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,047
What you mean, lock the door?

362
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,844
No. I mean because we're members
of the Protestant Reformed Church...

363
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:27,325
which successfully challenged
the autocratic power of the Papacy...

364
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:31,169
in the mid-16th century, we can wear
little rubber devices to prevent issue.

365
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:32,370
What do you mean?

366
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,128
I could, if I wanted,
have sexual intercourse with you.

367
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:36,443
Oh, yes, Harry.

368
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:39,208
And, by wearing a rubber sheath
over my old fellow...

369
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:43,049
I could ensure that when I came off,
you would not be impregnated.

370
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:47,609
That's what being a Protestant's all about.
That's why it's the church for me.

371
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:50,892
That's why it's the church
for anyone who respects the individual...

372
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,012
and the individual's right
to decide for him or herself.

373
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:58,288
When Martin Luther nailed his protest
up to the church door in 1517...

374
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,845
he may not have realised
the full significance of what he was doing...

375
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:04,574
but 400 years later, thanks to him...

376
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,374
I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

377
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:10,373
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom.

378
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:13,891
- Oh, no! I can wear French Ticklers if I want.
- You what?

379
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,967
French Ticklers, black mambos,
crocodile ribs.

380
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:19,728
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect...

381
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:23,091
but also to enhance
the stimulation of sexual congress.

382
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,244
Have you got one?

383
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:27,805
Have I got one? No, but I can go down
the road anytime I want...

384
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:32,008
and walk into Harry's, and hold my head
up high and say, in a loud, steady voice:

385
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,563
"Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.

386
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:38,489
"In fact, today I think I'll have
a French Tickler, for I am a Protestant."

387
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:40,645
- Why don't you?
- But they cannot.

388
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:44,206
Because their church never made
the leap out of the Middle Ages...

389
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,173
and the domination of
alien Episcopal supremacy.

390
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:49,571
NARRATOR: But despite the attempts
of Protestants...

391
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,805
to promote the idea of sex for pleasure...

392
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,171
children continue to multiply everywhere.

393
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:05,447
WILLIAMS: "And spotteth twice
they the camels before the third hour.

394
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:10,205
"And so the Midianites
went forth to Ram Gilead...

395

00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:32,685
"yea, and placed they the bits in little pots."

402
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:36,013
Here endeth the lesson.

403
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:38,365
Let us praise God.

404
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,129
Oh, Lord.

405
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:46,291
CONGREGATION: Oh, Lord.

406
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,371
You are so big.

407
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:52,285
CONGREGATION: You are so big.

408
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,168
So absolutely huge.

409
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:58,846
CONGREGATION: So absolutely huge.

410
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:03,926
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

411
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,891
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

412
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,367
Forgive us, Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

413
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,689
CONGREGATION: And barefaced flattery.

414
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:21,810
But you're so strong,
and, well, just so super.

415
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,413
CONGREGATION: Fantastic.

416
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,085
CHAPLAIN: Amen, Reverend.
CONGREGATION: Amen.

417
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,366
Now two boys have been found...

418
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:32,333
rubbing linseed oil
into the school cormorant.

419
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,333
Some of you may feel
that the cormorant does not play...

420
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:40,090
an important part in the life
of the school, but I would remind you...

421
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:44,009
that it was presented to us by
the corporation of the town of Sudbury...

422
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,768
to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember...

423
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,653
the names of all those from
the Sudbury area...

424
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:52,044
who so gallantly gave their lives...

425
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,486
to keep China British.

426
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:59,214
So from now on,
the cormorant is strictly out of bounds!

427
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:05,847
And Jenkins,
apparently your mother died this morning.

428
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,444
Chaplain.

429
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:09,332
[Religious organ music]

430
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:15,171
ALL: [Singing] O Lord, please don't burn us

431
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,612
Don't grill or toast your flock

432
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:23,248
Don't put us on the barbecue

433
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:27,045
Or simmer us in stock

434
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:31,324
Don't braise or bake or boil us

435
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:35,165
Or stir-fry us in a wok

436
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:40,334
Oh, please don't lightly poach us

437
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:43,771
Or baste us with hot fat

438
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:49,213
Don't fricassee or roast us

439
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:52,447
Or boil us in a vat

440
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:57,805
And please don't stick thy servants, Lord

441
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:01,644
In a Rotissomat

442
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,450
He's coming!

443
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:18,049
All right, settle down, settle down.

444
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,044
Before I begin the lesson,
will those of you...

445
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:25,172
playing in the match this afternoon
move your clothes down...

446
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,644
onto the lower peg
immediately after lunch...

447
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:30,568
before you write home,
if you're not getting a haircut...

448
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,614
unless you have a brother going out
this weekend as the guest of another boy...

449
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:38,483
then collect his note before lunch,
put it in your letter after your haircut.

450
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,726
Make sure he moves your clothes
onto the lower peg for you.

451
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,653
- Sir?
- Yes, Wymer?

452
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,169
My brother's going out
with Dibble this weekend...

453
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,610
but I'm not having my hair cut,
so do I move...

454
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:51,812
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

455
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:56,014
If you're not getting your hair cut, you
don't have to move your brother's clothes.

456
00:36:56,095 --> 00:37:00,452
You simply collect his note before lunch,
after you've done your scripture prep...

457
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:03,214
when you've written your letter home
before rest...

458
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,412
move your clothes onto the lower peg,
greet the visitors...

459
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,612
and report to Mr. Viney
that you've had your chit signed.

460
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:11,889
Now, sex.

461
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:17,773
Sex, sex, sex. Where were we?

462
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:26,213
Well, had I got as far as
the penis entering the vagina?

463
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,765
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

464
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:35,531
Well, had I done foreplay?

465
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,529
Yes, sir.

466
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,134
As we all know all about foreplay,
no doubt you can tell me...

467
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:46,723
what the purpose of foreplay is...

468
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:48,964
Biggs.

469
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,893
Don't know. Sorry, sir.

470
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:56,484
Carter?

471
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:01,405
Was it taking your clothes off, sir?

472
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:03,968
And after that?

473
00:38:05,135 --> 00:38:07,205
Putting them on a lower peg, sir.

474
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:13,169
WILLIAMS: The purpose of foreplay is
to cause the vagina to lubricate...

475
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:16,851
so that the penis can penetrate more easily.

476
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:18,928
Could we open a window, sir?

477
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:20,573
Yes. Harris, will you?

478
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:25,285
And, of course, to cause the man's penis
to erect and harden.

479
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:31,892
Now, did I do vaginal juices last week?

480
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,170
Pay attention, Wadsworth!
I know it's Friday.

481
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,483
Watching the football?

482
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,169
Boy, move over there. I'm warning you.

483
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:41,654
I may decide to set an exam this term.

484
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:43,774
- Oh, sir!
- Sir!

485
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,806
So just listen.

486
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:52,571
Now did I or did I not do vaginal juices?

487
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:55,843
Yes, sir.

488
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:58,927
Name two ways
of getting them flowing, Watson.

489
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,413
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

490
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,206
What's wrong with a kiss, boy?

491
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,849
Why not start her off with a nice kiss?

492
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:16,005
You don't have to leap
straight for the clitoris like a bull at a gate.

493
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:17,892
Give her a kiss, boy.

494
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:22,527
- Suck the nipple, sir?
- Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

495
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,732
DUCKWORTH: Stroking the thighs, sir?
WILLIAMS: Yes. I suppose so.

496
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,011
STUDENT: Biting the neck.
WILLIAMS: Yes, good.

497
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,491
Nibbling the ear lobe, kneading
the buttocks, and so on and so forth.

498
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:34,806
So we have all these
possibilities before we...

499
00:39:34,895 --> 00:39:37,887
stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.

500
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,967
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

501
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:45,050
Now, all these forms of stimulation
can now take place.

502
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:56,729
Of course,
tonguing will give you the best idea...

503
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:59,773
of how the juices are coming along.

504
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:01,370
Helen?

505
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:04,771
Now, penetration and coitus,
that is to say, intercourse...

506
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:07,733
up to and including orgasm.

507
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,050
Hello, dear.

508
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:13,614
Do stand up when my wife
enters the room, Carter.

509
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,844
Sorry, sir.

510
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:19,453
Humphrey, I hope you don't mind. I told
the Garfields we'd dine with them tonight.

511
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:22,811
- Yes, well, I suppose we must.
- I said we'd be there by 8:00.

512
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:25,693
It'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

513
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:28,847
I know you don't like them,
but I couldn't make another excuse.

514
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,607
It's just that I felt...

515
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,244
Wymer!

516
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,173
This is for your benefit.
Would you kindly wake up?

517
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,533
I've no intention
of going through this all again.

518
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,768
We'll take the foreplay as read,
if you don't mind, dear.

519
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:53,924
No, of course not.

520
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:58,770
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife...

521
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,533

more or less fully erect.

WILLIAMS: What is it?

526
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,164
- It's an ocarina, sir.
- Bring it up here.

527
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:21,449
The man now starts making
thrusting movements with his pelvic area...

528

inside the vagina.

529
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,175
Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.

her clitoral stimulation...

531

Do, please,
share your little joke with the rest of us.

537

frightfully funny is going on.

00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:47,684
No, honestly, sir.

539
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:51,370

I think you'd better be selected to play...

against the masters this afternoon.

If we don't meet again, sir...

555
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:07,447
I'd just like to say it's been
a real privilege fighting alongside you, sir.

556
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:10,971
Yes, well, this is hardly the time
or place for a good-bye speech.

557

Me and the lads realise that, sir,
but, well, we may never meet again, so...

558
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,332
All right, Blackitt. Thanks a lot.

559
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:19,053
No, just a moment, sir.

560
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:21,524
Me and the lads,
we've had a little whip around.

561
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:24,652
We've bought you something.
We bought you this.

562

I don't know what to say.

563
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:33,092
It's a lovely thought. Thank you.
Thank you all.

564
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:35,690
But I think we'd better get to cover...

565
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,167
We've got something else
for you as well, sir.

566
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:44,127
Sorry it's another clock,
only there was a bit of a mix-up.

567
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,171
Walters thought he was buyin' a present...

568
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:49,133
and Spadger and I
had already got the other one.

569
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,253
Well, it's beautiful. They're both beautiful.

570
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:57,291
We'd better get to cover now.
I'll thank you properly later on.

He didn't know about the others. It's Swiss.

573
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:05,167
Now, that is thoughtful, Sturridge.
Good man.

574
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:09,288
There's a card, sir, from all of us.
Sorry about the blood, sir.

There's just one other thing, sir.
Spadger, give him the cheque.

579

This is really going too far.

580

It'll be in No. 4 trench.

mixing the sugar and the almonds.

at 15 degrees below zero.

It's all very well to laugh at the military,
but when one considers...

615

- Must have a hell of a hole in your net.
- We've sent for the doctor.

689
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:56,293
- Hardly worth it, is it?
- Yes. Better safe than sorry.

690
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,206
Yes. Good Lord, look at this.

691
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:00,286
By Jove! That's enormous.

692
00:52:00,415 --> 00:52:02,724
You don't think it'll come back, do you?

693
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:04,134
- For more, you mean?
- Yes.

694
00:52:04,215 --> 00:52:06,126
- We'd better get it stitched.
- Right.

695
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:07,409
Hello, Doc!

696
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:11,283
'Morning. I came as fast as I could.
Is something up?

697
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:16,012
Yes. During the night,
old Perkins got his leg bitten, sort of, off.

698
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:19,254
Yeah. Been in the wars, have we?

699
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:20,810
Yes.

700
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,006
Any headache? Bowels all right?

701
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:27,252
Well, let's have a look at
this one leg of yours, then.

702
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,366
Yes. Yes.

703
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,331
- Yes, well, this is nothing to worry about.
- Good.

704
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:40,169
There's a lot of it about. Probably a virus.
Keep warm, plenty of rest...

705
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:43,884
and if you're playing football or anything,
try and favour the other leg.

706
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:44,885
Right.

707
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:47,205
As right as rain in a couple of days.

708
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:50,651
- Thanks for the reassurance.
- Not at all. That's what I'm here for.

709
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:53,090
Any other problems
I can reassure you about?

710
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,449
No, I'm fine.

711
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:56,526
Jolly good. Well, must be off.

712
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:59,727
So it'll just grow back again, then, will it?

713
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:06,293
I think I'd better come clean with you
about this.

714
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:09,572
It's not a virus, I'm afraid.

715
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:13,925
You see, a virus is what we doctors call
very, very small.

716
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:17,405
So small it could not possibly
have made off with a whole leg.

717
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:20,726
What we're looking for,
this is no more than an educated guess...

718
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:23,966
I'd like to make that clear,
is some multicellular life form...

719
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:28,207
with stripes, huge, razor-sharp teeth,
about 11-foot long...

720
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:30,490
and of the genus Felis horribilis.

721
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:33,453
What we doctors, in fact, call a tiger.

722
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:35,848
A tiger?

723
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:37,694
A tiger?

724
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,287
[Men scream in fear]

725
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:43,447
A tiger in Africa?

726
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:45,527
A tiger in Africa?

727
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:51,290
- It's probably escaped from a zoo.
- Doesn't sound very likely to me.

728
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:53,408
SERGEANT: Sir! Sir!

729
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,288
The attack's over, sir.
The Zulus are retreating.

730
00:53:56,455 --> 00:53:57,524
Jolly good.

731
00:53:57,615 --> 00:54:00,925
Quite a lot of casualties, sir.
C-division wiped out. Signal's gone.

732
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:03,085
- Thirty men killed in F-section.
- I see.

733
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:05,564
I should think about 150 men altogether, sir.

734
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:06,690
Jolly good.

735
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:10,211
I haven't got the final figures,
but there's a lot of seriously wounded...

736
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:13,685
Yes, the thing is, Sergeant,
I've got a bit of a problem here.

737
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:17,731
One of the officers has lost a leg.

738
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:22,170
- Oh, no, sir!
- I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger.

739
00:54:22,695 --> 00:54:23,889
In Africa?

740
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:28,010
The M.O. Says we can stitch it back on
if we can find it immediately.

741
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,327
- Right, sir. I'll organise a party.
- It's hardly the time for that, Sergeant.

742
00:54:33,415 --> 00:54:36,452
- A search party.
- Much better idea.

743
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:40,365
[Men groaning in agony]

744
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:42,449
Sorry about the mess.

745
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,969
We'll try to clear it up
by the time you get back.

746
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,205
SOLDIER: We showed 'em, right, sir?
AINSWORTH: Yes.

747
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,251
We got a search party. Leave that alone.

748
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:52,327
All this killing, bloodshed,
bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?

749
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,325
Very good.

750
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,009
- 'Morning, sir.
- Nasty wound you've got there, fella.

751
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,767
Thank you very much, sir.

752
00:54:59,015 --> 00:55:01,483
AINSWORTH: Come on, Private.
Making up a search party.

753
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:04,851
Better than staying home, isn't it?

754
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:07,125
At home if you kill someone,
they arrest you.

755
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:09,604
Here, they give you a gun
and show you what to do.

756
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:13,768
I mean, I killed 15 of those buggers, sir.
At home, they'd hang me.

757
00:55:14,255 --> 00:55:16,849
Here, they'll give me a fucking medal, sir.

758
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:19,403
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

759

[Ainsworth clears his throat loudly]

761
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:34,448
SERGEANT: Sorry, sir.

762
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:36,334
PAKENHAM: Thank you.

765
00:55:53,215 --> 00:55:54,330
Look!

766
00:55:56,535 --> 00:55:58,446
My God! It's huge!
