Our opening night
less than a week away.

Where in the script does it say
that Truman Capote has a fat, saggy ass?

In the very beginning.
"Enter Capote...

- Oh, Suzi-Q!

- Hey.

- Yeah. I'll call you.

- Whoa! Nice.
- Huh?

When did you
have drinks with her?

19
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,820
The other day.
Didn't I tell you? She stopped by.

20
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,286
- Where was I?
- You were, uh...

21
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,653
- That's right. You were taking a nap.
- Wow.

22
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,659
So, did you make a move?

23
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,559
I wanted to.
I couldn't get her alone.

24
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,929
She had that friend Ruthie with her.
She's like a friggin' shadow.

- Mm-hmm.
- What did Robert Morse do when he did the play?

36
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,262
He did both, but he had
the budget for it, you know?

37
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,339
Okay, we got
12 American Charlies...

two bare-assed...

- Her name is May Fong.

So she says.

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,911

Which one of you two
is in charge of this dump?

just ruined my wife's pants.

Uh, you know, club soda's good for that.

I'm sure the two of you think it's
very progressive to hireJerry's kids...

the freaks in the back...

How many times have I told you
that we don't want the freaks in here?

and it doesn't go through.

be studying your lines?

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,257
- [Walt] Not necessary. Locked and loaded.
- Then help me stack the wood.

162
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,332
I can't. I could pull something.
It's a performance day.

163
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,458
Nice.

164
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,436
Aren't you a little bit nervous?

165
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,669
Uh-uh. What's a four-letter word
for "snatch"?

166
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,847
- "Grab."
- Oh. [Chuckles]

167
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,917
Oopsie.

168
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,386
You're not even
a little bit nervous?

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,788
What's there
to be nervous about?

170
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,860
Well, you're up there,
you know, in a one-man show...

171
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,963
in front of all those people.

172
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,732
- I'd be crappin' myself.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,267
This is my ninth year.
I think I'm just kind of...

174
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,735
I feel like I'm over it,
you know?

175
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,671
- I guess that's how you have to be.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,278
You're doin' that blinkin' thing.

177
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,212
- You're not gonna have a panic attack on me?
- No. I'm cool.

178
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,283

- Yeah.

- Oh, God. Take it easy.

181

- I think I'm dying.

182
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,359
- I'm dying. Oh, God.
- No, you're not.

183
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,791
You're not dying.
You're having a panic attack.

184
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,897
- Get my bag.
- Come on. Take it easy. Take it easy.

185
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,966
Wait. I'm having an arrhythmia.

186
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,360
Here you go. Here you go.
Breathe into the bag.

187
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,494
Short breaths. Here we go.
Concentrate on the breathing.

188
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,665
- It's nine years in a row. I don't wanna go onstage.
- I know you don't.

189
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,777
- Why do I have to go onstage with you?
- Look at me.

190
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,711
- You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.
- I need the bag.

191
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,478
Hey. You're gonna
have fun tonight. All right?

192

You're gonna have fun.

193
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:06,217
[Walt] Any normal person with
a normal sense of self-preservation...

194
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,852
would understand that
all an artist has is his life...

195
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,899
and what he observes
as he passes through his life.

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,232
And any serious writer
hanging out for years with the rich...

197
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,798
well, my God, you'd have to be deluded
to the point of derangement...

198
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,869
- not to realize that that writer was taking notes.!

My God, I even told them.

200
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,414
They all knew
I was writing this book.

201
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,925
What did they think I was there for?
The intellectual stimulation?

202
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,458
The wit?
The spiritual uplift?

203
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,658
I'm the one that brought
the intellect and the wit to the party.

- [Bob] Hey.

211

- So what's up for next year?

212

Oh, uh, I don't know.

You seem a little...

219
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,986
Bob, you remember
when we were little...

220
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,222
and we first found out
we'd never be separated?

221
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,851
- Sure.
- We made a blood pact that day, remember?

222
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,360
Yeah. We promised we'd never
hold each other back, no matter what.

223
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,297
And we never have. Right off the bat,
we made a hell of a team, didn't we?

with you again next year.

I'd never stop you from doing that.
- No, no...

I mean, I wanna be a real actor.

- What?

- Come on.

- Those were your friends.

Look, man, we're from
Martha's Vineyard, okay?

262
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,810
Meryl Streep's not from the Vineyard.
She shot one movie here.

263
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,540
Right. But she stayed on a couple
extra weeks because she liked it, right?

I'm hearing this from you of all people.

269

Hey, isn't that what people
told us our whole lives?

270
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,864
That we couldn't do what normal people did.
Never stopped us before.

to be in L.A., where May Fong lives.

- No, I'm not ready for that.

- [Scoffs]
- Yeah. Or better yet...

maybe you can get
in the movie biz too.

280

What am I gonna do
in the movie business?

281
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,395
I don't know. You could be my...
my stunt double.

- Your stunt double?
- Yeah.

If I gotta do, like,
a dangerous stunt...

284
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,508
you could do it
so that I don't get hurt.

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,871
Huh? Come on.

286
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,207

except for a couple of pictures on the wall.

going here.

- It might be better!

about that? Huh?

we give it a try, we see how it works out.

I'll be happy 'cause I know that we tried.

00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,824
- [Chuckles]
- [Typing Stops]

323
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,827
That psycho-midget's been riding my ass
to finish this screenplay...

324
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:09,229
I've been working on
for the last two years. [Sighs]

325
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,330
- This is it.
- Ooh.

326
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,839
- Clean sheets and towels.
- Yes.

327
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,705
There'll be a pot of green tea
in the office for you every morning.

328
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,643
- Name's Moe if you need anything.
- This is great.

329
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,239
Do you have a room
with a double bed?

330
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,409
Oh. Sorry.
This is all I got.

331
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,713
But I'll tell you
what I can do.

332
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,587
I'll see if I can get you a queen bed
in here in about a week or two.

333
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,759
- See you, guys.
- Thanks, Moe.

334
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,337
Why don't you give her a call,
let her know we're here?

335
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,603
- Wha... [Stammering]
- Huh?

336
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,873
Walter, this is serious.
We have a lot of things to do out here.

337
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,246
Not the least of which
is try to get you into a casting agency...

338
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,853
without them laughing you
out of the room.

339
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,956
Why would they laugh?

340
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,385
Look at you.
You're pale as a ghost.

341
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,552
We gotta get you a tan.

342
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:16,225
Okay, what's a four-letter word
for "voiceless," ends in "D"?

343
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,270
- Uh, "surd."
- "Surd"?

344
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,430
- "Surd" with a "U."
- Ah. Yep.

345
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,736
[Chuckles]
Finis.

346
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:29,336
I gotta tell you, this crossword's a lot easier
than the one I'm used to at home.

347
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,882
[Walt Grunting]

348
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,745
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

349
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,483
- Hey!
- [Walt] Hi.

350
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,559
Are you guys
new around here?

351
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,356
Just got in this morning.
My name's Walt.

352
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,795
- Hey, I'm April.
- Hi. This is my brother Bob.

353
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,902
- Hey. Bob Tenor.
- Hi.

354
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,267
- Uh, have a seat.
- So you guys are brand-new.

355
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,503
- Our first California sunburn.
- We're official.

356
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,737
You guys are gonna
love it here at the Star.

357
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,179
I've been here, like,
two and a half years, and...

358
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,410
Hey, you guys
are stuck together.

359
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,453
And I still love it here.
We're like one big happy family.

360
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,717
So, where'd you get this done?

361
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,793
Uh, no, no.
We were born like this.

362
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,862
Cool, cool. And, uh,
where are you guys from?

363
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,866
Uh, Massachusetts.
Bob here is a lover/ grill man...

364
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,629
and I came out
to give acting a shot.

365
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,366
Oh, my God.
I'm an actor too.

366
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,341
- Oh, yeah?
- You're an actor?

367
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,378
Yeah! Well, no.
I mean, I wanna be one.

368
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:38,381
- Right now I'm just kind of a lingerie model.
- Oh, my God. So am I.

369
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,747
No, he isn't.

370
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,980
[Laughs] No, seriously, like,
do you have an agent?

371
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,725
- No. No, not yet. How about you?
- No, not momentarily.

372
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,387
But I did have one though...
this colostomy bag named Morty O'Reilly.

373
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,862
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Yeah!

374
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,298
Anyway, I've had
better luck on my own.

375
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,870
Every morning,
I read Back Stage West. Thanks.

376
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,907
- Can I see?
- Yeah. And it lists all the open casting calls.

377
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,804
- Oh.
- Yeah, you know, you don't even
need an agent with that thing.

378
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,938
Bob, check this out.
Right here.

379
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,877
"Wanted: Tall, handsome,
distinguished actor...

380
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,880
to play the Robin Hood
for the new millennium."

381
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,745
- That's you!
- That is me.

382
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,289
- That is you!
- Is that me?

383
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,892
- Yeah, it's you!
- It is me!

384
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,355
[Laughing]
You guys are fun.

385
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,763
Listen, ye all,
and hear me now.

386
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,229
The Sheriff of Nottingham
will come forth...

387
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,933
- but he will not bend this merry band of...
- [Hysterical Laughter]

388
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,540
of brothers!

389
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,238
- He will...
- [Laughing Continues]

390
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,848
Who put you up to this?
It was Lovett!

391
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,714
It was Lovett over at CAA, wasn't it?
[Laughs]

392
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,584
Joan, get that S.O.B. on the horn for me,
will you, please? [Continues Laughing]

393
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,714
Did you bring a head shot
and list of your credits?

394
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:59,354
Uh, you know, I was supposed to do that,
and I forgot it at home.

395
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,295
[Walt Chuckles]

396
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,766
Sometimes I think he'd forget
his own brother if I wasn't sewn on.

397
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,802
Okay, thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch.

398
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,433
- [Man Singing]
- [Together] No.

399
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,810
- No.
- [Singing Continues]

400
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,219
[Pounding]

401
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,298
[Pounding Continues]

402
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,334
[Screaming]

403
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,429
l-I'm sorry, but the message
that we're trying to get across...

404
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,600
is that Dubble Bubble
doubles the taste...

405
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,702
not... causes birth defects.

406
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,478
[Walt] I don't know.
Maybe you were right, Bob.

407
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,249
- Maybe this is a pipe dream.
- Yeah.

408
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,690
Probably time to face facts.

409
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,556
I mean, if you haven't made it
in the first 72 hours...

410
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,359
- you should probably just pack it in.
- Right.

411
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:13,165
I bet Meryl Streep wasn't out here six hours
before she got her big break.

412
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,296
De Niro too.

413
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,704
How about Steve Buscemi?

414
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,300
With his pearly whites, he was probably in
town 45 minutes before he got his first role.

415
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,244
- Are you making fun of me?
- You bet I am.

416
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,876
I know you were born without a liver,
but you did get some backbone, didn't ya?

417
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,916
You gotta admit these
last couple of days haven't exactly...

418
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,817
I'm not gonna admit anything.

419
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,951
How do we know the producers
of The Lion King...

420
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,891
aren't lookin' for some
conjoined hyenas as we speak?

421
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,967
You know who's
gonna get the part now?

422
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,829
Those Schappell sisters from Oregon
who are stuck together at the forehead.

423
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,463
Why are they gonna get it?
They're country singers. They're not actors.

424
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,374
- Because you quit, that's why.
- Oh.

425
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,412
Right.
[Sighs]

426
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,539
Maybe I was a little hasty.

427
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,779
Good. Hey, don't worry
about anything.

428
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,483
I happen to have a little plan that's going
into effect first thing tomorrow morning.

429
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,322
Yeah?
[Chuckles]

430
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,658
All right. You're
a great brother, Bob.

431
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,790
Yeah, I know. Now zip the lip.
Let's get some sleep.

432
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,925
[Grunts]

433
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,178
I like your plan.

434
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,371
The car's only plan "A."

435
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,641
Plan "B" is to get you an agent.

436
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,741
Right.

437
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,389
[Walt] Retirement home?
Are you sure we got the right address?

438
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,824
This is what he gave me.
Maybe we should try someone else.

439
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,419
April said this Morty guy's
a total sleaze.

440
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,295
But you said he was the only one
that would give us an appointment.

441
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,272
I wanna let you boys know
right up front that Morty O'Reilly...

442
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,467
only represents actors who are
truly committed to their craft.

443
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:02,273
Th-That's me, Mr. O'Reilly.
I am fully committed.

444
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,713
Committed enough to pay
my $200 up-front service fee?

445
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,648
Which, of course, is used
to defray the costs...

446
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:13,247
of registration fees, entitlement,
uh, paperwork and what have you.

447
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,656
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing him how committed I am.

448
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,925
You're showing him
how stupid you are. Here.

449
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:26,192
We'll give you $100, 'cause
you're only representing one of us.

450
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,570
Look, I'm gonna level with you. Siamese twins
ain't the easiest sell I've ever had.

451
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,166
- We're not Siamese. We're American.
- [Stammers]

452
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,269
I think what
my brother's saying is...

453
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,905
he'd prefer the term
"conjoined twins."

454
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,444
Okay, but I should also
let you know...

455
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,850
I'm not one of those
run-of-the-mill suits.

456
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,753
- I'm a full-service agent.
- Wow.

457
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,553
- Meaning?
- I get 25 percent.

458
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,391
- Well, what does he get in return?
- Seventy-five percent.

459
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,901
Well, I gotta tell you,
I think he seemed like a real player.

460
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,294
- I guess.
- [Chattering]

461
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,170
- I guess.
- [Chattering]

462
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,140
- Oh, my God. It's her.
- Who?

463
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,235
D-D-Don't...
Don't gawk.

464
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,542
Don't do that. She's famous.
She probably hates when people gawk.

465
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,483
[Soft Jazz]

466
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,714
- I like that part, but...
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

467
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,849
I think we gotta at least
go by and say hi.

468
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,856
A minute ago, we couldn't even look at her,
and now we're gonna go say hello?

469
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,365
Hey, Bob, relax.
It would be rude not to.

470
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,799
I'll do all the talking.

471
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,442
Excuse me.
Uh, Miss Streep?

472
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,806
Sorry to, uh,
interrupt your lunch.

473
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,381
I know this is completely inappropriate,
but... [Clears Throat]

474
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,650
my... my brother, Bob,
is, uh, a big fan of yours.

475
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,485
He just... He wanted
to come by and say hi.

476
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,616
Hi.

477
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,524
[Chuckles]
Hi, Bob.

478
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,191
We're from Oak Bluffs
on Martha's Vineyard.

479
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,359
Oh. I've been there.

480
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,494
Yeah, I know.
I know you have.

481
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,870
Actually, w-we... we're friends
with Timmy Sheehan.

482
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,637
- Who?
- Timmy Sheehan.

483
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:18,977
Remember, he waited on you one time
atJimmy C's restaurant?

484
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,414
- Remember, you autographed his menu for him?
- I did. Huh.

485
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,989
Yeah, I know,
because I read it, and it said, uh...

486
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,987
"To Timmy, a good waiter.
From Meryl Streep."

487
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,263
But the way you had signed the "P,"
it looked like an "L."

488
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,299
So, we used to call Timmy
all the time and say...

489
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,731
- "Hello. This is Meryl Streel calling."
- Streel.

490
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,860
But, you know,
we were just busting his nuts.

491
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,996
- True story.
- Yeah.

492
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,936
I think I
remember him. Uh...

493
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,508
I ordered some food,
and he brought it to me.

494
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,707
That would be him.

495
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,875

a restaurant and nobody bugs ya.

to call her Meryl.

She says I should just
keep plugging away...

537
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,293

of most actors she's met.

- Well, you do.
- Thanks.

Anyway, I told her my first love's
the theater back home...

540
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,634

to give it a crack.

But if I ever go back,
she said that I should give her a call.

She's dying for an excuse
to go back to the Vineyard.

star in a show with me.

Nine inches?

Yeah, it's about
nine inches across.

554

what I was gonna ask you is...

Bob and I share a liver.
He's got most of it.

560
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:19,220
So, there's no way that they can just,
like, nip and tuck so you both get some?

There is and there isn't.
The doctors at Mass General...

at no risk to Bob...

I don't know...

a 50-50 chance that
I wouldn't make it, so...

00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,647
You look a lot bigger
than in your photos.

648
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,419
Well, I would hope so,
or else I'd only be three inches tall.

649
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,653
[Laughing]

650
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,928
Hi. I'm Bob's brother, Walt.
I spoke to you on the phone.

651
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,330
- Walt, meet May.
- Oh.

652
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,271
N-Nice to meet you, Walt.

653
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,310
You never told me
you had a brother.

654
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,641
I never told you I had a brother.

655
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,783
Are we going somewhere?

656
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,409
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

657
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,421
- l-I made dinner reservations.
- Oh.

658
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,321
Tenor, party of three.

659
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,486
I believe we had
an 8:15 reservation.

660
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,758
- [Man On Speaker] Can I help you?
- We'll have twoJumboJacks...

661
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,528
please, a Sourdough Jack...

662
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,467
three fries
and three medium Pepsis.

663
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,870
- TwoJumboJacks, one Sourdough Jack...
- Got a favorite parking spot?

664
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,203
three fries,
three medium Pepsis.

665
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,607
Want anything else?

666
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,525
So, how... how
was the trip here?

667
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,924
Oh, awesome. Awesome flight.
You should've seen it.

668
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,460
- We played cards, like, the whole way.
- Oh, cards are fun.

669
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,997
[Quietly]
Grand Canyon.

670
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,864
- We flew, actually, right over the Grand Canyon.
- Oh, yeah?

671
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,237
Yeah. It's, like, real different
from the Vineyard.

672
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,310
You know,
with the big hole and shit.

673
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,313
- Um, and it was orange.
- [Laughs]

674
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,287
Hey, do you guys remember
that Woody Allen movie?

675
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,825
I think it was Annie Hall
where the guy goes out with the girl...

676
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,896
and to try and ease the tension, he suggests
they kiss at the beginning of the date...

677
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,392
- instead of the end of the date.
- Yes!

678
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,559
- Do you remember this?
- That's a really good scene.

679
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,638
No, no. The best scene is when
Diane Keaton's brother...

680
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:20,677
says that he's gonna drive headfirst into
the truck and, like, kill everybody in the car.

681
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,840
Yeah.

682
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,942
[Clears Throat]

683
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,358
Um, look, May, I think
there's something I should tell you.

684
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,361
- Yes?
- Go ahead.

685
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,831
Um, see, the reason
that I'm acting kind of, uh...

686
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,732
- [Hyperventilating]
- strange...

687
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,669
I think I'm dying.

688
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,901
- I can't... I can't breathe!
- Are you okay?

689
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,011
- Oh, my God! Oh, oh, oh.
- Should get a...

690
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,373
No, no, no, no. You're having
a panic attack. Breathe into this.

691
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,382
- You don't like me, do you?
- What?

692
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,452
You're disappointed
with me in person.

693
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,680
- No, no, no! You're awesome.
- No.

694
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,813
- You're even better in person. Yes!
- No, I'm not.

695
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,757
Oh, yeah.
You're a hottie. Absolutely.

696
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,328
Just... Just breathe into there.
No, no, no, no.

697
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,432
- Oh, God. I'm... I'm... I'm...
- I'm so embarrassed.

698
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,229
I waited so long to meet you,
and now I'm blowing it.

699
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,328
- No, no, no, you're not blowing anything.
- No, no.

700
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,636
No blowing. No.
You're so much better than I could...

701
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,711
I'm actually really happy
that you're having this...

702
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,473
'cause it means we have even more in common
than I thought we had.

703
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,674
- l... I freak out too.
- He does.

704
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,753
- You really have panic attacks?
- All the time.

705
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,788
I was actually
just about to have one...

706
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,414
and then you beat me
to the punch.

707
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:48,431
[Speaking Spanish On Film]

708
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,631
[Snoring]

709
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:58,333
Um, hey, sorry, uh...

710
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,342
to have Walt here
tagging along on our date.

711
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,505
You know, he can...
he can be a little clingy.

712
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:09,608
You know, it's his first time
out on the, uh, left coast...

713
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,621
and, you know, he's, uh,
heard about the gangs...

714
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,317
and the Crips
and the Bloods and, uh...

715
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,760
I was less nervous about it.
I actually looked into joining the Crips...

716
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,366
but I found that the Bloods
had a better dental plan.

717
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,627
[Both Laughing]

718
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,828
No. No, sir. That's not true.
They wouldn't take me.

719
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,839
Um...

720
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,975
[May]
I had a lot of fun tonight, Bob.

721
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,842
Yeah, me too.

722
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,647
Well, anyway...

723
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,721
I guess this is it.

724
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,848
Yep.

725
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:56,599
- Oh. Will you, uh, walk me to the door?
- Um...

726
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,964
Oh, God. I'm gonna get out
and stretch my legs too.

727
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,931
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah.

728
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,697
Wh-Wh-Whoa, whoa.
Sidewalk's safer.

729
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,368
[Grunting]

730
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,640
Miss, you get over here. I'm gonna
walk you guys right to the front door.

731
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,716
This is beautiful,
by the way.

732
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,479
I got an early
morning callback.

733
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,723
- Good luck tomorrow, Walt.
- Oh, thank you very much.

734
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,318
Thanks.

735
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,795
Well, you guys probably
seen enough of me for one night.

736
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,400
I'll just, uh,
get out of your hair.

737
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,650
- Good night, Bob.
- Good night, May.

738
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,398
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

739
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,172
- Good kisser?
- Yeah. I'm not bad.

740
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,676
- That's good. That's cute.
- That is good, huh?

741
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,805
- No, no, no! It's not funny!
- Who's your daddy?

742
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,544
So what's this Pavlov's Dog
about anyway?

743
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,679
I don't know.
They didn't send me a script.

744
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,725
Probably one of those Disney movies
with the talking animals.

745
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,192
- Cool.
- [Altered Voice] I'm Pavlov.

746
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,287
- Hey, great makeup job, fellas.
- Thanks.

747
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,400
You too.

748
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,494
[Cher] Am I just talking
to hear my brains rattle?

749
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,334
I'm hot!
Do you hear me?

750
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,466
I am hot.
Look what it says here.

751
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,204
Okay. "Who's hot! Who's not!
Cher... red hot!"

752
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,874
Of course you're hot. You're hotter
than hot. You're on fire. No question.

753
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,853
Then answer me this.
Why am I doing this lame-ass TV show...

754
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,187
when I should be doing movies?

755
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,352
Because you signed a contract,
and the network's holding you to it.

756
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,192
Besides, Honey and the Beaze
isn't lame-ass.

757
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,634
You're playing a sassy lawyer who uses DNA
evidence to free wrongly-convicted minorities.

758
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,738
I mean, this is
cutting-edge stuff, Cher.

759
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,272
Oh, cut the crap, Howard.

760
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,174
Come on. This TV show makes Touched
by an Angel look like Trainspotting.

761
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,474
Can I remind you that before I
busted my nut to get you this gig...

762
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,674
you were, like, two weeks away
from being the corner square?

763
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,547
Center square.

764
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,211
You... You told me they
wanted me for center square.

765
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,551
[Stammering]
I did say that.

766
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,387
And... And, y-y-you see,
what happened is...

767
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,793
Alf was able to free up his schedule and,
you know... [Stammering]

768
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,230
The point is, if you didn't get lucky
with one lousy indie film...

769
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,928
you'd be begging
for this job right now.

770
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,432
Let me explain something
to you, okay?

771
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,499
First of all, that lousy little indie film
has grossed over 200 million dollars.

772
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,669
And secondly, I don't beg.

773
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,407
- And you know why I don't beg?
- Yeah?

774
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,882
Because I am
a fucking Oscar winner!

775
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,153
Uh, Cher.

776
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,414
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

777
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,223
Sorry. We're looking for Stage 32,
and a little lost.

778
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,594
Thirty... There's no 30...
Let me have a look at that.

779
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,226
Here's your problem.
You're on the wrong lot.

780
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,771
You want Stage 32 at Half Mast Studios.
That's across the street.

781
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,775
Oh. So that would explain
why the guard was shooting at us.

782
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,871
Sorry to bother you.

783
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,950
What?

784
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,448
You're Cher.

785
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:42,222
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just a big... I'm a big fan.

786
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,887
- He is.
- A big fan of your work. And I'm an actor too.

787
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,226
You guys are an actor?

788
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,631
N... No, no, no.
Not him. Not him. Just me.

789
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,736
- I'm a short-order cook back East.
- Yeah.

790
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,328
He does that.
And I'm out here right now...

791
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,566
just kind of going
through it, you know?

792
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,574
Living it right now.
It's going well too.

793
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,804
I got a couple of things going on.
Couple of irons in the fire.

794
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,677
I'm doing a gig across the street,
actually. I have an agent.

795
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,753
- I was wondering, could l-I
trouble you for an autograph?
- We're busy.

796
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,789
Right. Okay.

797
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,290
No... No, uh,
no heat on that.

798
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,690
All right. Well, just keep on
keepin' on.

799
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,786
Do what you do.

800
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,865
Well, that really puts things
into perspective, doesn't it?

801
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,338
[Annoying Voice] "That really puts th..."
[Gibberish]

802
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,172
Just get me out of
the stinkin' show!

803
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:39,179
So, this is your first job, huh?

804
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:43,377
Yes. Yes, it is. Actually,
I was wondering, is, uh...

805
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,715
there somebody around here
who might have a script?

806
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,915
- I haven't gone over my lines.
- [Chuckles]

807
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,453
They're not gonna be using a script.
They're gonna set up the scenes...

808

and then they're gonna let you all
just kind of wing it.

- Yeah.

have the right to choose my own costar?

We bumped into Cher
on the studio lot...

870

all this very personal stuff...

to keep it out of the press.

Well, how would we know?
That's way too personal.

- You didn't ask her?
- No, no. I asked a lot...

879
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,216
and she said,
"That's way too personal."

your sorrows somewhere else, okay?

00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,865
So what kind of deal
you looking for, Morty?

969
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:37,543
Basically, it's the same deal I got
for Kitty Carlisle in What's My Line?

970
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,443
$1,250?

971
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,177
Per show.
And that's not all.

972
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,753
He gets his own dressing room
with a star on the door...

973
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:48,324
and a fresh pot of coffee every morning...
and none of that cheap stuff either.

974
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:51,621
Folgers Crystals.

975
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,229
That's very doable.

976
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,730
[Clears Throat]
What are we looking for on the back end?

977
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,701
You mean, the brother?
Bob doesn't really act.

978
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:05,274
How about 50 bucks a week
and his own dressing room?

979
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:12,506
Hi. Are you attorney
Honey Garret?

980
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,743
- Who's asking?
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

981
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,514
Name's Mack Beasley.
I understand your law firm...

982
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,886
is looking for
a crime-scene detective.

983
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,252
All right, Mr. Beasley.
You have five minutes.

984
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,330
Well, I appreciate
you taking the time.

985
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,865
This is, uh, quite an office
you work out of.

986
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,566
Oh, yes, I know.

987
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,637
So...

988
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,332
Well, Mr. Beasley,
what are your qualifications?

989
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,841
Well, I'm a Rhodes scholar.
I have a PhD in bioanalysis.

990
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:45,436
I trained with the Navy SEALs
for, let's see, seven years.

991
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,642
And I won the Heisman trophy.
Twice.

992
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,753
Hmm.

993
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,821
Well, here. Fill this out...

994
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,380
and I will see if I can squeeze you into
an entry-level position.

995
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,689
Fantastic. Let me tell you something...
You won't regret this.

996
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,230
And by the way, if you need
any references or anything...

997
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,893
- I can certainly furnish you
with everything that you...
- [Man Moaning]

998
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,368
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,
you're killing me.

- [Bell Ringing]

1000
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,403
- [Man] Come on, guys. Back to work.
- Ten. That's ten times.

1001
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:18,378
Let's go.

1002
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,448
- [Groaning]
- It's okay.

1003
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,518
It's just very, very important
that you stay on your mark.

1004
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,386
Yeah, I'm just... I'm a little nervous.
I have some opening-day jitters.

1005
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,457
It's okay, kid. It's okay.
And I know you're gonna get it.

1006
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,584
- It's just, you have to stay out of frame. Okay?
- Okay. Gotcha.

1007
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,856
- Otherwise, the whole show won't work.
- Right.

1008
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,932
I don't want to tell you
how to handle this, Griffin...

1009
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,427
but back home, at the Oak Bluffs Playhouse,
we used to disguise him...

1010
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,833
- as different props in order to hide him.
- That's a great idea, Walt.

1011
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,304
- We'll just turn Bob into a bush.
- It might not be such a bad idea.

1012
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,639
It's a terrible idea! The network
has made it very clear...

1013
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,339
that the kid stays
out of the picture.

1014
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:56,885
This way, we don't have to explain why Beaze
is followed around by a juniper bush.

1015
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,784
Still gotta explain
the suck-y dialogue.

1016
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,822
Hey, hey, hey...

1017
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:05,860
Uh, I'm sorry, Bob. Do you now have
a problem with the script?

1018
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,795
Uh, no, no. No. The script is awesome, sir.
It's just, the dialogue.

1019
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,957
I mean, look. Come on.
Every guy knows...

1020
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,759
that Archie Griffin's the only guy
who won the Heisman twice.

1021
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,568
- Archie who?
- [Chuckles]

1022
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,438
Hey, B-Bob, just cool it, okay?
He didn't mean it.

1023
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,342
The kid's right.
This script sucks.

1024
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:29,544
Griffin, come here. Look, why don't we
just give Bob a chance to write the script?

1025
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,620
[Scoffs]
Yeah, right.

1026
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,245
- Bob, have you ever written for television?
- No.

1027
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,293
You see how perfect this is? We can get rid
of the old hacks that wrote this crap...

1028
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,362
and we can get
some fresh blood.

1029
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,260
Are you... Are you... Are you
suggesting we bring in the bush...

1030
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,960
- to punch up the script?
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.

1031
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,601
Look, you got to go with me on this.
I got a good feeling about this guy.

1032
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,673
He's gonna do some great things.

1033
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,241
I don't believe this!
I just... l...

1034
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:56,539
All right, everybody. That's... That's...
You know. That's a wrap.

1035
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,275
[Man]
Okay, folks. That's a wrap.

1036
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,443
- Congratulations, Bob. You're the new head writer.
- Thanks.

01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,801
Is your throat sore?
Are you achy?

1041
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,460
I just feel
a little run-down.

1042
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,799
I was up all night
studying lines with Walt...

1043
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,272
so that's probably
what did it.

1044
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,367
- Is that why he got you the big teddy bear?
- Yeah.

1045
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,345
He really went
overboard this time.

1046
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,950
Get some rest...

1047
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,218

Why don't you just tell her?

Oh, you're right.
The time has come.

1055
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,844
You know?

1056
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,478
Hey, by the way, I got to give you some credit
for bringing Moe on as a writer.

1057
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:16,615
I mean, he's really given the Beaze character
some dignity, you know?

1058
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:20,752
I don't want to be one of those actors who
takes a role and ends up looking like an ass.

01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,499
You know what I mean?

1060
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:28,198
I just can't believe this.
It's... It's like a miracle.

- [Man On TV]
- It's not a miracle. Walt's a great actor.

1062
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,864
Yeah, but Bob can't friggin' act.
How are they gonna pull this off?

there's a Mack Beasley here to see you.

I don't know any Mack Beasley.
Get rid of him.

- I'm sorry. I told him not to...
- Are you Honey Garret?

1070
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,763
Just who the hell do you think you are,
barging in here like this?

1071
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,336
I figured I had a right.

According to this cocktail napkin,
I'm half owner of this law firm.

1073

- Where did you get this?
- I won it off some drunk
in a poker game in Gardena.

01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,780
That drunk happens to be
my ex-husband.

1075
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,684
- Well, I can see what drove him to the bottle.
- Well, you son of a...

What I meant is, losing a beautiful squaw
like you would drive any man to firewater.

- Where?

1078

- He was right there for a second.
- You got farts in your head!

1079
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,427
I'm tellin' ya, I saw his nose.
Here he is again.

- It is his honker!
- That's him. That's him.

Oh, my. Bob looks
very good, you know?

1082
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,869
He's lost a little weight,
and he... Nice tan.

With chroma key, the camera
picks up every color except for blue.

01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,341
So, Bob, you see?
To the audience at home, you don't exist.

Hey, Bob. Put your mask down.

to spread his wings a little.

- No, he was doing just fine before.
- Well, now he'll do even finer.

Bam. Bam. Bam.

- Could I talk to you in private?
- Sure, sure.

1097
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:00,417
Don't you realize how morally repugnant
and politically incorrect it is...

to hide Walt's God-given
Siamese... ness?

01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:09,288
Your concern is very touching, Cher,
but let's live in the real world.

I mean, America isn't ready for that.
Besides, Bob doesn't even want to act.

1123
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,486
- Hey, lady. Can you go get the Beaze for us?
- [All] Yeah.!

Hey.

1126
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:48,188
You wouldn't happen to know
if Bob is alone, would you?

1127
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,322
I... highly doubt it.

1128
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,435
Okay.

for Mr. Sick-in-bed.

Oh. [Gasps] I'm sorry.
I was looking for Bob.

Oh, no! May, no!
It's not what you think!

Wait! May?

under that hood.

I'm really sorry, Bob.

She'll be back.

- Someone ratted you out, boys.

Cronkite's gonna have a field day with this.

In the wake of the startling revelation
that actor Walt Tenor...

1155
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,744
of Honey and the Beaze
is actually a conjoined twin...

Come on.
What are you waiting for?

1160
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,768
We stand firmly by our decision
to hire Mr. Tenor.

1161
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:14,467
Sadly, the realities
of our business template are such...

1162
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,942
that with the, uh,
loss of our sponsors, we are forced...

1163
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,237
to halt production
until further notice.

1164
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,215
We will, however,
run the final three episodes as scheduled.

1165
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:30,485
All right. Here's the plan. We're gonna
canvass all 48 states with denials.

1166
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,390
Now, I'm giving you
the same advice I gave Hudson in '56...

1167
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,396
- deny, deny, deny.
- Right.

1168
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,830
Deny what?

1169
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,300
The fact that there's two of you
where one should be.

1170
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,564
I got a better idea.

These are my clients. They'll do as I say.

1172

- Wait. What's your idea?
- Hey, hey, hey. What is this, a "minutiny"?

1173
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:55,974
It's really simple.
Don't deny, deny, deny.

1174
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,548

- Really? Okay.
- My memory's not bad.

his own brother if I wasn't sewed on.
