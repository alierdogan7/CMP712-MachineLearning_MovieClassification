Joe! Joe!

00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,403
You've been in there
for 54... 55 minutes, Joe!

Masturbation is fun.
I get it.

9
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,012
It's not very green to do it
with the shower running.

10
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,262
Jesus!

11
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,809
Bring your briefs
in there with you.

12
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,147
You're 15 years old.

13
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,358
It's not cute anymore.

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,813
Got his mother's fanny.

I mean, look...
look at the board.

School's over.

- (laughs)
- Hey..

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,490
So, are you guys around tonight?

34
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:02,241
Because you should totally come
to Thirsty Thursdays.

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,413
- End-of-school tradition.
- Yeah. Yeah, totally.

36
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,379
- I'll... I'll be there.
- Cool.

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,206
So it's at Wolf's Pond,
whenever you...

38
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh... my God.

39
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,049
BOY:
Eat shit, Toy!

40
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,840
I can lend you a shirt.

41
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,512
I've got like five
in my locker.

42
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:19,508
(school bell ringing)

43
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,557
You know what, actually,
it doesn't look that bad.

(sighs)

45
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,890
So, pregame at Paul's
at like 7:00-ish.

46
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,892
Paul has his own apartment?

47
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,226
(horn honking)

48
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,774
What, you're not
going to acknowledge me?

49
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,938
- Hi.
- Mmm. Yeah.

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,274
Um, I will see you tonight.

51
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,901
Yes. Yeah, uh...

52
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,235
- Babe.
- Yes?

53
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,487
Let's go get egg bagels.

54
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,946
Okay. All right. Bye.

55
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,157
Paul. God.

56
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,580
(school bell rings)

57
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,123
I need a shirt.

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,671
(laughs) That's awesome.

59
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,460
That is... that is great.

60
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,089
Actually, I need a picture.
Shit, can I get my phone?

61
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,589
Hey. Mrs. Keenan?

62
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,007
Shh!

63
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,469
WOMAN: Patrick, why are you
running around?

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,846
Oh... Grandma,
you remember Joe.

65
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,057
Hi, Mrs. Keenan.

66
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,685
Darling, would you
like a cold washcloth?

67
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,060
What? No. No washcloth.

68
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,853
How about you, Joseph?

69
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,194
Actually, yeah, I would...
I'd love a washcloth.

70
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:17,989
No, Mom, sit. What the hell?
What the hell is happening'?

71
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,617
My mom reminds me of Blanka.

72
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,240
That's the sound I hear
whenever she speaks.

73
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,492
Just the gibberish
of an undisciplined animal.

74
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,961
It's never going to end.
Even when I'm

75
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,579
an adult, she'll find me,
question me.

76
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,048
You're being a little
dramatic, I think.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,172
Joe, they're giving me hives.

78
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,383
There's no way
that they can give you hives.

79
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,380
(controller clatters on floor)

80
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,465
Holy shit.

81
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,718
Hey, kiddo.

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,312
ANNOUNCER (from video game):
Round two. Fight!

83
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,984
(tapping continues)

84
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,779
- What, Dad?
- Should be a stud here.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,658
(Joe's dad humming)

86
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,620
Oh, what's all this?

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,166
Carol's going to be here in 30.

88
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,004
- Go wash up.
- Uh, Dad, you know, urn,

89
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,001
I actually just realized
I have a party tonight,

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,798
so I'm not going to be
able to make it

91
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,172
for dinner and stuff.

92
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,505
Sorry.

93
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,007
Too bad.

94
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,383
The plans are already made.

95
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
Your sister's driving
all the way in.

96
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,138
I'm making lamb stew.

97
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,596
Are we in Beowulf?

98
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,598
Look, after dinner,

99
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,560
I was thinking
we might bring back Game Night.

100
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,812
It'll be fun.

101
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,607
Game... Game Night's
a family thing, Dad.

102
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,609
I'm not going to play Game Night
with some spider woman

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,360
you found in the gutter.

104
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,113
Carol is not a spider woman
that I found in the gutter, Joe.

105
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,163
She's a very nice lady
who happens to like me.

106
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:50,911
And I like her.

107
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,877
So, we haven't played Game Night

108
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,544
since Mom died, and then,

109
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:59,465
all of a sudden, you meet
some floozy and expect...

110
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,378
Enough! Enough, Joe.

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,172
This is not a debate.

112
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,965
My house, my rules.

113
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,434
Now, go get ready.

114
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,520
WOMAN: So, Joe,
your dad told me

115
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,766
that you go to Tottenville.

116
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,726
Are you on any teams?

117
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,604
Carol, before we go any further,

118
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,022
you should know...

119
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,649
Frank is not my real father.

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,489
I love him,
and I owe him a lot.

121
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,453
You know,
he's very special to me,

122
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:27,655
but he's not my blood.

123
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,031
Is that true, Frank?

124
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,534
That's completely untrue.

125
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,201
I'm taking Ventnor.

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,954
Frank, the lamb was delicious.

127
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,915
Just so tender and...

128
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,960
it was like I was
chewing avocado meat.

129
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Colin.

130
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,381
Avocado meat.

131
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,800
(smacks lips, exhales)

132
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,012
Heather, do you remember
when Dad quit because, um,

133
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,931
you wouldn't trade him B&O?

134
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,853
- Remember that?
- Oh... oh, do I remember

135
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:58,727
when my own father called me
a "fear-mongering Chinaman?"

136
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,196
Yeah, I do... mostly
'cause I'm not a man.

137
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:02,064
Nor am I Chinese, so...

138
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,607
Oh, my God, what a panic.

139
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,905
That's something
my great-grandfather would say.

140
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:06,153
He's a racist.

141
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,616
DAD:
You do that often?

142
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,490
Eat the hamburger
and then the fries'?

143
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,868
You don't...
you don't mix it up?

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,577
I don't know, Dad.

145
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,204
Just asking.

146
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,706
MOM: We watched
a very good movie

147
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,999
on the cable last night.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,591
- Mmm.
- Oh, honey, what was it called?

149
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:22,925
DAD: it had that guy
in it, that actor...

150
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:23,966
- What was it'?
- What's his name?

151
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,426
Called, uh, Heimlich, the...

152
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,136
Yes, yes! With, uh,
what's-his-name.

153
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,385
The Prince,
the... the New Prince.

154
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:31,427
Will Smith?

155
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,178
Will! Yes. Will Prince.

156
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,770
- Will Prince.
- Oh, my gosh, what does he play?

157
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,357
- Superhero? 
- Oh, he plays a superhero in this one.

158
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,439
Kind of a supe...
Not a cape, though.

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,484
- Yeah, it's called Heimlich.
- The darnedest thing.

160
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,818
Come on.

161
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,286
You want to be my buddy?

162
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,321
Yes. I would love that.

163
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,948
Tennessee for Park Place.

164
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,996
Right now, straight up.

165
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,826
(laughs) Done.

166
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,291
(chuckling):
You got it.

167
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,377
What? No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:02,588
- The men are talking, Joseph. Pipe down. 
- COLIN: Yes. Quiet.

169
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,678
Quiet, everybody,
except for the men.

170
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,922
- We're in command of the room.
- JOE: This is bullshit, Dad.

171
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,425
You're pricing me
out of the goddamn game.

172
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,177
Your roll, JoJo.

173
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,428
This is collusion.

174
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,888
Dad, come on.

175
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,391
Yeah, it's
kind of cruel, Frank.

176
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,016
FRANK:
No, no.

177
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,018
He's just mad because he
doesn't want to be here,

178
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,236
so he's being a little shit.

179
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,826
- Oh, great.
- Oh, no.

180
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,402
Joe, don't go.

181
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,531
He's quitting.
That's nice work, Dad.

182
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:33,906
He'll be all right.

183
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,329
Let him walk it off.

184
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,205
(dialing)

185
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:45,209
Patrick, have you been
washing that foot every day?

186
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,588
Because moisture can get trapped
in there from the brace.

187
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,057
That's what killed
Jim Henson, you know.

188
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,392
Oh...

189
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,260
What the hell
are we talking about?

190
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,512
MOM: Ooh, Patrick,
can you whistle?

191
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,766
(whistling)

192
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,522
I like it when you harmonize
with me on the whistling.

193
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:05,693
- Patty, where you going?
- Got to go potty'?

194

199

Yeah, I'd like
to report a theft.

200
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,951
Goddamn it!

201
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,078
Yeah, his name is Frank Toy.

202
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,956
Brown hair, uh, height unknown.

203
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,005
I'll call you back.

204
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,294
You son of a bitch.

205
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,297

WOMAN:
The problem with Joseph's habit

208
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:41,354
is that one day there will be
an actual emergency

209
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:43,693
or violent crime
coming from this house.

210
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:46,728
Yeah, well,
the night is still young.

211
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,450
Uh, Mr. Toy, are you familiar
with "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

212
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:54,444
Yes. I experienced a childhood
on the planet Earth, so...

213
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,366
yes, I've heard of that one.

214
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,958
Do you think you can
apply it to my situation

215
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,784
in an allegorical fashion?

216
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,828
Okay. It's a...

217
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,250
- a story that involves
a boy who... -Ah, ah, ah...

218
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,374
- constantly cries "wolf."
- WOMAN: Stop.

219
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,423
And when the wolf finally
comes... He doesn't know it.

220
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,420
- I'm sorry, "The Boy
Who Cried" what? -Wolf.

221
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,964
- Fuck you.
- WOMAN: Let's go.

222
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,093
- "The Boy Who Cried" what?
- Stop talking.

223
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,718
- Wolf.
- Get the fuck off my porch

224
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,683
before I knock your dick
in the dirt.

225
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,639
- Come on, let's go. 
- I don't see what the problem was.

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,642
- Why are you yelling at me?
- What's next? Three Little Pigs?

227
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,395
It gets easier.
Okay? Honest. I swear.

228
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,147
Look at it this way:
In two years,

229
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,946
he's going to pay
for you to leave.

230
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:34,735
(chuckles) Yeah.

231
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,654
Uh, look,
this may sound desperate,

232
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,199
but I am 100% lucid, okay?

233
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,495
Don't smile, 'cause I'm...

234
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,118
- Don't.
- No, this is very serious.

235
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,292
- I am serious.
- I'm taking you so seriously.

236
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,456
I can be packed in 15 minutes.

237
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,083
Just take me with you
to Granville.

238
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,627
Please.

239
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,471
(inhales sharply)
Okay, I would.

240
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,422
Totally would, but...

241
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,393
Dad would want to come
visit us all the time,

242
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,886

wouldn't work for me.

- So...

- Yeah. Yeah.

PATRICK:
Almost where?

356
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,395
What the hell
could you be showing me

357
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,693
in the woods right now'?

358
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,402
What is this, Joe?

359
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,326
You want your room
facing sunrise or sunset?

360
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,613
My What?!

361
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,742
This is the site
of our new house, man.

362
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,409
What, like a tree house?

363
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,787
No, like a real house.

364
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,037
I'm moving out.
We're moving out.

365
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,460
What the hell are
you talking about?

366
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,670
My mom won't let me walk

367
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:05,250
around the house
without socks on.

368
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,628
She's definitely
not going to let us

369
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,003
live out here in the woods.

370
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,132
No one will
find us out here, Patrick.

371
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,221
This house,
this land, it's ours!

372
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:13,763
We make the rules, you know?

373
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,635
Like men!

374
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,637
So we're just going
to move out here

375
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,978
and, uh, build a house
from scratch?

376
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,019
How hard can it be?

377
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,564

378
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,311
doing here?

379
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,854
I don't know.

380

I'm afraid to tell him to leave.

381
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,863
I don't know
what he's capable of.

382

Forget him.

383
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,153
Break ground with me, man.

the blue shirt today?

388
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,800
Not the one with the pocket?

389
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,302
- He's got the blue one on.
- PATRICK: Yeah.

390

Whoa, rope in
the attitude, mister.

Yeah, there must be. Uh-oh.

Greco-Roman. What's arena?

Arena is pro.

Not for Patrick to run away, no.

It's a classic kidnapping.

605
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,814
They took our children
and the canned goods and pasta.

WOMAN: All right, look,
I hate to admit it,

607
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,405
but Frank is right.
Right now, we have to assume

608
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,326
that these
are voluntary disappearances.

609
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,865
Wow. What do you know?

610
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,042

Whoa.

612
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,333
Mrs. Keenan,
I assure you,

613
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,584
there is no other agenda

614
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,003
than to find your son right now.

615
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:01,969
No. The Irish
are the blacks of Europe.

616
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,963
The blacks of Europe.

617
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,423
- MR. KEENAN: Oh, my God.
- Period.

618
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,846
- That's powerful stuff.
- That's not...

619
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,262
MR. KEENAN:
Okay, wow.

620
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,099
Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?

621
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,934
We're under a lot
of stress, Captain.

622
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:13,144
I'm sorry about...

623
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:15,436
You know Patrick
was our only boy.

624
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:16,979
- "Is."
- Did you know that?

625
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,604
- Yes, I do.
- Did you?

626
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,854
I'm well aware.

627
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,106
Listen, according
to the report,

628
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,691
$80 to $100 in food

629
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,784
and housewares is missing.

630
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:26,735
From the Toy house,

631
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,362
we are down a tool set,

632
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,240
grill utensils
and about $240 in cash.

633
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,460
Now, I presume
we're not pressing charges.

634
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,665
Frank, would you like

635
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,589

636
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,836
(sighs)

637
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,297

638
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,800
FRANK (voice-over):
He took the Monopoly, too.

639
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,300
Obviously to spite me.

640
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,473
HEATHER:
Maybe he just wanted

641
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:52,142
something to remember you by.

642
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,721
No way.

643
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,941
He hates that damn game.
Did you see him the other night?

644
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:58,184
Well, he used to love it,
you know,

645
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,937
when it was, like,
the four of us.

646
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,027
You're kind of shitting
on his memories, Dad.

647
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,151
Well, what am I
supposed to do, Heather?

648
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,447
You know, if I died, he'd get

649
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:08,486
over it in about six weeks.

650
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,197
Uh, sir, Chinese food is here,

651
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,745
so I would like to actually...

652
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,658
How much?

653
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,285
Uh, it's $51.

654
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,661
$51?

655
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,502
What the hell did you order?
Heather?

656
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:21,125
Don't look at me.
I got dumplings.

657
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,213
I'm not even hungry.

658
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, I actually ordered a...

659
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,424
a large portion of the shrimp
with lobster sauce.

660
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,047
I figured it was pretty neutral.

661
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,512
We can eat it family-style.

662
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,847
- Neutral?
- Mm-hmm.

663
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,059
Shrimp with lobster sauce?

664
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,177
Yeah.

665
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,887
I can't think

666
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,607
of a more marginal dish
in any culture.

667
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,394
- MAN (quietly): Hi.
- Hey.

668
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,270
What's your name?

669
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,897
My American name is Gary.

670
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,821
You ever have one
of those days, Gary?

671
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:48,150
What kind of days?

672
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,818
The kind I'm having right now.

673
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,570
I don't know what kind
of day you're having.

674
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,947
Where you feel like somebody

675
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,537
is pissing in your face
all day long.

676
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:55,659
Is that good or bad?

677
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,494
- Bad.
- Bad.

678
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,996
Gary,

679
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,164
every time...

680
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,585
You see those wontons, Gary?

681
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,172
- You see the size of them?
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,378
Those wontons are too big,
my friend.

683
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,380
Everybody loves those.
People ask us for the recipe.

684
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,090
We won't provide it.

685
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,967
It's part of our training...
how to deal with people

686
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,468
who want the recipe too bad.

687
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,095
- Oh? 
-We have a phrase we have to repeat.

688
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,097
- What is that?
- "We won't provide it."

689
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,682
I can see the value
of these now.

690
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,684
I can have the kids
from the neighborhood come over

691
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,395
and bounce up and down on them
at a fucking party.

692
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,444
- Oh, sarcasm, I get it.
- It's like a bouncy house.

693
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,856
The poor man's wit.

694
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,778
My question for you, Gary, is:

695
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:33,493
How do you want me to eat these
with my normal human mouth?

696
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,410
Do you want me to unhinge my jaw
like an anaconda?

697
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,201
Should I put this in my belly
and lay out in the sun

698
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,296
- for two months, digesting it?
- Dad, enough! My God!

699
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:43,753
- Just pay the poor guy.
- GARY: My God. Yeah, and maybe

700
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:45,419
you should get
some forks in the house

701
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,127
so your dad doesn't have
to unhinge his stupid jaw to...

702
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,753
We're done here, and for
the record, your wontons

703
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,470
are way too big.
Nobody can fucking eat those.

704
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:53,137
No, I can eat them;
just give them to me.

705
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,852
- Good night, Gary.
- I'd be very happy to eat those.

706
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:58,137
Your house has a bad vibe.

707
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,560
JOE (voice-over):
No more rice,

708
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:00,931
no more pasta.

709
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,275
It's time to eat an honest meal.

710
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,809
Biaggio?

711
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,983
You and I will take
to the trees.

712
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,271
Patrick,

713
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,023
you, uh...

714
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,399
Yeah, yeah, I know.

715
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,777
I... I pick berries and apples

716
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,193
and forage.

717
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,787
And it makes a lot
of sense, yeah.

718
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:16,363
(grunting)

719
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,157
Oh, what?

720
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,037
You should be the hunter
just because you're stronger?

721
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,162
Yeah.

722
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,544
Oh, don't...

723
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,922
don't drink the water.

724
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,636
Uh-uh,
I shouldn't have done that.

725
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:34,929
I'm glad you came out, Biaggio.

726
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,383
I mean, this is...

727
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,102
this is our rite
of passage, goddamn it.

728
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,386
Have you ever felt

729
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,972
this at one with...
with yourself?

730
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,724
With your instincts,
with nature?

731
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,726
This...

732
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,186
this masculine?

733
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,647
I don't know.

734
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,567
I don't really see myself
as having a gender.

735
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,196
Is that a problem?

736
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,198
It's not great.

737
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,373
This way to the bison,
my friend.

738
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,830
When you get up here,

739
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,207
you can see a field of bison

740
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,793
majestically grazing.

741
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,512
Ooh, get your weapon ready.

742
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:14,506
- Yeah.
- (horn honking)

743
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,518
Let's go, Biaggio.
Come on.

744
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,722
No, but the...

745
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,808
the quarter dark is so good.

746
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,935
Boston Market, that's...

747
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,230
that's from our old life,

748
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,359
our weak life.

749
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,532
Wait here.

750
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,327
(horn honks)

751
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,166
What will it attract...
scavengers?

752
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,881
Scavengers?
Look at this.

753
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:54,216
Fit for a goddamn king.

754
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:56,431
Are there any bears
in these woods?

755
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:59,174
Hope so.

756
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,974
A bear would feed us
for a month.

757
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,393
Perhaps we can disillusion him.

758
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,862
A bear who doesn't believe
in anything

759
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,021
will be easier to bring down.

760
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,773
(clears throat)

761
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,777
I... I guess I agree with that.

762
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,201
Might be a little small.

763
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,665
One, two, three, four, five.

764
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,418
(thud)

765
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,631
(insect chirping)

766
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,230
(slacking)

767
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,859
You have a tag on your pants.

768
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,905
Did you buy new clothes
for this?

769
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,000
It comes like that...
it's the style.

770
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:07,585
(clattering, animal screeching)

771
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,245
Yes!

772
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,789
Okay, come on.

773
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,792
No, the swords.

774
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,337
We got it.

775
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,339
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

776
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,924
Oh, God, okay.

777
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,347
Flip, flip, flip the thing,

778
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:26,094
and I'll, uh...
I'll take its life.

779
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,642
Strike it at its neck.
Don't compromise the meat.

780
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,640
- I know, I know.
- It may plead; don't listen.

781
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,184
- Be cold, clinical with the blade. 
-I will.

782
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,277
It may try to bargain...
this is natural.

783
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,269
- Just turn it!
- Okay!

784
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,562
(screeching)

785
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,940
(both screaming)

786
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,489
PATRICK:
Yeah, I'm just surprised

787
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,709
you found a live chicken
in these woods.

788
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,920
Yup, yes, sir.

789
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
That's amazing.

790
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,373
JOE:
Biaggio,

791
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,085
your corn pudding is to die for.

792
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,633
I have to know the recipe.

793
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,302
Mmm.

794
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,887
Oh, God.

795
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,639
So smug.

796
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,849
PATRICK:
Dude,

797
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,350
food attracts mice.

798
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,603
And you know what mice attract?

799
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,441
- Stupid fucking questions?
- No.

800
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:17,526
They attract snakes.

801
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,240
In Italian, the word for "snake"

802
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,149
means "the demon's cock."

803
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,365
- No, it doesn't. 
- There's a chance that it doesn't.

804
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,361
Whatever, dude.

805
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,154
From here on out,

806
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,202
- all the food goes either in the
fire or in the ground. - (groans)

807
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,415
God, man, you're
so doom and gloom

808
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,457
all the time.
Just enjoy this.

809
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not doom and gloom, bro.

810
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:37,964
I just found a copperhead
skin two hours ago.

811
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:40,299
I read once that animals
see fear as a color.

812
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,922
I thought you can't read.

813
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,922
No, I can read.

814
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,258
I can't cry.

815
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,263
Well, there you go.

816
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,605
OFFICER: Okay, we traced
Joe and Patrick's cell phones

817
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:55,601
to this bus.

818
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,352
Savanovic, Dietzel,

819
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,771
check under the seats,
see if the bathroom's locked.

820
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,898
This is an artist's projection

821
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,274
of what he might look like now.

822
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,447
The beard may be a little full.

823
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:05,193
FRANK:
They aren't here.

824
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,616
This is a waste
of real time, Davis.

825
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,448
You can check under
the bus if you want.

826
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,038
There's not a lot of air

827
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,035
that can make it
under there, but...

828
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,329
Listen to me. Our son ran away
about eight years ago.

829
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,298
- I'm sorry. Did he come back?
- So, he came back?

830
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:21,627
- Well, it was a really hard time
for us. -Uh, thank you.

831
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,594
Jesus, we don't need this
right now, sir. Are you okay?

832
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,179
- Uh, what does he mean?
- He doesn't mean anything.

833
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,766
- You need to lean on each other.
- Sir.

834
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,884
- Oh, my God.
- Get him back on the bus.

835
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,683
- Davis. 
- No, I don't want to get on the bus.

836
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:32,271
I'm a licensed therapist!

837
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,847
This is Joe's bag.

838
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,317
It's empty.

839
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,937
- That's Patrick's phone.
- That's Joe's.

840
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,939
Some dude had a beeper?

841
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,157
DRIVER:
That's dope.

842
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,359
MRS. KEENAN:
W-Wait a minute.

843
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,655
What... what is that?

844
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:47,905
What does that mean?

845
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,821
It's a Monopoly piece.

846
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,074
MY Piece.

847
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,285
He's taunting me.

848
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,957
He's like the Zodiac Killer.

849
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,376
Okay, the worst thing you can do
is hope right now.

850
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:00,796
I'm just letting you know.

851
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,006
(rhythmic clanking)

852
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,264
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

853
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,809
We have to do this for real.
Ready?

854
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,853
One, two...
a-one, two, three, four!

855
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,733
(rhythmic clanking resumes)

856
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,369
(Biaggio chanting)

857
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,428
(rhythmic clanking continues)

858
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,265
(chanting)

859
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,146
(rhythmic grunting)

860
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,742
(birds chirping and cawing)

861
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,461
JOE (voice-over):
Cheers.

862
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,834
(chuckles)

863
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,462
We have water, shelter.
We can put a balanced meal

864
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,548
on the table.
I mean, we answer to no one.

865
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,092
We're men.

866
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,094
Just now'?

867
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,554
Just happened?

868
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,389
Just happened, man.

869
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,391
You don't say.

870
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,769
JOE: All I'm saying
is that if anything

871
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,898
was missing from all of this...

872
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,733
...it'd be a woman's touch.

873
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,902
We have Biaggio. (laughs)

874
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,577
JOE:
Doesn't count.

875
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,253
- Right here. Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, what, what?

876
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:01,536
Hey-

877
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,505
- KELLY: Hello.
- Got to get my drink on.

878
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:05,582
Hi. Do you guys want anything?

879
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,130
Uh, I got a Titleist right here.

880
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,920
It's worth like $3.50,
so if I could get

881
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,514
a Sun Chips and a beer
and then 50 cents

882
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:12,970
in change,
that would be fantastic.

883
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:15,809
Okay, well, we do not
run on a barter system.

884
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,557
What the fuck
is a "barger" system?

885
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,181
- KELLY: Barter.
- Barger?

886
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,148
When you use equal goods
or services instead of cash.

887
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:24,687
So you admit that these
are equal goods

888
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,936
- in your barger system.
- Yeah, but we

889
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,189
do not run on a barter system.

890
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,440
That's not the point.

891
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,868
(birds chirping)

892
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,461
KELLY: You're on the news, Joe.
Your dad was on K-19.

893
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,086
(sighs) Okay, please.

894
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,172
My dad is loving
every second of this, okay?

895
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,466
No, Joe, I seriously doubt that.

896
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,889
So, uh...

897
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,227
...does Patrick have a really
big, crazy beard now, too'?

898
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,521
Yeah, yeah, his is a little
more serious than mine.

899
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,560
I have... I have thin hair.

900
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,983
You know, you have to groom it.

901
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:09,271
Oh, right.

902
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,940
Yeah, like Paul's
sick-ass goatee?

903
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,984
Uh...

904
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,778
I guess you wouldn't
have heard...

905
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,197
Paul and I broke up.

906
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,866
Oh.

907
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,585
This isn't over, Kelly.

908
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,912
This isn't over, Kelly!

909
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,165
(beeping)

910
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,596
(laughs) Uh... uh, no,
I did not catch wind of that.

911
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,507
Um...

912
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,976
I'm sorry, though.

913
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:45,765
I, uh, came here actually
to invite you to dinner.

914
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,810
Uh, sort of like a...
a housewarming thing.

915
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,437
- If you want.
- Yeah, obviously I want to,

916
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,189
but how do I...
how do I get there?

917
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,440
Do I have to...

918
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,068
be blindfolded or something?

919
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:56,943
In all seriousness, it's of

920
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,073
absolute vital importance
that you not tell anyone,

921
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:02,118
- not bring anyone. No one.
- Yes.

922
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,335
- This is life or death, Kelly.
- Okay, okay, okay.

923
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,125
Okay.

924
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,293
(whooping)

925
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,466
(groans)

926
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,890
Bitch.

927
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,893
Joe.

928
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,732
(rustling in bushes)

929
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,332
(rustling continues,
footsteps scurrying)

930
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,252
Dude.

931
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,962
Biaggio.

932
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,057
You're camouflaged horribly.

933
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,677
Dude!

934
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:04,970
Where's Joe?

935
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,304
What's up, man?

936
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,472
What's up?

937
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,890
Have you seen Joe?

938
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,142
No, I don't know where he is.

939
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,560
But where's Biaggio?

940
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,396
You're right here.

941
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,321
You're right... Oh, God.

Okay, fine, fine.

949
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,016
We bought a few chickens.

950
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:29,639
Less than 30, more than 25.

951
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,059
But the fact is Biaggio and I

952
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,853
have been hunting and getting

953
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:34,601
pretty goddamn dangerous
out there.

954
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,227
This is hypocrisy.

955
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,777
Joe, listen to yourself.
How can you sleep at night?

956
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,566
Look, I can deal with the fact

957
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,739
that the chickens
were store-bought.

958
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,985
Okay? I can.

959
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,653
But it really bothers me

960
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
that the loaded potato
isn't Biaggio's recipe.

961
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,828
No. No, no, that
actually really is.

962
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:53,546
I... I honestly have no idea
where he's getting chives.

963
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:59,298
So, um, can I pass or...?

964
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,259
MR. KEENAN (voice-over):
Judy keeps saying

965
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,599
that wherever they are,
at least they have each other.

966
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,300
(sighs)

967
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,895
I guess that calms me down
sometimes, you know?

968
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,899
FRANK (voice-over): I got to
wonder whose idea it all was.

969
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,143
MR. KEENAN (laughing):
Yeah.

970
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,561
Wait, are you serious?

971
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,905
It could have been
Patrick's idea.

972
00:48:19,906 --> 00:48:21,236
No way. Oh, my gosh.

973
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:22,903
Joe is the one who drove them

974
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:24,401
to the movies
when they were nine.

975
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,904
Remember?
Only reason they got caught

976
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,951
is 'cause they went
through a drive-through.

977
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:30,782
Sunfish. Damn it.

978
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:34,538
Joe is the one who tied
Patrick's pet turtle to a kite.

979
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,413
Wanted to send him up
into space.

980
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,747
(Frank laughing)

981
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,962
I forgot about that.

982
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,050
Are you laughing?

983
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,751
Are you laughing at that?

984
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,846
FRANK: It was... it was more
of a laugh of admiration.

985
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,922
For the murder of a turtle'?

986
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,258
The turtle died, then?

987
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,260
Yeah, the turtle died, Frank.

988
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,595
I suppose that's a shame.

989
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,473
The problem is
Joe's a mama's boy.

990
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,942
Clarissa was good for him.

991
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:58,436
She just let him be.

992
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,813
Something about his innate
sense of menace

993
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,407
seemed to charm her.

994
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,735
Now it's just the two of us.

995
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,488
I... I'm afraid I broke him.

996
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,116
MR. KEENAN:
I mean, our sons did run away.

997
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,870
They don't... they don't want
to be with us.

998
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,747
They don't want
to live in our houses.

999
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:24,335
I guess maybe... we did do
something wrong, you know?

1000
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,680
What the heck?

1001
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,050
Ah. (snaps fingers)

1002
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,975
Patrick is the one
who set up Bicycle Olympics

1003
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:36,055
in my goddamn swimming pool.

1004
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,018
That was a nice
$1,300 repair job.

1005
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,104
I never called you about that.

1006
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,774
Thought we were having
a moment just then, Frank.

1007
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,369
And Bicycle Olympics
was Joe's idea.

1008
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,952
Goddamn it.

1009
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,418
(sighs)

1010
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,622
(crickets chirping)

1011
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,088
Joe, I love it here.

1012
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,634
I want to spend the rest
of my days with you.

1013
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,220
That's an emotional fact for me.

1014
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,770
Yes, but...

1015
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,477
But I worry.

1016
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:25,313
I can't keep my brain
from worrying.

1017
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,815
My..

1018
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,776
my woman brain.

1019
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,779
Ah, my sweet Kelly,

1020
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,624
why should we let it
ruin this moment'?

1021
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,829
FRANK (voice booming):
Joe!

1022
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,456
It's time to come home.

1023
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,834
(grunts)

1024
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,799
Leave us, Frank.

1025
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,759
The forest is ours.

1026
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,719
You're out of your depth.

1027
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,269
You made a fool of me
in front of the whole town, boy.

1028
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,474
A harlequin.

1029
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,570
He is a man grown, and his path
is his own to choose.

1030
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,064
Silence, land-trunt.

1031
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,489
(grunts fiercely)

1032
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,199
(video game sound effects)

1033
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,993
(yells)

1034
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,746
VIDEO GAME ANNOUNCER:
You win.

1035
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:23,371
- Perfect.
- (groans)

1036
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,582
Joe. Hey, bro,
we got company.

1037
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,959
Lots of company.

1038
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,758
Hi, brother.

1039
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,343
BIAGGIO:
All right.

1040
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,471
KELLY:
This is so great, Joe.

1041
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,350
(laughter)

1042
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,602
BOY: Yo, bros,
what did you guys do

1043
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,936
with this chicken?

1044
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,526
Melts in your
goddamn mouth, right?

1045
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:51,694
So, um, do you guys eat
the same thing every night?

1046
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,156
Yeah, a lot of chicken.

1047
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:54,152
They're everywhere here.

1048
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,496
- Right, Joe?
- Oh.

1049
00:51:55,497 --> 00:51:56,904
All sorts of them.

1050
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,364
Yeah, Patrick, um,

1051
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,866
he usually takes care
of the gathering,

1052
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,244
you know, berries, roots.

1053
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,244
I take care of the meat
and the protein.

1054
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,838
(grunts) And the shopping.

1055
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:07,415
He's a great bargain hunter.

1056
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,709
I do the hunting.

1057
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,681
So, Biaggio, what do you do?

1058
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,302
I met a dog the other day

1059
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,597
that taught me how to die.

1060
00:52:17,598 --> 00:52:19,510
(Joe clears throat)

1061
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,726
Yeah, uh, Biaggio here,
he's a...

1062
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,017
he's a real renaissance man.

1063
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,604
BIAGGIO:
I have incredible focus.

1064
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,728
You should see his hands.
So quick.

1065
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,853
This cat right here,
he can snatch trout

1066
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,026
right out
of the goddamn stream.

1067
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,022
Just... (smacks lips)

1068
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,231
Bullshit.

1069
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,905
No, it's true. I've seen it.

1070

01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,776
Guess I'm a man now, huh?

1607
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:40,528
(laughs)

1608
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,947
You're getting there, bud.

1609
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,032
No need to rush.

1610
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,626
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Stroke alert.

1611
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:48,494
Fifth floor, building B.

1612
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,870
Room 514.

1613
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,331
Stroke alert.

1614
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:55,334
So, uh...

1615
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:58,587
how are things
between you and Carol?

1616
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,423
Carol?

1617
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:02,345
You're referring
to the spider woman

1618
01:27:02,346 --> 01:27:03,637
I found in the gutter?

1619
01:27:03,638 --> 01:27:05,224
That you found
in the gutter, yes.

1620
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:07,184
- That's the one.
- The same. One and the same.

1621
01:27:07,185 --> 01:27:08,726
Things, uh...
things are actually

1622
01:27:08,727 --> 01:27:10,977
cooled down between
Carol and me.

1623
01:27:10,978 --> 01:27:12,184
It's baffling.

1624
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,894
Just... I can't quite

1625
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,569
pinpoint the exact moment
when everything went south.

1626
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:18,941
(both laughing)

1627
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,861
- Yeah.
- It's a puzzle.

1628
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,535
Sorry about that one.

1629
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,824
It's okay.

1630
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,701
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

1631
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,286
She didn't...

1632
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,747
(sighs)

1633
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,000
(voice-over):
I don't know, she...

1634
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:36,333
she didn't make me nervous.

1635
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,503
Not like your mom did, anyway.

1636
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,881
And you need that.

1637
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,509
(elevator bell dings)

1638
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,268
FRANK:
Mm-hmm.

1639
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,433
(Mrs. Keenan sighs)

1640
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,983
MR. KEENAN (quietly):
I know. I know.

1641
01:27:54,984 --> 01:27:57,322
(metallic clanking and creaking)

1642
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,743
(loud, labored breathing)

1643
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,966
(brakes squeak)

1644
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,750
What's going on over there?

1645
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:57,289
(chuckles, sighs)

1646
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,918
Patrick's just being an idiot.
