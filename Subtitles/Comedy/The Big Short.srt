272
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,863
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds

273
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,230
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

274
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,268
They made billions and
billions on their 2% fee

275
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,570
they got for selling each of these bonds.

276
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,440
But then they started
running out of mortgages

277
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,074
to put in them.

278
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,810
After all, there are only so many homes

279
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,646
and so many people with good enough jobs

280
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,680
to buy them, right?

281
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,849
So the banks started filling these bonds

282
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,084
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,587
Thank you, Benter.

That way they can keep that
profit machine churning, right?

285
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:26,430
By the way, these risky
mortgages are called subprime.

286
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,897
So whenever you hear "subprime", think

287
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,434

288
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,070

out that these mortgage bonds

00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,709

All right? The originals were simple.

637
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:11,673
They were just thousands of
AAA mortgages bundled together,

638
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,507
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

639
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,410
The modern ones are different.

640
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:18,348
They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

641
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:26,087
The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

642
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,789
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,

643
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,357
taking on defaults first.

644
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,094
Now, obviously, if you're buying
B's, you could make more money.

645
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,362
But they're a little risky.

646
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,533
Sometimes they fail.

647
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,102
Chris?

648
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,273
Somewhere along the
line, these B's and BB's

649
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,807
went from a little risky

650
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,309

up from 1% to 4%, fellas.

And if they rise to 8%, and they will,

a lot of these BBB's
are going to zero, too.

That's right.

665
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,043

Yeah. That's right.

Actually, my name's Jiang
and I do speak English.

681
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:58,279
Jared likes to say I
don't because he thinks

682
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,181
it makes me seem more authentic.

683
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:03,317

which is the mortgage bond
that Michael Burry shorted.

But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

So, what am I going to do?

00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:33,068
Throw all this unsold fish, which
is the BBB level of the bond,

745
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,506
in the garbage and take the loss?

No way.

whatever crappy levels
of the bond I don't sell,

It's a whole new thing!

1032
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:42,831
quintupled since 2000

1033
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,766
and the average take-home pay is flat,

1034
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,300
but home prices are soaring.

1035
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:49,470
That means the homes are debt, not assets.

1036
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:52,673
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who

1037
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:56,177
gets his hair cut at Supercuts
and doesn't wear shoes,

1038
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:59,213
knows more than Alan
Greenspan and Hank Paulson.

1039
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:00,916
Well...

1040
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,519
Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does. (CHUCKLES)

1041
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:06,621
That's cute. That's cute.

1042
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,958
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?

1043
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,092
(SIGHS)

1044
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:13,594
Lawrence,

1045
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,764
I don't know how to be sarcastic.

1046
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,535
I don't know how to be
funny. I don't know how to

1047
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,769
work people.

1048
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,003
I...

1049
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,438
I just know how to read numbers.

1050
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,944
How big is your short position right now?

1051
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,443
Um...

1052
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,014
Just $1.3 billion.

1053
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:33,113
And the premiums?

1054
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:34,883
Well, we pay, uh,

1055
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,351
- roughly $80 to 90 million
- (MARTIN LAUGHING)

1056
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:39,920
each year, which is high,

1057
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:42,057
but I was the first to do this trade.

1058
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,626
Watch. It will pay. I may have
been early, but I'm not wrong.

1059
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,795
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing, Mike!

1060
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:53,467
You're managing a fund
of, what, $555 million?

1061
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:56,973
In six years, it'll all be gone.

1062
00:47:57,773 --> 00:47:59,307
On one bet.

1063
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,543
No, the second quarter of '07 is
when the adjustable rates kick in.

1064
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,144
The defaults will skyrocket.

1065
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:05,914
Yeah. Says you.

1066
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,481
LAWRENCE: How much is eligible
for withdrawal before they do?

1067
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:10,386
Say, in the next two quarters.

1068
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,123
If your investors panic.

1069
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,758
$302 million?

1070
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,762
I...

1071
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,264
My God, Mike.

1072
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:23,733
(MIKE CHUCKLES)

1073
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,135
No one will pull out.
That would be suicide.

1074
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,670
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

1075
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:33,039
But if they trust me, and
they trust me, because...

1076
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,742
No one trusts you! No one!

1077
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,278
I sent several emails to my investors

1078
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,349
letting them know that the...

1079
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:41,949
(EXHALES)

1080
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,519
...the second quarter of '07 is when our

1081
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,957
housing positions show returns and...

1082
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:50,391
I've been very clear.

1083
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,795
People will withdraw their money.

1084
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,365
Lawrence, that would be
so stupid. I mean, the...

1085
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:01,302
(STUTTERS) If the fund's
capitals drop too much,

1086
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:04,472
then the swaps contracts are voided.

1087
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,842
And then the banks get to
keep all of the collateral.

1088
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,010
MARTIN: Wait a minute. Wait.

1089
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,144
All of it.

1090
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,380
The contracts are voided?

1091
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,150
The contracts are voided?

1092
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:16,983
Holy shit!

1093
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:18,020
Oh, motherfucker!

1094
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,554
- Michael?
- (TAPPING)

1095
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,224
Give me my money back.

1096
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:29,032
Michael, do you hear
me? I want my money back.

1097
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,836
Give me my fucking money back...

1098
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:37,237
(LAUGHS) ...you motherfucker.

1099
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:40,474
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

1100
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,809
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy.

1101
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,681
"Let's just all calm down."

1102
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:50,416
I sold that house for
$350,000 the year it was built.

1103
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:52,686
Two years later, $480,000.

1104
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,990
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1105
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,025
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

1106
00:49:59,027 --> 00:50:00,961
He'd let it go for that.

1107
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,729
Hi, John.

1108
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:04,365
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.

1109
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,865
It will break his heart,
but he'll let it go.

1110
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,702
Why is he selling?

1111
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,537
MARLENE: Neither one's working right now.

1112
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,273
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

1113
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:16,342
As motivated as one can
be in this neighborhood.

1114
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:18,979
This house on the left, I would
say they're probably motivated.

1115
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,014
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.

1116
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,383
MARLENE: Oh, it's just the gully.

1117
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:24,217
That's all. Just...

1118
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,719
Just nerves.

1119
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,456
So where do we stand?

1120
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,191
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

1121
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:32,592
MAN: This market won't last.

1122
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,461

talk to a mortgage broker?

1123

have someone. Absolutely.

So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

1129
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,610
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund,

1130
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,744
but we're not really part of it.

1131
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,313
We invest in financial service companies

1132
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,349
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1133
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,385
How many loans do you write each month?

1134
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,021
- (BLOWS AIR) About 60.
- Yeah.

(LAUGHING) You own a...

1140
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:11,932
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1141
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,700
- MAN IN BLACK: Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1142
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,735
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1143
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:18,940
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

1144

Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1145
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,976

Sorry. We're not alone.

1209
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:12,079
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

1210
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,447
you are not going to be able to refinance.

1211

whatever your monthly payment is

1212

once it jumps up after
your teaser rate expires.

1213

01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,398
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.

1371
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,898
What the hell is going on?

1372
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,934
We don't know, but Deutsche's
on the phone demanding payment.

1373
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:56,836
<i>Call Vennett. Call that little shit.</i>

1374
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:58,905
Call Vennett. Tell him
to get his ass down here.

1375
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,773
So subprime loans go bad,

1376
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:02,441
but subprime bonds, which are made up

1377
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:04,077
of subprime loans, are more valuable?

1378
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,646
I know. They want another
$1.9 million by market close.

1379
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:08,882
What about the ratings
agencies? Moody's, S&P...

1380
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:11,383
Are they downgrading the
CDOs and mortgage bonds?

1381
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:12,552
Where are the ratings agencies at?

1382
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:14,153
They're the fucking same.

1383
01:03:14,155 --> 01:03:15,688
No, they're all still AAA.

1384
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,291
What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me?

1385
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:20,459
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!

1386
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,994
They go public, and all they care about

1387
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,496
is their bottom line and their shit.

1388
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,331
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

1389
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,733
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

1390
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:28,168
They called in Kathy Tao.

1391
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,403
They're trying to convince
her to make us sell our swaps.

1392
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:32,706
Apparently, tying up six
years of insurance payments

1393
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,541

1394
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:35,941
<i>is not prudent investing.</i>

1395
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:37,311
What did Kathy say?

1396
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,045
Nothing yet. She keeps asking
if this is one of your crusades.

1397
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:42,081
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

1398
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,351
and very calmly, very politely,

1399
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,619
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

1400
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:48,354
And then meet me over at Standard & Poor's.

1401
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:49,956
We're gonna talk to Georgia.

1402
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,090
VINNIE: <i>All right. Okay.</i>

1403
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:53,059
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.

1404
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:54,864

1406
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,534
Uh, gentlemen?

1407
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:04,606
I spoke with Mark Baum.
He says to fuck off.

1408
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,722
I can't see a damn thing.

1409
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,691
(SIGHS) My eye doctor's always busy.

1410
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:26,559
I end up taking any
appointment they'll give me,

1411
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:28,897
and then the whole
morning gets shot to hell!

1412
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,567
So...

1413
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,967
All righty,

1414
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:37,003
FrontPoint Partners,

1415
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:39,438
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1416
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,773
VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why

1417
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,510
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1418
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,646
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1419
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:49,148
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

1420
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,016
but they're actually within our models.

1421
01:04:51,018 --> 01:04:52,954
- So...
- VINNIE: Says you.

1422
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,623
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

1423
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,193
in these bonds are solid loans.

1424
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,161
GEORGIA: That is our opinion, yes.

1425
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,329
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1426
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:05,130
I mean, they're giving these loans

1427
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:06,465
to anybody with a credit score and a pulse.

1428
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:09,168
Excuse me, sir. What do you
think we do here all day?

1429
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,269
VINNIE: We're not sure.
That's why we're here.

1430
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:11,470
Here's what I don't understand...

1431
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,305
We check, recheck, recheck again.

1432
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:14,708
MARK: If these mortgage
bonds are so stable...

1433
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,476
Perhaps you could check your friend.

1434
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:18,579
MARK: ...have you ever refused to rate...

1435
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,012
VINNIE: Ma'am, that's delusional.

1436
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:21,215
GEORGIA: We stand behind them.

1437
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,882
MARK: Georgia, have
you ever refused to rate

1438
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:26,253
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

1439
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,920
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?

1440
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:30,023
I am under no obligation
to share that information

1441
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:31,191
with you, whoever you might be.

1442
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,992
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1443
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,061
Can you name one time in the past year

1444
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,463
where you checked the tape

1445
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:40,670
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

1446
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,170
If we don't give them the ratings,

1447
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,005
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

1448
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:51,010
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

1449
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:54,182
Not our fault. Simply
the way the world works.

1450
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,820
VINNIE: Holy shit.

1451
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,023
Yes, now you see.

1452
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,224
And I never said that.

1453
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,693
They're selling ratings for fees.

1454
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:07,760
A ratings shop.

1455
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:10,664
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1456
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,632
Nobody said that.

1457
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,900
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.

1458
01:06:14,902 --> 01:06:16,369
Are you kidding me?

1459
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:17,769
No, I am not "kidding you".

1460
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:20,139
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1461
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,441
MARK: Is that the angle you're taking?

1462
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:25,077
So, now, anyone who has a
boss can't be held responsible

1463
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:26,579
for doing shitty and illegal things.

1464
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:28,215
What are you, four?

1465
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:32,619
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.

1466
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,123
And I wonder what your incentives might be.

1467
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,757
Is it maybe in your best interest

1468
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,730
to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps?

1469
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,067
How many credit default
swaps do you own? Hmm?

1470
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:49,101
It doesn't make me wrong.

1471
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,302
No.

1472
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,407
It just makes you a hypocrite.

how to value these CDOs,

...core mortgage shorts on the swaps.

1710
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,226
No problem, Dr. Burry.

1711
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:21,430
- Dr. Burry?
- Hmm?

(CLEARS THROAT)

1713
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,165
If the investors withdraw,

1714
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:29,034
what's going to happen here? Are we done?

1715
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:30,939
Honestly, I don't know.

(STAMMERS)

1717
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,882
The bonds aren't going down.

1718
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:45,217
They won't move. It's possible

1719
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:49,791
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

Or... (STAMMERS) You're wrong.

1721
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:00,499
Sure.

1722
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,506
It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

1723
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:13,745
I guess when someone's wrong, they never...

1724
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,983
They never know how.

1726
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,490
Yeah.

1727
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,892
Even Bear upped their prices.

1728
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:29,461
And they keep calling us Brownhole.

1729
01:19:29,463 --> 01:19:31,162
You just don't have the
money or the reputation.

1730
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,632
Don't take it personally.

1731
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,200
I don't think I have the
strip club in me tonight.

1732
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,769
I'm just gonna get some ginger
ale and watch some pay-per-view.

1733
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:40,141
I'll book us some flights
out for the morning.

1734
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:44,276
CHARLIE: (STAMMERS) A deal.
We need a deal, right? A deal.

1735
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:46,178
We need a deal we can afford.

1736
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,580
We need a deal that
they're not gonna refuse.

1737
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:51,920
So... What can we do? We can...

1738
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:56,187
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

1739
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:58,257
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1740
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:01,259
We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated,

1741
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:03,329
but in reality they're more like 25%.

1742
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,831
Some of them are 0%!

1743
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,567
We also know that if the
bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1744
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:09,802
the upper tranches are affected.

1745
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:11,269
They go to zero.

1746
01:20:11,271 --> 01:20:14,673
I'll bet you right now that
those AA's are actually like B's.

1747
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:17,779
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

1748
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:19,780
Look, Ben.

1749
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:22,850
The payoff

1750
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,851
is 200 to 1.

1751
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,018
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

1752
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,425
So they're charging pennies on
the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1753
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,960
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1754
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:37,530
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1755
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,532
The banks will think we're
either high or having a stroke.

1756
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:42,871
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1757
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:46,807
Kinda brilliant.

1758
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,742
This is what we did that
no one else thought of.

1759
01:20:50,744 --> 01:20:53,778
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1760
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,214
But we did.

Little Brownhole Capital.

1762
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:02,088
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1763
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,990
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1764
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,392
Oh, got no angle. We're new
to this. We're just excited.

1765
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:10,562
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1766
01:21:10,564 --> 01:21:11,731
I don't understand.

1767
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,369
You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.

1768
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,771
$40 million against the AA.

1769
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,272
Brother, I will sell
you as much as you want.

1770
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:23,510
You understand perfectly,
Bob. You want the deal?

1779
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,037
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1780
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:53,772
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1781
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:55,040
We should celebrate.

1782
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,041
You just bet against the American economy.

1783
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:58,611
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1784
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,646
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1785
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:04,383
Which means if we're right...

1786
01:22:04,385 --> 01:22:07,820
If we're right, people lose
homes. People lose jobs.

1787
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:11,123
People lose retirement
savings. People lose pensions.

1788
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,391
You know what I hate about fucking banking?

1789
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:14,026
It reduces people to
numbers. Here's a number.

1790
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:16,928
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1791
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,531
- No.
- Did you know that?

1792
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,101
No, I didn't know that.

1793
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,238
We were just excited.

1794
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,307
Just don't fucking dance.

1795
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:30,145
- CHARLIE: All right.
- JAMIE: Where are you going?

1796
01:22:34,515 --> 01:22:36,685
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1797

First of all, great show today.

1798
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:41,786
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

I appreciate that.

You worried you and your
swaps are getting played?

1802

Well, this is an opportunity for you

1803
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:50,396
to meet who you're betting against.

1804
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,263
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1805
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,766
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

JAMIE: <i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

1807
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,803
I'm a CDO manager.

1808
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,936
A "CDO manager"?

1809
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,938
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1810
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,043
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1811
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,777
MR. CHAU: Oh.

1812
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:08,379
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1813
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:09,848
and monitor the assets.

1814
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,750
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1815
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,786
Do you represent the
investors or Merrill Lynch?

1816
01:23:14,788 --> 01:23:15,888
The investors.

1817
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,022
You do.

1818
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,557
- Yeah.
- But...

1819
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:20,526
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

1820
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:25,196
unless you put Merrill
Lynch's bonds in your CDO.

1821
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,534
Good question. Let's just
say Merrill and I have, um...

1822
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,768
We have a good relationship.

1823
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,037
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1824
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:34,807
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1825
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,376
And so the CDOs that you create

1826
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:41,379
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1827
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,382
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1828
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:46,921
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1829
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,060
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1830
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:55,896
Okay.

1831
01:23:57,497 --> 01:24:01,233
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1832
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,867
They give you the bonds they want to sell.

1833
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,268
They give you clients,

1834
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,738
they give you money to run your business.

1835
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,540
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1836
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:10,809
But you represent the investors?

1837
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,077
(CHUCKLES)

1838
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:13,245
Is that right?

1839
01:24:13,247 --> 01:24:14,379
Yeah.

1840
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:15,915
But we're not in the
Merrill Lynch building.

1841
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,583
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1842

You're 20 minutes away.

01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:21,688
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1844
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:24,824
That's funny, huh?

1845
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,090
That's hilarious.

Your boss is about to explode.

1849
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:34,599
No, he's too curious to explode.

1850

Hold on. Say that again.

1851
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,370
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1852
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:40,373
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1853
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,708
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".

1854
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,543
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1855
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:46,614
A CDO of a CDO.

1856
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:48,214
All right?

1857
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,249
And then there's CDOs made
up of the opposite side

1858
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,050
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1859

We call them synthetic CDOs.

1891
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:18,970
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.

1892
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:21,940
Let's say I bet $10
million on a blackjack hand.

1893
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,809
$10 million because this
hand is meant to represent

1894
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:27,047
a single mortgage bond.

1895
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:33,552
Okay, Selena has a pretty
good hand here, showing 18.

1896
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:34,652
Dealer showing seven.

1897
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,787
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1898
01:26:36,789 --> 01:26:38,255
Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning

1899
01:26:38,257 --> 01:26:40,726
<i>this hand are 87%.</i>

1900
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:44,196
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1901
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:46,932
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1902
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,400
How could I lose, right?

1903
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,001
Now, this is a classic error.

1904
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:53,037
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1905
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,674
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.

1906
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:58,043
People are sure they're
gonna make the next one.

whatever's happening now</i>

1908
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,915
<i>is gonna continue to
happen into the future.</i>

1909
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,352
<i>During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up</i>

1910
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,086
and people thought they
would never go down.

1911
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:10,722
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1912
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,258
will make a side bet.

1913
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,593
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1914
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:16,260
I love Selena Gomez.

1915
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:17,862
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1916
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:20,031
And I'll give
you 3-to-1 odds.

1917
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:23,936
3-to-1 odds? Okay,
I'll take that bet.

1918
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,371
RICHARD: Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

1919
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:28,639
on the outcome of their bet.

1920
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:29,875
Bet you 50 million she wins.

1921
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,910
That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.

1922
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:36,248
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1923
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,916
wins that bet.

1924
01:27:37,918 --> 01:27:41,152
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1925
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:42,388
How about
20-to-1?

1926
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,923
Deal.

1927
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:48,226
And this will go on and on with
more and more synthetic CDOs.

1928
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:52,429

original $10 million investment

1929

their server crashed.
