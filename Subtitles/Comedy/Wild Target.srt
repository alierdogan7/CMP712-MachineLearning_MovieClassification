I give, I gave, I have given.

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,780
I fly, I flew, I've flown.

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,180
Have been taken care of the matter.
47th

4
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,374
Half now, the rest behind.

5
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
Why do they always do that?

6
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,940
<i>What's your name?</i>

7
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,894
<i>My name is Pierre Bertrand.
I am 32 years old.</i>

My name is Victor Maynard.
I am 54 years old.

10
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,620
And I am a professional killer.

11
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,980
- I love you.
- Shut up!

12
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,574
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Victor Maynard.

13
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,734
I am 54 years old.
And I am assassin.

14
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,620
Want a sip of coffee?

15
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Victor Maynard.

16
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,540
I love you.

17
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,100
Good day.

18
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,540
Where should we go?

19
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,294
- It was not me.
- I love you, Victor Maynard.

20
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,260
- Victor Maynard, I love you.
- What the fuck out in...

21
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,540
Sheltered housing

22
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,454
I have read,
home to men -

23
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,294
- Has squiggle to
feel attracted to their mother.

24
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,694
- All right?
- We lived together for long.

25
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,134
- Yes, we did.
- Do you have the squiggle, Victor?

26
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,660
- I think not, mother.
- What is the problem then?

27
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,454
- I can not actually be.
- I got your card from Paris.

28
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,574
37 meters on the street
with a silencer.

29
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,374
Your father would have been proud.
Going international.

30
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,574
- I look in again soon.
- Wait. Your birthday.

31
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,380
It is not until...

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,694
WOMAN strangled in cinema

33
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,174
- It's too much.
- They are all there.

34
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,820
"Musicians have died."
There is room for many more.

35
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,780
A bit of a career.
A bit of a legacy.

36
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,380
You age 55, Victor.

37
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,974
- I know.
- Your dad's age when you were born.

38
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,934
I started knitting.
Blue for a boy.

39
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,774
- It has since allowed to hope.
- Goodbye, mother.

40
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,700
Someone has to continue
family business.

41
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,900
I also have a gift for you.

42
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,660
His name is Roger.
Parrot Roger.

43
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,300
- Wrong side of the road!
- The wrong way!

44
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,900
CYCLING FORBIDDEN

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Restaurants

46
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,180
- Rose.
- Is it finished?

47
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,420
I'm worried.

48
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,494
- I do not want.
- We had an agreement.

49
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,460
Yes, I know.

50
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,460
But...?

51
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,974
Rose, you must swear wholeheartedly,
that nothing is for painting.

52
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,540
Jerry, I swear.

53
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,780
You make me very happy
by doing so.

54
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,740
And if it is not enough
so just think of money.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,940
What are you thinking, Jerry?

56
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,980
How to yes.

57
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,580
It really is beautiful!

58
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,654
- Where is the copy?
- You look at it.

59
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,940
Here is the original.

60
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,220
The paint is still wet.

61
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,214
Get them mixed up.

62
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,454
<i>Culture Minister is disappointed with sales
of Rembrandt's Self Portrait -</i>

63
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,494
<i>- to a Russian buyer. It has
been seconded to the National Gallery.</i>

64
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,900
<i>gallery managed simply not
to outbid the Russians.</i>

65
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,334
We agreed on the 900th

66
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,460
900000, or I keep it.

67
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,580
It is in though. I keep it.

68
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,014
Relax.

69
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,300
It was just for fun.

70
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,494
Perfect, mr. Ferguson.
There is no shadow of doubt.

71
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,374
- What they told you?
- It's adorable.

72
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,374
- How did you nevertheless hold of it?
- It's my secret.

73
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,300
We may not know how,
but we know why. Money.

74
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,820
800,000 pounds.

75
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,654
- We agreed on nine.
- No, eight.

76
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,460
- Nine.
- Eight.

77
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,420
Okay, so nine.

78
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,054
900000, or I keep it.
Fine, I keep it.

79
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,494
I just said yes to nine.
Put it back.

80
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,100
One million.

81
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,934
- You must be mad.
- Goodbye.

82
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,094
Stop!

83
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,174
I am not a gangster -

84
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,254
- But I was realtor
for 20 years. Nothing can stop me.

85
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,220
Relax.

86
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,620
It was just for fun.

87
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,740
- Do we have enough money with me?
- Yes.

88
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,494
So now...

89
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,060
... is this gem...

90
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,494
... the ultimate record of a
man's fearless conversation with himself -

91
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,294
My property.

92
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,574
And mr. Sakova go home
with a good forgery.

93
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,814
He still can not tell the difference.

94
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,500
But I can.
I feel for this.

95
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,500
You have... your...

96
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,940
What he waffle on?

97
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,734
- It is a forgery.
- Impossible.

98
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,140
It is a forgery!

99
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,374
Sørme yes.

100
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,140
Go to the yellow color...

101
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,220
- She traded it for.
- You do not say.

102
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,580
<i>You have a new client.</i>

103
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,820
Not a scratch.

104
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,500
- So I can get many problems.
- Yes, so many here.

105
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,540
- Rose.
- What?

106
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,420
- Your luck runs out.
- What could be happen to me?

107
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,580
She is totally out of control.

108
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,220
I just switch.

109
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,814
- Do you see something you like?
- Sorry?

110
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,660
Something to drink?

111
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,380
- Goodbye, taxes.
- Goodbye.

112
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,460
Eventually.

113
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,574
- Room 27th
- Yes, I remember.

114
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,814
- You have no messages.
- How I prefer it.

115
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,020
The solitary type, eh?

116
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,420
There is a bell by the bed,
if you change your mind.

117
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,460
How much you weigh?

118
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,500
Yes.

119
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,540
No.

120
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,174
- You have committed the ultimate sin.
- Mom.

121
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,694
Regain your boss's confidence.
Your reputation depends on it.

122
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,014
- The family's reputation.
- Yes, mother.

123
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,974
He has probably found a competitor.
Someone who is better and younger.

124
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,374
It is probably true.
What do you think I should do?

125
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,174
There is only one thing you can do.
Ask the client for pardon.

126
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,660
Kill her,
and deliver your money back.

127
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,734
- You killed him.
- He was going to kill you.

128
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,380
- Okay, put yourself into.
- Keys.

129
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,860
Hurry!

130
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,494
- Will they really kill me?
- What am I doing?

131
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,300
Soon now the car.

132
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,814
Do not move out of the split.

133
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,100
Barney? Barney?

134
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,500
Do not say... Out. Now.

135
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,140
Stop!

136
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,340
Face to the wall.
You both.

137
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,774
- Oh god. What have I done?
- Who are you?

138
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,214
- Who are you?
- Know ye not one another?

139
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,774
I washed cars.
I've never touched a gun before.

140
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,300
You would shoot him. Him and...

141
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,414
- Oh god. Is she...
- She just fainted.

142
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,414
Have you ever fired a gun?
Just give it to me.

143
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,654
- Do not do it. He shoots you.
- No, I do not.

144
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,334
You saved my life.
Why would I shoot you?

145
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
Do not do it.

146
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,340
Just put it from you
before someone gets hurt.

147
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,374
I give it to him.
He has tie.

148
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,900
- And then he just looked angry at me.
- I is not mad at you. In honor.

149
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,740
Clever boy. It was good.

150
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,014
What did I do?

151
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,214
You shoot actually quite good
for a beginner.

152
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,494
- You killed him not...
- I would not either.

153
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,374
So, I was angry at him.

154
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,414
It is quite understandable.

155
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Afterwards I took it actually quite calm.
As if I had all sorts of time.

156
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,260
Excuse me a moment.

157
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,374
- What happened?
- I shot him. He is not dead.

158
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,294
The kid had no choice.
We have to save him.

159
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,574
Turns I killed him?
I killed the second.

160
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,500
We would not kill him.

161
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,854
We have to kill him.
He has seen us.

162
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,574
- Can we not go to police?
- They can not protect us.

163
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,700
- We do it the quiet way.
- Stop!

164
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,894
You are right. We can easily
escape before he wakes.

165
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,494
Let us get away.
Do not take home.

166
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,774
- A place with many people.
- Who are you?

167
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,700
- It does not matter.
- Are you an agent?

168
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,494
What are you doing? I'm afraid.
Where's the kid?

169
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,254
He slipped away.

170
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,214
I do not know who you are
but can I trust you?

171
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,700
Rely on me?

172
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,174
This is not random.
His boss wants me dead.

173
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,774
I just hope it happens quickly.
As with him.

174
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,454
I would almost wish
it happened right away.

175
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,374
So I escaped
to speculate on when.

176
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,620
Oh god!

177
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,094
I must pee.

178
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,740
I just think it's nerves.

179
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,700
Do you have a napkin?

180
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,340
Silk. Lovely.

181
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,420
Go ahead.

182
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,494
It was not even a million.
It is hand ears for them.

183
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,500
I have not done any harm.
Why are people so gullible?

184
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,134
Wait. Where are you going?

185
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,420
I need protection.
I can pay you.

186
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,174
I can pay you in advance.
I have several in my purse.

187
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,174
- I can not help you.
- Do not just leave me.

188
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,500
It's nice for you to.
I implore you.

189
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,414
- I can not. Believe me.
- I feel safe with you.

190
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,180
You are clever, calm and stable. You are
as an ancient oak.

191
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,900
Half now, the rest behind.

192
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,974
- Should I run? You seem...
- I am angry.

193
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,534
- They are wrong.
- You stole his boots?

194
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,300
He must not use them more, right?

195
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,774
- Why do you have a gun?
- It is my job.

196
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,174
- What are you doing?
- I'm private detective.

197
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,014
You do not look like the type.

198
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,054
- What were you doing here?
- I watched a client's wife.

199
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,454
She had a cheeky agreement
with a man in a car.

200
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,254
A cheeky agreement?

201
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,694
- What do you have per week?
- About a week? I'm too expensive.

202
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,134
- How much?
- 30,000.

203
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,820
It is in order.
I'm getting us out of here.

204
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,620
- I want day protection.
- Sorry, no.

205
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,540
- Bak! Run him down!
- It must be your jest.

206
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,100
- He is fine.
- What are you doing? In with you.

207
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,260
Up with you!
I can not see.

208
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,420
You nearly killed me!

209
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,260
Nail in the bottom! Now!

210
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,774
- Where?
- Just out of here.

211
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,980
We find a discreet hotel
and keeps a low profile.

212
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,374
- Discreet? Are we rich and famous?
- They check the cheap hotels.

213
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,220
Not looking for us here.

214
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,780
Three...

215
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,134
- Three bedrooms, please.
- Name?

216
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,814
- Smith.
- Smith.

217
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,774
I called the same?

218
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,574
- And you called, sir?
- Tony.

219
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,534
We settle for a single room.

220
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,620
- Excuse me.
- What? Av.

221
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,260
- It can not be serious.
- Who pays?

222
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,774
I can not sleep in others' presence.
I pay even for my room.

223
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,294
It's not about money,
but on day protection.

224
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,134
- Wait!
- No. We take a room.

225
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,414
I can discuss further in the 322nd
It is one of our cheapest.

226
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,974
- Are we now in safety?
- Naturally.

227
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,854
I leave nothing
to chance.

228
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,500
- Latrica, have you seen Mike?
- Sorry, mr. Ferguson.

229
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,020
Where is he?

230
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,894
It would help
if you could control yourself.

231
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,494
Three adults in a small room
at a luxury hotel.

232
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,700
You have got us noticed!

233
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,854
With murderers in heels,
then you are discreet. Mon hiding.

234
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,140
Mon shouts not up
in the hotel lobby.

235
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,054
- Which side do you want?
- What?

236
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,574
No. I keep watch.
Tony.

237
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,134
- You sleep with her.
- So we say it.

238
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,494
Please respect my zone.
It is here... is my area.

239
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,774
- It'll be fun.
- Find a different tone, young lady.

240
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,174
Pipe had a different sound in the past.
I pleaded not you.

241
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,774
- I begged not.
- To offer a guy 30,000...

242
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,974
- ... is unlikely to play expensive.
- Unbelievable. I just met you...

243
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,500
... but it would take me several days,
take note of everything I hate about you.

244
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,140
- Will you not?
- No. I need a little rest.

245
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm at the bar.
Let it not be long.

246
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,894
One thing. Did I hear you say
that she pay you?

247
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,054
- Yes.
- I have no money.

248
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Do not worry. I apply to you free.
In fact...

249
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,300
You can help me,
to look after her.

250
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,494
So I'm your assistant?

251
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,700
Pupil.

252
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,260
Tony, you're a fine young man.

253
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,980
That was all.

254
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,300
There you are. I wondered
me about what I did.

255
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,654
I apologize for before.
I was...

256
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,694
... uncomfortable and...

257
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,814
... and hostile.
That is how I usually do not.

258
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,140
I was aggressive and annoying.
And... so I am very often.

259
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,060
- No, you can be a pleasure.
- Really? When?

260
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,780
- I can not just come up with something.
- Although. Thank you.

261
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Right now you... a pleasure.

262
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,500
- You is not listening.
- Yes.

263
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,974
- What did you say?
- That you were a pleasure for 7-8 sec.

264
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,574
- You beglor bartender.
- Yes. He likes me.

265
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,614
Bother you? Why?
Do you like me?

266
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,334
- It's a simple question.
- Of course not.

267
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,820
That was what I thought.

268
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,734
<i>Is it because you like him?</i>

269
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,374
No. I just want you to
to listen when we talk together.

270
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,214
That's me if you are in
with the entire hotel.

271
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,540
- It does not concern me.
- You are incredible.

272
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,220
Hello.

273
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,374
A large Glenfiddich.

274
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,774
And a cognac and a belvedere.

275
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,574
And one tequila, two small red wine
and some peanuts.

276
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,775
- It is surely not only to you?
- No, tequila is for you.

277
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:28,101
My father pays.

278
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,180
How much you weigh?

279
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,015
You know what, Mike?

280
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:04,614
You're the only one with reality-
sensation in all this.

281
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,460
The only.

282
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,494
- It's not my fault.
- Not so?

283
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,494
You said we should not hire more
an assassin. The fact that Barney was enough.

284
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,174
Now I have only one bodyguard.
An incompetent and bold one.

285
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,574
Stop tremble.
Stop it!

286
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,774
Why you tremble?
Do you think I am mad at you?

287
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,220
Do you think I hit you?

288
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,734
It's funny. The truth is -

289
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,654
- To me tonight
is more than anger to tears.

290
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,654
You must understand,
that we have lost her?

291
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,054
Vixen has gone underground.

292
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:56,580
Our chances of finding her
is almost nil.

293
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,300
Tonight I am sad.

294
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,660
You are also sad.

295
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,100
I do not care about
sad people. Go into the bathroom.

296
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,934
Just keep away.
You ruined my night.

297
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,574
- I tried to make friends.
- You displayed yourself.

298
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,180
Do you have any friends?
I can not believe.

299
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,780
- Sorry. Wrong door.
- Quite right.

300
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,780
You are always wrong.

301
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,574
- I fell asleep.
- It's okay.

302
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,574
Everything he does is in order.
You ruin the boots.

303
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,734
- Ignore her. She is full.
- My reaction ability is refreshed.

304
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,974
- Now we can keep watch together.
- We can change.

305
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,780
Fantastic. The two musketeers.

306
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,574
- What are you doing?
- Stiller them out for cleaning.

307
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,780
- They are stolen.
- You are not at the hostel.

308
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,500
Do not try anything.

309
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,374
Who takes the first...

310
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,220
... watch?

311
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:03,060
- Chef, he is here.
- Good. Ask him to wait.

312
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,460
Want something?

313
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,740
- Just coffee.
- Can not we just go?

314
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,580
Will you please let me go first.

315
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,340
- Free ground.
- You do not say.

316
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,974
The story is pretty incredible.
Him, I hire for the job -

317
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,574
- Kill one of my men
and maim one another.

318
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,494
And he now protects the girl.

319
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,934
- They must both be cleared.
- You should have phoned earlier.

320
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,574
- We tried to handle it themselves.
- I can see.

321
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,420
- They killed Barney!
- Mike.

322
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,180
I can not stand you right now.
Get some cigarettes for me.

323
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,380
- Put money in our parking slot.
- It can even make damn.

324
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,614
And the name of the gentleman
causing problems?

325
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,014
I do not know his name.
I have never met him.

326
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,734
- Can you tell anything about him?
- Mike, hop into. Describe him.

327
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,094
Higher than average.
Thinner than average.

328
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,854
Plain appearance.
Plain mustache.

329
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,134
Victor Maynard.

330
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,174
- Do you know him? Where he is?
- No, nobody knows him.

331
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,414
Nobody has seen him.
He is of the old guard.

332
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,414
How do you know
how he looks?

333
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,374
Rumors.

334
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,820
In our industry,
we are the two most expensive.

335
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,780
He is actually
slightly more expensive than you.

336
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,820
We find
whether he is worth it.

337
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,174
Help yourself.
Except the sausages.

338
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,814
You are generous.

339
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,294
Get now just paid the hotel bill.

340
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,580
Am I not a moment without you,
I then commit suicide.

341
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,700
Wait. I did not mean that.
I was just lucky.

342
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,294
Do not move! Hands up!

343
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:47,174
Shit! You are shaking like a espeløv.
Give me the gun.

344
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,774
I mean it! You know me.

345
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,574
I could easily frame
balls by mistake.

346
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,294
- You tried to drown me.
- Only a bit.

347
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,934
- I am a sweet and nice person.
- Relax. Breathe deeply.

348
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,140
<i>I is casual!</i>

349
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,860
It was an accident.
You made me scared.

350
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,140
Find your ear and put it on ice.
The hospital can sew it back on.

351
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,420
There is ice in the minibar.

352
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,054
- Flee!
- What?

353
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,014
Shit!
I was not even a bathrobe.

354
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,374
Smith, Smith and Tony?

355
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,894
He tried to kill me!

356
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,420
In the bathroom.
With a great shoot.

357
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,140
Wait! Wait!

358
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,260
My ear!
Your sick pig!

359
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,740
Put it on ice!

360
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,700
- Did you shoot his ear off?
- It was an accident.

361
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,780
- Get them cleared up.
- You have hired a pro now.

362
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,654
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Girl. The mustache.

363
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,100
They stayed at the hotel.
The kid pushed my ear.

364
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,900
- Mini car!
- For God's sake. Get your car!

365
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,334
He made me afraid;
I saw...

366
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,820
You made it necessary.
You are a natural talent.

367
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,854
- They follow us.
- Faster.

368
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,734
- I can not.
- Run faster.

369
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,374
I do my best.
I learn the car to know.

370
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,414
- Is it new?
- I found it yesterday.

371
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,054
- The keys were sitting in.
- Is it stolen?

372
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,294
- Yes!
- They are catching up on us.

373
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,100
I take the accelerator.
We switch places.

374
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,100
- Move. I can see nothing.
- But you get when paw everything.

375
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,500
- Baby!
- Continue. We are bigger.

376
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,900
- I think they are gone.
- Not sure?

377
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,900
Stop it!

378
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,295
- Where should we go?
- We must be out of town.

379
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:30,294
- No, I like the city.
- Ditto. I know nothing else.

380
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,374
We drive in a stolen car
which is pierced.

381
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,974
We are hunted by assassins,
and probably half the police force.

382
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,180
We must be out of town!

383
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,774
- Did you remember the tent?
- I have a hiding place.

384
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,934
- More hidden than the hotel?
- I will ignore you.

385
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,660
"You ignore me."

386
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,534
- Can we stop? I must pee.
- No.

387
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,814
You get 30,000 a week.
You do as I say.

388
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,054
- I get money to protect you.
- 30,000?

389
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,580
Yes, I should be able to sit down
and pee at the price.

390
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,494
Mr. Smith, 30,000?
It's pretty good.

391
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,494
- Yes.
- I know it is dangerous.

392
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,054
But I do me quite well.

393
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,174
So that I am your pupil,
We can do it formally?

394
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,900
So I could get a piece of cake.

395
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,174
Now listen...

396
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,614
I can offer you
six weeks of training.

397
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,974
In monitoring, identity fraud,
arms workout...

398
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:11,214
Small arms, rifles, explosives.
The 17 ways to strangle on.

399
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,374
- And the basic training in poison homicide.
- All that to become a private detective?

400
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,780
You never know
whom you can meet.

401
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,854
Okay. Continue.

402
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,654
I can not offer health insurance
but board and lodging is covered.

403
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,654
And a bus passes to London.

404
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,620
Will you take care of me?

405
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,500
Yes.

406
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,900
And my name is Victor Maynard.

407
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,060
Come on!

408
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,740
Come back!

409
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,574
The place is criminal.
Half of the goods is too old.

410
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,254
So irresponsible!
Appalling childish!

411
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,894
Shocking!

412
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,460
Would anyone have a fig roll?

413
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,300
- I want one.
- Do.

414
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,020
Is it a cow?

415
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,340
Much bigger in real life.

416
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,300
What's this?

417
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,614
This is my home.

418
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,374
- Your home?
- What's strange about it?

419
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,140
Nothing.

420
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,020
Now give it all meaning.

421
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,374
It was my grandfather, my father
and now it is mine.

422
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,174
- Lifts?
- It was my mother.

423
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,774
She lived here with
me until... recently.

424
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,174
- Is she dead?
- No.

425
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,294
- Stands In another close?
- Why you ask?

426
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,174
I'm just friendly.
What is wrong with you?

427
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,700
Look what I found!

428
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,460
Snow White. Hello...

429
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,540
Now I'll show you
your room.

430
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,180
- You get my old room.
- Thank you.

431
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,774
Do you like it?
My dad did it for me.

432
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,694
- He was clever with his hands.
- I've never had a father.

433
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,420
I've obviously had a,
but he left us.

434
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,460
- Is it your mom's room?
- Yes.

435
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:26,620
You are a little crazy with the plastic, right?
Condoms touch you probably do not.

436
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,380
How have your assistant it?

437
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,294
- We should probably turn off for him.
- It is probably best.

438
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,654
No. He has been paid
the rest of the month.

439
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,700
He gives as a little company
while I wait.

440
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,574
- At you.
- Do not worry.

441
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,374
Sooner or later
committing one of them an error.

442
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,374
We're safe here as long as
we follow the few simple rules.

443
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,300
Never leave the site.
Salted middle of the table, please.

444
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,220
And mint sauce.

445
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:22,220
No contact with the outside world.
Mobile phones must be switched off.

446
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,094
The wine must also enter the middle.

447
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,454
If you want to be kind.

448
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,374
It is a light burgundy.

449
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,700
I especially like wines
from Burgundy.

450
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,454
- So it is a prison.
- No, it is a safe place.

451
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,094
When do you think
hazard is driven over?

452
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,260
You will be hunted by assassins.
The driver never over.

453
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,580
A small gift from my mother.

454
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,534
- The time is 2:45.
- I know as well.

455
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,014
- What are you doing?
- I turn the bed.

456
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:34,060
I sleep with head towards south.
I'm suffering from insomnia.

457
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,020
How. Plug in the south.

458
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,414
- Why did not I think of that?
- The shoes.

459
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,460
They give me confidence.

460
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,174
Tony, who is young and mature,
and a bit eksentrisk -

461
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,300
- But as everyone else at. 2.45,
so he sleeps.

462
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,574
No. It is her, we go after.

463
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,454
Watch her.
A pending accident.

464
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,094
The kid is negligible.
Maynard contrast...

465
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,734
It is pointless
to go after him.

466
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,940
He leaves behind no traces.
Not so much as a crumb.

467
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,500
He is the ultimate
killing machine.

468
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,614
- What are you doing? You are insane!
- I just dig.

469
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,654
- Keep up immediately!
- I would plant some magnolias.

470
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,854
It would be a surprise.
I got up at six o'clock.

471
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,815
I've never dug
a hole for someone before!

472
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:17,700
- Why start with me?
- I would thank you!

473
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:22,414
- For helping me last night.
- Fill the holes up.

474
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,814
- No!
- It was not a request!

475
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,694
It was an order!

476
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,374
It had you not entitled.
It is my garden!

477
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,494
You do not care. A garden must
be enveloped in beauty.

478
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:44,654
How one's senses can get free games.
But you pack your own furniture into.

479
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,894
You are only happy here in your
dark and dreadful secret.

480
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,734
Ye gods, it is awful!
The smell follows you everywhere.

481
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,174
- What smell?
- Cleaning.

482
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,700
It's like being in a hospital.
There are so certain that it is dangerous.

483
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,100
I mean it.
I'm afraid.

484
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:18,414
I fear that I end up
just like you. Afraid of everything.

485
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,294
- I am not afraid.
- To admit who I am.

486
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,500
What I want.

487
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,420
Where will you go with it?

488
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:38,500
You do not really
something about yourself, right?

489
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,540
It's me.
May I come in?

490
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,974
- I'm in the bath.
- I know.

491
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,094
- Is it important?
- I think so.

492
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,420
Okay.

493
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,574
- Are we a bath?
- It looks like this.

494
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:08,214
Tony, at last, I have not
really had a grip on things.

495
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,694
I have been distracted at work -

496
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:17,334
- And I'm overtrimmet
my best bonsai tree.

497
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,934
So I was wondering -

498
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,974
- It may be you,
which confuses me.

499
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,374
- Confuses you?
- Instinct.

500
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,140
Without any of us really know.

501
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,260
Confuses you?

502
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,100
Sexually.

503
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,574
- The idea is absurd.
- I did not know you were...

504
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,974
I am not.
This is the case.

505
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,100
<i>- It is confusing.
- Yes.</i>

506
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,100
Okay... What is your first thought?

507
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,380
My bonsaitræ.

508
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,894
I can use the rubber plant.

509
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,540
I will not bother you anymore.

510
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,934
Everyone knows it is a copy.

511
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,974
Mr. Ferguson will know
where the girl got it from.

512
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:25,374
I am not interfering
with criminal elements.

513
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,894
Even your smile is criminal.

514
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,014
Names!

515
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,494
There are many
by copying paintings.

516
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,740
The ones I know did not.

517
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,700
Force me not to shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

518
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,140
Fat pen.

519
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,300
What flavor is it?

520
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,300
Bell Busk.

521
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,260
They are not bad.

522
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:24,294
Go ahead. But I do not know
whether they are good enough.

523
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,220
Excellent. Fabian.

524
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,340
No, no.

525
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,900
Take the painting.

526
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,820
It's me.

527
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,374
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

528
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,300
I know it is late.

529
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:06,180
Sorry for the former.
I should not have said everything.

530
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,620
I was angry.
And very tired.

531
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,620
- There is no harm done.
- Why even take me seriously?

532
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,014
- You should have slept a little.
- I can not sleep.

533
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,134
- What is it this time?
- I have a sore jaw.

534
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,660
I have too many teeth
here behind.

535
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,894
Got some pills?
Tamazepan, Trazadone...

536
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,494
Sleeping pills, Valium, Zanex...

537
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,900
- No, sorry.
- Okay, so yesterday I just...

538
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,740
I could...

539
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,020
... massage your feet.

540
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,614
- Are you serious?
- Acupressure.

541
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:11,014
I learned it long ago.
I use it sometimes myself.

542
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:17,260
- It is good for anxiety.
- Massaging your own feet?

543
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,080
Here?

544
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,254
There?

545
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,654
You really
a good roof on it here.

546
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:35,374
Many experienced nocturnal anxiety.
It is perfectly normal.

547
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,974
Let it not move you on.

548
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,934
Let me tell you something?
A confession.

549
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,654
- Why not?
- I like you as my protector.

550
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,894
You are really good at it.
It seems at least that.

551
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,774
I have not really
nothing to compare with.

552
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,774
Nobody has ever
protected me before.

553
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,900
But with you,
I enjoy it really.

554
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,620
I enjoy doing it.

555
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,934
For me in particular?

556
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,900
With you... in particular.

557
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,980
Do I...

558
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,820
... massage the other foot?

559
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,540
Tony, let me out!

560
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,220
Tony, she will kill me!

561
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:55,134
An old hare in a wheelchair
just tried to kill me.

562
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,900
It's true.

563
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:03,500
Mom?
Mom, are you there? It's me.

564
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,860
Mom?

565
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,620
I have everything under control.

566
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,774
She thinks it well.

567
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:30,374
- Mom, can we talk about it?
- You disappoint me, Victor.

568
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,454
- Would you sleep in the living room?
- I'm too scared.

569
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,174
- You can sleep inside with me.
- Yes. Tony fits you.

570
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,900
Your reputation is in tatters.

571
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,900
- Mor...
- She is a typical mother.

572
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,574
Until you kill her,
you're the target.

573
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,814
- I stood behind the door.
- I said you must never do.

574
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,854
- Forgive me, I...
- Stop.

575
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,334
Do you know what trouble you're in?

576
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,774
Since I have moved,
have you gone to the dogs.

577
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:13,340
You are not even
in bed with her.

578
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:18,134
Mom, I think we have a problem.

579
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,174
- I think so too.
- I know you have sacrificed much...

580
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:27,294
A Beretta for your 7-year-old birthday.
A divine gun.

581
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,774
I think just,
what is the result -

582
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,980
Has made me.

583
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,460
You've been your father's Sun

584
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,894
You saved my life. Again.

585
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:52,294
I did not mean that.
I have never been so scared.

586
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:58,700
I am glad that you did it.
I have nothing to live for now.

587
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,534
I'm in love.

588
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,694
- Really?
- Yes.

589
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Yes, yes, yes.

590
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,700
Put yourself under the covers. Come on.

591
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,900
Just lie back.

592
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,860
He is so nice.

593
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,620
- He is so nice.
- Who?

594
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:45,500
- Mr. Maynard of course.
- Really?

595
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:52,700
When his mother woke me
I dreamed about him.

596
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,300
Really?

597
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,134
It's funny. Yesterday -

598
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:06,014
- I thought only of escape.
And now... I will never get out of here.

599
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,334
What happened in between?

600
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,100
Enough.

601
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:16,974
No, we are here. Us three.

602
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,700
One big, happy family.

603
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,260
- A difficult night.
- Not at all.

604
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,614
My mother requires an explanation.

605
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,174
- I understand how you feel.
- Do you?

606
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:47,974
I had a cousin.
Gal as your mother, poor kid.

607
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,500
But I loved him.
Family is family, right?

608
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:05,220
I can easily yourself.
I did know even this.

609
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,374
- How...
- My name is Fabian.

610
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,540
You need to recommend me one,
who can paint such a here.

611
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,054
Who created it?

612
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,534
- Rembrandt.
- Who?

613
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,180
- Rembrandt.
- Give me his address.

614
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,574
- He is dead.
- Death?

615
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,180
- When?
- For 300 years ago.

616
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,654
- Give me a name.
- That must be Jerry.

617
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:37,374
- Jerry Who?
- Jerry Bailey. National Gallery.

618
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,220
He is a friend.

619
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,574
Excellent.

620
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,614
It took a while, but...

621
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,054
Good day.

622
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,380
What a mess.

623
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:15,780
<i>Today is mr. Maynard's birthday
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah...</i>

624
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,300
Is everything for my sake?

625
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,734
I am touched.
It's so kind of you.

626
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,660
I know.
Breathe them out.

627
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:47,174
Sorry it with the mirror.

628
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:53,100
- How did I, it was today?
- From the pictures in your old room.

629
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,420
- Have you done it?
- No. It was you.

630
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,054
I'm stuck.

631
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,774
- I know.
- No. I can not move me.

632
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:47,100
- My shoes.
- Do you have them still?

633
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,620
Of course.

634
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,780
- It's my watch.
- I thought you wanted it.

635
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,420
Thank you.

636
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:28,020
How much you weigh?

637
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,900
Good morning.

638
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,500
Dear Mike,
you've been shot before.

639
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,254
Tony, what do you think
about this room?

640
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,660
It needs to suit.

641
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,580
Colourful.

642
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,620
Colourful.

643
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:59,614
MUSIC murdered in Morecambe

644
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,294
MALE SUBJECT UD
FROM TOWER BRIDGE

645
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,454
DIPLOMAT BLADE slew

646
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,500
Shot in the head

647
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,820
<i>Congratulations. Your father, Felix.</i>

648
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,820
Colourful.

649
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:27,700
Tony, I think
it will suit her taste.

650
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:38,500
- Rose. May I come in?
- No, I'm not dressed.

651
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:45,654
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, why not?

652
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:50,660
Not for anything. Come with down.
I'll show you something.

653
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,220
Can not you see that?

654
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,540
- Why are you smiling?
- It takes you out of.

655
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,734
- Turn around.
- Why?

656
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,814
- Turn around now.
- First one why.

657
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:24,334
- Turn around.
- Are you in it?

658
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:28,420
- Naturally.
- Do not be a child.

659
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,094
Why are you doing this?

660
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:39,820
To make the surprise more.

661
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:48,980
I got you. Do not be afraid.
It is quickly over.

662
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,020
So the time has almost does.

663
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:02,374
- The time has also come for you.
- The gun is dangerous.

664
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,934
- You do not say.
- You misunderstand.

665
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,294
It is just an heirloom.
It may explode.

666
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,334
- You are a liar and a murderer.
- And you are a thief.

667
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,574
- You are made for each other.
- When you noticed this?

668
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:20,054
He is not private detective.
He is an assassin.

669
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,374
- Hired to kill me.
- It is unfortunately true.

670
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:29,980
I'm really some shitty.
How can you live with yourselves?

671
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:13,094
- Was not I a detective-pupil?
- As shoot people?

672
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,934
Sometimes. By accident.
If it is inevitable.

673
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:20,294
- Kills you me now?
- Of course I'm not doing it.

674
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,854
But if you go,
then makes a second it.

675
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,734
I can almost guess who.

676
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,580
- Who?
- Dixon.

677
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:34,220
Dixon? Is he clever?

678
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:39,734
He is a disgrace to the profession.
A sadist. A beast.

679
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:42,854
- Mr. Maynard.
- Yes, Tony?

680
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,780
We get hit on him.

681
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,940
<i>I give, I gave, I have given.</i>

682
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,380
<i>I choose, I chose, I have chosen.</i>

683
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:57,100
I feel I felt I felt.

684
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,894
Jerry. We're in Trouble.

685
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,454
The situation has been...

686
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:07,220
... dangerous.

687
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:15,700
- Where is he?
- Who?

688
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,854
The man who would kill you.

689
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,180
- Who asks?
- His successor.

690
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,334
Where is he?

691
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,374
- I do not know.
- Say it...

692
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,614
... or I'll cut his finger on
and forces you to swallow it.

693
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:53,740
Which I leave you
be alone with him.

694
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:57,174
Would you like to be brave?

695
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,300
It would also Jerry.

696
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,420
Gradually, thanks.

697
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,814
- I've lost the roof.
- No. Reload.

698
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,980
We do it together.

699
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,614
Feet, check. Hand, check.

700
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,774
Wrist, check.

701
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:41,494
If there is time, so relax.
I have time, I relax.

702
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:44,700
I love the weather.

703
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,500
I am one with my gun.

704
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:04,380
I should perhaps look away.
I shall perhaps pressure on you.

705
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:11,214
Feet, hands, wrists, -

706
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:14,100
Respiration.

707
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,654
Impressive.

708
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:25,374
People train for years,
order to do that.

709
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,500
I did not shoot.

710
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:44,660
Put the guns from you.
Slowly.

711
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,140
Victor Maynard.

712
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,574
- At last.
- And you are?

713
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,100
You know very well
who I am.

714
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,140
Dixon.

715
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,574
- Hector Dixon.
- How is it spelled?

716
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,014
- Make him angry.
- Dixon?

717
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:22,134
Are you taking the jobs
I do not bother?

718
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,654
And those you make a mess.

719
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:29,574
- Have they tortured you?
- No. I immediately gave them the address.

720
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,220
Why did you not remit?

721
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,220
Why do you think?

722
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,654
Yes. It really is heartbreaking.

723
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,660
Ask you up the wall.

724
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:55,140
- I've missed you.
- Same.

725
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,334
Tony.

726
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:02,854
Maynard, do your job
and I do not kill the kid.

727
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,374
Excuse me?

728
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,174
Kill the girl, I'll shoot you -

729
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,100
But he goes from here unscathed.

730
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,660
- I can not.
- Do it!

731
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,454
Just do it.

732
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:53,180
I prefer you.
I want the best.

733
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,374
Shoot him.

734
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,140
Turn around.

735
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,580
Cane you not!

736
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:13,980
You are, hands up.

737
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:17,374
Higher up.

738
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,374
At your age,
I will still do your homework.

739
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,094
- You, there.
- Me?

740
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,300
Pick up the pistol.
And searched the rat.

741
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:33,334
The kid can be trained,
but he will never get what you have.

742
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,614
- Dræberinstinktet.
- You know, I do not believe.

743
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:42,574
No, you believe in the upbringing.
So, blame the mother.

744
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:46,014
Our disagreements, despite...

745
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:51,700
- So I am grateful to you today.
- Do not be sentimental.

746
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,414
So that?

747
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,134
- So what?
- Nobody move.

748
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:05,060
- He took that from me.
- Lay down their arms.

749
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,700
Now!

750
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:11,700
And the knife.

751
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,860
- You've really lost the roof.
- It's Felix's gun.

752
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:21,654
It was my father's first
and preferred weapons.

753
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,774
I hope it relieves the shot hole.

754
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,300
Goodbye.

755
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:37,860
Tony, come and see what happens
if you can not clean his gun.

756
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,700
THREE YEARS LATER

757
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:21,620
Tax.

758
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,900
Has anyone seen the cat?
