179
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,442
(SIGHS)

180
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,443
- I figured I'd be a lot safer here.
- Thank Christ.

181
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,696
Are you freaking kidding me?

182
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,365
We're in a hospital.

183
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,616
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,077
Right. Sorry.

185
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,204
Just practicing.

186
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,957
I don't even smoke. I quit a month ago.

187
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,250
It's a girl.

188
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,794
Oh, my God. I gotta call you back.
Is she...

189
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,461
They're both doing just fine.

190
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,543
Would you like to meet her?

191
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,054
(BABIES GURGLING)

192
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,228
(CRASHING)

193
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,147
(BABIES CRYING)

194
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,691
There you are.

195
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,483
LYLA: Am I dead?

196
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,779
Sorry. Jared'll be in in a sec.

197
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,156
My hero.

198
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,490
He's a sweetie, huh?

199
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,700
Hmm.

200
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,246
I hope this isn't too inappropriate to ask,

201
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,166
but is it true that he's
never really had...

202
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,500
It's true.

203
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,169
Oh.

204
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,503
Okay. What kind of a doily

205
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,173
passes out in the Daddy's Room?

206
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,719
- I hope you feel better.
- Thank you.

207
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,512
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

208
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,598
Thank you. (HUMMING)

209
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,807
She's perky.

210
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,268
Who, Jane? Yeah, she's great.

211
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,728
She's screaming for a shot at the title.

212
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,812
Nice.

213
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,416
What could possibly be wrong with her?

214
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,860
I am so over this whole
fresh-faced, Ivy League,

215
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,653
preppie, bouncy, ponytail-y type.

216
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,509
Don't you have to be under one first?

217
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,530
Good one.

218
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,574
She knows, by the way.

219
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,867
Yeah. A bunch of us went out

220
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,535
for too many margaritas last month.

221
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,997
Now they have, like, an
un-virgin pool going.

222
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,082
What?

223
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,085
A bevy of hot nurses
are conspiring to bang your brains out?

224
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,503
You should press charges.

225
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,340
No, not my brother. He's
gotta wait for love.

226
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,548
Yeah, well...

227
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,927
It seemed like
a really noble idea when I was 15.

228
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,096
Anyway, I'm starting to waver.

229
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,472
Shut up.

230
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,890
No, I'm gonna be 30 soon.

231
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,558
But then that would mean
that I've wasted the last

232
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,228
15-plus years.

233
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,438
You're fine.

234
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,564
Well, call what's-her-name back in here.

235
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,900
Come on. You can use my bed.

236
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,444
I'll wait in the hall. I
can laugh really quietly.

237
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,447
Or I could just
put you back in there with the babies.

238
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,573
No.

239
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,075
Oh.

240
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,868
Whoa, whoa. You okay?

241
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,662
(EXHALES)

242
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:20,830
I want you to...

243
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,999
Look right at me. Right at my nose.

244
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,963
Yeah, you might have a concussion.

245
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,256
How will I know?

246
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,216
Headaches, vomiting.

247
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,468
Hmm. And I haven't even seen Dad yet.

248
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,553
(CHUCKLES)

249
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,013
Hey. Where's Andrew?

250
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,224
I don't know. Can we bookmark it?

251
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,145
I want to keep the whole "Lyla's desiccating
her life" lectures down to one a day.

252
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,354
I can't wait.

253
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,605
See you, Jared.

254
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,566
Neither can they.

255
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,529
He's huge.

256
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,613
(BOTH GASPING)

257
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,949
(SIGHING)

258
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,580
I remember. (CHUCKLES)

259
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,916
Look at Jared.

260
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:07,835
(CHUCKLES)

261
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:12,256
Lyla. Oh, look how tiny Alejandro was.

262
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,843
BEBE: One of the workers
almost painted over that

263
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,178
while we were redecorating.

264
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,639
I had my knitting needle to his throat
when Donald pulled me off of him.

265
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,559
ELLIE: Yeah. And now they're all grown.

266
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,643
Yeah.

267
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,896
You were so wonderful to them.

268
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,649
Well, they're not
officially my kids, but, you know...

269
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,027
God, you look stunning.

270
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,447
Cut the crap, Bebes.
I look a decade older and so do you.

271
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,658
Said the one of us not
wearing control tops.

272
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,371
Wait until you see Muffin. Oh, my God.

273
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,748
I heard she had work done.

274
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,958
Really, like, somebody said it was scary.

275
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,212
Well, let's just say most of her face
is now behind her ears.

276
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,975
(LAUGHING)
- And she's completely mental.

277
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,466
She's driving me crazy
about the details of the wedding,

278
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,718
which is ironic because
we're hosting it here.

279
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,802
- Right.
- Right?

280
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,930
And I'm catering it. Organic, of course.

281
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,433
Oh, God, I was just so
terrified to see you.

282
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,646
Oh, don't be.
I mean, look, it was a long time ago.

283
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,648
So...

284
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,734
Yeah. Well, now that you're here,
I realize how much I missed you.

285
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,445
Well. Hey, I want to say something.

286
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,695
- This house?
- Yeah?

287
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,365
It looks absolutely incredible.

288
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,367
When were you two married, anyway?

289
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,702
Oh, we weren't. I don't need a ring.

290
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,747
I mean, maybe
I'd like to have a ring some time, but...

291
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,831
You should tell him.

292
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,458
He knows. He knows.

293
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,419
Doesn't exactly back stroke
through the deep end

294
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,712
of the sensitivity pool.

295
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,422
Hey. Look at you two.

296
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,091
Haven't seen this much tail around here

297
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,592
since the last poochie died.

298
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,887
(BOTH LAUGH POLITELY)

299
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,725
LYLA: Oh, Well.

300
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,479
JARED: Welcome to the jungle.

301
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,147
I truly loathe this place.

302
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:56,734
Oh. Is that because you've hooked up
with, like, half the staff?

303
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,536
It was high school.
And hand jobs don't count.

304
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,655
Oh, thank God.

305
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,950
LYLA: Hi. Oh, look at you.
You look gorgeous.

306
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,286
Oh, so do you.
Oh, my God, your hair, I love it.

307
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,162
- Thanks.
- I'm so glad you're here.

308
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,746
- Sister.
- Immigrant.

309
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,748
- Ambulance chaser.
- Partner.

310
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,628
Hey, good for you. Where's Andrew?

311
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,089
- Oh, God.
- Are you okay?

312
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,341
- I gotta sit down.
- Come. Come.

313
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,760
She's drunk already?

314
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,681
Mild concussion. This should be fun.

315
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,810
MISSY: It's, like, as
soon as we got engaged,

316
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,147
it suddenly dawned on them
that he's not Caucasian.

317
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,606
Wait, you're not Caucasian?

318
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,899
Not at the moment.

319
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,359
JARED: Well, that's upsetting.

320
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,278
They're, like,
putting on this whole dinner theater,

321
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,196
PC act, pretending to be really cool,

322
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,656
but really they're freaking out

323
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,781
that they're gonna have beige grandkids.

324
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,103
Isn't that a little hypocritical,

325
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,952
considering your father's
being investigated for...

326
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,913
There's my little princess!

327
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,708
Darling. A wisp.

328
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,792
No, it's fine.

329
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,793
Sweetheart, you know the Corns.

330
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,379
- Hi.
MISSY: - Hi. Good to see you.

331
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:00,798
And this is her friend Alejandro.

332
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,593
MAN: - Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

333
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,386
- AI is fine.
MAN: - Good. AI.

334
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,804
- Well, hello, Lyla.
- Muffin.

335
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,890
How's Chicago?

336
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,684
Crawling with spics and Jews.

337
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,645
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

338
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,067
DON: I'm shaking, I mean,
it's been so long.

339
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,610
What the hell am I gonna say to her?

340
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,973
BEBE: Don, you're gonna do fine.

341
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,239
I need, uh, a drink.

342
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,824
Babe, hey.

343
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,702
Thanks, babe.

344
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,080
ELLIE: - There she is.
- Okay.

345
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,375
Hello, sweetheart.

346
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,709
How are you?

347
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,834
Donald.

348
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,295
You look breathtaking.

349
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,963
You've packed on a few.

350
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,924
You know, only in the good spots. But...

351
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,387
Do you... Well, is it okay if I...

352
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,722
Actually, I'm just...
I'm not feeling so hot right now.

353
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,557
Oh, hey. I miss you so much.

354
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,642

I wasn't actually kidding.
I really don't feel well.

I really wish we could spend some time,

And where are we going on our honeymoon?

367
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,005
Vietnam and Cambodia.

368
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,882
Yeah. We suggested Venice,
but we don't count.

369
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,844
Because it's safer.

370
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,056
But also, of course, because Venice
is Alejandro's native language.

And it's perfectly safe.

375
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,946
I know, because I lived
there for three months.

410

are just dying to hear all about

411

And it just...

417
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,525
It just got really hard,
and he couldn't take it.

418
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,153

so I cut him loose before he did it to me.

perform the ceremony?

- Just, listen to me,

have this thing about divorce?

that divorce is a great big, fat sin.

I'm not listening.

498
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,591
And she's also under the impression

499
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,530
that of all the big, fat divorce sinners
in this whole big, wide world,

500
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,907
you and I are not among them.

- Don?

- Not remotely.
- We're not divorced!

- What?

you and I are husband and wife.

I feel terrible.

00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,975
They're just letting
anyone into Harvard these days, huh?

512
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,020
And you never told her
about them because...

513
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,231
I mean, there was no way
she was ever gonna come here.

514
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,109

until that Pre-Cana.

What would happen if she knew the truth?

517
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,948
You told me what she put you
through during the adoption.

518
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,243
She gave up her only son so that I
could have a chance at a better life.

519
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,411
And now, she left Colombia,

520
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,789
which she swore
she would never do. On an airplane,

521
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,956
which she's petrified of,

522
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,666
only to find out that
I've been lying to her

523
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,834
about being raised by heathens

524
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,336
for the past 15 years.

525

- No offense.
- None taken.

526
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,590
It'd break her poor little heart.

for a of couple days? No big deal.

00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:47,057
Sweetie, there's just
one little part that I'm stuck on.

530
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,266
If those two are still married,

531
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,144
then what does that make me?

532
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,899
My concubine?

533
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,070
I hadn't really gotten there yet.

534
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,488
- I see.

535
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,281
All right.

536
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,743
More tea, anyone?

537
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,287
I thought my life was a shit storm.

538
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,623
I feel awful.

539
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,507
Well, then what the hell
are you waiting for?

540
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,629
This is gonna go great.

541
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,552
Before we start shitting kittens,
why don't we just sit the old gal down

542
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,509
and lay it all out for her?
You and I are divorced.

543
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,803
It's not like we moved
to a fucking petting zoo or something.

544
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,721
ELLIE: She's from another country.

545
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,098
A very different country.

546
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,850
And her values aren't the same as ours.

547
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,434
So just pretend to be
married for the weekend.

548
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,519
What's the big deal?

549
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,923
Where would you like me to start?

550
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,939
Hey, listen. You were no Mardi Gras, toots.

551
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,065
What did you call me?

552
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,525
DON: Let's get that straight. Oh.

553
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,026
And it's an expression. It's an expression.

554
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,362
Of endearment.
So don't get all Jane Fonda about it.

555
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,321
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Well, you know, the Tibetans

556
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,322
have a wonderful expression

557
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,366
for moments like these as well.

558
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,450
Yeah?

559
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,327
Loosely translated,
it means, "Go fuck a yak, Don."

560
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,123
That's the moment. I finally feel home.

561
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,332
So, she's leaving.

562
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,751
Some apology.
What is the matter with you? Why can't...

563
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,961
She won't listen to me.

564
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,336
She's not going anywhere.

565
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,131
Honey, this is all very dramatic.

566
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,716
- Can't we just...
- Put a sock in it, Donald.

567
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,885
Let me help you with this.

568
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,469
Let's go in the kitchen,
let's have some tea...

569
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,972
- You hate my tea.
- I love your tea.

570
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,265
BEBE: Really?
DON: Okay, okay.

571
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,349
I do hate your tea.
But the rest of you is pure perfection.

572
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,561
- Just take the suitcase.
- Honey, please. Look...

573
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,979

00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,147
- Jesus.

I promise, we can figure this out.

577

and your happiness.

579
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,950
And if my presence
means that that doesn't happen...

580
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,286
But, Bebe, you're a big
part of that happiness.

I'll just...

582
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,997
No. Because then every time

583
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,874
you look back on your wedding day,

584
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,374
it's gonna be with pain and regret.

585
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,696
And I can't allow that to happen.

already on thin ice.

but may I just say something here?

supposedly love is devastated,

880
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,190
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

881
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,203
Mama?

882
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:27,830
It's okay.

883
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,834
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

884
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,023
What the fuck did she just say?

885
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,232
Shh! Please.

886
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,860
DON: I don't know what she's saying.

887
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,654
(WHISPERING)

888
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,204
You have my blessing.

889
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,164
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

890
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,999
BARRY: All right.

891
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,336
- Come sit.
BARRY: - Yeah.

892
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,755
You know, contemplate, place to put it.

893
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,885
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

894
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,261
Hey, Don. Where's Bebe?

895
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,224
We were supposed to
go over the crudités presentation together.

896
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,100
Yeah. Well, her aunt just passed,

897
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,704
so she had to go back to Poughkeepsie.

898
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,270
MADONNA: Nuria!

899
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,481
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

900
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,691
- But her aunt's dead.
- That's what I said.

901
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,667
God knows I hate a boring dinner.

902
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,126
Everybody have enough ice water?

903
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:59,839
Good evening, and welcome
to Weeblewog Country Club.

904
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,298
My name is Yvette.

905
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,927
And I will be your captain this evening.

906
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,302
Bebe?

907
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,304
(THUMPING)
- Ow!

908
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,099
BEBE: Tonight our soup is a lobster bisque,

909
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,309
flavored with twice
the recommended daily dose of sodium.

910
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,895
We also have a filet mignon.

911
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,983
Not organic, stuffed with
bleu cheese, sour cream,

912
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,609
bacon, and a defibrillator.

913
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,319
DON: I'll have the filet mignon.

914
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:23,863
Don't think so.

915
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,656
Excuse me, miss.

916
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,242
Our guests really aren't
used to American food.

917
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,326
Do you think that Chef Claude

918
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,956
could whip up some chimichangi thingy?

919
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,332
No. Stop it.

920
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,750
MUFFIN: What, I didn't say it right?

921
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,711
No, you said it fine.

922
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,212
Just fine.

923
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,547
Are you okay?

924
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,300
(SOFTLY) Just fucking with him.

925
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,302
BARRY: Fine.

926
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,344
Mama.

927
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,346
What's the rumpus?

928
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,724
Oh, um, she was wondering why the wedding

929
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,349
is being held at our house,

930
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,561
and not at the O'Connors'.

931
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,688
Um...

932
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,568
Well, we thought we'd shake it up a little.

933
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,570
Uh, besides, our house...

934
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,280
- Is in foreclosure?

935
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,531
- Okay, that's...
MISSY: - That's right.

936
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,366
He has to plead poverty

937
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,203
because he's
being investigated for stock fraud.

938
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,370
Spectacular fork.

939
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,081
BARRY: It's more complicated
than that, I think.

940
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,125
But we still have money. We do.

941
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,877
- Really. It's just...
- Okay.

942
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,962
It's overseas for the time being.

943
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,213
BARRY: That's enough!

944
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,842
I'm gonna check on the soup.

945
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,347
I wanted to tell you
that your house is the most

946
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,389
amazing place that I have ever seen.

947
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,808
You built it yourselves, yes?

948
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,143
(THUDDING)

949
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,436
We did, actually.

950
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,812
Tell her the story.

951
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,549
MISSY: Yeah, it's really romantic.

952
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,983
It is. It is romantic.

953
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:45,401
It's fine. Tell her. Tell the story.

954
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,405
Don and I, we were living
in the city separately.

955
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,282
She wouldn't shack up with me

956
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,646
because we weren't in matrimony.

957
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,744
ELLIE: So Don's latest exhibition

958
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,120
had sold out completely.

959
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,412
Third in a row.

960
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,499
It did well. Awash in humility. As always.

961
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,833
One of the many things she loves about me.

962
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:00,918
That's our Donny. Yes.

963
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,379
Can we please just skip
to the happy ending?

964
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,420
(SPITS)

965
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,422
ELLIE: So Don and I,

966
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,383
we decided we'd take a
drive to the country,

967
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,510
and we came to this open field. Remember?

968
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,053
We parked there, we went for a walk.

969
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,805
And it was so wonderful.

970
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:13,931
It was sunset.

971
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:16,016
Do you remember that, Don? Sweet.

972
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,269
And we came across this gorgeous pond.

973
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:23,983
And he proposed to me
as the sun kind of went down.

974
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:27,361
DON: I was...
I was sneaking out here on Saturday

975
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,821
while she was
spending time with her folks, and...

976
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,446
Yeah, but I knew what you were up to.

977
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,532
Believe me, I knew what he was up to.

978
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,783
- Oh, you?
- I did.

979
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:33,993
You didn't have a clue.

980
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,619
- What are you talking about?
- You were clueless.

981
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:36,704
He spent three months

982
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,163
searching the entire New
England countryside

983
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,455
for the most beautiful spot,

984
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,257
and when he found it,
he took her back there.

985
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,459
And then when he proposed...

986
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:44,003
He planted...

988
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,843
And then they built a house over the years

989
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,469
under the shade of the
tree, and added on to it

990
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,725
every time Don
sold another sculpture, until, well...

00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,814

Oh, yes, of course.

997
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,199
Will you please excuse me, just for...

00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,077
- Jared!

Yeah, sure.

1004
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,503
Please. May I take you to the restroom,

Oh, my God.

1020
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,058
So, the thing to remember
is that men are like pumpkins,

1021
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,351
the good ones are either taken

1022
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,477
or they've had everything scraped

1023

What's happening in here?

Well, Nuria and I
have become very close friends.

1028
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,572
Yes. She was just explaining to me.

1029
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,699
- Really?
BOTH: - Mmm-hmm.

1030
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,038
Wish I had been adopted.

1031

Can we please just elope now?

Seems like the lesser
of two evils at this point.

1033

Really? Because I'm pretty sure
Vegas is just back that way.

wouldn't survive the trip.

- Why?

Well, yeah. We'll take a steam
when we get back to the house.

you have a steam in the guest room?

00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,638
ELLIE: No offense, Lyla, but honestly.

1057
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,516
Really, you did leave him.

1058
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,643
Yeah, he doesn't have
to make it so easy for me.

1059
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,396
You think he'll show up at the wedding?

1060
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:50,772
He does, I'll tell him
to fuck the fuck off.

1061
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,399
- Language.
ELLIE: - Oh, Lyla.

1062
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,568
He said terrible things to me.

1063
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,695
- Punch him in the nose?
- Of course not.

1064
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,572
Because that would be unladylike.

1065
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,866
What are you looking at me for?

1066
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:04,953
You miss him.

1067
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,582
A little.

1068
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:11,335
That's what I thought.
Look, just give him a call.

1069
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,128
I can't.

1070
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,733
So, I was thinking
we could maybe go to my room,

1071
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,778
listen to some music, or you know...

1072
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:39,696
Whatever.

1073
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,573
No, thank you.

1074
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,701
But you may read me
some poetry, if you wish.

1075
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:46,662
Poetry?

1076
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:47,913
Yes.

1077
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,705
Are you serious?

1078
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:51,833
Yes. Your mother was very informative.

1079
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,711
I deserve to be treated with respect.

1080
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,633
Don't we all.

1081
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:00,716
MISSY: Say it louder.

1082
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,237
ALEJANDRO: I'm an idiot.
MISSY: A what?

1083
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:06,431
I'm a galactic idiot.
My idiocracy knows no bounds.

1084
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:10,310
You won't tell a tiny white lie to a priest
that you'll never see again,

1085
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,562
but make a complete farce of our wedding?

1086
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,729
- I know.
- That's no problem?

1087
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,731
I know.

1088
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,234
I feel so bad for Bebe.

1089
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,903
You know how many months she and my
mom have been planning this.

1090
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:23,407
I know. I know. I'm an idiot.

1091
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,914
I did talk with Father Moinighan, though.

1092
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,666
For reals?

1093
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,751
I promised that little

1094
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,878
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

1095
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:40,257
would grow up ravenous
for the sweet baby Jesus.

1096
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,341
Did you?

1097
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,094
May have had crossies when I said it.

1098
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,556
Thank you.

1099
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:50,726
You really truly love me.

1100
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:51,768
I do.

1101
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,396
Yeah, you do.

1102
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,277
And you'll fix all the other stuff?

1103
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,778
What's it worth to you?

1104
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:03,572
Huh?

1105
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,115
You honestly think...

1106
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,791
It's too bad I'm saving
myself for marriage.

1107
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,752
I'll see you tomorrow.

1108
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,796
I'm busy tomorrow.

1109
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,799
MISSY: All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah."

1110
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,886
ELLIE: So, you know, call her again.

1111
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,348
I tried, but she had the
front desk lock me out.

1112
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,769
Tell me again how this is my fault.

1113
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,810
Don.

1114
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,931
WOMAN: (ON TV)
<i>...in a year. Many of these children...</i>

1115
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,299
DON: Now, where'd you dig that up?

1116
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,400
Oh, my God, I can't
believe how tiny he was.

1117
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,485
Yeah.

1118
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,487
Sometimes I wonder

1119
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,155
if we did the right thing.

1120
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:47,115
Ellie, for two people
who did a lot of things wrong,

1121
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,742
adopting AI wasn't one of them.

1122
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,702
Yeah, he's the kindest of us all.

1123
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,787
Yeah.

1124
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,623
We didn't do that
many things that were wrong, did we?

1125
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,042
Everybody's happy now.

1126
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,293
- Well...
- Right?

1127
00:47:58,377 --> 00:47:59,753
(STAMMERS) Yeah, right.

1128
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,297
Kids are great.
You're having nine-hour orgasms.

1129
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,965
Uh... (LAUGHS)

1130
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,850
No, no, no, just... Yeah,
well, give or take.

1131
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,845
- I'm intrigued.
- Yeah, I'm stunned.

1132
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,846
- Prove it.
- You wish.

1133
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,849
- For old time's sake.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

1134
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:15,602
You know what,
I think the coast must be clear by now.

1135
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:16,770
Ooh.

1136
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:18,855
Good to see you, Ell.

1137
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,983
I think you said that already.

1138
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,947
- What the hell?
- Oh!

1139
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,824
- Ow!
- What are you doing?

1140
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:29,866
Oh!

1141
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,495
Shoot. You're gonna
wake Madonna, for God's sake.

1142
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,579
Shh.

1143
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:35,871
Ow!

1144
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,667
I have been reading sonnets. Out loud.

1145
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,876
Well, that's very romantic.

1146
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,878
So romantic for you, dear. What?

1147
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:46,007
I am 29 years old, and
I've finally, I mean, I...

1148
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,384
What?

1149
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,885
I can't believe
I'm getting cock-blocked by my own mother.

1150
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,013
I merely told her that
there are certain things

1151
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,889
that women should expect from a man

1152
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,560
before she just
jumps into bed with him. All right?

1153
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:00,772
Yeah, I know.
Don't you think it's kind of hard to...

1154
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:01,857
What?

1155
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,378
Send her flowers every day for a year

1156
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,040
when she goes back to Colombia on Monday.

1157
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,069
<i>C'est la guerre.</i>

1158
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,780
(GASPS) Oh...

1159
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:09,906
So sorry.

1160
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:11,907
Oh, my goodness.
Well, anyway, good night, sweetheart.

1161
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,076
Sweet dreams, of course.

1162
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,161
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1163
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:15,911
You suck. <i>Buenas noches.</i>

1164
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,747
ELLIE: <i>Buenas noches.</i>

1165
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,087
(GASPS) Oh!

1166
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,715
<i>Noches.</i>

1167
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,133
<i>Noches</i> again.

1168
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,511
(EXHALING)

1169
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,055
Oh! Back so soon?

1170
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,225
Oh, yeah.
The temptation was more than I could stand.

1171
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,934
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1172
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,312
Now you're talking.

1173
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,064
- Uh...
- Be gentle.

1174
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,066
(CHUCKLES)
- Or don't.

1175
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,361
Good night.

1176
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,573
- Good night? Says you.
- Yup.

1177
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,158
Oh, please. Come on, you
didn't really think

1178
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,243
that we'd go through with this, did you?

1179
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,828
No one ever died from dabbling.

1180
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,164
Uh-huh. Just our marriage.

1181
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,956
- Fair point.
- Yeah.

1182
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,293
But, you know,
I couldn't stand being ignored.

1183
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,879
I ignored you?

1184
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:09,508
You didn't need a soothsayer to know that
you were terrified of being alone with me.

1185
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,927
I'm sorry, Don. Really, lam.

1186
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,095
Just, you know, with the children gone,

1187
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,474
I guess I didn't think
we had much in common anymore.

1188
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah, so we picked up another kid
to avoid the issue.

1189
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,564
You know, I tried to stick it out.
I really did.

1190
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:25,982
I know you did, Don.

1191
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,195
Wanna fool around?

1192
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,821
(LAUGHS) Oh!

1193
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,450
You need to marry Bebe.

1194
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,869
And that's nothing you don't already know.

1195
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,996
And what about you?
Anybody special since...

1196
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:41,997
Me?

1197
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:42,998
Yeah, of course.

1198
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,167
There have been guys here and there.

1199
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:47,504
Yeah. And I guess nothing
I'd write home about,

1200
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:48,964
nothing special.

1201
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,258
Well, I did date this local cop

1202
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,384
when I lived over on Courtesy.

1203
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,261
He was really quite nice.

1204
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:57,055
And then in New York City
I met this stock broker

1205
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,349
who actually proposed to me
on the third date.

1206
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,352
You know, that should have
been my first clue. God.

1207
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,563
But then...

1208
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:07,065
(SNORING)
(GROANS)

1209
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,037
(RHYTHMIC THUDDING)

1210
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,583
ELLIE: A little more left. Left. Oh!

1211
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,041
- Oh, yeah!
(DON GROANING)

1212
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,253
ELLIE: In there! That's right!
DON: Right there?

1213
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,088
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

1214
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,923
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1215
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,783
What happened to you?

1216
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,327
What time is it?

1217
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,637
A little after 8:00. I thought you quit?

1218
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:04,998
Thought I quit a lot of things. 8:00?

1219
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,626
So that would make it, hey...

1220
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,796
Forty minutes. Not bad for starters.

1221
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,300
Was that what that...

1222
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,012
You didn't. Oh, tell me you didn't.

1223
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:23,141
You and Mom for 40, that's... You scumbags.

1224
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,476
Gross. What?

1225
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,354
- What about Bebe?
- I know.

1226
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,106
God, what is wrong with you?

1227
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:35,110

Look, I know we might never
see each other again, so,

1574
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,686
I thought maybe we'd toast to

1575
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,854
what was almost a beautiful friendship.

1576
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:52,940
Hmm.

1577
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,608
No, you know,

1578
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:57,151
your mother was the one that told me that

1579
01:09:57,152 --> 01:10:01,365
American women are more reserved
when it comes to their sexuality.

They're gonna be spectacular together.

I mean, what was I thinking?

What an idiot. I mean,
what is wrong with me?

No, there's nothing wrong with you.

At all, Bebe.

In fact, you know what
I've come to believe?

I believe you're the
sanest one of all of us.

- Oh, no.
- Yes.

1600
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,267
You don't have to say that. That's crazy.

1601

That doesn't make it any less true.

1604
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,152
probably one of the reasons

1605
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,529
that I found Don so attractive.

1606
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:25,407
Come on. You were in love with Don Griffin

1607
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,367
from the first time I introduced you

1608
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:28,744
at the Crabtree summer party.

1609
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,245
Was it that obvious?

1610
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,371
Yeah, to me.

1611
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,540
Well, then why didn't
you hit me with your car or something?

1612
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:36,251
Come on, you were my best friend.

1613

Oh, Bebe. It wasn't him.

1615
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,386
Oh, yeah, okay, so he was flirting,

1616
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,930

- Because...

I wanted to make sure I was over him.

And you know what? it turns out

1620
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:59,274
I've been over him for such a long time.

I want you to know something else.

I've always been happy

1623

that it was you he turned to.

1624
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:13,288
I told you I forgive you.

has had his penis in your mom.

stayed away from you for all these years?

ruin my marriage the same way.

I called him.

the best chance at a happy life.

1673

Because ultimately, and we're all selfish,
that gives me the best chance at a happy life.

you felt that you had to pick a side.

And I was okay with that.

1681
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,262

from an old douchebag like me.

mistakes along the way,

I did the best I could
to earn my place in all of your lives.

1694
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,025
You know, you can
be mad at me, not mad at me.

how I feel about you.

1744
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:59,259
<i>Here you go. Sorry for cutting in.</i>

1745
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,011
I just want to tell you something.

1746
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:03,638
Well, okay. We're all listening.

1747
01:18:04,014 --> 01:18:07,809
If I've learned anything about life,
it's that it's all but a dream.

1748
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,227
- Brilliant.
- And there's no wizard

1749
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:11,313
pulling levers behind a curtain,

1750
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:12,856
which means, as far as I can see,

1751
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:14,816
the only real use in loving someone

1752
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,194
is that it makes your life better.

1753
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:20,071
And my life would suck infinitely more
without you in it.

1754
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:21,698
CROWD: Aww!

1755
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:24,659
That's it?

1756
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:25,911
That's the truth.

1757
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:27,704
(ALL BOOING)

1758
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:31,458
Okay. Okay. I just have one answer for you.

1759
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:34,419
No, no, I did not ask you a question.

1760
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,670
The answer is yes.

1761
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:38,215
I did not ask him a question.

1762
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:42,469
Yes. Yes. Yes, I am a horse's ass.
Yes, I will ogle,

1763
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,137
but never again, other
than perhaps mentally,

1764
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:45,555
fondle another woman.

1765
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,681
And yes, I will embarrass you,

1766
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:49,142
and shock you, and often cause you

1767
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:50,685
to question every last reason in the world

1768
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:52,570
why you would ever love
me in the first place.

1769
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:53,688
- Yes.
- You...

1770
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:56,566
- Yeah?
- Think that I still love you?

1771
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,568
Really, you don't?

1772
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:03,697
- Keep going.
- Right, right. And yes,

1773
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:07,744
I would rather gouge out my eyeballs
with hot spoons than cause you pain again.

1774
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,830
And yes, I will keep you
on an alabaster pedestal.

1775
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:12,123
Words.

1776
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,709
And yes,

1777
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,296
I will love you and only you
for the rest of my life,

1778
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,714
if you will allow me

1779
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,132
(BOX CLICKS OPEN)

1780
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,304
the honor of becoming your husband.

1781
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:27,722
(GASPS)

1782
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,687
Where the fuck did you get that ring?

1783
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,608
I've had it around for a
while, six years or so.

1784
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:36,898
Six years?

1785
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:38,733
So, what do you say?

1786
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:40,485
Oh, what the hell.

1787
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,945
MOINIGHAN: That's the spirit.

1788
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,321
Okay then.

1789
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:46,658
By the power still vested in me,

1790
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:49,911
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1791
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:51,955
You may kiss the bride.

1792
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:55,041
(WHOOPING AND APPLAUSE)

1793
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,465
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1794
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,761
Wait a second.

1795
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:03,818
(CHUCKLES)

1796
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:11,825
(LAUGHING)

1797
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,578
You'll always love me.

1798
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,299
May I have this dance?

1799
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,638
Oh!

1800
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,308
ANDREW: Ooh, yeah.

1801
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,060
Oh! (LAUGHS)

1802
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:40,397
Ohh! Oh, Oh.

1803
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,232
Oh, some wedding, huh?

1804
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:43,441
It's my first two-fer.

1805
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:44,734
Yeah. Congratulations.

1806
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:45,819
You, too.

1807
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:49,030
Yeah. You know, you were right.

1808
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,116
About what?

1809
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:54,077
There are different kinds of love.

1810
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,871
Which one are you feeling now?

1811
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,873
(EXHALES) All Of them.

1812
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,262
Whoo!

1813
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,901
DON: <i>Welcome to the family, baby Jane.</i>

1814
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:30,822
<i>Lesson one, your grandmothers are all nuts.</i>
