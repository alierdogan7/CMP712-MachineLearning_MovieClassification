Welcome to Sheffield...

2
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:54,236
the beating heart of Britain's
industrial North.

3
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,800
The jewel
in Yorkshire's crown...

4
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,835
is home to over
half a million people...

5
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,111
and thousands more flock here
daily to shop and to work.

6
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:07,810
All this is built on Sheffield's
primary industry--steel.

7
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:12,515
The city's rolling mills,
forges, and workshops...

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,223
employ some 90,000 men and
state-of-the-art machinery...

9
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,027
to make
the world's finest steel--

10
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:22,229
from high-tensile girders
to the stainless cutlery...

11
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:24,328
that ends up
on your dining table.

12
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,537
But it's not all hard work
for the people of Steel City.

13
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,136
They can spend the day
lounging by the pool...

14
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,908
watching
one of our top soccer teams...

15
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:35,745
or browsing in the shops.

16
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:43,520
But when the sun goes down,
the fun really starts...

17
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:46,822
in the city's numerous
nightclubs and discotheques.

18
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,319
yes, Yorkshire  folk
know how to have a good time...

19
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:53,697
and it's good times
for the city's housing, too.

20
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:56,100
Sheffield
leads the way in town planning.

21
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,695
Victorian slums
have been cleared...

22
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:00,138
to make way
for the homes of the future.

23
