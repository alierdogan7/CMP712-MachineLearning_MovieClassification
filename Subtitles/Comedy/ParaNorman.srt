They hurt me.

1234
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,130
So, you hurt them back?

1235
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,898
I wanted everyone to see
how rotten they were.

1236
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,665
You're just like them, Agatha.

1237
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,232
No, I'm not!

1238
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,299
You're a bully!

1239
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,505
No, I'm not!

1240
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:21,839
Ahh!

1241
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,266
They did something awful,

1242
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,810
but that doesn't
mean you should, too.

1243
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,107
All that's left in you now
is mean and horrible!

1244
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,408
That's not true!

1245
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,541
Then stop! This is wrong
and you know it!

1246
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,676
You spent so long
remembering the bad people

1247
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,517
that you've forgotten
the good ones.

1248
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,114
There must have been somebody who
loved you and cared for you.

1249
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,318
You don't remember them?

1250
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,621
Leave me alone!

1251
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,357
But you're not alone!
You have to remember!

1252
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,727
Keep away from me!

1253
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:12,822
Remember!

1254
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,519
Aggie.

1255
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,953
My name was Aggie.

1256
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,904
I remember,

1257
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,464
my mommy
brought me here once.

1258
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,875
We sat under the tree
and she told me stories.

1259
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,746
They all had
happy endings.

1260
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,813
And then those horrible men
came and took me away,

1261
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,754
and I never
saw her again!

1262
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,348
(GASPS)

1263
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,621
(SOBS)

1264
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,363
Sometimes when
people get scared,

1265
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,903
they say and do
terrible things.

1266
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,864
I think you
got so scared

1267
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,930
that you forgot
who you are.

1268
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:34,877
But I don't think you're a witch.
Not really.

1269
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,006
You don't?

1270
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:41,244
I think you're just a little
kid with a really special gift

1271
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,949
who only ever wanted
people to understand her.

1272
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,560
So, we're not all
that different at all.

1273
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,931
But what about
the people who hurt you?

1274
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,695
Don't you ever want
to make them suffer?

1275
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,629
Well, yeah, but what
good would that do?

1276
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,771
You think just because
there's bad people out there,

1277
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,334
that there's no
good ones either?

1278
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,644
I thought the same
thing for a while,

1279
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,809
but there's always someone
out there for you,

1280
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,015
somewhere.

1281
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,522
I just want my mommy.

1282
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,393
I'm sorry, Aggie.

1283
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,733
She's gone.

1284
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:34,437
That story you were telling,
how does it end?

1285
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,343
I think that's up to you.

1286
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,814
Is this where
they buried me?

1287
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,489
It's a pretty
good place to sleep.

1288
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,964
Then you can be
with your mom again.

1289
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,598
(SIGHS)

1290
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:24,616
Sleep tight.

1291
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,846
Norman?

1292
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,819
Norman!

1293
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,857
My brave little man!

1294
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:34,086
I thought I was going to lose you.
(KISSING)

1295
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,390
Mom! You're embarrassing me.

1296
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,431
That's my job.
COURTNEY: Psst.

1297
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,791
Good job, Norman.

1298
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,768
Well done, son.
You did it.

1299
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:58,076
So, are we going
to need statements?

1300
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,517
No!
Ow! That was my fingernail.

1301
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:04,547
You know what it's like. You join a
mob and you say things. (CHUCKLES)

1302
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,456
I was merely
inhabiting the role.

1303
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,655
Yeah, it was the others.
They pushed me into it.

1304
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,427
Yeah, me and Norman are in
a lot of the same classes.

1305
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,661
We're pretty much
inseparable best buds,

1306
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,898
and we do a lot of psychic
investigations together.

1307
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,668
We have a blog, actually.
You should check it out.

1308
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,904
So, I was thinking maybe we
could catch a movie sometime.

1309
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,411
Nothing scary.

1310
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,675
That sounds great, Kathy.

1311
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,240
You know, you're going
to love my boyfriend.

1312
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,843
He's, like,
a total chick-flick nut!

1313
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,787
Hey, Neil.

1314
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,490
You did it! You stopped
the witch's curse,

1315
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:49,194
and made the zombies go away and
saved pretty much everything!

1316
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:50,429
I guess.

1317
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,938
I just wanted
to say thanks.

1318
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,440
You stood by me,
all the time.

1319
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:58,671
Yeah, of course!
Don't get weird or anything.

1320
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:02,305
So, do you think now everything
is going to turn back to normal?

1321
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:05,045
Well, as normal
as it could be.

1322
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,113
(SCREAMS)
Oh!

1323
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,245
Stop it!

What are you watching?

is she?

1335
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,577
Right.
Of course she is.

1336
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,843
Is she, uh... Is she, uh,
