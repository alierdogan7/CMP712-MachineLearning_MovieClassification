1
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,108
I've got the vibes.

2
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:44,632
This thing is evil,
Man.

3
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,009
I got a bad feeling.

4
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,707
Shut up and keep moving.

5
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,773
Is big mistake.

6
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:51,612
Let it go, Man.

7
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,210
We set it down,
And we let it go.

8
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:56,116
Aah!

9
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,387
It's only a bloody monkey,
For christ's sake.

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,422
Now pick it up.

11
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:10,426
Listen,

12
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,164
You no pick up the cage,

13
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:15,435
You no get
The big dollars.

14
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:16,566
Ooh!
Grr!

15
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,042
Holy shit!

16
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,545
Don't move!

17
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:29,247
What are these buggers
Playing at?

18
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,288
He says that that monkey
Must be set free.

19
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,388
He says we must leave
This valley

20
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,193
And never return,

21
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:43,565
Or the evil spirits
Will exact their revenge.

22
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:44,330
Permit.

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,304
Look and see. Permit.

24
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,329
Permit!

25
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,136
Aah!

26
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,076
I'm a new zealand
Zoo official,

27
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,918
And this monkey is going
To new town.

28
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,291
No.

29
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,626
Oh! Aah! Aah!

30
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,655
No!

31
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,926
Move it!

32
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,628
Aah!

33
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:40,715
Start her up! Quick!

34
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,628
Hey!

35
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,864
Wait!

36
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,897
Drive, You buggers!

37
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,474
Ow!

38
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,567
Man, Wait.

39
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,805
Step on it!

40
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,836
Aah!

41
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,009
Ow!

42
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,853
The little bugger bit me.

43
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,729
Zingaya.

44
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,757
Zingaya!

45
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:30,305
You've got the bite.

46
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:36,338
There's... There's some
Dettol in the jeep.

47
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,841
Aw, Jeez! No!

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,247
No! What are you doing?!

49
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,381
Aah!

50
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:50,294
Aah!

51
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,320
Zingaya.

52
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,363
Oh, Jee... Oh!

53
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,493
Aah! Oh!

54
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,264
Oh! Oh! Aah!

55
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,295
Zingaya!

56
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,330
Aah!

57
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,285
N...

58
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,681
Thank you.

59
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,021
HI, Paquita.

60
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:37,051
Good morning, Roger.

61
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:40,960
That's the lot.

62
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,365
Tell your dad I'll be
Round on thursday

63
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,394
With the saveloys.

64
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:54,135
That's a pretty dress,
Paquita.

65
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:01,309
See you later,
Alligator.

66
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:09,650
You like that boy,
Paquita?

67
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,223
Shuffle the cards.

68
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,107
We will see
If you and roger

69
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,008
Are destined
To be together.

70
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:28,407
Create his image
In your mind

71
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,348
And cut the cards.

72
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:31,940
Paquita,

73
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,747
I thought we'd seen
The last of this.

74
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:38,779
Whenever he come,
You start over again.

75
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,417
This...

76
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,452
Is you.

77
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,966
And this...

78
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,866
Is the man
Of your future.

79
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,167
But he doesn't look
Like roger.

80
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,197
It is not roger.

81
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:04,114
There will be
One romance,

82
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,949
And it shall last
Forever.

83
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,317
Romance. Puh.

84
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:10,616
What about money?

85
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,786
This man will enter
Your life...

86
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,191
In the near future.

87
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,890
And you will become...

88
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,900
Romantically entangled
With him

89
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,835
Almost immediately.

90
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,666
But who is it?

91
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:30,368
You will recognize
This man...

92
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,274
By the symbol...

93
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,370
Of the star...

94
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,405
And of the moon.

95
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,482
What is this?

96
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,986
Oh! No, Not that one.

97
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,851
Paquita,
We have a customer.

98
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,392
It is bad, Yes?

99
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,987
Oh, Nothing.

100
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,021
Paquita!

101
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:13,541
Uh, Just dropping off
Our order.

102
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,044
Um...

103
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,456
Mum says to pack
The biscuits on top,

104
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:24,258
Because she doesn't
Want any broken.

105
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,526
Uh, Actually...

106
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,558
I'll take
One of these now.

107
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,367
Sorry.

108
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,407
Santa maria.

109
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,255
Ooh.

110
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,287
I better be off,
Then.

111
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,297
Oh!

112
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,983
Woman: Lionel!

113
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,155
Lionel!

114
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,928
Woman on radio:
Good morning, Everybody.

115
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,459
Morning, Everybody.
Well, Now I'd like...

116
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,131
There's a beetle.

117
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:41,798
Eh?

118
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,604
There. Under the fridge.

119
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,476
Horrid little creature
Scuttled right in front of me.

120
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,605
I thought I told you
To spray this house!

121
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,980
The place is infested
With vermin.

122
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:57,011
I'll get on it
Straight away, Mum.

123
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,180
Lionel!

124
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,355
You'll be pleased
To know

125
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:05,852
That your mother has been
Voted treasurer elect

126
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,058
Of the w.L.W. L...

127
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,433
The wellington ladies
Welfare league.

128
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,267
Ah, That's great, Mum.

129
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,499
And on friday,

130
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,870
The president
Nora matheson

131
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:19,035
Is dropping by to offer
Her congratulations.

132
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,046
Wow. The president.

133
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,445
Oh, God!

134
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:28,419
Look at the state
Of this place!

135
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,354
All the windows
Will have to be polished.

136
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,381
Woman on radio: Whiter,
Brighter, Cleaner wash.

137
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,858
Look at this dust!

138
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,451
It's an inch thick!

139
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,258
You'll have to do
The silver.

140
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,662
I polished it
Last week.

141
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,394
And the drapes
Need cleaning.

142
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,664
Woman on radio:
Once a week, Once a month...

143
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,260
Ohh!

144
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:45,997
I just mowed
The lawn.

145
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,767
Does this look like
A well-Maintained frontage?

146
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,798
Woman on radio: Very often
After drying the dishes...

147
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,521
Whoa! Aah!

148
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,285
Ooh. Ugh.

149
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,687
Get up,
You stupid dog.

150
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,423
Here,
I'll help you.

151
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,397
No. I manage.

152
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,493
Your brother usually does
The deliveries.

153
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,528
Not today.

154
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:32,840
Ohh. Is big house.

155
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,148
You live here always?

156
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,018
Yeah.

157
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,421
You like my dog?

158
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,325
Is very big, Yes?

159
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,728
Any bigger,
And he'd belong in a zoo.

160
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,732
Zoo? Pardon?

161
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,233
Zoo. You know.

162
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,928
Uh... Animals.

163
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:51,958
Cages.

164
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:52,833
Ahh!

165
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,338
Claro.

166
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,341
I like to go with zoo.

167
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,639
I go with the zoo?

168
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,009
Oh, No. No, No.

169
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,674
You want to go
To the zoo.

170
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,707
Yes, Please.

171
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,776
Ohh.

172
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,613
Oh, Ok.

173
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,647
Tomorrow?

174
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,592
I'll meet you outside
The shop.

175
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,623
Ok.

176
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,998
I have to go.

177
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,784
My jardiniere.
It's shattered.

178
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,514
Ah, Mum,
That was your favorite.

179
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,022
It wouldn't have happened
If you'd dusted carefully.

180
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,956
I can get you another one.

181
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,789
It's irreplaceable.

182
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,795
A present
From your father.

183
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,024
Our last
Wedding anniversary.

184
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,292
Before...

185
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:58,132
He was taken from us.

186
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,160
Ohh.

187
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,066
I miss him, Too.

188
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,100
Ohh.

189
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,066
Oh.

190
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,092
Look.

191
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,602
Cary grant.
He is such a dream.

192
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,870
I wish I could be
Grace kelly.

193
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,672
She is so pretty.

194
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,704
Such beautiful
Blond hair.

195
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,083
Lionel?

196
00:14:57,662 --> 00:15:00,654
What is wrong?

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,467
Ohh.

198
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,196
Uh, Sorry.

199
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:06,464
Um...

200
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,995
When I was young,
I was at the beach,

201
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
And I...

202
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,640
I nearly drowned

203
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,873
When I fell off
This pier.

204
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,872
Uh, My dad dived in
To save me, But...

205
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,886
As he was climbing out,
This...

206
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,286
Freak wave just...

207
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:27,621
Washed him out to sea,
And...

208
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,651
He drowned.

209
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,773
Oh, The little monkeys!

210
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,799
Look, Lionel.

211
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,286
Oh!
Oh!

212
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,394
There! For you!

213
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,424
Oh!

214
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,966
Ohh.

215
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,737
Poor little bugger.

216
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:06,047
You get out of there,
You vicious little shit!

217
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:13,059
Reckon they're only found
On one island, You know?

218
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,226
Story goes,
These great big rats...

219
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,430
Come scuttling off
The slave ships...

220
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:24,465
And raped all
The little tree monkeys.

221
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:25,509
You know,

222
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,512
The natives use them
In black magic rituals.

223
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:29,570
Really?

224
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:30,842
Yeah.

225
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:31,712
Don't ask me how.

226
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,777
Probably suck the blood
Of virgins, Eh? Eh?

227
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,812
I want to sit down.

228
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,782
Wow.

229
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,120
Mmm.

230
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,862
Oh! Oh.

231
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,564
Aah!

232
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,601
Aah! Aaaaah!

233
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,645
Mum?

234
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,376
Aah! Aah! Aah!

235
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,407
Aah!

236
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,843
Ew.

237
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,622
Ew.

238
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,691
Ohh.

239
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,897
Mum!

240
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,666
Holy shit!

241
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,336
Look at this.
It bit me.

242
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,902
I've been savaged.

243
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,471
And my dress.

244
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:39,779
Here. I help you.

245
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,809
Oh!

246
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,179
Lionel...

247
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:48,315
Take me home.

248
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,884
Uh...

249
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,737
There you are, Vera.

250
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,009
Now you just rest up.

251
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,141
I'll be back
In a couple of days

252
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,650
To change
That dressing.

253
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,811
Thanks,
Nurse mctavish.

254
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,115
It's all right,
Lionel.

255
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:20,147
I'll see myself out.

256
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:29,863
Why have you
Deliberately

257
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:33,632
Gone out of your way
To upset me?

258
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,663
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:42,169
It won't happen again.

260
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,953
I don't deserve
All this attention, Darling.

261
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,089
If you need anything
During the night,

262
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,291
You just call.

263
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,391
You're so good to me.

264
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:06,426
Good night, Mum.

265
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,614
Lionel!

266
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,952
Hello!

267
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,022
Shh!

268
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,190
Keep your voice down.

269
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,097
Look.
I have your jacket.

270
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,193
Yeah.
I'll get it tomorrow.

271
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,227
What?

272
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,130
Look.

273
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,222
Ooh.

274
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,247
Oh!

275
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,784
It could've waited
Till the morning.

276
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,729
Is that all
You have to say?

277
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:07,321
Ohh.

278
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:11,927
Look, I'm really sorry
About the zoo, Paquita.

279
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,870
It's just mum.

280
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,167
She's...

281
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,935
You know.

282
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,307
We go out again?

283
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,641
To a movie?

284
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:21,940
Look...

285
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,471
I'd like to...

286
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:28,508
But it's not...
It's just not possible.

287
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,542
Not possible?

288
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:32,488
But we are romantically
Entangled.

289
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:33,990
Entangled?

290
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,458
Oh, Look...

291
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:38,018
Look, I don't know
What you're thinking,

292
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:39,654
But, Um...

293
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:43,690
I just can't see you
Anymore.

294
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,012
Ohh.

295
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,042
Oh, Paquita.

296
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,697
There will be
One romance...

297
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:23,730
And it shall last
Forever.

298
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,272
Ohh!

299
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,559
Ohh, Wow.

300
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,933
Mum, What a beautiful day.

301
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,315
Ohh.

302
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,429
I'm gonna call
Nurse mctavish.

303
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,593
No. You'll do
No such thing.

304
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,103
I'm perfectly
All right.

305
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,129
But...

306
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:06,700
You look after me,
Lionel.

307
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:14,811
Nora matheson.

308
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:18,845
Ladies welfare league.

309
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:24,851
Your mother's
Expecting us.

310
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:28,697
The mathesons are here.

311
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,468
No, Mum.
You're not well!

312
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:37,497
Get my dress!

313
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,280
Oh.

314
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:44,713
Jeez.

315
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,444
Please go back to bed,
Mum.

316
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,748
I'll put them off.
It's only the mathesons.

317
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:51,778
It's the w.L.W.L.

318
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:00,595
Oh.

319
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:01,529
Sorry.

320
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:10,063
Careful.
It'll stick on crooked.

321
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:11,802
Ok.

322
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,176
Our...

323
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,414
Main objective
Next year,

324
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:24,682
Is to...

325
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,213
Get the younger
Generation

326
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,691
Involved
In the league.

327
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,387
That's why
I'm so pleased

328
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,558
That you're on
The committee.

329
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,591
Thank you, Nora.

330
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,828
It's a great... Honor.

331
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,505
H- Have you had
Any thoughts

332
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,274
On the agenda for
The annual meeting?

333
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:52,305
Annual meeting.

334
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,942
Annual meeting.

335
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,246
Ann...

336
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,018
Ann...

337
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,356
What we need's
Another war!

338
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,390
Yes, Dear.

339
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:13,762
I hear
Sir edmund hillary's

340
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:18,036
Planning an attempt
On the south pole.

341
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,235
Right you go.

342
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:24,271
Have some more beans,
Mrs. Matheson.

343
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:26,310
I'll have
A few of those, Lad.

344
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,841
I really think
We should be going.

345
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:31,878
Thank you, Lionel.

346
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,249
What?

347
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,259
No pudding?

348
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,558
Only custard,
I'm afraid.

349
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:38,960
Custard!

350
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:42,056
I haven't had
A good custard in years.

351
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,092
She never
Makes the stuff.

352
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,540
Damn fine custard.

353
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,590
Mmm.

354
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,620
Rich and creamy,
Just the way I like it.

355
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,814
Touchy on
The old food front, Eh?

356
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,184
Never mind.

357
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:44,194
That was
A fine meal, Boy.

358
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:48,221
Thank you,
Mr. Matheson.

359
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,641
Lionel!

360
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,508
What's wrong?

361
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:05,003
Lionel,
You must listen to me.

362
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:10,043
Dark forces are amassing
Against you.

363
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:13,356
My grandmama has seen it.

364
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,157
Say, "The path ahead
Is one of fear

365
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,355
And great danger."

366
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,557
Eh?

367
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,793
Fernando!

368
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,598
Paquita, Wait!

369
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,335
God, Mum.

370
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,355
Oh, Fernando.

371
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,728
Your mother ate my dog!

372
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,761
Not all of it.

373
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,666
Aah!

374
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,852
Get nurse mctavish, Quick.

375
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:41,770
Ohh.

376
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:44,781
How long has your mother
Been like this?

377
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,544
Since this morning.

378
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,246
Oh. I'll call
An ambulance.

379
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:54,053
You pack some things
For the hospital.

380
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,958
I'll do it.

381
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,298
Nurse mctavish.

382
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,813
Your mother's dead,
Lionel.

383
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,996
I'm sorry, Lionel.

384
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,032
There was nothing
We could do.

385
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:53,212
She loved you very much.

386
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:20,366
Which toothbrush?

387
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:21,576
Lionel!

388
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,079
Your mother's
Toothbrush...

389
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:26,571
The white one
Or green one?

390
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,608
Green!

391
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:36,791
Man on radio: Mother.

392
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,294
You are looking well today.

393
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,263
Woman on radio:
I woke up this morning,

394
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,991
How about
A nice cup of tea?

395
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:48,493
I'll just put the jug on.

396
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,203
Sorry, Mother. That
Was your favorite teapot.

397
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:55,404
It slipped
Out of me hand.

398
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,438
Never mind that.

399
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,611
Aah!

400
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,992
Paquita: Jacket,
Nightgown, Slippers,

401
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,019
And toothbrush.

402
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:50,495
Where's your mother?

403
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,593
She's gone to hospital.

404
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:53,125
Oh.

405
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,536
I didn't hear
The ambulance.

406
00:32:55,572 --> 00:32:57,005
No, No.

407
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,140
Um...

408
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:00,575
No, Uh...

409
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,341
She went
In nurse mctavish's car.

410
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,439
Sort of, Uh, Well,

411
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,848
Sort of Iying across
The back seat, Really.

412
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:13,881
Yeah. Her and nurse mctavish.
Off to hospital.

413
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,491
But her night bag?

414
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,518
I'll take that.

415
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,932
Man on radio:
So, It's you

416
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,732
Who've been poaching
My rabbits.

417
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:28,294
Lionel.

418
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:29,327
Man on radio:
I've a good mind

419
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,898
To let you have it
With both barrels.

420
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:33,170
Second man on radio:
It weren't me, Sir.

421
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,179
It were that johnny
Morris what did it.

422
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:36,872
Well, I go now.

423
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,212
Man on radio: You just be
On your way, Young lad.

424
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:41,945
If I see you here again,

425
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:45,978
I'll give you what for.

426
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,120
What do you want?

427
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:29,689
You're not
From the immigration?

428
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,598
I told you people

429
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:35,196
I lost
My bloody papers, Ok?

430
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,800
My family left latvia

431
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,434
During the occupation.

432
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:44,004
We were hunted
Like dogs.

433
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:48,040
I just want to buy some...

434
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:49,242
Sedatives.

435
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:52,881
What do you think I am,
A goddamn doctor?

436
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,916
I don't sell sedatives.

437
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:02,188
Tranquilizers,
I do have.

438
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,735
Do you want
A syringe,

439
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:16,769
Or are you
Going to sniff?

440
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,832
Aah!

441
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:08,981
Oh, Lionel,
I am happy to see you.

442
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:14,320
Tell me about these...

443
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,690
Dark forces.

444
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,961
Death surrounds him.

445
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,304
There will be torment

446
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,242
And suffering.

447
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:30,269
You are marked.

448
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,174
Lionel.

449
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,988
Lionel, If something
Is wrong, I can...

450
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:45,017
Nothing's wrong, Ok?

451
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:58,307
It contains the power
Of the white light.

452
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,778
It will protect you.

453
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,805
Keep it with you always.

454
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:12,884
How is your mother?

455
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,582
Oh, Fine.

456
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:18,890
They want to keep her in
Hospital for a few more days.

457
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,920
Bye.

458
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,832
Aah!

459
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:49,281
She ran
Right in front of me.

460
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:56,322
They must have
Discharged her early.

461
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:04,237
It was
A dreadful shock,

462
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:05,969
Losing vera
Like that.

463
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,204
Had lunch with her
Only last friday.

464
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,303
Picture of health.

465
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,678
That boy of hers,
Where is he?

466
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:12,113
Fine lad.

467
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,243
Lionel called half a dozen
Times in the last 2 days.

468
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,049
Very keen
To view the remains.

469
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:19,783
Of course,
I had to put him off.

470
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,381
It would have been
Far too distressing.

471
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:25,225
As it is, It's been a damn
Difficult embalming job.

472
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,492
Oh, My god.
Excuse me.

473
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,851
I can tell
You're not a cosgrove.

474
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:53,185
You're far
Too good looking.

475
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,155
Pardon?

476
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,317
Les is the name.

477
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,350
I'm lionel's u...

478
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,560
Lionel's uncle.

479
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:04,260
And who might you be?

480
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,294
Paquita maria sanchez.

481
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,069
Latin, Eh?

482
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,440
Excuse me, Father.

483
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,569
I am looking
For lionel.

484
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:15,168
I haven't seen him.

485
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,543
And if he's not here
In 10 minutes,

486
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,606
His mother will be delivered
Into the hands of the lord

487
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:22,641
In his absence.

488
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,511
Mortician: You idiot.

489
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,678
I told you to stay in there.

490
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,716
The embalming machine
Should be turned off.

491
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,087
Oh, Great!
Blowout!

492
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,473
Mortician:
You're a half-Wit.

493
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,873
This is coming
Off your wages.

494
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,172
I'll fix them up.

495
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:21,677
No, Leave it.

496
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:27,707
We've got to get the body
To the service.

497
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,458
The theme of
Today's service

498
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,491
Is the sanctity
Of motherhood.

499
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,993
Vera cosgrove
Will be surely missed

500
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,803
By her friends
And grieving family,

501
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:54,435
For she was indeed
A fine woman,

502
00:41:54,477 --> 00:42:00,040
And everything a boy
Could wish for in a mother.

503
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,414
Father mcgruder: Lionel...

504
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:04,614
Though deprived of his father
At an early age,

505
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:09,023
Was blessed with an abundance
Of mother love.

506
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,028
Father mcgruder:
Though our dear ones depart,

507
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,587
They live on in our hearts
And memories

508
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:18,863
Until,
In the fullness of time,

509
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,133
We, Too, Depart
From this world...

510
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,336
Until we are reunited
Once again.

511
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:30,176
A christian spirit
Is eternal.

512
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:36,209
Yea, Whosoever believeth
In the lord jesus christ

513
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:39,378
Shall be...

514
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:46,285
Resurrected.

515
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,406
Poor lionel.

516
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:05,937
He was always dreadfully
Attached to his mother.

517
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:08,450
Well, I've seen some displays
Of grief in my day,

518
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,478
But nothing
Quite like that.

519
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,551
Do you need anything?

520
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,586
I'm fine.

521
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,266
I called
To see you yesterday,

522
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,325
But you didn't
Answer the door.

523
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:31,364
I just want to be left
Alone for a while, Ok?

524
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,006
At least he's
Well provided for.

525
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,173
Yes, Well, The cosgroves
Were hardly paupers.

526
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:43,208
He'll be the sole
Beneficiary.

527
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:32,231
Hey, Guys.

528
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:35,260
Look what I found.

529
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:38,737
What are you doing
With this thing?

530
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:41,369
Digging up a few stiffs?

531
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,639
L...
Shut up!

532
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,546
You know
What you are?

533
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,550
A bloody sicko.

534
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,576
Yeah, Mean talk.

535
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:57,783
Get his wallet.

536
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:08,093
That's my mother
You're pissing on.

537
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:18,771
It's a zombie!

538
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,806
Aah!

539
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:39,801
Aah!

540
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,463
Mom, No!

541
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:59,745
What in god's name
Is going on here?

542
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:17,470
The devil is amongst us.

543
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,475
Stay back, Boy.

544
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:23,468
This calls
For divine intervention.

545
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,504
Yaaaaaah!

546
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,483
I kick ass for the lord!

547
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:35,707
Aah!

548
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,810
No!

549
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:42,147
Aah!

550
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,993
There you are, Mum.

551
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,647
Void.

552
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:41,673
Use the spoon.

553
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,150
Ohh!

554
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:07,900
Arrrrrr!

555
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,241
Ohh.

556
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:22,991
Hey, Hey.

557
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,789
Cut that out.

558
00:49:26,996 --> 00:49:28,987
Shh.

559
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,570
How's it going, Lionel?

560
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,542
Uh...

561
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,807
Come on, Mate.

562
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,939
I'm dying for a slash.

563
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,314
I've got a urinary infection.

564
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:50,842
Christ, What a stink.

565
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,252
Yeah. Dog
Must have crawled

566
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:54,552
Under the house
And died.

567
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:54,885
Huh.

568
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:58,087
Can't have been easy for you
These past few weeks, Lionel,

569
00:49:58,127 --> 00:50:02,120
What, With your mother gone.

570
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,494
Uhh.

571
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:11,735
Who's that, Uh,

572
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:14,902
Little girl
You've been seeing?

573
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:16,036
What?

574
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,741
You know,
The little latin number

575
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,476
With the cute bum.

576
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:21,983
Lionel: Paquita.

577
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,576
Oh, Yeah, Paquita.

578
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:25,484
That's the one.

579
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:26,954
She's a bit of all right.

580
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,890
Wouldn't mind her
Doing the growl on me.

581
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,790
So...

582
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,894
All this is coming
Your way, Eh?

583
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,907
Of course, Uh...

584
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,909
Your mother
Was always intending

585
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,774
To leave me a bequest.

586
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:49,709
Oh.

587
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,269
Oh, Yes.

588
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,247
We talked about it
Many times.

589
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,909
It was a foregone
Conclusion, Really.

590
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,920
It's just, With her
Dying suddenly,

591
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:01,412
She didn't get the chance
To include me in her will.

592
00:51:01,457 --> 00:51:03,550
Well, You'll have
To talk to the lawyers

593
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,560
About it, Uncle les.

594
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,825
Don't bring the bloody
Lawyers into it.

595
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,560
This is a private
Family matter.

596
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,426
What the hell's that?

597
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,030
It's the pipes.

598
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,165
They do that sometimes.

599
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,367
It's not the pipes,
Lionel.

600
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:21,433
It's somebody
Doing the business.

601
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:23,741
Please, Uncle les,
You just gotta leave.

602
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,776
So you found your dad's
Old stag movies, Eh?

603
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,684
Yeah.

604
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:35,282
Father mcgruder:
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!

605
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:36,552
Is that the one
With the donkey

606
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:37,684
And the chambermaid?

607
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,627
No, Please.

608
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,425
All right.

609
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,261
I understand,
Lionel.

610
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,529
Some things
A man prefers

611
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:46,796
To do on his own.

612
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:52,497
It's all part
Of the grieving process.

613
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:03,575
Be seeing you, Lionel.

614
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,940
Man on radio: Nijinsky
Was of what nationality?

615
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:32,436
Second man on radio:
Nijinsky is russian.

616
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,847
Russian is right.
That's very good.

617
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:35,509
Um, 13.

618
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:39,544
Number 13,
He's going for.

619
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,956
Lionel!

620
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:10,619
I dropped a shilling.

621
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:11,847
It must have, Uh...

622
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,082
Rolled down the drain.

623
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:14,282
I come to see you,

624
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:15,950
You shut the door
In my face.

625
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,152
You built a big wall.

626
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,162
I telephone,
And you don't answer.

627
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,026
Why?

628
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:23,793
Speak to me.

629
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,530
You don't want
To see me anymore?

630
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,562
It was a mistake.

631
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,431
Sorry.

632
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:36,434
Good-Bye.

633
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:52,125
Paquita.

634
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:53,526
Leave me alone.

635
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:54,654
I'm sorry.

636
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:56,096
Leave me alone.

637
00:53:56,132 --> 00:54:01,126
Take your hands
Off her, You creep!

638
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,595
You know what they're saying
About you, Don't you?

639
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:06,233
You've gone funny
In the head.

640
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:09,108
A real bloody weirdo.

641
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:09,702
You touch her again,

642
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:12,646
And I'll knock you into
The middle of next week.

643
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,411
Come on, Paquita.

644
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,441
Ohh.

645
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,084
Ohh.

646
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,603
Hmm.

647
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,637
Ohh!

648
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,596
Ahh.

649
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:45,731
Cute.

650
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,766
Ahh.

651
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,901
Uhh! Aah!

652
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,985
Hello. Hello.

653
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,063
Oh, There's a cutie.

654
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:23,405
How's cute little selwyn
There?

655
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,437
Ow!

656
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:28,206
Ohh. Ohh.

657
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,242
Peekaboo.
Peekaboo.

658
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:53,598
Whee!

659
00:57:02,284 --> 00:57:04,275
Whee!

660
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:30,034
Aah!

661
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,241
So I said...

662
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,983
Yeah!

663
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:12,443
Hyperactive.

664
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,726
So, I tackled
This guy, Right?

665
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,856
I brought him down
This real bone cruncher.

666
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,389
And the ball rolls free,
So I scooped it up,

667
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,196
And you know what I did?

668
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:28,669
I drop-Kicked
From 50 yards out.

669
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:30,467
Ha ha! God, You
Should have seen it.

670
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:33,532
Put us 3 points ahead.
Gave us the match.

671
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,568
Fantastic.

672
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:52,185
Hello, Lionel.

673
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,889
That's quite
A collection

674
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:55,260
Of stiffs
You got down there.

675
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:58,266
And I thought you were
Such a quiet chappie.

676
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,894
Uncle les,
They're not what you think.

677
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:02,233
Back off, Mate!

678
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,329
Lay a hand on me,

679
00:59:03,372 --> 00:59:05,431
I'll have you
For breakfast.

680
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,077
I'm sorry, Lionel.

681
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:10,578
If I don't
Report this,

682
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:15,607
I'll be an accessory
After the fact.

683
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:23,484
I hope they can keep it
Out of the papers

684
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:24,822
For your mother's sake.

685
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,159
She always
Hated a scandal.

686
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,994
This is hard
For me, Lionel,

687
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:32,523
Informing on
Me sister's boy and all.

688
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,195
Of course, If I was
To keep me mouth shut,

689
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:35,897
I'd be taking
A hell of a risk.

690
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:40,637
Hey, Put me through
To the police, Please.

691
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:42,166
Of course,
If I was to, Uh,

692
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,339
Get my fair share
Of vera's estate,

693
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,643
I might be
More inclined

694
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:50,049
To protect a member
Of the family.

695
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,279
You want the money?

696
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,083
Speak to sergeant bauer.

697
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:58,116
I'd like to report
A multiple murder.

698
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:01,995
Yes, I'll wait.

699
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,024
The money and the house.

700
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:13,431
Blood is thicker
Than water, Lionel.

701
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,340
Yeah, G'day.

702
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:53,109
Les about?

703
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,479
Hey, You bastard!

704
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:55,448
Thought
We'd pop over

705
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:57,577
And take a squish
At your new digs.

706
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:58,381
Yeah, Mate. Why not?

707
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,183
Rip the skins off
A few brown ones.

708
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:01,519
Yeah. We'll make
A night of it.

709
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,581
Where are you going?

710
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:03,181
Just for a walk.

711
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,988
No, Mate. These people
Want a feast.

712
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:05,891
We'll get a party going.

713
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,896
Let's get
Some snacks, Mate.

714
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,228
You got real-Live
Stiffs here?

715
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:12,733
Man: Hey, Les, Let's
Stick some real music on.

716
01:01:12,768 --> 01:01:14,531
Oh, Yeah.
Comin' through, Buzzer.

717
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,868
Clear the dance floor.

718
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:17,894
I don't know
What sort

719
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,874
Of kinky shit
You're into,

720
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:24,902
But I want
Those things buried.

721
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,869
Come on, Babe.
Have a dance.

722
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,878
It's no good asking lionel.

723
01:01:56,912 --> 01:01:59,642
He's nothing
Like his old man.

724
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:00,909
He was a real stick man.

725
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:03,213
Used to pull the birds
Like you wouldn't believe.

726
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,117
Don't talk about
My father like that.

727
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:09,147
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Ho ho!

728
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,789
Mmm.

729
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:12,885
Tasty.

730
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:15,260
You got anything else
That I can, Uh,

731
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:16,025
Nibble on?

732
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:18,191
So, You know,
I throw him a dummy,

733
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:19,461
Fooled him
Completely.

734
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,331
Now, You
Gotta imagine,

735
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,837
This is, Like,
10, 15 Yards out

736
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:23,565
From the sideline.

737
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:24,867
There are several
Of these big buggers

738
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,204
Coming towards me,
Right?

739
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:27,105
So what do I do?

740
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,871
L... I put
My head down,

741
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,106
And I shot
To get a touchdown

742
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:32,875
Right between
The posts. God.

743
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,246
The coach reckons
I'm a dead certain

744
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,477
For the next
Callback trials.

745
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:36,814
What do you think
About that, Paquita?

746
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:42,848
You could be going out
With the next bob scott.

747
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,371
Where were you?

748
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,405
A cute little
Se}orita, Eh?

749
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:07,915
Oh, God. Wait.

750
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,646
Oh, Come on, Now.
Don't be a party pooper.

751
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,153
Come and have a drink.

752
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:12,585
Oh!

753
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:15,715
Oh, I bet you go off
Like a rocket.

754
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:17,122
Oof!

755
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,854
Ohh!

756
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,829
Oh! Oh! Little bitch!

757
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,456
I'll get you!
Where is she?

758
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:28,493
Aw, You foreign bitch!
I'll get...

759
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:40,538
Hello?

760
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,051
Hello?

761
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:56,754
Aah!

762
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:06,063
Paquita!

763
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:13,404
Eeeeeee! Aah!

764
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,608
Paquita.

765
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:26,083
"Death surrounds him."

766
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:35,059
Lionel: They're not...
Dead exactly.

767
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:37,333
They're just...

768
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:40,102
Sort of rotting.

769
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,542
Nurse mctavish.

770
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,944
Father mcgruder.

771
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:49,373
Your mother!

772
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:54,419
I don't know what to do,
You know? I...

773
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:58,449
Don't know how
To stop it.

774
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:02,755
You must destroy them.

775
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,265
I...

776
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:06,290
I can't.

777
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,593
Not mum.

778
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:15,666
That thing
Is not your mother.

779
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,311
Come on, Les.
Join in.

780
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:52,770
I'll do it.

781
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:04,248
Aye, What's this?

782
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,846
Her lap bird's
Flying the coop, Is it?

783
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:07,513
Out of the way!

784
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,456
You're not going
Anywhere, Mate,

785
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:12,619
Until the house
Papers come through.

786
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:13,650
Come on, Lionel.

787
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,822
No, You don't!

788
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,855
Oh!

789
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,293
Oooooh!

790
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,562
Arrrrrr!

791
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,533
Whoa!

792
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:32,970
Come on!

793
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:35,608
Rrrr! You foreign
Animal bitch.

794
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:40,087
Time you and I got
Better acquainted.

795
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,689
Help! Someone!

796
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,723
Please!

797
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,109
For god's sake, Run!

798
01:08:35,143 --> 01:08:38,135
Not so loud, Mate!

799
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,373
Aah!

800
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,314
Oh! Aah! Aah!

801
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,683
Bitch!

802
01:09:28,396 --> 01:09:31,388
Lmadre de dios!

803
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,500
Help us!

804
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:37,528
Bugger that!

805
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,491
Aah!

806
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,738
Run, Paquita!

807
01:10:37,232 --> 01:10:39,223
Help!

808
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,507
Help! Help! Help!

809
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:52,536
Oh, No! Shit!

810
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:59,043
Help! Help!

811
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:02,446
Aah!

812
01:11:03,391 --> 01:11:05,382
Aah!

813
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,743
Please don't kill me.

814
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:44,948
It's ok. It's me.

815
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:10,041
That's a nasty plaque
Problem you got there, Mate.

816
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,985
Got a bit of a cavity
There, Mate.

817
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,013
Heh heh!

818
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,404
Mandy.

819
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:43,110
It's me, Rita.

820
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:45,142
Remember?

821
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:54,478
Oh. Oh.

822
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,702
Aah! Aah! Aah!

823
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,010
Ha ha ha ha!

824
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:48,725
Oh!

825
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:06,977
Uhh!

826
01:17:11,492 --> 01:17:15,485
Ya mutant
Little shit!

827
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,031
You'll be ok.

828
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:29,709
Let me in!

829
01:17:29,744 --> 01:17:33,771
For christ's sake,
Let me in!

830
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,113
Let me in! Help me!

831
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:36,980
Help!

832
01:17:37,018 --> 01:17:38,781
Paquita,
We must.

833
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,845
Come on! Help!

834
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,879
Quickly!

835
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,933
There's thousands of them!

836
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:56,869
What the hell's this?!

837
01:17:56,904 --> 01:17:58,462
Leave her alone.

838
01:17:58,506 --> 01:17:59,632
She's been bitten!

839
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:01,232
You know
What that means?!

840
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:02,970
She's gonna turn
Into one of them!

841
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:06,002
I won't. I won't.

842
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,442
Help me!

843
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:51,189
You stay out of it!

844
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:53,785
I know what to do.
She's history.

845
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:54,886
I've read
The comics!

846
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:57,591
Total lobotomy!
Dismemberment!

847
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,894
Are you crazy?!

848
01:18:58,933 --> 01:19:04,929
There's no room for
Hysterical women in my unit.

849
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:40,130
Aah!

850
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:02,953
Step right up,
You creepo bastards!

851
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:11,895
Aah!

852
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,574
Lionel.

853
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,269
Paquita!

854
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,300
No!

855
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,580
Uhh!

856
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,614
Oh!

857
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:55,338
Aah!

858
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:15,663
Just as well someone around
Here's got balls, Eh, Girls?

859
01:21:15,703 --> 01:21:17,694
Ohh!

860
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:26,369
Goddamn little rug rat!

861
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:32,108
Get out of the way!

862
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:37,714
Come on, You little maggot!

863
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:44,788
Where are you,
You little crawler?!

864
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:09,245
Aah!

865
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,281
No! Whoa!

866
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:20,457
Whoa!

867
01:22:21,302 --> 01:22:23,293
Lionel!

868
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,573
Holy christ. Vera.

869
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:40,586
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

870
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,561
Leave me.

871
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:03,076
Aah! Aah!

872
01:23:14,188 --> 01:23:17,180
Party's over.

873
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,632
Aah! Aah! Aah!

874
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,214
Aah!

875
01:27:10,357 --> 01:27:12,348
Rita?

876
01:27:22,636 --> 01:27:24,627
No!

877
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:21,584
Oh!

878
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:24,127
Now, You just get
Out of here.

879
01:28:24,164 --> 01:28:26,155
What?

880
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:29,869
Haven't seen mum yet.

881
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,733
Aah!

882
01:28:52,192 --> 01:28:55,787
Come to mummy,
Lionel.

883
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,820
Come on!

884
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,545
No!

885
01:29:57,624 --> 01:30:01,617
You don't
Scare me, Mum.

886
01:30:08,135 --> 01:30:10,262
All my life...

887
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,772
You told me nothing
But lies.

888
01:30:12,806 --> 01:30:14,967
That stuff about dad,

889
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:19,001
None of that was true!

890
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:25,176
You drowned them both,
Mum...

891
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,483
Dad and that blond woman.

892
01:30:27,521 --> 01:30:28,886
You caught them together,

893
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:30,514
And you killed them,
Didn't you?

894
01:30:30,557 --> 01:30:33,583
How dare you speak
To me like that.

895
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:36,619
Didn't you?!

896
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:00,413
Lionel, Help! Quick!

897
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:02,445
Slut!

898
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:14,766
Don't you touch her.

899
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:16,598
No!

900
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:22,633
No one will ever love you
Like your mother.

901
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,801
No! No!

902
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:36,145
No!

903
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:42,658
No!

904
01:31:42,696 --> 01:31:45,688
Such a good boy.

905
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:50,993
Heh heh heh heh.

906
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:51,220
Aah!

907
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:54,257
Aah!

908
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,601
No.

909
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:11,844
The sign of love

910
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:14,870
Has cost its toll

911
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:20,009
The truth foretold

912
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:23,279
Is now revealed

913
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:28,284
Its mystery

914
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:31,454
Our destiny

915
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:35,458
The stars and moon

916
01:34:37,771 --> 01:34:40,763
The sign of love

917
01:34:40,874 --> 01:34:43,866
Has come at last

918
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,372
2 Lonely hearts

919
01:34:49,549 --> 01:34:52,541
Are in the past

920
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:57,152
It blazes bright

921
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:00,353
Love's blinding light

922
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:02,692
Through darkest night

923
01:35:02,729 --> 01:35:06,722
And floods the room

924
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:10,226
The stars and moon

925
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:38,254
The sign of love

926
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:41,557
Our time has come

927
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:44,504
The stars and moon

928
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:46,699
Stars and moon

929
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:49,732
Will shine for us

930
01:35:50,844 --> 01:35:54,405
The stars and the moon

931
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,440
Are guiding us

932
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:02,445
We follow the sign

933
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:06,949
To perfect love

934
01:36:37,991 --> 01:36:40,983
The sign of love

935
01:36:42,195 --> 01:36:45,187
Our time has come

936
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:49,391
The stars and moon

937
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:53,229
Will shine for us

938
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:58,574
The stars and the moon

939
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:01,604
Are guiding us

940
01:37:03,183 --> 01:37:06,175
We follow the sign

941
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:10,646
To perfect love
