00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,151
(funky disco plays)
 My name is Cleveland Brown 

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:06,419
 And I am proud to be 

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,722
 Right back in my hometown 

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,591
 With my new family 

5
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,760
 There's old friends
and new friends 

6
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,029
 And even a bear 

7
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:18,231
 Through good times
and bad times 

8
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,833
 It's true love we share 

9
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:22,068
 And so I found a place 

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,337
 Where everyone will know 

11
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:26,506
 My happy mustached face 

12
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,775
 This is The Cleveland Show. 

13
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:30,644
Sync, corrected by elderman
(chuckles)

14
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:34,781
The Cleveland Show 02x06 // Fat and Wet
Original Air Date on November 21, 2010

15
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,453
Love the pool,
Cleveland.

16
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,206
Yeah, who says
pools need to...

17
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,908
need to be in the
ground or look nice?

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,245
I went into the Tar-zhay to get
some medicated arch supports,

19
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,881
and I walked out
with this sweet-ass pool!

20
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,150
You walked out with
this whole pool?

21
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,085
Fit in my trunk.
(clicks tongue)

22
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,503
Water not included.

23
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,455
(gasping breaths)

24
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,157
Nine rings. New record.

25
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,625
Opened my eyes, too.

26
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,493
No goggles, no regrets.

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,095
You getting in, Junior?

28
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:05,298
No. I don't like to take my
shirt off in front of people,

29
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,334
on account of
my Frisbee nips.

30
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:12,138
Mine has grown together so they
look like the MasterCard logo.

31
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,040
(chuckles)
Priceless.

32
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,492
(both sigh)

33
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,583
 

34
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,327
 

35
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,900
(music stops abruptly)

36
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,469
Roberta, I don't mean
to embarrass you

37
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,640
or sound old-fashioned, but...
ye maidenhood's showing.

38
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,108
My what?!
Your...

39
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,776
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

40
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,894
You're doomed.

41
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,145
Ow! Bitch!

42
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,047
My bad. From where
I was standing,

43
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,583
it looked like I was
throwing to a man.

44
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,151
(gasps)
Rallo!

45
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,654
What did I tell you about
getting too close to this pool?

46
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,955
Calm down, Donna.

47
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,990
The boy's just trying
to have some fun.

48
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,792
Don't tell me
to calm down.

49
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,395
I told you, I think
this pool is dangerous.

50
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,364
It's like now we've got two
loaded guns in the house.

51
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,266
Hey, is that
Djimon Hounsou?

52
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,867
Where?! Aah!

53
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,772
Ha-ha! Now you got to
change your clothes!

54
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,274
And get your hair done!

55
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,210
And get a new
cell phone!

56
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,646
(low snoring)

57
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,615
(low snoring continues)

58
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,216
(sighs) Junior's
been snoring

59
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,885
every night this
week, Cleveland.

60
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,554
Why don't you just go
in there and wake him up?

61
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,090
I would, but he started
locking his door at night

62
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,726
because he's scared
of the rock band Kiss.

63
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,796
He saw them on American Idol
and thinks they're real.

64
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,465
- Cleveland, he is 14 years old.
- I know.

65
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,867
Well, I read in
Reactionary Parent Magazine

66
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,836
that sometimes snoring
is a symptom

67
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,705
of serious health problems.

68
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,106
Snoring is?!

69
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,475
RALLO: Stop making
so much noise, you fat loser!

70
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,377
He can't help it, Rallo!

71
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,012
I wasn't talking to him.

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,014
Oh. I'm sorry!
Good night!

73
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,683
I make so much noise sometimes.

74
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,185
Stupid!

75
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,590
Here, put these Band-Aids
in your pocket.

76
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,125
But, Daddy,
that's stealing!

77
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,227
They're free!
Hurry!

78
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,163
Well, Junior, your tests are
back, and it appears you have

79
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,265
one of the most overdiagnosed
childhood disorders

80
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,167
in America:
sleep apnea.

81
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,569
But you really have it.

82
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,870
Probably.

83
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,506
I think a light diet
and losing a few pounds

84
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,408
should solve this
and what I imagine

85
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,510
are countless other
problems in your life.

86
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,214
Doctor, Junior's been
on a "light diet" for years.

87
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,349
Yeah. What else you got?

88
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,618
Well, there is something
called a C-PAP machine.

89
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,387
Here you go.
Cool! (laughs)

90
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,188
I'm Jacques Cousteau...!

91
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,356
Ow.

92
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,824
Hey, those aren't
your Band-Aids!

93
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,426
(gasps)
Junior!

94
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,495
Stealing?!

95
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,166
Good morning, family!

96
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,601
Oh, sweet Lord!

97
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,835
How'd you sleep, Junior?

98
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,370
Better than ever.

99
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,272
I'm alert, I have
tons of energy,

100
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,641
and my poo came out
with no tears!

101
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,045
I feel so good, I'm gonna wear
this mask to school today.

102
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,180
Junior, I don't want you
to embarrass yourself

103
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,916
by wearing that to school,
but if you're going to,

104
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,551
at least take off
your underwear

105
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,853
so no one can pull
it over your head.

106
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,488
Okay.

107
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,626
One problem at
a time, Donna.

108
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,494
(bell rings)

109
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,370
(exhausted panting)

110
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,576
(continues panting)

111
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,218
(continues panting)

112
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,225
(continues panting)

113
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,095
(stops panting)

114
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,216
(heroic theme playing)

115
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,718
 

116
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,719
(clanging)

117
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,370
(rapid thumping)

118
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,172
(whirring)

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,174
 

120
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,182
(all laughing)

121
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,184
Look, everybody,
it's Robohog.

122
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,086
Hey, it's
Optimus Prime Rib!

123
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,921
(laughter)

124
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,941
Get it? 'Cause in that mask,
you look like a fat robot.

125
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,359
(laughter)

126
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,760
No, I got it.

127
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,263
But I need my mask
to breathe properly.

128
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,366
Breathe properly?
What are you, gay for oxygen?

129
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,135
Derek, we all
need oxygen.

130
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,137
Yeah, man, stick
to the fat jokes.

131
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,705
Fine.
'Sup, Fatty?

132
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,839
(laughter)

133
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,541
He's back!

134
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,415
Why so blue, Junior?

135
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,519
I got made fun of
because of my fat problem.

136
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,554
I'm sorry to hear that.

137
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,058
(squeaky groaning)
Weh... eh, weh...

138
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,443
You want a piece of pizza?

139
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,128
Oh! Sure!

140
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,363
Thank you!

141
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,101
You know, it seems
like us heavysets

142
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,438
are the only group you're
allowed to make fun of anymore.

143
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,476
Well, us and even
the smartest of the Polish.

144
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,412
There should be a hate-crime law
for people like us.

145
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,482
Or a weight-crime law!

146
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,783
(gasps)
That's it!

147
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,653
If we got a law passed
to protect us from ridicule,

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,688
all our problems
would be solved.

149
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,124
Then it's settled--
we're doing it!

150
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,592
Thanks, Miss Kendra.

151
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,894
Now, give me a hug.

152
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,329
Mmm.

153
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,231
(grunting)

154
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,003
Cleveland, we are completely
out of graham crackers.

155
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,307
Will you keep an eye on Rallo
while I run to the store?

156
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,210
Make sure he stays
out of the pool.

157
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,311
Cleveland.

158
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,845
Cleveland, do you hear me?

159
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,047
Yes, Donna.

160
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,282
Lou Ferrigno
could hear you.

161
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,587
He drops back.

162
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,423
Oh, he sees an opening,
and he takes... Aah!

163
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,625
Help! I can't swim!

164
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,661
Somebody help me!

165
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,301
CLEVELAND (muffled):
Oh, my God, no!

166
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,271
They're doing another
season of The Bachelor?

167
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,073
Hmm. This world.

168
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:25,044
TV ANNOUNCER:
...is now one and one
with two outs, runner at first.

169
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:32,488
TV ANNOUNCER:
...two outs,
with a runner on first.

170
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:35,141
Wait a minute.
I don't remember buying

171
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,477
a coaster shaped
like a dead kid!

172
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,279
Rallo! My angel!

173
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,131
Oh, can you hear me?

174
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:46,585
Oh, God, if you die,
I am never getting laid again!

175
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:51,707
(grunting)

176
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,626
(electrical zapping,
loud humming)

177
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,512
(grunting)

178
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:02,351
(exhaling repeatedly)

179
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,187
Yecch! I should've done this
before the plunger.

180
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,674
Aah. I got to bury the body.

181
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,443
(car alarm chirps)

182
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,411
(coughing)

183
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,646
Even better!

184
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:14,780
(car alarm chirps)

185
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,986
Rallo, are you okay?!

186
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,291
Mm...

187
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,774
You saved my life, old man.

188
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:23,477
From now on, you need
anything, you come to me.

189
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,479
Oh, I don't need
anything from you--

190
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,582
other than to never mention
this to your mother!

191
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,217
Why not?
You're a hero!

192
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,854
Yes, but... Rallo,
if your mother finds out

193
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:36,157
you were running
around this pool,

194
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,326
whoo-hoo, boy,
will she be mad--

195
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,694
at you.

196
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:42,463
She might even ban you
from the pool completely.

197
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,498
A hero and a genius.

198
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,133
I won't say a word,

199
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,002
but I will never
forget this.

200
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,237
Like E.T. never forgot Elliot.

201
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,238
(phone rings)

202
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,239
Hello?

203
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,176
E.T. phone Elliot!

204
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,377
Oh. Hey.

205
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:57,645
What's up?

206
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:59,413
Nothing since we
talked yesterday.

207
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,449
Do you still have that bike?

208
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:04,151
Again, no, E.T. I don't
still have the bike

209
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,820
I had when I was ten.

210
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,322
What about the blanket?

211
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,024
Nope. No blanket, either.

212
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,992
Listen... I got
to go, E.T.

213
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,929
Elliot...!

214
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,097
What?!

215
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,098
Hi.

216
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,269
My name is Cleveland Brown Jr.,

217
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,304
and I'm here to recruit you!

218
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,607
For too long,
this world has marginalized

219
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,376
and ridiculed fat people,

220
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,945
assuming that just because
our feet are often numb,

221
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,613
that we don't have feelings.

222
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,982
But they're wrong!

223
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,752
My name is Kendra Krinkelsac,

224
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:40,888
and our ballot measure
guarantees equality

225
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,091
for all obese heterosexuals.

226
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,860
(sobbing)

227
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,062
Hey, it'll be okay.

228
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,432
We'll vote for this one,
and then, in time...

229
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,167
In time.

230
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:59,707
Glad I lived to do
this for you, old man.

231
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,976
'Cause I saved you,
I saved you.

232
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,378
Mm-hmm, yes, I did,
yes, I did.

233
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,847
Cleveland, how many times
do I have to tell you

234
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,817
not to leave your baseball cards
spread out all over our bed?

235
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,887
I was seeing which guys I had
and which guys I need!

236
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:14,455
Cleveland, how
many times do I...

237
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,791
Hold up, Mama--
you need to treat this man

238
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,209
with the respect
he deserves.

239
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,660
- Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.
- Excuse me?

240
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,595
No, Cleveland,
she needs to hear.

241
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,364
This man's a hero.
He saved...

242
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:25,699
Yeah, money on car
insurance with Geico.

243
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,201
(forced chuckle)
Get it?

244
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,437
What the hell are
you talking about?

245
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,372
Hey, I almost forgot,
Djimon Hounsou's

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
in the front yard.
- Really?!

247
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,926
(relieved sigh)

248
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:40,648
You were supposed to be
watching me the other day

249
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,817
when I fell in the
pool, weren't you?

250
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:44,919
Yes, I was, yes, I was.

251
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,488
- And I almost drowned?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,457
You realize I own
you now, right?

253
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,125
That you do, yes.

254
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,627
Empty your pockets so I
can take what I want.

255
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,496
Dang!

256
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,941
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

257
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,977
That's my grandfather's
pocket watch.

258
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,179
I think you mean
my pocket watch.

259
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,548
There is no way
on God's Earth

260
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,784
I am letting you have
that watch...

261
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:17,952
(loud crying)

262
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,453
Cleveland wasn't watching me,

263
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:22,556
and I almost drowned in his
white-trash above-ground pool!

264
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,525
Here, take the watch,
you little hombitch.

265
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,893
All right!

266
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,294
I love this watch.

267
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:28,729
It's classy.

268
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:31,031
(with British accent):
What time is it, you say?

269
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:33,300
A quarter past the hour?

270
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,204
So, Cleveland
and Lester,

271
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,740
how does it feel to
have your son and wife

272
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:41,375
be the laughingstock
of our town?

273
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,676
Shut up,
Eraserhead.

274
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,912
Laughingstock?
What are you talking about?

275
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,413
According to the news,

276
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:49,483
Junior and Kendra are the king
and queen of the fatties.

277
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,186
(laughter)

278
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,154
I boned a fat
chick once.

279
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:55,523
As a goof.

280
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,324
Had to date her for eight months
before she let me.

281
00:11:57,392 --> 00:11:58,792
Fell in love,
asked her to marry me.

282
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,127
She said no.

283
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,862
Said she boned a short guy
as a goof.

284
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,430
(scoffs)
Chicks aren't funny.

285
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,832
Ah, drink
up, fellas.

286
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,600
You don't want
to be sober

287
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,303
when you walk into that booth
and see your names associated

288
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,905
with the grossest
thing on Earth.

289
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,172
- Fat people.
- Fat people.

290
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Prolapsed
rectums.

291
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:14,508
Hey!

292
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:17,845
Prolapsed rectums
are not funny!

293
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,318
(dramatic TV news theme)

294
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,720
Shh, shh. It's coming.
It's results time.

295
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,690
I wish I could cross my fingers.

296
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,959
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Here now with the news,
Dwayne Meighan.

297
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,127
Good evening.

298
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:35,095
I'm Dwayne Meighan.

299
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,831
Today was the day
when they had had an election.

300
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,267
Everybody went and said
what they had

301
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:43,003
about a measure
called the Brown/Krinklesac

302
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:46,440
for the fat people
or the fat individual.

303
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:49,577
They had people that you were
signed your name on a sheet,

304
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,080
and then you could say yes
or no and that...

305
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,951
was for you, but everybody got
to say yes or no.

306
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:00,921
At this juncture,
several people,

307
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,723
on a voluntary basis,

308
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,292
had counted
what they had called a ballot,

309
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,195
that was what
they had said yes or no.

310
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,997
They had made one pile for yes

311
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,866
and another pile
for those who said no.

312
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:15,569
Both piles were then counted,
double-check,

313
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,505
as a result
for which was made official.

314
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:22,910
Word had been the measure
had been actually defeated.

315
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,244
Oh!

316
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,246
I'm sorry, Junior.

317
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,848
They had had a camera out

318
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,150
at what they had called
a polling place earlier

319
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:31,352
with my friend Larvell.

320
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,020
Larvell?

321
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,255
Um, I'm actually
at the polling place,

322
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:38,492
and, um, there were some
that had, um, some guys...

323
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,227
Hey, wait. Here's some guys.

324
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:41,462
Um, hey, guys...

325
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,663
(quieter):
did y'all, um,

326
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,665
(into mic):
vote on Brown/Krinklesac?

327
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,833
Yeah.

328
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,034
These guys voted.

329
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:48,302
Hey, um,

330
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,436
(quieter):
how did y'all vote?

331
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,739
We both voted, "Hell no!"

332
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,040
That's right!

333
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,175
N-O. No!

334
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:57,378
So, suck on
that, fatties!

335
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:00,514
(both laughing)

336
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:04,585
I think we're
in big trouble, Lester.

337
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:08,088
That is, until we...
disappear!

338
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,024
(screaming)

339
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,061
Seems like
that's the story now.

340
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,946
Hmm?

341
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:21,464
You know, Ms. Kendra,

342
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:24,967
right now I weigh more than
I ever have in my whole life,

343
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,935
and yet, I've never
felt smaller.

344
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:29,104
That's beautiful.

345
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,673
You know what's
ironical, Junior?

346
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:32,874
Nothing.

347
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,109
Ironical isn't a word.

348
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,577
Nothing is ironical.

349
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,079
But go ahead.

350
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:41,216
I was just gonna say that,
all I wanted was to be accepted,

351
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:44,486
but now I feel more left out
than ever.

352
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,221
That's beautiful, too.

353
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,391
Even though it's kind of
exactly what I just said.

354
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,927
And it wasn't
just our families.

355
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:55,197
This whole town is
full of skinny jerks.

356
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,799
You know what?

357
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,268
We don't need them.

358
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,403
There's got to be someplace
better than this.

359
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,739
Where people are free
to be who they are.

360
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:07,175
Where a person is judged
not by the size of their belly,

361
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,745
but by the color of their skin.

362
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,346
- Huh?
- Screw Stoolbend.

363
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:13,815
We're hitting
the road, Junior!

364
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,550
Yay!

365
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,452
(upbeat music plays)

366
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,379
(calming Muzak plays)

367
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,298
(upbeat music plays)

368
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,569
(calming Muzak plays)

369
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,939
(upbeat music plays)

370
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,648
(engine revving, tire squeak)

371
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,450
 

372
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,403
What are you doing, man?

373
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:52,954
Where's my Kool-Aid?

374
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:55,023
(sighs)
Rallo, I've been
busting my butt,

375
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:56,992
following your
orders all day.

376
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,227
I just finished
ironing your clothes,

377
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,730
and painting that Eazy-E
mural over your bed.

378
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:05,967
I'm exhausted.

379
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,669
- Give me a minute.
- A minute?

380
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:10,939
Oh, is that how long I was
unconscious, or was it longer?

381
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,675
Now, get out of that pool
and make me a Kool-Aid.

382
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,145
You're crazy!

383
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,847
No. I'm just
bigger than you.

384
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:20,349
You're five years old,

385
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,451
and I'm not gonna
let you order me

386
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,152
around my own
house anymore.

387
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,954
But you almost killed me!

388
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,156
No, you almost killed you.

389
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,092
I just wasn't
paying attention.

390
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,476
And I should have been.

391
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,363
I'm truly sorry.

392
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,881
(yells)
What was that for?!

393
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,033
That was for making
me eat a stick.

394
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:39,301
We straight?

395
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,736
Yeah-yeah... yeah,
we-we straight.

396
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:41,937
Good.

397
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:43,705
I love you, Rallo.

398
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,140
Now learn to swim.

399
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,608
The river's that way.

400
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,744
Yes, sir.

401
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:51,963
Man, I got
this parenting thing down.

402
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,267
Hmm. Haven't seen Junior
in a couple days.

403
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:02,140
You had me kick in
for gas money,

404
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,626
but I notice this runs
on electricity.

405
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,861
Hmm?

406
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,796
(muttering)

407
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:11,650
Junior, I think
I see something

408
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:14,703
just over this hill!

409
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:18,807
I've heard tell, but I
never knew it was real.

410
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,209
They call it...

411
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,178
Wisconsin.

412
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,981
(dramatic music plays)

413
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,319
(rumbling)

414
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,656
Look at me!

415
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,592
I'm walking again!

416
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,532
Hey, you folks want to
try some crazy butter?

417
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,201
What's that?

418
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:22,771
It's three sticks of butter in
a mug with melted cheese on top.

419
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,940
Hells, yeah,
I want that crazy butter.

420
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,947
 

421
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,304
(starter pistol fires)

422
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,753
 

423
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:20,996
(laughter)

424
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,033
(laughter)

425
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,736
(wheezy panting)

426
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,939
I thought eating
anything and everything

427
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,275
would solve all
my problems,

428
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:35,343
but maybe...

429
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:39,614
the eating is a symptom
of other problems!

430
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,550
You just blew my mind.

431
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,253
Out of my way,
large sir!

432
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,454
Move it!

433
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,523
Aw, everybody's sticky!

434
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:50,091
- Dad?
- Lester?

435
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,327
How did you
find us?

436
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,930
I got a LoJack
for your Rascal when Cleve...

437
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:57,415
uh, those Puerto Ricans
moved in down the street.

438
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:01,152
Well, you wasted
your time coming here.

439
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,521
You hurt me,
Lester.

440
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,024
Kendra, you may be
morbidly obese,

441
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,094
but I'm the one who acted
like a big fat fool.

442
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:12,764
Because, disgust me
or not, I love you.

443
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,165
Please come back.

444
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,533
I don't know.

445
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,603
I strongly urge you
to consider your options.

446
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,672
Let's go home!

447
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:27,462
Let's go home,
too, Junior.

448
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,931
Not until you apologize
for what you did.

449
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,833
I'm sorry you're fat.

450
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,235
Junior, fat people don't
deserve special treatment

451
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,737
just because
they're fat.

452
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,672
Being fat is a choice.

453
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,507
Do you choose to be pudgy?

454
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:40,976
Wha...?!

455
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,511
You-you think
I'm pudgy?!

456
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,846
Hurtful.

457
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:46,081
(sobbing)

458
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,349
That's it.

459
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,817
No more fries.

460
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,686
Just chips.
Or cheese fries.

461
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:54,489
- You want some cheese fries?
- I could eat.

462
