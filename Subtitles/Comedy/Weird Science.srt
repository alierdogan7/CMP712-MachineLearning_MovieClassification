3
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,041
Look at her.

4
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:49,328
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

5
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:51,330
Shower with them.

6
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,333
Then we hit
the city, baby,

7
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,834
dead on,

8
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,767
for a little drinks,

9
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,363
a little nightlife,
dancing--

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,668
Dancing.

11
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:06,179
We throw a huge party,
I mean <i>huge</i> party--

12
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,782
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.

13
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:11,649
All these girls,
they're all there.

14
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,050
Naked bodies everywhere.

15
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,247
Gary.

16
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:16,812
They'll know my name.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,255
What?

18
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,589
Nobody likes us.
Nobody.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,096
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?

20
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,758
We know about
the reality.

21
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,267
Don't ruin
the fantasy, okay?

22
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:30,769
And then,

23
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,771
we're a hit, man.

24
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,773

We're revered.

25
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,832
Man, we're studs.

00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:42,341

to be a vet.

Chet? Shit!

81
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,501
You should have
told me this

82
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,510
before I agreed
to sleep over.

83
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,513
How do you
put up with him?

84
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,018
If I don't,
he beats the shit
out of me.

85
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,215
It's a habit
he picked up
in military school.

86
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,723
He's very
protective of me.

87
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,090

Actually making a girl...

113
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,499

Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.

127
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,888
I'm not digging up
dead girls.

128
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:32,671
I'm not talking about
digging up a dead girl.

129
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm talking about
your computer, idiot.

130
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,201
You can simulate stuff
on your computer.

131
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,180
Why can't we
simulate a girl?

132
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,183
I guess I could,
but why?

133
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:48,186
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.

134
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,848
It's not
flesh and blood.

135
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,859
But we can
ask it questions.

136
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:57,795
We'll put it in
real-life sexual situations

137
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,196
and see how it reacts.

138
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:04,032
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?

139
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,799
She lives in Canada.

140
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,806
She has no morals.

141
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,809
I don't like that
in a girl.

142
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,708
Anyway, get to work.

143
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,641
Very nice.

144
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:27,920
Hold it, Wyatt.
I know female stats.

145
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,394
Anything bigger
than a handful,

146
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,897
you're risking
a sprained tongue.

147
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,456
Yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,497

149
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,505
Okay. Now what?

150
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,872
Should we give her
a brain?

151
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,140
Yeah. We'll play chess
with her.

152
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:50,239
Chess? Just give her
a brain.

153
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,558
That's all we can do
with my stuff.

154
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:05,621
Did you get
a free toaster
with this, too?

155
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:09,634
The problem is,
this is a lame idea.

156
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,136
Your computer
is a wimp.

00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,140

We're in trouble, Gary.

161
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,138

We got to
fill this thing

163
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,211
We'll make her

164
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,577
I want her

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,713
Are you okay?

365
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:19,217
My nuts
are halfway up my ass.

366
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:22,014
Other than that,
I'm perfect.

367
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:25,523
Think of what
you'll do about Chet.

368
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,991
He's one serious idiot.

369
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,089
You're stewed, butt-wad!

370
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,263
Who, me?

371
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,266
Know what time it is?

372
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,632
Uh, 2:00?

373
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,194
Time to pay the fiddler.

374
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,813
I was kind of
counting on you

375
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:51,372
to be human about this.

376
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,822
Here's the
bottom line, Wyatt.

377
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,758
I'm telling Mom and Dad
everything.

378
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:06,025
And I'm even considering
making up some shit.

379
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,769
All right, Chet.
Name your price.

380
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:14,271
$1 7 5 and zero cents,
cash--

381
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,773
New bills,
crisp and clean,

382
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:19,333
in my wallet by 7 A.M.

383
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,279
Thank you.

384
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:25,783
Hey, what are
big brothers for?

385
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,012
See you upstairs.

386
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,345
How to be jilted.

387
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,292
Pllllttt.

388
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,793
Shh.

389
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,295
Shh.

390
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,797
The boozehounds return.

391
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,300
What a joke!

392
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,858
Hi, girls.

393
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,615
<i>Feeling kind of Queasy?</i>

394
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:04,247
How about a nice
greasy pork sandwich

395
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:07,315
served in
a dirty ashtray?

396
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,771
He pukes, you die.

397
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,002
He's not laughing
at you, Chet.

398
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,135
<i>Yes, I am</i>.

399
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,807
Did you tell Chet
about the woman
we made tonight?

400
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,248
He's drunk.

401
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:33,511
No shit.

402
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,917
No shit, Chet.

403
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:39,515
You donkey dicks
couldn't get laid
in a morgue.

404
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,525
You're absolutely right.

405
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,527
You're absolutely
right, Chet.

406
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,028
Hey, Gary.

407
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,655
What?

408
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,467
Ha ha ha ha!

409
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,511
He's an asshole.

410
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,409
Look at his haircut.

411
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,109
Anybody with
a haircut like that

412
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,118
<i>is an asshole</i>.

413
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,327
Psst. Lisa.

414
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,501
Where are you?

415
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,001
I'm right behind you.

416
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:39,847
Surprise!

417
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,959
I won't hurt you.

418
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:52,963
Your lips feel like
rigor mortis has set in.

419
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,965
Relax a little bit.

420
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:58,469
I wasn't expecting you
to kiss me.

421
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,903
I mean, I was just--

422
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,565
I was...uh...

423
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:09,979
<i>d Oh d</i>

424
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,676
That was better.

425
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,518
Want to try it again?

426
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,524
If you don't mind.

427
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:23,755
I mean,
yes, please, ma'am.

428
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,592
<i>d Oh oh oh oh d</i>

429
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:33,901
<i>d Oh d</i>

430
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,599
Mmph!

431
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,338
You sure
you're only 1 5?

432
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,941
I'll be 1 6 in June.

433
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,554
You made me.

434
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,613
You control me.

435
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,496
What are you
thinking about, huh?

436
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,226
Um...

437
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,058
women's gymnastics.

438
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,505
Well, I don't know.

439
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,507
I'll do my best.

440
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:12,065
Good.

441
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,605
Oh.

442
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:52,274
Wyatt, Wyatt,

443
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,046
Wyatt, where are you?

444
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,053
I'm right here, Gary.

445
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,554
What happened?

446
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,487
I don't know.

447
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,994
I think
it was a dream.

448
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,756
What?

449
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,764
Everything--
Last night, Lisa.

450
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:09,494
It had to be a dream.

451
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:11,832
<i>We were both in it</i>.

452
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,771
Two people can't have
the same dream.

453
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,674
It had to be a dream.

454
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,575
<i>In your dream,</i>

455
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:25,548
did I get up
in the middle
of the night

456
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,177
<i>and yak</i>
<i>in your sink?</i>

457
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,187
<i>Didn't throw up. No</i>.

458
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:33,691
Maybe it was a dream,
you know--

459
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,693
A very weird, bizarre,

460
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:42,633
<i>vivid, erotic, wet,</i>
<i>detailed dream</i>.

461
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,795
Maybe we have malaria.

462
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:47,270
Shit.

463
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:57,472
Gary! Wyatt!

464
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,039
<i>Breakfast</i>!

465
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,651
I don't
have the bucks

466
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:08,056
to pay Chet off
about this.

467
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:11,027
You can't fear Chet
the rest of your life.

468
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,621
Why not?
Please...

469
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:16,030
I don't know, Wyatt.

470
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:20,663
I mean, it's seriously
affecting your sex life.

471
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,674
<i>1 0 seconds into</i>
<i>my gymnastics routine,</i>

472
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:25,676
<i>you passed out</i>.

473
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,177
You slept.

474
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,769
I did my toes.

475
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:31,680
By the way,
you're very cute.

476
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,241
We'll try it again
sometime.

477
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:39,781
Good morning,
turd brain.

478
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,348
Hi, Chet.

479
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,755
You spit in this?

480
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,825
Not that
I'm aware of, no.

481
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:53,769
Hey, that looks
pretty good.

482
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:02,269
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.

483
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:11,221
I like your panties.

484
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,722
[Burp]

485
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,884
It's a joke, Chet.

486
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,723
That's not a joke!

487
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,730
That is a severe
behavioral disorder.

488
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,561
Those are women's
underpants!

489
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,729
Next you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.

490
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:29,740
The old man's
going to have a stroke.

491
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:32,242
All right, Chet.
How much?

492
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,743
How much?

493
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:37,304
This goes way beyond
payment, pal.

494
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,316
Come on, Chet.
Please?

495
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,309
Well...

496
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,257
your VCR
should cover it...

497
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,758
for openers.

498
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,260
Thank you.

499
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:54,321
For Christ's sakes,
will you cover yourself?

500
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:19,223
You guys looking
for something
for your mom?

501
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:23,227
I really don't
think so...Sue.

502
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:27,664
Do you guys have,
uh...girlfriends?

503
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:32,669
One does not refer to
a 23-year-old woman

504
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,466
as a girlfriend.

505
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,439
Uh, mistress, Gar.

506
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,135
Um, lover.

507
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,438
Sexpot.

508
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,445
She's a sexpot.

509
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:45,449
<i>You guys</i>
<i>are the ones</i>
<i>that got beat up</i>

510
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:48,008
at the homecoming
game, right?

511
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:53,958
Do you think
you could wrap up

512
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:57,256
a bottle of
this scent for me?

513
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,660
<i>Um, two</i>.

514
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,893
Set yourself up
with one, too.

515
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,492
Three scents, please.

516
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:08,403
If you were
a 1 5-year-old boy,

517
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,907
would these
turn you on?

518
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:14,468
I think so, too.
I'll take them.

519
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:24,922
Do you have a bra
to match that...

520
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,925
something leather,
rubber, or barbed wire?

521
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:29,984
Give me a break.

522
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,431
Check it out.

523
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:35,830
What?

524
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,938
Five bucks?

525
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,497
Finsky.

526
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:48,543
Max, what
will you do?

527
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:54,982
For the first time
in my life,

528
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:58,489
I don't feel like
a total dick.

529
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,285
Yeah, me either.

530
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:04,985
Ha ha ha ha ha!

531
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,333
<i>Ha ha ha ha</i>!

532
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,099
Sorry, boys.

533
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,436
Momentary loss
of motor control.

534
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:19,443
<i>You guys getting</i>
<i>tired of this?</i>

535
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:22,446
There's a big
white sale going on...

536
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:24,448
at Towel World!

537
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:26,780
We're not impressed.

538
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:36,016
Can I have some
of that, please?

539
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:39,930
Their shit bores me.

540
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:41,556
Should we dump them?

541
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,568
We've been with them
three months.

542
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:47,571
We've been
to all the parties.

543
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,574
We won't go
to any more parties.

544
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:53,577
We'll go into
a social coma.

545
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,078
Sorry.
Sorry.

00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:47,365
Bar!

728
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:52,809
Do you think they'll
embarrass us tonight?

729
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:54,310
Yeah.

730
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:55,868
Yeah.

731
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:02,818
Caviar?

732
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,754
If Max and Ian
see her,

733
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:08,121
it's over for us.

734
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,251
How's your stomach?

735
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,556
Better.

736
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:15,565
If you're gonna
float an air biscuit,
let me know.

737
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:17,260
Float a what?

738
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:20,463
If you fart,
I'll hit the fan.

739
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:23,473
Sorry. I suffer
pain and discomfort

740
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,533
due to occasional
stomach upset.

741
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,546
We always talk about
how great it would be

742
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:33,048
if we went to parties.

743
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:37,076
Now it's our party,
hundreds of people
are having fun,

744
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,281
and we're in theJohn.

745
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:42,292
You're as uptight
as I am.

746
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,295
Nobody can be
as uptight as you.

747
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,797
Your middle name
is tense--

748
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,799
Wyatt ''Tense Up''
Donnely.

749
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,801
It's not that bad.

750
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:54,303
We can hear the music.

751
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:58,308
Maybe if we put
our noses to the door,

752
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,742
we can smell the food.

753
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:02,244
Hey, brother!

754
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,747
What's happening,
my main man?

755
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,248
Right on!

756
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,375
Scotch.

757
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:08,748
Straight up?

758
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,083
Give me
the whole bottle.

759
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:12,588
Bend over.

760
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:16,023
I'll shove it
straight up your ass.

761
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,687
On the rocks is fine.

762
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,424
Ha ha ha ha!

763
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:24,332
Yeah, that's what
I thought you'd say.

764
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:39,439
There she is.

765
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:41,109
You deal
with the drinks.

766
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,176
<i>I'll kill the girls</i>.

767
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:57,600
I wonder
if Lisa's having fun.

768
00:45:57,668 --> 00:46:01,934
Lisa could have fun at
an insurance seminar, Wyatt.

769
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:04,907
The thing
that really galls me

770
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:06,909
is that she's ours

771
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:10,413
and we can't
get close to her.

772
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:12,472
Hit the fan.

773
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,856
This is
the best party
I've ever been to.

774
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:21,357
It's great!

775
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,359
Whose house is this?

776
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:27,363
It's probably
that girl with
the English accent.

777
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:31,367
She doesn't have a zit
on her whole body.

778
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:33,369
She has zero fat.

779
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:35,371
And she's so relaxed.

780
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:38,067
She burped
and it was charming.

781
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:43,779
Uh, yeah.

782
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:45,338
The bathroom.

783
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,955
Ladies.

784
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:54,456
Hi.
Hi.

785
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:55,787
Hi.

786
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,452
<i>I can't believe you</i>!

787
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:59,462
<i>You're dropping</i>
<i>wolfbait</i>

788
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,395
<i>and chicks are outside</i>!

789
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:04,457
Light a match!
Light a fire!

790
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,404
Hi.
Hi.

791
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:09,905
Hi.

792
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:13,910
We thought there were
just girls in there.

793
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:16,071
It's just us dudes.

794
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:17,910
Why are you here?

795
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:21,145
Gary was just
taking a shit.

796
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:22,617
I meant--

797
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:27,546
What are you doing
at the party?

798
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,559
Oh, it's my house.

799
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,561
This is your party?

800
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:35,565
We like to do this
once a week,

801
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,567
throw little
get-togethers.

802
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,728
Haven't you guys
been by?

803
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:42,567
How did we
miss these two?

804
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,575
So many people,
so many parties.

805
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,235
So many parties.

806
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:48,642
You lose track.

807
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:52,478
Can I come in
and check my face?

808
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,484
What's wrong with it?

809
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:57,214
Can we come in?

810
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:58,983
Come on in.

811
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:00,921
Sure. Be our guests.

812
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:02,481
Thanks, guys.

813
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:06,929
We've seen you
at school,

814
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:08,931
but we've never met.

815
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,432
You're Hilly.

816
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:11,934
You're Deb.

817
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:13,936
Hi. I'm Gary.

818
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:15,437
Hi, Gary.

819
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:18,441
What have you guys
been doing--

820
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:22,445
I didn't know you guys
had so many friends.

821
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:24,276
Neither did we.

822
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:27,146
Who's the girl
with the accent?

823
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:30,016
I thought
this was her party.

824
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:33,579
You mean the sensuous
sex symbol type?

825
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

826
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:37,093
<i>She's with us</i>.

827
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:40,324
She's with...you guys?

828
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:42,865
Come on, Lisa.
Why not?

829
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,868
Because I belong
to Gary and Wyatt.

830
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:50,873
Did they make you
in the garage
with power tools?

831
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:53,000
Do they own you?

832
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:54,510
<i>Control you?</i>

833
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:56,011
<i>Seriously</i>.

834
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,274
Seriously.

835
00:48:57,348 --> 00:48:58,781
They're toads.

836
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:03,616
Do I look like
I'd go out with two toads?

837
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:05,018
<i>You do</i>.

838
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:07,023
Gary and Wyatt

839
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:10,527
will force everyone
to redefine their terms.

840
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:13,722
And you're completely
loyal to them?

841
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:18,097
I do whatever they say.

842
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:30,436
Hi.

843
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:37,053
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

844
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:40,613
No problem.
We'll be in here.

845
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,123
Okay, fine.

846
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:56,572
They're stoked
for us.

847
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,074
Should we go for it?

848
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,043
What about Lisa?

849
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,079
She said we should party.

850
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:05,877
Let's score points
with these two.

851
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:08,816
We'll deal with
the mechanics later.

852
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,114
Sounds good.

853
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:12,587
Let's not hurt
Lisa's feelings.

854
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,487
She wants
a bone job from me.

855
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,391
Ready to party?
Let's break!

856
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:32,708
Those guys are weird,
but they're kinda cute.

857
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,209
Hi.

858
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,213
Where did you two
disappear to?

859
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:41,012
We were in
the bathroom.
We were
in the kitchen.

860
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,019
Eating.
Doing our hair.

861
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:46,022
Have you met
Gary and Wyatt?

862
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,523
Yes.
No.

863
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:48,990
Sort of.

864
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:54,363
If you get the chance,
shower with them.

865
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:55,864
I did.

866
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,401
It's a mind scrambler!

867
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:01,302
Oh, hurts so good.

868
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,835
She took a shower
with them.

869
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:11,847
I have a wonderful
idea, Henry.

870
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:15,749
After dinner,
let's stop by
and visit Wyatt.

871
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:18,253
He's alone
at home tonight.

872
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:21,257
Doesn't he have
anything to read?

873
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:23,259
I don't know, dear,

874
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:27,263
but nothing's
more important
to a teenage boy

875
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,196
than his grandparents.

876
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:31,097
We'll drop by.

877
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,667
Ha ha ha!
Yeah! Woo!

878
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:50,715
I'd like to apologize
for the Icee today at the mall.

879
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:53,723
It was very immature.
I'm sorry.

880
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,885
It was just,
like, tomfoolery.

881
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,224
<i>We are sorry</i>.

882
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:01,355
It happened.

883
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:03,730
What's the deal
with Lisa?

884
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,428
Can we borrow her?

885
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:07,936
We can't do that, guys.

886
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,939
Common decency
prohibits us.

887
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,271
We can't.
It's not cool.

888
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:15,277
Well, she said
it was cool.

889
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:18,781
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.

890
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:21,044
That's really
selfish.

891
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:23,052
Just forget it, guys.

892
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,680
We can't do it,
you know?

893
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:28,281
Come on.
Quit being pricks.

894
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:30,223
Hey, come on.

895
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:34,230
<i>Regardless of what</i>
<i>she may have told you,</i>

896
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:37,756
our feelings for Lisa
run very deep.

897
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:40,736
So do ours
for Deb and Hilly.

898
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:44,240
It's respect, the time
you spent together.

899
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:46,367
You guys deserve them.

900
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:49,879
<i>We want to make</i>
<i>a deal with you</i>.

901
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:52,939
Let us have
a crack at Lisa

902
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:55,849
and Deb and Hilly
are yours.

903
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:58,911
Can you guys
keep a secret?

904
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:00,149
Sure.

905
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:01,486
A secret?

906
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:03,492
Look again.
It's Gary.

907
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,993

01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:02,766
Grrr.

1091
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:07,207
Yah!

1092
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:08,676
Ha ha ha ha!

1093
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:11,771
Aah!

1094
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,343
Oh!

1095
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:17,716
Haaa!

1096
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,221
Prepare to die,
Wyatt.

1097
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,724
I can't wait to die.

1098
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:24,555
We're gonna kick...

1099
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:25,719
ass.

1100
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:28,764
Okay. This is war.

1101
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:30,321
<i>Hands off the girls</i>.

1102
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,267
Leave the girls
out of this.

1103
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:34,928
Ha ha ha ha!

1104
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:37,131
I said hands off!.

1105
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:38,366
<i>Now</i>!

1106
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:40,671
Ah...ahh!

1107
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:45,271
Hee hee hee hee!

1108
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:47,282
Hee hee hee hee!

1109
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,875
Why don't you
shut up, bitch?

1110
01:06:54,624 --> 01:06:57,559
And as for
your ugly ass,

1111
01:06:57,627 --> 01:07:00,790
<i>you don't come into</i>
<i>my friend's house</i>

1112
01:07:00,863 --> 01:07:02,797
with your faggot friends,

1113
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:06,301
driving your motorbikes
all over his floors,

1114
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:10,362
stinking up the place--
and you do stink.

1115
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:17,976
You're going to
let go of the girls

1116
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,811
and apologize
to all these people.

1117
01:07:20,883 --> 01:07:22,817
Get on your bikes.

1118
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:25,945
Pedal your ugly asses
out of here.

1119
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,252
Ha ha ha ha!

1120
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:32,693
We're gentlemen,
so we'll give you a choice.

1121
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,458
You can
leave in peace...

1122
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,327
or you can stay and die.

1123
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:45,469
Ugh!

1124
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:55,707
The choice is yours.

1125
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:30,952
Aaaahhhhh!

1126
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:35,947
Get out of here.

1127
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,891
Beg your pardon.
Your home is lovely.

1128
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:46,559
<i>Terribly sorry</i>.

1129
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:49,161
Call me.
We'll have lunch.

1130
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,900
Can we keep this
between us?

1131
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:55,466
I'd hate to lose
my teaching job.

1132
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:02,474
God bless you.

1133
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:14,429
I can't believe it.

1134
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:16,431
Is everyone all right?

1135
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:17,932
We're heroes.

1136
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,434
We showed
these guys down.

1137
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:23,939
You and me saved
all these people.

1138
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:27,942
This could mean
a guest shot
on <i>Phil Donahue</i>.

1139
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,773
This is exciting, man!

1140
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:32,781
Where did you
get that thing?

1141
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:35,409
It's a squirt gun.

1142
01:09:35,485 --> 01:09:37,112
Aah!

1143
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:47,185
That's my boys.

1144
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,828
<i>d Crimson morning skyline d</i>

1145
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,134
<i>d Whoa oh d</i>

1146
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:00,641
What a weird night, huh?

1147
01:10:02,144 --> 01:10:05,636
You really weren't
afraid of those guys?

1148
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,084
I was scared.

1149
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:12,643
But what could I do?

1150
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:23,598
I probably shouldn't
ask too many questions

1151
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,156
about tonight.

1152
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:26,599
Probably.

1153
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:30,605
<i>Since this is</i>
<i>a night of weird shit,</i>

1154
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:33,335
can I ask you
something strange?

1155
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:41,176
Would you kiss me?

1156
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:45,016
What about Ian?

1157
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:50,682
We all make mistakes.

1158
01:10:53,696 --> 01:10:54,822
Okay.

1159
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:56,194
Okay.

1160
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,695
Where do you want it?

1161
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:06,135
Can I ask you
a question?

1162
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,641
Yeah.

1163
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,702
How do you feel
about Lisa?

1164
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,442
I love her.

1165
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:15,677
That's what I figured.

1166
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:19,087
But, uh...

1167
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:22,591
it's definitely
a different
kind of love.

1168
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:26,094
You know,
it's more sisterly,

1169
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:29,620
like big sisters,
like, kind of.

1170
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,599
But she's
so beautiful.

1171
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:38,403
Yeah, she's
really beautiful.

1172
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:43,002
And her body is...
it's gorgeous.

1173
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,446
It's a nice figure.

1174
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,107
So...

1175
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:54,147
I mean,
what would I be
compared to her?

1176
01:11:54,223 --> 01:12:00,628
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...

1177
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:05,066
before I knew
what I wanted.

1178
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:09,070
<i>I know that if</i>
<i>I could do it again,</i>

1179
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:12,130
I'd make her
just like you.

1180
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:15,637
Honest.

1181
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:25,586
Dead honest.

1182
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:29,648
I'm like... I'm really honest
when I say that.

1183
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,022
I'm so very honest.

1184
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:33,084
<i>I mean that</i>.

1185
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:26,140
What the hell?

1186
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:27,944
<i>Ucch</i>!

1187
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:29,985
That little bastard.

1188
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:35,851
If my room's okay,
I won't kill him.

1189
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:39,417
I'll just hurt him
real bad.

1190
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,448
Freeze.

1191
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:13,160
Chet!

1192
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,220
Where's my brother?

1193
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:18,393
Ow.

1194
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:19,900
Uh...

1195
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:22,199
I don't know.

1196
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,262
You're dead meat,
pilgrim.

1197
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,865
Uh...

1198
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,503
Chet, Chet,
that's her nose.

1199
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:33,776
She has nothing
to do with it.

1200
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,578
Okay. You die.

1201
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:39,985
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.

1202
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:49,654
I'll be back.

1203
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:57,102
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.

1204
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:59,004
He's an asshole.

1205
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:03,540
Oh, hi, Chet.

1206
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:07,048
What the hell's
going on around here?

1207
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:09,550
Chet, it was
an accident.

1208
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:11,051
An accident?

1209
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,954
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,

1210
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:16,423
goddamn it?

1211
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:19,052
<i>Some weird shit</i>
<i>happened, Chet</i>.

1212
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:23,064
It doesn't
take a genius
to figure that out,

1213
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:24,565
monkey dick.

1214
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:26,066
Start talking.

1215
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:30,231
Gary and I
made a woman
with the computer.

1216
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:34,174
She went crazy and
messed up the house.

1217
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:37,144
Don't smart-mouth me,
you shit!

1218
01:15:37,213 --> 01:15:39,010
Leave him alone.

1219
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:41,276
This is a family
matter, bimbo.

1220
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,012
Chet,just let me
find Lisa.

1221
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:46,020
She'll clear
everything up.

1222
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,784
You can have
my college money

1223
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:53,090
and my social security,
Chet.

1224
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:02,030
So you guys think
you can fool me, huh?

1225
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,696
Huh?

1226
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:07,572
You've synched everybody
to the same bullshit story.

1227
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:11,135
This is
a Pershing missile, Chip.

1228
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:13,238
My name is Chet.

1229
01:16:13,315 --> 01:16:19,550
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.

1230
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:21,351
[Burp]

1231
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:25,717
Hi, Nanny.
Hi, Grampy.

1232
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,060
I'm not a moron.

1233
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:31,565
I...

1234
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:35,560
Was that
my grandparents?

1235
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:42,710
Are they dead?

1236
01:16:42,778 --> 01:16:44,973
No. They're
just resting.

1237
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:47,982
What are they
doing in here?

1238
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,484
<i>I put them in there</i>.

1239
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:55,649
<i>They weren't having</i>
<i>a very good time</i>
<i>at the party</i>.

1240
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:59,660
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>they're having a good time</i>

1241
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:02,253
catatonic in a closet?

1242
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,900
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?

1243
01:17:08,971 --> 01:17:12,168
I wouldn't give
a squirt of piss

1244
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,732
for your ass right now.

1245
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:22,308
<i>You guys</i>
<i>get the girls home</i>.

1246
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:24,477
<i>Wyatt,</i>
<i>take the Porsche</i>.

1247
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:26,680
Gary, take the Ferrari.

1248
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,086
The Ferrari?

1249
01:17:28,157 --> 01:17:31,183
I want to be alone
with Chet.

1250
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,125
Good to see you.

1251
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,129
Get out of here!

1252
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:37,688
Take your little
hussies home!

1253
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:44,036
I want to get to
the bottom of this,

1254
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:45,801
A.S.A.F.P.

1255
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,069
Oh, so do I.

1256
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:53,875
First, I'd like to
butter your muffin.

1257
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:56,042
Why must you be
such a wanker?

1258
01:17:56,118 --> 01:17:59,645
Because
I get off on it.

1259
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:02,452
I want you to
keep your big mouth shut

1260
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,186
about everything
that's happened here.

1261
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,991
Treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.

1262
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,895
Oh, really?

1263
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:12,661
Yeah. Really.

1264
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:16,171
I can be
a real serious bitch...

1265
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:20,402
if I don't get
what I want.

1266
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:25,277
Ooh. Hit me
with your best shot.

1267
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:32,118
How fast

I'm really
not this cool.

1295

This is not my suit.

1297

Those people
weren't my friends.

1298
01:21:34,736 --> 01:21:38,172
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1299
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,403
Because I want you
to like me

1301
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:45,980

Well, I'd better
get going.

1304

have to deal with Chet.

1307

Careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.

1308
01:22:21,383 --> 01:22:23,010
Sorry.

1309
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:27,921
That's better.

1310

Turn me back
to normal.

1311
01:22:30,525 --> 01:22:33,392
I haven't done
anything to you.

1312
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:36,397
You've done plenty
to your brother.

1313
01:22:36,465 --> 01:22:37,830
Like what?

1314
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:40,390
You've nagged him,
harassed him...

1315
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:41,902
Huh, me?

1316
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:46,464
Supressed him,
extorted money from him.

1317
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,634
It was done
out of love.

1318
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:52,612
I should give you
a set of elephant balls.

1319
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:54,808
Heeagghh!

1320
01:22:56,985 --> 01:23:01,422
Promise me you'll leave
Wyatt and Gary alone,

1321
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:04,618

1322

Oh, all right.

1323

Shake on it, huh?

1324
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,036
No, thanks.
I'd rather not.

1325
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:17,128
Wait!
Where are you going?

1326
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:20,368
I have to
go and get changed.

1327
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:21,636
What about me?

1328
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:25,612
The effect
will wear off, okay?

1329
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,216
Well?

1330
