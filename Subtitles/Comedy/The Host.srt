Mr. Kim.

5
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,407
I hate dust more than anything.

6
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,913
I'll... I'll clean again.

7
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,712
You don't have to clean up now.

8
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,247
Why don't you dump this first?

9
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,581
That's formalin.

10
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,385
Formaldehyde, to be precise.

11
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:40,295
To be even more precise, dirty formaldehyde.

12
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,200
Every bottle is coated with layers of dust.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,005
Pour them into the sink.

14
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,701
Excuse me?

15
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,406
Just empty every bottle to the very last drop.

16
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,176
It's just... they are toxic chemicals

17
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,047
and the regulation states that...

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,180
Pour them right down the drain, Mr. Kim.

19
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,219
If I pour them in the drain,

20
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,032
they'll run into the Han River.

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,260
That's right.

22
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,869
Let's just dump them in the Han River.

23
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:18,869
But, you know,

24
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,805
this is not just any toxic chemical...

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,809
The Han River is very broad, Mr. Kim.

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:30,678
Let's try to be broad-minded about this.

27
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,384
Anyway,

28
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,289

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,653

That's pretty gross.

34
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,604

35
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,884

36
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,384
No, it moved a second ago.

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,987

38
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,687

39
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,188
That was close.

40
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,992

00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,889
Someone help, please!

180
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,591
There are people in there.
I gotta go help.

181
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,094
Hey, mister, my kid...

182
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,600
Donald, don't go.
Come on, Donald. Come back!

183
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,997
You're gonna get hurt. Donald!

184
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,204
Hey, hey, hey!

185
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,706
Let me help! Let me help!

186
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,209
Hey, man! Hey, man!
You're not gonna get this door open.

187
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,491
Hey!

188
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,601
Donald! Where're you going?

189
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,908
Donald! Come Back!

190
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,475
Faster! Let's go!

191
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,381
Throw it hard!

192
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,184
Donald!

193
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,494
<i>- Semi-finals...

194
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,788
<i>This is the last shot of the semi-finals.</i>

195
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,898
<i>Ooh, now is not the time to
lower her bow.</i>

196
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,193
Shoot!

197
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,902
<i>Because if she goes over the clock...</i>

198
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,902
Shoot!

199
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,802

200
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,807
<i>Oh no! The clock!</i>

201
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,002
You could have just let go.

202
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,306
<i>Park's Achilles'heel

203
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,971
<i>And today it cost her the title.</i>

204
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,879
<i>She shouldn't have done that.
She wasted much time.</i>

205
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:37,785
<i>At this point, Park can only hope Yoon Ock-hee, Kyungbook

Sir!

217
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,397
You have ten minutes to clear the area!

218
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,001
Please take care of your things
and evacuate.

Hyun-seo!

224
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,597
It's bronze. Bronze.

225
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,398
Your aunt
brought you a bronze medal.

226
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,980
Hyun-seo, it's your aunt...

Let go of me!

00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,979
What are you taking pictures of?

234
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,780
What's so goddamn interesting?
Fuck off!

235
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,582
Stop taking pictures!

<i>Calling the owner of a Hyundai car,

Hey lady, how could
you park your car there?

238
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,500
So you screwed up?

239
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,802
I heard everything.

240
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,104
You grabbed some other girl's hand?

241
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,304
You left Hyun-seo on the ground?

242
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,676
Your own daughter!

243
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,875
You call yourself a fucking father?

244
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,579
You son of a bitch!

245
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,588
I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand...

246
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,601
She's so pretty in that photo.

247
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,307
She looks just like her mom
in that photo.

248
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:45,783
Do you think her mom
even knows that she died?

249
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,077
Not a chance.

250
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:52,281
It's been 13 years since she
popped out the baby and ran off.

251
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,586
I'd run away too, dammit.

252
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,890
Are you sleeping? Huh?

253
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,090
Nam-il...

254
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,895
You can sleep at a time like this?

255
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,502
What are you doing to your brother?

256
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:19,083
Her birth was an accident...

257
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,086
and so was her death...

258
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,182
Old people have always said,

259
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:33,594
that an animal which kills a human
should be torn limb from limb.

260
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,394
That it's a human's duty to do so.

261
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:47,109
Until I slit that beast's stomach and
at least find Hyun-seo's body,

262
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,509
I'll never
leave this world in peace.

263
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,887
Attention please!

264
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:05,295
Ladies and gentlemen, those of you
present at the river incident...

265
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,988
there are probably a lot of you here...

266
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:12,593
This is an important matter of
life and death.

267
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,103
Those who were at the scene...

268
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,708
or those who have come
in contact with these people!

269
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,707
Raise your hands!

270
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,680
This isn't something
you should hide.

271
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,476
Raise your hands.

272
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,480
If you go home, it might affect
your families. Raise 'em high!

273
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,287
Hey, mister.

274
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,888
What the hell is going on here?

275
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,296
Fuck, shouldn't you start by
explaining what's happening?

276
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,096
- Yeah
- Explain!

277
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:51,004
An explanation should
be appearing on the TV news now.

278
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,212
To save time, we'll let the news
serve as explanation.

279
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,875
Okay, the news... the news...

280
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,179
- Take off that shit and speak!
- ... isn't on now.

281
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,281
Shit...

282
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,984
Anyway, from this moment.

283
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,688
you fall under our control,
so start moving!

284
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,389
This is for your own safety.

285
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:19,595
We have transport buses
waiting outside now.

286
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,799
Okay, please move toward
the buses in an orderly fashion.

287
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:28,606
That's right. Watch your children.

288
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:35,585
Oh, did anyone here touch or come
into direct contact with the creature?

289
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,484
Um... I didn't touch it.

290
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,491
But some of its blood
got sprayed in my face.

291
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,891
Don't move! Tell him to freeze!

292
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,489
Grab him! Grab that one!

293
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,294
Please remain calm, people.

294
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,598
What are you doing? My son
didn't touch anything!

295
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,205
Let go!

296
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,204
Why are you doing this?

297
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,809
- Gang-du! Get out of there!
- Dad!

298
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,604
- Don't go!
- Dad!

299
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,976
Gang-du, don't worry.
I'm coming with you.

300
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,583

Hello, sir!

- You can't go home.
- What? We can't?

328
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,581

Ah, shit...

333
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,292
It's a squirmy feeling,
like something's there.

334
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,695
It's because
you never take a bath, it's okay.

335
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:07,999
Attention! Numbers 25-40,
raise your hands. Quickly!

336

338
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:19,080
Don't tell anyone

- Mr. Park Gang-du?
- Yes?

340

00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:55,840
Hyun-seo...

354
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,379
<i>- Come quick!
- Hyun-seo</i>

355
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,676
Is it Hyun-seo?

356
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,996
What is it?

357
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,800
Did you see that?

358
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,499
- What?
- Wait a minute.

359
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,785
Sweet!

360
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,083
Hey!

361
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,587
Hey, don't go near the water.

362
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,092
Be careful!

363
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,103
Let's go.
I'm starving.

364
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,106
It's okay, get back in.

365
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Mister! Mister!

366
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,894
Try to turn...

367
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,773
Your daughter, Park Hyun-seo,
a seventh grader at Dangsan Middle School.

368
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,682
She's on the deceased list.

369
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,982
Yes, she goes to Dangsan School...

370
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,560
she's deceased,
but she's not dead.

371
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,098
I mean, she died, but she's still alive.

372
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,601
Now you're talking in circles.

373
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,796
So, she's on the list..

374
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,601
Wait, shut up.

375
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,710
- At any rate, there was a call.
- Right.

376
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:51,679
So shouldn't you be able to
trace the call or something?

377
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,783
Trace the call?

378
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,284
That's not something
we do for just anyone.

379
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,285
Are you even aware
of how complicated that is?

380
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,788
'Just anyone' is that what you said?

381
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,483
Stop it! Step back!

382
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,889
What the...

383
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,794
Please, officer,
let's talk like reasonable people.

384
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,493
- They're just kids, don't...
- What are you doing?

385
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,500
No, I mean...

386
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:17,097
Your daughter never called you
in the first place, okay?

387
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:21,905
Your son had a dream,
but it was so real that...

388
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,176
You don't believe
anything we said?

389
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,782
Now you're obstructing an officer
in the line of duty...

390
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,081
Step back, Nam-joo.

391
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,486
Officer, should I explain it again?

392
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,386
The way it happened was...

393
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,894
I know, I know.
You yourself saw your daughter die.

394
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,191
But she called you
in the middle of the night?

395
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,493
Does that make any sense?
That's completely ridiculous!

396
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,603
A servant of the people,
talking back like that?

397
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,295
- Then what's your problem?
- Just a moment...

398
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,599
Stop!

399
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,705
This is...

400
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,291
This is my daughter Park Hyun-seo.
My daughter...

401
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,792
I'm the creature.

402
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:19,094
I ate her... Okay?
And then...

403
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,808
It happened like this.
This is the sewer.

404
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,974
You don't understand?

405
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,676
He's received
psychological treatment?

406
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,580
He's not a bad man, but he's
in shock. We should understand.

407
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,283
- Hey.
- I knew it!

408
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,590
Officer!
My daughter is alive in the sewer!

409
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,392
- Officer?
- Cut it out!

410
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,591
Your putting on
a damn show doesn't help!

411
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,501
My friend's nephew's husband's
brother-in-law is a cop,

412
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,004
maybe we should contact him...?

413
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,903
Right, I'm sure he'd
bend over backwards for us.

414
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,308
You're a college graduate,
can't you even persuade a cop?

415
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,880
What's college got to do with it?

416
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,677
I put you through school
selling cup ramen, and you...

417
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,683
- Dad.
- Huh?

418
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,789
How long's it been since
she's eaten? Down in the sewer?

419
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,288
What's there to eat down there?

420
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,108
You over there!

421
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,006
Hey blondie, stop!

422
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,373
Run!

423
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,075
Out of the way!

424
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,683
Catch them!

425
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,789
Out of the way! Quick!

426
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,790
This way! Hurry up!

427
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,086
Gang-du, hurry up!

428
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,989
- Which floor?
- Close the door! Quick!

429
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,291
I'm coming down, but I'm
in the elevator, so...

430
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,697
Where is he?

431
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,394
B4 A3?

432
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,002
What did I just say?

433
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,697
B4 A3!

434
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,509
A3. Where's A3?

435
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,375
There it is!

436
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,077
Stop! Catch that car.

437
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,381
Hurry! Open the door!

438
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,287
Go! Step on it!

439
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,395
- Nam-joo!
- Hurry up!

440
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,496
Where is Nam-joo?

441
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,597
Where is she?

442
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,199
Did they catch her?

443
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:29,992
- Oh, shit.
- Where?

444
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,294
Where?

445
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,096
- There, there!
- Where?

446
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:33,601
Over there.

447
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,399
That idiot!

448
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,600
How could you leave
your only sister?

449
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,110
- We can pick her up!
- Pick her up then!

450
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,874
- She's always been slow...
- Mister, can you stop here?

451
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:45,481
Hurry up!

452
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,481
What a dimwit!

453
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,176
- Hurry it up, will you?
- Quick! Quick!

454
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,088
Hey, family!
Everyone stop. Stop the van.

455
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,890
Hey, stop!

456
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,093
Just close it! Close!

457
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,510
Did we make it?

458
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,183
That does it.

459
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,978
This won't do.

460
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,489
<i>The basic fee for pickup and the
items you ordered is 7,400 dollars.</i>

461
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,788
Including the Han River sewer map.

462
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:35,297
Plus, we brushed off
a cop in the parking lot,

463
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,402
and two police cars on the road.

464
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:45,408
Anyway, including hazard fees,
the total is 11,400 dollars.

465
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,408
One of the escaping family...

466
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,809
Wow, Gang-du on TV!

467
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,579
That's my citizen ID photo.

468
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,276
It's from one of those
subway photo booths?

469
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,877
Hey, we should tape this and
show it to Hyun-seo. Daddy on TV...

470
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,388
Jesus...

471
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:08,087
We don't accept these. If you're
short on cash, we accept cards.

472
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,298
We'll just take the card.

473
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,404
<i>The blonde one,
who made direct contact with it.</i>

474
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,602
<i>He's the stupidest of all.</i>

475
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,680
That bitch!
Listen to the mouth on her.

476
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,875
<i>He pounced on me
and slammed me to the floor.</i>

477
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,681
<i>I think he gave me arthritis.
I'll need treatment, I'm sure.</i>

478
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,880
<i>That's what he's like.</i>

479
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,285
I know who she is.

480
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,087
Like we can't recognize her
through that voice disguiser?

481
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,793
But they keep reporting on us.

482
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,899
<i>The superior archer who escaped In addition,
the daughter among the escaped family members</i>

483
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,596
<i>The superior archer who escaped is confinirmed to
be Park Nam-joo, national bronze medalist in archery.</i>

484
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,706
What the hell?
How come there's nothing about me?

485
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,400
There's nothing special about you.

486
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,910
Plenty of unemployed
university grads these days...

487
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,274
I sacrificed my youth for
the democratization of our country,

488
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,385
and those fuckers
won't even give me a job.

489
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,782
The passwords are all 4989?

490
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,483
There's a white truck outside.

491
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,891
It's a disinfection truck,
you can take it.

492
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:19,091
<i>expressed concern that Korea is
not adequately quarantining,</i>

493
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,797
<i>- the infected. The U.S. also...
- Come on, let's go.</i>

494
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,009
That's the truck?

495
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,271
Does it really work?

496
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,182
This is what you got
after spending all your assets?

497
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,281
This gun is...
Fuck, we're not boy scouts.

498
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,393
And why only two disinfectant suits?

499
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,291
So two of us should just
creep around hiding?

500
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,990
Dad, shouldn't this be yellow?

501
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,192
If it's not yellow,
they're bound to catch us.

502
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:55,795
Wow, this map is
the topping on the cake.

503
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,500
The red circles indicate sewers?

504
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,611
You spent 500 dollars on this?

505
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,507
Really?

506
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:06,673
But... I got it from a civil servant
who knows the sewer system.

507
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,581
It's photocopied
on the back of used paper.

508
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,483
Hey, a guard post. Get down!

509
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,184
Cover up, quickly!
Your blonde hair is showing.

510
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,087
Get down quickly!

511
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,792
Whatever, you two handle it.

512
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,002
<i>Biohazard</i>

513
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,191
What? If that's their attitude,
why even bother?

514
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,487
Bunch of lazy bums.

515
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,096
Quiet! Stop.

516
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,782
Mr. Park?

517
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,488
Mr. Bacteria?

518
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,697
Lower your mask.

519
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,398
This definitely
a Daesung disinfectant truck.

520
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,105
But are you Daesung people?

521
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,985
Yes, but we're a different team.

522
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,489
Oh, really?

523
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,391
I'm Manager Cho
from the district office.

524
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,091
Don't you know who I am?

525
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:08,002
You know that 14 different companies
are doing the fumigation on shifts?

526
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,304
But Daesung just
barged in at the end.

527
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,412
To the other companies,
it seems odd.

528
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,480
So I spoke with
President Kwak yesterday...

529
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,781
Not this! No!

530
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,888
Let go...

531
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,598
Manager Cho, this is all I have
with me right now.

532
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,602
Sorry, I'll see you later.

533
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,881
Hey, Gang-du.

534
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,284
Hyun-seo.
It's your Dad.

535
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,385
Hyun-seo!

536
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,163
Hyun-seo!

537
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,776
Park Hyun-seo!

538
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,387
Hyun-seo!

539
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,491
Hyun-seo!

540
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,690
Hyun-seo!

541
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,895
Hyun-seo!

542
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,996
Why does he have to do that?
He's not a kid.

543
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,700
Let him be.

544
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,912
He wants to disinfect himself.

545
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:37,276
He's worried he'll
pass the virus on to Hyun-seo.

546
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,689
Virus...

547
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,393
All of us are fine, why do they
keep going on about a fucking virus?

548
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:50,091
If the government says so,
we have to accept it. What can we do?

549
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,494
Is it the virus
that's making me so sleepy?

550
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,605
Hyun-seo...

551
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,197
Look on the ground for footprints.

552
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:06,175
Hey, did Hyun-seo describe any
special traits of the sewer?

553
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,783
Special traits?

554
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,977
We need some kind of hint here.

555
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,490
Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer.
Look how big this is.

556
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:18,595
Yes, it seems we'll find something.

557
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,792
Yeah, sure!
Wandering blindly through the sewers...

558
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,299
We need to think of a better way.

559
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,201
Stop complaining! Put your time into
searching another sewer instead.

560
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:34,003
Hey tortoise! Just try to keep up.
Slow-ass bronze medalist.

561
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,509
- You wanna die?
- Wait!

562
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,277
Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo!

563
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,680
Turn it off.

564
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,787
Something moved there.

565
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,304
Move!

566
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,969
It's this way!

567
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,880
Get down!

568
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,184
What is this?

569
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,495
It's just water!

570
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,791
God damn it!

571
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,199
How typical of you.

572
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,794
Sorry, Dad.

573
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,602
Did you pee?

574
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,304
Because of the bangs, a little.

575
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,285
Why are they going around shooting?

576
00:49:55,926 --> 00:50:00,590
Wow, this cave really does lead
to the Han River!

577
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,790
It's not a cave, it's a sewer.

578
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,297
They're all connected like this.

579
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,793
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.

580
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,195
Do we really have to go?

581
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,298
So you're not hungry?

582
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,701
No, I'm hungry!

583
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,907
If we do this once,
we'll eat well for a whole month.

584
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,273
- Don't you know that?
- I do.

585
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,796
Wow, there's money too.

586
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,292
Don't touch it.

587
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,594
Why not? I'm taking it.

588
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,193
If we take that too, it's theft.

589
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,896
Put it back now, okay?

590
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,002
We're stealing from this place anyway.

591
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:29,083
Se-joo, this is not theft.

592
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,881
We're now doing 'seo-ri'.

593
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,385
Like melon seo-ri at a farm.

594
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:46,291
Hey, do you even know
what seo-ri means?

595
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,505
No? The generation gap
is pretty big.

596
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:56,101
It's an old borrowing game kids play.
So, seo-ri is a right of the hungry.

597
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,588
Run!
