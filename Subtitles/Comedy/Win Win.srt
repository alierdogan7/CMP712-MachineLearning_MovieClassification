Mm.

He has the regions this weekend, and if
he wins there, he goes on to the states.

01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:11,222
- That's great.
- It is, you know.

1333
01:10:11,223 --> 01:10:13,473
Could be a really good thing for him.

1334
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:16,224
It might even mean a scholarship.
You know?

1335
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:19,938
So I was wondering, actually, if you
wouldn't mind maybe staying around...

1336
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:22,096
another couple of weeks?

1337
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:26,141

to stay in the motel for that long.

we could stay in my dad's house?

probably make that work. Yeah.
