00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,720
Oh, thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,037
Well, congratulate me.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,432
I just managed to finagle reservations
for two at Emilio's.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,310
- How does that sound, honey?
- Sounds good to me, sweetie.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,355
That is wonderful, Willie.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,151
What, is she coming too?
I thought this was gonna be our night.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,797
Oh, for heaven's sake, ALF,
it's Valentine's Day.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,271
Kate and I are looking forward
to spending an evening alone together.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,956
It's what keeps us from becoming bitter.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,914
I'll just spend Valentine's Day alone...

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,676
...without romance, without love...

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,113
...without two bodies
beyond rational thought.

Anyone call while I was gone?

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,718
Oh, please, Willie? Stay home.
We'll order out. It'll be my treat.

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,759
By the way, can I borrow
a couple of hundred till payday?

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,072
I seem to have misplaced
your credit card.

ALF, would you stop that?

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,234
Now, I understand
that this is not an easy time for you.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,754
And, so?

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,516
Actually, that was all.

- What is it?
- Oh, my hands.

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,354
Look at them.
They're shaking like a schoolboy's.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,590
One of my favorite movie stars
just moved into this neighborhood.

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,154
"Louise Beaumont."
Why does that name sound so familiar?

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,030
Oh, she was the aging vamp
in <i>Footlight Fancies...</i>

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,876
...and she was the tap-dancing bag lady
in <i>Broadway and 74th...</i>

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,160
...and she played the Swedish bombshell
in <i>Stage Door Yohnny.</i>

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,950
"I love you, Yohnny, you big yerk."

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,352
Oh, I remember Louise Beaumont.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,160
She was a minor movie star in her day.

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,438
Willie, Louise is a queen...

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,031
...and her castle's just a few blocks
from here.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,433
"Sunset Villa"? ALF, it's not a castle.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,239
It's a retirement home.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,236
It's not unlike the place
I'll be staying in long before my time.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,238
Let's do something mad, Willie.

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,194
Grab your Polaroid.
We'll swing by the home.

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,155
- You're right, that is mad.
- No, no, no. You see...

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,793
...I'll hide while you ask her to sing
the theme from <i>Naughty Señoritas.</i>

Wouldn't be so bad
if you could only carry a tune.

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,840
There. That ought to hold you
till we get to the sitter's.

- We ready to go?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,717
I'm gonna hold my breath
until you take me to see Louise.

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,636
Night, ALF.

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,233
I'm gonna do it again.

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,950
Good night, ALF. We'll bring you
what's left off of our plates.

Oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'm "yumping" for "yoy."

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,880
Willie doesn't understand.
He has his woman.

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,679
Poor schlub.

62
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,436
But, oh, Louise.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,117
That's it. I deserve one night in the sun.

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,597
Oh. But I'll need a clever disguise.

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,549
Maybe Kate's wedding dress.
Haven't worn that in a while.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,914
No. White always makes me look
too busty.

67
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,113
Oh, wow.

68
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,040
This could be Louise's window.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,194
That could be her nightstand.

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,996
Those could be her teeth.

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,558
Just my luck. She's not in them.

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,990

Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us.

Oh, look. You seem like very nice people

I'm gonna level with you.

For those of you
who remember back that far.

106
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,550
Do you eat and drink
like normal humans?

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,352
Depends on who you ask.

108
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
So you're an alien, eh?

you guys were up there somewhere.

Do you know what I think?

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,949
I think he's here to make us young.

- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

We rented it last week. It's the one
that Opie directed, remember?

118
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,591
Oh, yes.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,716
It's an amazing achievement
for an 8-year-old.

120

Let it go, Jack. Let it go.

121

I just came to get a peek
at Louise Beaumont.

122

Just point me to her room.
Can you do that?

123

She's just down the hall.

- She treat all her fans this way?
- Forget about her. Let's talk about you.

You've been all over the universe.

144

What an incredible amount of knowledge
you must have.

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,756
Tell us, what's it like in outer space?

146
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,675

Mind if I use the phone?

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,754
He wants to phone home.

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,719
Just like in that movie <i>Splash.</i>

161
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,273
I swear, if my bones weren't
as brittle as saltines...

162
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,797
- ...I'd be out of here so fast--
- BEN: Hey, what's going on in there?

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,151
Uh-oh. Uh....

164
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,438
Listen. Uh, I'll be in there. Okay?

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,119
Uh, remember, you never saw me.
I don't exist, okay? Bye.

166

He's cute.

167
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay, what are you guys up to?

168
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, we don't have a talking dog
in the other room...

169
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,949
...if that's what you're getting at.

170
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,079
WOMAN: Hurry up, Ben.
The champagne's getting flat.

171
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,356
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'll pay for the damages.

345
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,997
- Come on. We should be going.
- Just a second.

346
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,639
I have to say goodbye now.

347
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,554
I'll always remember you guys.

348
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,599
I only wish you could say
the same about me.

349
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,717
Goodbye, ALF.

350
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,873
I want you to have this.

351
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,072
It's the scarf I wore in
<i>Stage Door Yohnny.</i>

352
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,791
Oh, thank you.

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,199
Wow. I wish I had something
to return the favor.

354
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,478
You already have, dear.

355
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,797
Happy Valentine's Day, ALF.

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,549
- Bye, guys.
JACK: Bye.

358
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,836
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

359
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,393
I don't know why,
but I think I may be proud of you.

360
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,833
Yeah? Save it till we get past
the guy with the tire iron.
