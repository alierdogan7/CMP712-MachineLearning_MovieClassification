There was one with a dog
in a gray van...

and a man in running clothes.

372

l didn't recognize anybody
but the dog.

373
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,724
He looked just like
Johnny Allen's dog...

There was a guy in the house--

he had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray van.

Oh, he knows.

398
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:56,364
We gave him a police set
for Christmas--

not this Christmas,
but last Christmas--

400
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:01,137

a badge and a hat and a whistle.

401
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,579
He took it very seriously.

402
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:03,877
He went around the house...

403
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,440
arresting relatives
for various crimes.

404
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,281

OK, bye.

1445
01:35:09,551 --> 01:35:11,178
Driver,
it's the big old Tudor place...

1446
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,016
with the Christmas lights
in the driveway...

1447
01:35:13,055 --> 01:35:14,420
that hasn't been shoveled.

1448
01:35:14,456 --> 01:35:16,549
-Eh?
-That one right there.

1449
01:35:17,559 --> 01:35:18,583
Oh.

1450
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:21,487
[Hammering]

1451
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:22,929
Um...

1452
01:35:27,703 --> 01:35:29,830
Have you ever had
the chickenpox?

1453
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:31,099
l had the chickenpox...

1454
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:33,937
when Herbert Hoover
was in the White House.

1455
01:35:33,976 --> 01:35:35,637
[Laughter]

1456
01:35:35,677 --> 01:35:37,008

Ah, you don't look
any worse for the wear.

1463
01:35:51,827 --> 01:35:53,454
They couldn't touch me.

1464
01:35:53,495 --> 01:35:55,725
The computer company
that got their chip boosted...

1465
01:35:55,764 --> 01:35:57,095
is giving Alex a reward.

1466
01:35:57,132 --> 01:36:00,124
lt's a 6-figure sum,
which is extremely cool.

1467
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:03,634
So, did you bring me anything?

1468
01:36:03,672 --> 01:36:05,867

JACK: Think you can drive that?

ALEX: l think we can handle it.

1472
01:36:13,882 --> 01:36:15,008
PARROT: Awk!

1473
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,610
Gentlemen, start your engines!

1474
01:36:17,653 --> 01:36:19,621
360, 360!

1475
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:24,655
Man overboard!

1476
01:36:26,294 --> 01:36:28,194
Say cheese.

1477
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:30,323
ROCK SlNGER: This is my town.

1478
01:36:30,365 --> 01:36:32,629
Watch your step

1479
01:36:32,668 --> 01:36:34,932

Coming from the nowhere.

1488
01:36:55,158 --> 01:36:57,683
Sliding 'cross the clover.

1489
01:36:57,727 --> 01:36:59,888
Hello, Lady Slick.

1490
