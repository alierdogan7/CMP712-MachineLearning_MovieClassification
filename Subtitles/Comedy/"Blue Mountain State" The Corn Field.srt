00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,796
The scandal that has rocked
the college football world--

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,640
12 starters from
Blue Mountain State,

3
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:06,442
as well as head coach
Marty Daniels

4
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:09,179
have been suspended by the NCAA
for various rule violations

5
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:12,218
and not allowed to participate in
the National Championship game.

6
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:16,090
Before the suspensions Blue Mountain
State was favored by three points,

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,627
<i>but by game time</i>

8
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:21,165
<i>Blackwell U</i>
<i>was favored by 17.</i>

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,801
Feels good
to be a champion.

10
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:25,872
That was the easiest game
we've played all year by far.

11
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,041
You know, we didn't want
to win it this way.

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,579
We wanted
to beat their best--

13
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:35,252
Thad Castle, Moran,
coach Daniels.

14
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,654
And it sucks

15
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,124
because now there's
always gonna be doubters.

16
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:41,626
And doubters should know
that we'd play

17
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:44,597

- Anywhere.

by five touchdowns,

20
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:52,039
<i>our offense took</i>
<i>its foot off the gas.</i>

21

24

25

I'm sitting here tonight

26

171
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,509
I heard that, Larry.

172
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,778
And God heard that too

173
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,480
and he's on my side
right now.

174
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:32,316

I'd shut up.

I say screw BMS.

178

You should be coaching
pros anyway, Marty.

179
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,929
Call Jerry Jones.

180
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,831
He'll hire you.
He'll hire anybody.

181
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:47,667
Hey, coach,

182
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,769
I just wanted
to say goodbye

183
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,337
and thank you
for ruining my career.

184
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:52,739
You did that to yourself.

185
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,708
Oh, no, I did not bring
shame to this program

186
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,776
with an NCAA scandal.
That was you.

187
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,612
You wanted your shot
and you got it.

188
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:01,281
But you couldn't handle it and
now you want to blame me, right?

189
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,783
Yeah? If you could just control
your players a little bit better,

190
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:05,418
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

191
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,788

- Coach, come on.

192

Hey, I don't ever want to see your
face in this locker room again.

193

from another sideline next
year, you cheating has-been!

They are in no shape
to play football.

What the hell happened
to your face?

351
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,445
Blackwell did this
to me, man.

352
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,181
They jumped me
and the cheerleaders

353
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,850
for no reason.
I didn't do anything.

354

nothing to me

Yes, Moran.

You're gonna regret
that decision, Moran.

Okay, I don't know
how we got here,

380

- now is the time to let it all out.
- That's right, that's right.

386

Let's show 'em what
real champions looks like.

- Yeah.
- Hmm?

520
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,022
Tell me I'm the greatest coach
that ever lived.

521
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:55,362
You are the greatest coach
that ever lived.

522
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,901
You always come through
for me, buddy.

523
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,972
You want some, Alex?

524
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,341
No, he doesn't.
He needs to focus.

525
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,842
<i>I</i> need to focus?

526
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,145
How did you talk me into this
in the first place?

527
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,747
- This is a stupid idea!
- This isn't over yet!

528
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,649
Might as well be!

529
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:19,619
All right,
everybody listen up.

<i>That was the worst half of football

But it's behind us.

532
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,695
<i>You know, what I said</i>
<i>before the game</i>

533
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:30,198
about how this game
was about sticking it

534
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:33,300
to all the people
who wronged us.

535
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:35,769
<i>Well, I was wrong.</i>

536
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:38,806
This game should be
a celebration.

<i>There's no money.</i>

<i>There's no bullshit.</i>

539
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:47,746
It's just football.

540

I want you all
to close your eyes

541
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:53,485
<i>and think about the
first time in your life</i>

<i>how much you love</i>
<i>this game.</i>

544
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,129
What a beautiful day.

545
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,999
You know, Thad, there's no
money in rollerblading.

546
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,000
- So what?
- I'm just saying

547
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,903
you can make a billion
dollars playing football.

548
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:12,305
A billion dollars?

549
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,209
Thanks, dad.
I love you!

550
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,183
Hit this, little cousin,

551
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,987
and you can smoke a bowl
out of each bong.

552
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,958
Yeah!

553
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:36,128
Pack 'em up,
cousin Denis.

554
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,696
Yes.

Man, I love football
so much.

Me too.

560
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:13,001
Daniels: <i>Now I want you to
do another thing for me.</i>

561
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,538
I want you to stop
playing this game

562
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:18,041
for that
crystal trophy

563
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:21,211
and play this game
for that moment.

564
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,918
All right,
everybody listen up.

565
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,920
We've been running screens
to the left all game,

566
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,991
but in the championship game that was
their strongest side of the line.

567
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,160
Moran, I want you to fake
a screen to the right,

568
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,029
drawing over
the left side.

569
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,398
And that leaves the middle
wide open for a draw.

570
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,333
I've been faking screens all day.
They've been all over me.

571
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:43,736
That's 'cause you're not
selling it, Moran.

572
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,604
You've got to make them
believe that when you pump,

573
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,339
that ball is going to
leave your hand

574
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:49,742
just like you make
every single girl believe

575
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,044
that she's
the only one for you

576
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,580
right before
you take them to bed.

577
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,750
- Hmm?
- Sounds mean when you say it like that.

578
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,753
- Yeah.
- It's a pretty good metaphor though.

579
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:02,288

- Yeah!

580

milk from a cow's tit

to play for that moment,
