1
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,893
Surprise!

2
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,988
Thanks for helping this summer.
Have a great year at school, Paige.

3
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,544
Hey, what happened
to the Lamborghini?

4
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:30,364
I'm quite bored of the Lamborghini.
Ready to lose?

5
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,157
I've won Grand Prix.
What have you won?

6
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,531
Nothing.

7
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,907
And you're gonna beat me
in your mummy's limo?

8
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:37,920
To be correct, Mr. Irvine, I'm going
to beat you in my mummy's limo,

9
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,056
to which I've made
numerous modifications.

10
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:41,883
So you should be afraid, my friend.

11
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,149
Not half as afraid as you're gonna
be when your mummy finds out.

12
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:04,699
- Hey, how was it?
- Oh, it was great.

13
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,556
They had a going-away
Danish for me.

14
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:09,729
And as soon as I blew out the candle,
Trey Carlson came in

15
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,962
with this huge bloody gash
on his forehead.

16
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:14,551
- He tried to give himself a haircut.
- Good going, Trey.

17
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:16,893
The cool part was they let me
stitch it up for him.

18
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,489
- Time check?
- 9:45.

19
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,612
Racers ready?

20
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:37,753
Go.

21
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:55,996
Hi.

22
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,289
No!

23
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,316
Look out!

24
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,730
Hi.

25
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,569
Great dress.

26
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,126
Good race, Your Highness.

27
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,731
Not exactly the way
I wanted to win.

28
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,226
It'd been better if you hadn't
lifted your foot off at the end.

29
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:03,803
- No, you did great.
- Congratulations.

30
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,918
- And then there were two.
- It's not that bad.

31
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,564
No, they seem really happy. I...

32
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,830
I just remember how much we used
to talk about getting out there

33
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,305
and following our dreams.

34
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:42,909
There's a whole world out there to see.
You too. We're the last holdouts.

35
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:47,868
Todd and I are engaged.

36
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,418
- Don't hate me.
- That's great.

37
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:56,835
- Why would I hate you? No.
- Oh, thanks.

38
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,425
- OK, ladies.
- Oh, look.

39
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,148
Betsy's throwing the bouquet.

40
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,510
Are you ready, ladies?

41
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:10,171
One, two, three.

42
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,780
I caught it!

43
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:39,012
- He is late every time.
- Yes.

44
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,344
It's OK, I've got it.
Thank you.

45
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:44,227
Thank you.

46
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,461
- Edvard.
- Hi, Ari.

47
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,063
His Majesty, the king.
Her Majesty, the queen.

48
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,265
His Royal Highness, the crown prince.

49
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,764
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Arabella.

50
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,021
Here we are, honey.

51
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:21,216
- Hope to see you at Thanksgiving.
- All right, I love you, Dad.

52
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,520
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye. Thanks.

53
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,565
- Hello?
- Paige, hey.

54
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,002
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God.

55
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,107
Good. How psyched
are you to be back?

56
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,449
Yeah, but this year we do the dishes
every three weeks

57
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,053
whether we need to or not.

58
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,636
And by "we", I mean you.

59
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,710
Oh, look what my dad
hooked me up with.

60
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:49,372
Yeah. He may be totally
inaccessible emotionally,

61
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,258
but he does know how
to install some really cool crap.

62
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,204
Well, enjoy it. I'll be lucky
if I'm ever home this year.

63
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,748
I've got a five-hour chem lab, plus
med-school applications and work.

64
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,154
Hey, hey, classes
haven't even started yet.

65
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,911
Before you start saving the world,

66
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,314
you could come to the Rat
with me, Stacey and Amanda.

67
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:11,302
So at this point in the trip, me and
the other tour leaders are just...

68
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:13,088
- We're fed up with all these
- OK, OK.

69
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,523
rich, snotty kids
and all of their complaining.

70
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:20,639
So one night in Rome,
we go to this bar,

71
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,175
and I kind of slept with a 45-year-old
cheesy ltalian guy.

72
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,716
Forty-five? Wow.

73
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:31,141
Well, he was cute
in a Mussolini kind of way.

74
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,621
- What are you gals talking about?
- Our love for older, virile men like you.

75
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:39,524
A few more of these and believe me,
I'll be the best-looking guy in here.

76
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,622
- Then you better take Stacey's away.
- Oh, yes, please.

77
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,660
- You want back on the work rotation?
- Yeah, definitely.

78
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,706
- How's tomorrow?
- How's Thursday?

79
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,234
- How's tomorrow?
- Tomorrow it is.

80
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:52,925
All right.
This round's on me.

81
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,654
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

82
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,099
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

83
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,888
I can't believe you got
to see all of Europe.

84
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:04,509
I wish I could fast-forward
through the next five years...

85
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,849
I hate when she starts
to talk about her life plan.

86
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,316
- It makes me feel so unfocused.
- Tell me about it.

87
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,910
I'm a senior, and I've changed
my major, like, six times.

88
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,892
- I don't even have a major.
- Oh, please.

89
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:16,739
By the time you get one,
Paige will be done with Johns Hopkins.

90
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:19,140
- That's if I get in.
- You'll get in.

91
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:22,150
No. Not after this semester.
I have to take Shakespeare.

92
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,003
Some sort of stupid
humanities requirement.

93
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,785
That's it. The next time you talk
about classes or work,

94
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,162
you have to do a shot.

95
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,148
It's just that Shakespeare
is so useless...

96
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,718
Stop.

97
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,115
- Hey, guys, I need this.
- Hey.

98
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,905
- Here you go.
- No.

99
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,006
- No, come on.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,028
- What is this?
- Drink it. Drink it.

101
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:42,881
- It's your first night.
- Cheers.

102
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:46,275
- Cheers.
- That's good.

103
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,558
Oh, I hate you guys.

104
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:55,590
Did you read all the prepared
research materials?

105
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,962
Of course.

106
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,265
Edvard, one day,
you will be the 51 st ruler

107
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:00,806
of the longest continuous monarchy

108
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,203
- in the history of the world.
- Yes, I'm aware, Father.

109
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,150
It's a monarchy that still requires
the participation of the king

110
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,614
in the workings and decisions
of the government.

111
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,086
So if I ask you if you're prepared,
it's not an insignificant question.

112
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,847
Father, I'm prepared, OK?

113
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,766
His Majesty, the king.

114
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:28,040
And His Royal Highness,
the crown prince.

115
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,622
- Your Majesty.
- I'm all right.

116
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,753
- Prime minister.
- Your Royal Highness.

117
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,374
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get started.

118
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,959
But a six-percent pay increase
is the least

119
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,688
the national unions will accept.

120
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,677
- That's unconscionable.
- Look.

121
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:47,556
If we can't agree, how are we
gonna get the two sides together?

122
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:48,898
This is blackmail.

123
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,430
All right, we'll have to make
other concessions then.

124
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,732
Is there no end
to the workers' demands?

125
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:58,311
Our government must refuse
to give in to the unions at all costs.

126
00:11:58,538 --> 00:11:59,879
I appreciate your ardor, Thomas,

127
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,593
but I assure you they are very serious
about the deadline.

128
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:04,680
Without concessions,
they will strike.

129
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:07,556
A nationwide strike will be
disastrous for our economy.

130
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,022
Edvard, I'm sure we'd all like
to know what you think.

131
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,629
Sorry, what was the question?

132
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,667
I was... I was busy.

133
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,582
I see.

134
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:23,967
I don't know why my father
insists I go with him.

135
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,497
- I've always detested those meetings.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,893
Perhaps it has something
to do with the fact that,

137
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,064
I don't know, you're going
to be king someday.

138
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,338
Yes, don't remind me, Soren.

139
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,890
You're very lucky you're not me,
let me tell you.

140
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,799
If you want to change places, sir,
call me day or night.

141
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,294
You know my mother's
gonna go crazy

142
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:49,352
when she finds out
what happened today.

143
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,196
It's a speech I definitely
don't want to hear.

144
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:55,241
I need to get out of Denmark,
Soren. I need to clear my head.

145
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh, yes, and where would you like
to clear your head this time, sir?

146
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:02,343
I hear the slopes are opening
early in St. Moritz this year.

147
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,163
Monte Carlo has opened a new casino.

148
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,500
Dropping a few hundred thousand
kroner always seems

149
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,088
to have worked miracles in the past.

150
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,848
Warning.
The following commercial...

151
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,676
Wait, no time for that.
Watch this!

152
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,143
For years, Desperate Dan
has been talking real women

153
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,372
into doing the most outrageous things.
And he's captured it all on tape.

154
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,903
And now Desperate Dan takes you
to America's heartland

155
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,302
to bring you Wild College Girls:

156
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,701
The Girls of Wisconsin.

157
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:30,856
Oh, please. Come on, take your
top off for us. Come on, Just once.

158
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,385
- Wisconsin?
- Yes.

159
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,139
Why there, son?

160
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,600
Because I've never spent
much time in America before.

161
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,801
And I'd rather go
to the heart of the country

162
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,141
where I can meet ordinary Americans.

163
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,663
Plus, there's a well-respected
university with interesting programs

164
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,761
and a wide variety
of extracurricular activities.

165
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,865
But this is absurd.

166
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,464
Look, I see this as a real
opportunity to find myself.

167
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,178
Oh, Edvard, please.

168
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:03,167
This is just another
in a series of escapades.

169
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,983
Which, by the way, we finance.

170
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,237
Inevitably ending up with you
in some tabloid, embarrassing us

171
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,053
and forcing you to come back
to the palace to hide yourself

172
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,934
until you convince us you have to go
and find yourself yet again.

173
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,919
If I'm the embarrassment
you believe me to be,

174
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:20,641
then maybe you should cut me off.

175
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,809
- Well, what are you saying?
- I'm saying I want to go and I'm going.

176
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,695
And I neither require your money
nor your permission.

177
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:33,449
- Edvard!
- I will do this on my own, Mother!

178
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:38,825
Let him go.

179
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,088
We've tried evertyhing else,
and it doesn't work, so...

180
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,893
Frankly, it's encouraging
he even wants to try.

181
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,795
Soren. You will go with him.

182
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,488
Me, Your Majesty?

183
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,024
On my own?

184
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,521
Surely there's a caretaker
better suited than...

185
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,963
I will arrange for our departure.

186
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:20,230
- Hey!
- Slow down.

187
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,302
Just look at them all, Soren.

188
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,695
Thousands upon thousands of young,
crazy college girls getting drunk

189
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,477
- and taking their tops off.
- Yes, sir, what a treat for us

190
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,585
that it's happening here
in America's dairy land.

191
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,038
Breeding ground of the coronary
bypass patients of the world.

192
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,730
Look at her.

193
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,201
Your parents are expecting you
to attend your classes,

194
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:46,633
- Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, I know.

195
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,711
Listen, Soren.

196
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:51,329
From this point forward,
I do not want you to address me

197
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:53,670
as the prince
or Your Royal Highness.

198
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:57,610
You will address me as...Eddie.

199
00:15:57,804 --> 00:15:59,691
Yes, Eddie.

200
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,666
The last thing I need right now
is to have the press all over me.

201
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,793
- I think it's gonna be fun.
- I'm having a wonderful time already.

202
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,183
- Are you unhappy, Soren?
- What gave me away, sir?

203
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,023
I don't know. Your expression
never changes.

204
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,838
- Do you even know how to smile?
- Yes.

205
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:42,599
Oh, Soren, this is us.

206
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,627
Good heavens.

207
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,859
I thought you had to be
convicted of a crime

208
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,907
before you lived
somewhere like this.

209
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:01,670
It's not that bad.

210
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,141
Plus, we haven't seen
the rest of it yet.

211
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,581
Apparently, this is the rest of it.

212
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:19,303
Well, I like it. And I'll even let you
have first choice of the beds.

213
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:20,929
Oh, heavens.

214
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,843
Which stained mattress
shall I choose?

215
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,404
You the new guys?

216
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:34,509
I'm Scotty.

217
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:39,912
All right, all my food's labeled,
so I'll know if you ate anything.

218
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:45,379
I'm allergic to dairy, shellfish,
red meat, melon, nuts and kiwi.

219
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,330
So don't bring any
of that stuff around here.

220
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:55,149
The Xbox is off-limits.
If you screw up any of my high scores,

221
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:58,189
I'll blind you with my laser pointer.

222
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:04,232
Now, this... This is the real university
life I was talking about.

223
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,725
You see, here, we're just two
typical college students.

224
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:11,714
Absolutely, sir. I, for one, can't wait
to raucously cheer on the fellows

225
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,113
of the tackle football team
as they challenge the Gophers,

226
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,921
our hated rivals, who apparently hail
from a place called Minnesota.

227
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:22,827
Minnesota sucks!
Wisconsin rules!

228
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,867
No, no.

229
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,724
Waitress, we'd like to see
some menus, please.

230
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,676
I'm not a waitress, there are no
menus, and the kitchen's closed.

231
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,030
Well, then what can you offer us?

232
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:06,952
I can offer you beer and pretzel rods,
my fine fellow, at ye old pub yonder.

233
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,450
- Shall I go to the bar, sir?
- Yes. Yes, two of these. Two beers.

234
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:18,792
Very good.

235
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,037
Would you like another, sir?

236
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:41,770
- Yes, I'll get these.
- Thank you very much, sir.

237
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,791
- Hello again.
- What can I get for you?

238
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,116
I was hoping you could
recommend something better

239
00:19:58,352 --> 00:19:59,661
than what we've been drinking.

240
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:02,125
Well, for the discerning
out-of-towner like yourself,

241
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,549
I recommend Leinenkugel's. You can
really taste the extra 1 0 cents.

242
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,396
Yes, by all means. Two, please.

243
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:24,875
You know, if we were in Germany
right now, we'd be underground.

244
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:27,919
- What?
- Rathskeller, it means basement.

245
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,628
OK.

246
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:34,061
Yes, perhaps I should've known
better than to flirt in German.

247
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:35,750
Perhaps.

248
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,223
It's not a very attractive language, is it?

249
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,325
No.

250
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,401
- I'm Eddie.
- Paige.

251
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:54,308
- So will you take your top off for me?
- What?

252
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:57,359
Take your top off for me
like Wild College Girls.

253
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:01,129
Just a quick look. No one's watching.
Just take it off for me.

254
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,713
- You, time to go.
- Just calm down.

255
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:10,472
- No, you calm down.
- Get off me.

256
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:12,679
- You get out.
- Get your hands off me.

257
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,992
Out. Go on!

258
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:18,315
Science is a never-ending quest.

259
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:24,207
For anyone planning a future
in science, an open mind is a must.

260
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,806
Grading is as follows:

261
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:30,028
Forty percent, procedure.

262
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:33,868
Fifty percent, lab work.
And ten...

263
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,383
May I help you?

264
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:44,041
Yes. I believe I'm signed up
for this class.

265
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:50,287
Fine, Mr. Williams. Next time be here
by 8:20, or you'll be locked out.

266
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:54,184
And what about you?
I'm talking to you, sir.

267
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:58,286
- I'm auditing.
- Not this class, too small.

268
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,041
Take a seat, Mr. Williams.

269
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:04,550
As I was saying,
forty percent, procedure.

270
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:06,858
- Fifty percent, lab work.
- You can wait outside.

271
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,064
- You'll be all right, sir?
- And ten percent...

272
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,818
- Yes, just wait outside.
- You know, if this is a "lovers' thing",

273
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:13,511
could you please take it
in the hall?

274
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,553
Soren, just go. Go.

275
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:20,616
My sincerest apologies.

276
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:30,955
Oh, please proceed.

277
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:36,397
And ten percent, attendance.

278
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,497
You will find a list in front of you
of your supplies

279
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,308
and the experiment
you will be conducting.

280
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:47,816
Now, I want you to turn to the person
next to you and introduce yourself.

281
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:52,399
Congratulations, folks, you've just said
hello to your permanent lab partner.

282
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,508
Hey. Hey.

283
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:01,192
You forgot your supply list.

284
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,697
Oh, right, thank you.

285
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,135
- Listen, what's your name again?
- Eddie.

286
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:10,508
Eddie. Right.
This class is really important to me

287
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:12,975
because I need this teacher
to get me into med school.

288
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,795
And if I'm stuck with you
as my partner,

289
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,360
I can't afford to have you
screw things up for me, OK?

290
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:21,198
It's very important to me, as well.
I love organic chemistry.

291
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,241
I've recently discovered
that large amounts

292
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:27,336
of alcohol mixed with a carbon-based
life form causes the life form

293
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,879
to blurt out stupid things.
So apologies to the other night.

294
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,804
I was just having some fun.

295
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:37,067
Of course you were. And I love being
made to feel like a brainless slut

296
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,850
by some sloppy lush. Thanks.

297
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,563
I have learned me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition

298
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:47,720
To you and your behest, I am enjoined
And beg your pardon

299
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:50,312
Is he drunk now?

300
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,480
It's a play. Romeo and Juliet?

301
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:56,941
Shakespeare?

302
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:00,490
This is gonna be a fun semester.

303
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,926
Don't forget your half
of the supplies next time.

304
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,761
You would think that
after spraying somebody

305
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,500
with high-powered soda,
he'd get the message to stay away.

306
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,601
Well, I think he's pretty hot.

307
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:24,810
Hot? Oh, my God, Beth,
he is so affected.

308
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:30,280
He was quoting Shakespeare, like
some Shakespearean-duke-lord guy.

309
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:32,043
I hate phonies like that.

310
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:35,309
So are you saying you wouldn't
take him up to the stacks?

311
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:39,881
OK. A, going at it in the dusty stacks
of the library is fairly disgusting.

312
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:43,213
And B, you literally say that
about every hot guy.

313
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:44,720
Oh, so you admit he's hot.

314
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,475
OK, I'm done having
this conversation.

315
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:49,457
I need to concentrate
on my applications.

316
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:56,617
And what's with his weird friend
who's always hanging around?

317
00:24:57,235 --> 00:25:01,064
One partner is monitoring
temperature and flow,

318
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:06,983
while the other pours the hydrochloric
acid into the separatory funnel.

319
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:08,843
Now...

320
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,008
...carefully turn the stopcock

321
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:18,538
to allow some of the solution
to flow into the round-bottom flask.

322
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,410
Start over again.

323
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,140
Where is he?

324
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,778
- You're still in bed?
- Good morning, miss.

325
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:47,400
Would you care for some breakfast?

326
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:50,189
I spent the last two hours
looking like an incompetent idiot

327
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,144
because my lab partner
didn't show up.

328
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,801
- Was that this morning?
- Yes!

329
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,530
You know, I know exactly
who you are.

330
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:56,909
- You do?
- You do?

331
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:59,628
You're a spoiled, little rich kid
who sees college as a detour

332
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:01,005
on the way to an easy life.

333
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,480
No character.
No accomplishments.

334
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:05,937
- Just a royal pain in the ass.
- You're completely wrong.

335
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,416
See, unlike people who are given
evertyhing, I have to earn what I get.

336
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:12,236
But that is the beauty
of a meritocracy.

337
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:14,671
People rise and fall
based on how hard they work.

338
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:16,330
Would you like some
more hollandaise?

339
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,214
- No, that's good. Thank you.
- You're making eggs Benedict?

340
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,479
- On a hot plate in a dorm room?
- Yes, just a typical student breakfast.

341
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:24,873
Would you care to join us?

342
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:26,254
No, thank you.

343
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:30,665
- So where's your statue?
- What statue?

344
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:32,558
Someone as righteous as you
must have

345
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,000
a statue of themselves
somewhere.

346
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,585
There's a difference between
being righteous and being right.

347
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:39,439
I happen to be right. Could you
please put a shirt on or something?

348
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,702
If you're going to be a doctor,
you'll have to get used to naked men.

349
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,681
Dude! Dude, there's a chick
in our room.

350
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:48,462
- Just drop the class.
- No.

351
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:51,181
Well, then you better be there,
and you better be prepared.

352
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,744
She really meant those things,
didn't she?

353
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:04,013
Yes, she did seem rather upset, sir.

354
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:07,851
Though, regardless,
I don't see why you would care.

355
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,494
Do enjoy the eggs, sir. They were
purchased with the last of your money.

356
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:15,091
- We have some left, don't we?
- What you came with is gone.

357
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:18,411
Well, you're getting some
sort of paycheck, aren't you?

358
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,620
Hey, you cheap Swede.

359
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:29,811
"Skills: polo, fencing, speak French,
English, German, Dutch,

360
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:31,434
"Danish and Flemish".

361
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:34,927
Flemish? Is there
a country called Flem?

362
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:40,400
Look, that's all great,
but it doesn't mean crap to me.

363
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:43,052
I need somebody with work
experience, and you don't have any.

364
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:44,714
I really could do
with the employment.

365
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,185
There are a lot of students
who wanna work here.

366
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,967
Well, I have the highest
recommendation.

367
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,202
- Hey, Paige.
- Hi.

368
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,435
Are you deliberately trying
to make me miserable?

369
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,936
No, I'm simply manning
the delicatessen in the event

370
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,555
that one of my fellow students
wants a tasty sandwich.

371
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:12,565
- Stu, did you hire this guy?
- Yeah. He came highly recommended.

372
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:13,968
- By whom?
- You.

373
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:15,823
- What would you like?
- A turkey sandwich.

374
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:19,600
Paige, I'm busy. Eddie's your boy.
You're in charge of him.

375
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:22,612
All right, it seems we're completely
out of turkey today.

376
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:25,517
Dude, there's like ten turkey
things in there.

377
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:30,228
Is this some sort of test?

378
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:32,909
Did Johns Hopkins send you to see
if I can handle pressure?

379
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,859
- Because I'm starting to crack.
- Well, who's in charge of carving?

380
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:38,093
- Use the slicer.
- What's that?

381
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:44,272
You used me as a reference.

382
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,258
Yes. Look, you were
the only one I knew.

383
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,975
Despite what you think,
I do need this job. I have no money.

384
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,732
But you have a personal egg poacher.

385
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,940
No, no. He's just another student.

386
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,596
Really? What's he studying?
How to be a 30-year-old junior?

387
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,684
Try the "on" button.

388
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,204
Look, Paige. You were right
about my parents back in Denmark.

389
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:07,221
They are from a certain wealth.

390
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:08,789
But I've cut myself off from them.

391
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,355
Dude.

392
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:12,438
Yes, just one minute.

393
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:18,733
Listen, Paige. I realize I've taken
advantage of you recently, and...

394
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:22,284
But just give me a chance today, and
if I cause any problems, then I'll quit.

395
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:28,753
OK. Your right hand
goes on the handle.

396
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,958
Slowly slide the meat
back and forth.

397
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,068
And unless you want
a turkey-thumb sandwich,

398
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,628
don't put your hand near
the blade when it's moving, OK?

399
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:38,066
Right.

400
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:40,236
OK.

401
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,417
- Slowly, slowly.
- Right.

402
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:51,825
Right.

403
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,127
OK, nice and smooth.

404
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,302
That's enough.

405
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:19,058
- Here, Paige, it's your turn tonight.
- OK.

406
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:34,897
Hey, kid.

407
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,166
I need you to go outside
and hose down the mats.

408
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,477
Are you sure you don't
want a hand, sir?

409
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:53,876
- No, I'm fine.
- Good night.

410
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,758
Hey.

411
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,254
You did OK in there.

412
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,355
- You can't be serious, can you?
- Well, by "OK", I mean

413
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:09,781
spilling a ton of beer
and screwing up everyone's order.

414
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,327
- Yeah.
- No, you'll be fine.

415
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:24,016
You know, this Saturday evening,
there's a dorm party at Brenner Hall.

416
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:25,394
A gathering.

417
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,649
I was wondering if you would like
to accompany me.

418
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,891
Accompany you?

419
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:35,318
Oh, right, yes.
How do you say it colloquially?

420
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:38,262
Yo, dog, there's a mad party
kicking at my crib,

421
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,752
if you want to roll
down there with me.

422
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:45,521
That was just sad.
Don't ever do that again.

423
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,608
Yes, I really hurt my finger.

424
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:49,813
So would you like to come?

425
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,858
I...

426
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,479
I'm actually kind of busy.

427
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,474
Oh, dear.

428
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:09,621
- What?
- I believe you just got rejected, sir.

429
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:13,743
You know, I don't think that's ever
happened to me before.

430
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:15,472
You've never been attracted
to anyone

431
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,560
who didn't know
you were a prince before.

432
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:20,464
I wouldn't get too worked up
over it, sir.

433
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:23,441
The chances of a relationship
between yourself and Miss Paige

434
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:24,983
are not promising.

435
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,111
You two are of
a completely different caliber.

436
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:32,242
Soren, just because she isn't royalty
doesn't mean she's not important.

437
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,449
The higher caliber
I was referring to, sir,

438
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,274
was hers.

439
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:38,131
What?

440
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,326
Miss.

441
00:33:52,442 --> 00:33:54,514
You really must get some rest,
Your Majesty.

442
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:57,648
I'm relieved there wasn't
more to it than this.

443
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:01,269
- There'll be more of these tests, yes?
- I can't say for sure.

444
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:03,254
- There'll be several tests?
- There might be.

445
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,522
- Will this take many days?
- No, I'm pretty sure

446
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,860
- we can get them out of the way.
- Thank you, doctor.

447
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,514
I don't think you need to go to this.

448
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,747
- I promised I'd go.
- Are you feeling ill, Daddy?

449
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,564
There's nothing to worry about,
my darling.

450
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,708
Yes, Arabella.

451
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:24,946
You shouldn't worry.

452
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,055
Just a little flu.

453
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,290
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's time for His Majesty to be going.

454
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:32,111
Sweetie.

455
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,371
So, what would you like to do today?

456
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,642
- Horse riding.
- Good idea.

457
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,598
Duty calls.

458
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,915
Shit.

459
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,687
Positive for ketone.

460
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:10,258
Mr. Williams, please do something.

461
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:18,964
So you know the other day
when you quoted Romeo and Juliet?

462
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,295
- Yes.
- Well, it's funny

463
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:26,103
because I'm actually taking
a Shakespeare class myself and...

464
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,982
I'm not struggling,
I'm actually being graded unfairly.

465
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,999
But I was wondering,
since you seem to be...

466
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,787
Well-versed.

467
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:36,345
Yeah. Well, I was hoping
maybe you could...

468
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,913
Help you.

469
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,114
- No, I don't need help.
- Oh, OK.

470
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:42,737
Just sounded like you were
asking me for help, that's all.

471
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:44,978
Forget it.

472
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:49,912
Yeah, OK, I need help.

473
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:52,656
Yes, I'll help you.
It's not a problem.

474
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,536
Only...

475
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:59,152
...I'm going to need some
help of my own first.

476
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:02,170
Pour the bleach like this:

477
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:05,624
And do not spill.

478
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,089
I bet you can't believe
I've never done laundry, can you?

479
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,869
Yeah, it's a real leap.

480
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:18,966
Cold.

481
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,000
Warm.

482
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,382
Cold, cold.

483
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,667
It's just so confusing. I mean, how do
you know what goes in which pile?

484
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,674
It's a gift. I guess you could
say I'm the Rain Man of laundry.

485
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:39,186
OK, now it's my turn.

486
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,623
We did King Lear,
and now we're on the Sonnets.

487
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,049
Next, it's Hamlet, which is about
a whiny prince from Denmark.

488
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:51,994
- What does that have to do with reality?
- More than you think.

489
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:54,227
Well, you're from Denmark,
do you even have princes?

490
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:55,893
Yes, I think we do.

491
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,131
Well, Beth read it, and she said
he's a total loser.

492
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,115
Well, you can tell Beth that the prince
was young and scared,

493
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,058
and he didn't feel ready for
the hard choices he had to make.

494
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:06,870
It's not easy facing
that kind of pressure.

495
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,941
Right. Sonnets, you say.

496
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:23,865
O me!

497
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,027
What eyes hath love put in my head

498
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:30,681
Which have no correspondence
With true sight

499
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:34,167
Or if they have
Where is my Judgment fled

500
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,983
That censures falsely
What they see aright?

501
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,707
It's beautiful.

502
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,683
It's gibberish.
I have no idea what he's saying.

503
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,371
Well, he's saying
that love is magical,

504
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,085
and that it makes people look
at each other in an unspoiled way,

505
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:49,462
without judgment.

506
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:50,871
Why doesn't he just say that?

507
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,589
Why can't people just say
what they mean?

508
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,210
Well, people rarely say
what they mean.

509
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,131
That's the interesting part, is...

510
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:01,464
...is what's going on
underneath the surface.

511
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,013
See, take line 1 2.

512
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:09,304
The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears

513
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:10,809
What does that mean to you?

514
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:15,130
That the sun can't shine
when it's cloudy.

515
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,976
No. You're being too literal.
See, don't just go for the obvious.

516
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,409
See, all these words,
they have multiple meanings,

517
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,513
and you have
to explore the possibilities

518
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,684
and then make your choice.

519
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:29,208
See, like the word "sun",
that could mean the actual sun,

520
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,511
or it can mean light.

521
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,557
But then "light" can mean
knowledge or reason.

522
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,023
That could go on forever.

523
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,135
Yes. Yes, it could.

524
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:41,529
But I think in this case
it means reason.

525
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:45,020
And then "heaven" may refer
to the pearly gates,

526
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:47,832
or it could mean a state of being,
you know,

527
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,932
Iike being happy or in love.

528
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:58,170
So now read it again,
taking in all the possibilities,

529
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:00,635
and tell me what you think it means.

530
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:06,580
The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears

531
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,067
I guess it means
that love blinds you.

532
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:19,518
And when you're in love,
you can't think reasonably.

533
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:23,734
Do you agree?

534
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:25,819
Yeah.

535
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,057
I mean, it's just a poem.

536
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:35,987
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a poem.

537
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,848
Are you worried
a union work stoppage

538
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:40,185
will throw the country
into a recession?

539
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,072
That's something
we're striving to avoid.

540
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,571
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Do you think being part of the EU

541
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:45,912
has been good for Denmark?

542
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:48,792
The United States of Europe
is a question of being strong together.

543
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,056
It's another boring photo opportunity
of an old guy walking down a carpet

544
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,392
answering the same questions
he answered last week.

545
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,964
- Where's Edvard?
- Now, you see,

546
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:58,678
he was always good for a big disaster
every few months or so.

547
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:00,723
I've got to find him.

548
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:07,962
Eddie. Hey.

549
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,450
Look.
It's my Shakespeare midterm.

550
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:13,689
A-minus.

551
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,221
That's brilliant.
That's really, really good.

552
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,592
- Well done.
- Thank you.

553
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,758
- Thank you, really, for helping me.
- It's OK.

554
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,930
I did even better on my chemistry.

555
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,447
It's good. That's really good.

556
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,221
- How'd you do?
- How did I do?

557
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:33,751
A minus...

558
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:36,534
-...three grades.
- D-minus.

559
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,451
- Yes, but it doesn't matter.
- Sure it does. You can do better.

560
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,273
I know you can.

561
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:47,669
And give up a brilliant career
in the food-service industry?

562
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:00,916
Hey, Eddie, do you have any plans
for Thanksgiving?

563
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,708
No, no. I'll be here.

564
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:09,364
Have a good vacation.

565
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,388
Yes, you too.

566
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:14,235
I can't believe you.
I can't believe you, Paige.

567
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:16,918
You should've invited him
home with you.

568
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:20,314
What? No. That would be so weird.

569
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:24,374
Well, then you won't mind if I invite
him back to Milwaukee with me?

570
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:27,641
No. No, of course not.
Why would I mind?

571
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,366
I don't know.

572
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,432
Hey, Eddie, since you don't
have any other plans,

573
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:34,809
I was wondering if...

574
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:38,300
You wanted to spend Thanksgiving
with me and my family?

575
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:42,714
Yes, that'd be nice.

576
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:46,165
- Thank you.
- Sure.

577
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,964
I think I probably
should come with you, sir.

578
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:53,369
Oh, no, not this time.

579
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,608
The thing is, you see,
you'll be on your own.

580
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:58,907
- Yes, and I'll manage.
- All right. Later, dudes.

581
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:01,438
Actually, sir, it's my duty
to look out for you at all times.

582
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:03,290
- Soren, I'll be fine.
- With respect, sir,

583
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:07,350
- that's not for you to decide.
- Soren, yes, it is for me to decide.

584
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:12,286
What am I going to do here
for five days?

585
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,781
I don't know. Just sightsee, relax.

586
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:17,148
Soren, you'll be fine, OK?

587
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:31,514
- I'll pick you up Monday.
- Thanks again.

588
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:38,783
- Thank you.
- Hey.

589
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:41,343
Hiya, sweetie.
Oh, it's good to have you home.

590
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:43,293
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, kiddo.

591
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:45,910
This is Eddie.
Eddie, this is my mom and dad.

592
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,957
Oh, we're so glad
that you could join us.

593
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:52,054
The only college friends of Paige's
we've ever met, they've all been girls.

594
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:54,558
- Thank you. I'm glad to be invited.
- Hi, I'm Ben Morgan.

595
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:55,898
Ben, hello.

596
00:42:56,097 --> 00:42:58,398
Hey, hey, Doc Paige.

597
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,991
Farmer John Sausage.

598
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,092
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, Mike, you look great.

599
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,191
Oh, well, you know, Kayla's got me
on Slim-Fast, so I lost 15.

600
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,564
And he put five of it back on today
at Rocky Rococo's.

601
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:11,256
Boys.

602
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:14,620
Who's this guy?

603
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:17,206
This is Eddie. Eddie's an exchange
student from Denmark.

604
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:19,001
- He's just a friend.
- Hello.

605
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,777
- Welcome to our home.
- Thank you.

606
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:25,243
Mike, he speaks better English
than you do.

607
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,944
Yeah, anyway...

608
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,934
Pops, we'll see you in the morning.
Hey, we're watching you, Frenchy.

609
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,088
Come on into the house.

610
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:37,500
- You can ignore the moron twins.
- OK.

611
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:42,329
This is it.

612
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:46,782
- Oh, you can put them right here.
- Right.

613
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:48,384
Thanks.

614
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:15,680
What are all the pins for?

615
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,400
The few red ones
are where I've been,

616
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:19,576
and all the green ones
are where I want to go.

617
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,592
Ecuador, El Salvador.

618
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:26,464
They're not exactly
tourist destinations, are they?

619
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,991
No, but they're all the places
that Doctors Without Borders

620
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:31,552
brings good medical care
and vaccinations

621
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:33,633
and clean drinking water. What?

622
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,611
Nothing.

623
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:38,908
I just really never met someone
who makes me feel so intimidated.

624
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:42,876
And believe me, I've met my fair share
of intimidating people.

625
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:45,336
I'm not intimidating. Look at me.

626
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:48,352
Yes, well, you see,
that's pretty intimidating, as well.

627
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:53,946
Well, I'm not the only one with goals.
What do you want to do?

628
00:44:54,147 --> 00:44:58,489
I don't really have any choice.
I have to take over the family business.

629
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,823
- No choice at all?
- No.

630
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:04,221
Careful, you're crushing Gus.

631
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:06,814
Oh, Gus.

632
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:09,343
Yes, Gus.
He's a very good watch-moose.

633
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,513
Not once was I attacked
by a monster under my bed

634
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:14,779
or something scary in the closet.
Isn't that right, Gus?

635
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,832
Yes, that's right.

636
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,303
Hello, Gus. Nice to meet you.

637
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:20,956
Very pleased to meet you, as well.

638
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:27,838
- I like you like this.
- Like what?

639
00:45:29,411 --> 00:45:31,549
Don't know. Just like this.

640
00:45:31,746 --> 00:45:33,534
Just Paige.

641
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,687
All right, Eddie, we got John's room
made up for you.

642
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,665
It's just down the hall
across from our room.

643
00:45:41,987 --> 00:45:45,532
- We sleep with the door open.
- Thanks, Dad.

644
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:47,934
So, Eddie, would you like to see
how things work around here?

645
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:49,374
Maybe help us out tomorrow?

646
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:51,962
No, no, I don't think that's
such a good idea.

647
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:55,708
- Oh, why not?
- Yes, why not?

648
00:45:56,515 --> 00:45:58,620
OK. You know what?
Go ahead and help out.

649
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,729
I'm gonna enjoy this.

650
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,291
Come on, let's get you settled in.

651
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:10,648
Stop. Stop.

652
00:46:22,244 --> 00:46:23,705
This one nearly hit me.

653
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,276
Haven't seen too many tractors, huh?

654
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:51,614
Nicely done with the milking.

655
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:55,227
Yeah, I think you got a new best friend
in Bessy.

656
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:58,558
- Hey, should we get some dinner?
- What are those?

657
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:02,657
- They're lawn mowers.
- Lawn mowers. Really?

658
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:04,346
Yeah.

659
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:06,970
Hey, hey.

660
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:10,750
Actually, we race these.
It's a huge sport around here.

661
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:12,409
Really?

662
00:47:12,645 --> 00:47:15,011
- Yeah.
- Do you mind if I have a look?

663
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:16,959
No, be our guest.

664
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:19,522
Take a look at this one.
This is my baby.

665
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:21,209
Right.

666
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,995
- I just put a new flywheel in there.
- Yes, I see.

667
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:35,583
You know, no matter how dirty
he races, there's no way

668
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:38,366
we're letting Keith Kopetsky
take the trophy again this year.

669
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:41,663
- How fast do these things go?
- Well, we clocked it at 52.

670
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:45,762
I can make it faster.

671
00:47:47,237 --> 00:47:48,862
- Yeah.
- OK. Come on. Let's go.

672
00:47:49,092 --> 00:47:50,848
- What?
- That's good.

673
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:54,241
Oh, you don't believe me?
I can.

674
00:47:57,189 --> 00:48:00,320
- Might be a Thanksgiving pa, huh?
- Yeah.

675
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:01,760
Are you OK?

676
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:04,804
- Oh, you had me going.
- Not until after the pie, all right?

677
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:07,809
- Milk?
- Oh, no.

678
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:10,492
I won't be drinking much milk
in the near future.

679
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:13,984
- Ma, great turkey.
- Don't eat too much.

680
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:16,798
We got feeding to do, and I don't need
you boys in a turkey coma.

681
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:19,044
- All right.
- You've got more work?

682
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:21,374
- Yeah, 24 hours a day.
- Really?

683
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:23,034
- Have to.
- If you don't milk them,

684
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:24,480
the cows' udders will explode.

685
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:28,895
- No.
- It happened at Frank Monahan's.

686
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,979
And did you actually
see it happen, Mikey?

687
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:32,547
- No.
- You're so bad.

688
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,293
You see, we gotta work twice as hard
as corporate-owned farms

689
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:36,670
just to stay afloat.

690
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,139
At this rate, the family farm
will be extinct in 20 years.

691
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,115
- I don't think he needs to hear it now.
- No, I'm interested.

692
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:45,340
What the big boys need to understand
is that we're all interdependent.

693
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:48,223
And if somebody loses,
eventually, we'll all lose.

694
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,222
- What?
- Nothing.

695
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:55,771
- Thanks, Dad.
- So, Eddie,

696
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,308
- what's up with you and my sister?
- Johnny!

697
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,475
Look, Paige, someone had to ask.

698
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,462
Yeah, Paige, he's too good-looking.

699
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:04,668
- Yeah.
- That's right, you're too good-looking.

700
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,290
- I'm not that good-looking.
- He's pretty good-looking.

701
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:09,152
- You're pretty good-looking.
- Oh, yeah.

702
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,106
- Guys.
- If you combine that with the accent

703
00:49:11,302 --> 00:49:13,276
and your Euro-charm,
you're a lethal combination.

704
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:16,739
- Would everyone just stop? Please.
- Paige, we don't even know this guy.

705
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,029
I don't know anyone from Denmark.
I've never heard of anyone from there.

706
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:22,116
- Have you?
- Yeah, sure.

707
00:49:27,557 --> 00:49:28,985
Eddie?

708
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,608
Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr,
Hans Christian Andersen.

709
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:35,034
Wow.

710
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:36,741
Hans Christian Andersen?

711
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:37,690
Hans Christian Andersen?

712
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,226
Lars Ulrich.

713
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:41,763
- From Metallica?
- From Metallica.

714
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,746
- Get out.
- OK.

715
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:46,397
- And Helena Christensen.
- Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

716
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,027
- The Victoria's Secret model?
- Yes.

717
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,986
- OK.
- That's gotta be the coolest country

718
00:49:50,214 --> 00:49:52,580
- in the world now.
- You should be a superpower.

719
00:49:53,478 --> 00:49:54,754
Yes.

720
00:49:58,086 --> 00:50:00,606
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the Manitowoc County Fairgrounds.

721
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,715
A beautiful day for racing

722
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:06,214
and the 10th annual
Mad Mower Derby.

723
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:08,349
Give them a hand.
We got the seniors' class.

724
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,037
We've got machines
up to 1 5 horsepower.

725
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:14,555
They'll be blasting by the grandstand
at a good eight to 12 miles an hour.

726
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,179
So hang on to your hats
when they come by, folks.

727
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,585
Let them hear it when they come
past the stands here.

728
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,874
Peterson's coming out of the pit.
Look at him go around that corner.

729
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:26,209
- Come on. Come on.
- We've got a big deal today.

730
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:28,413
Check it out. Kopetsky.

731
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:39,522
What's up, Keith?

732
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:42,404
What the hell did you do
to that thing?

733
00:50:42,631 --> 00:50:46,013
I bumped up the compression
and a few other little modifications.

734
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:57,189
All right. One lap to go, folks.
Let them hear it now.

735
00:50:57,383 --> 00:51:00,644
The last of the five laps here
in the senior class.

736
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:03,587
Osterhouse is pushing.
Now Peterson's moving up.

737
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:05,888
He's making his move.
Here he comes now.

738
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:09,316
And here comes Thompson.
There goes Peterson!

739
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:11,650
Go, Mr. Peterson.

740
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:14,236
- That's Mr. Peterson?
- He's so damn old.

741
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,326
What a good, clean race
we had for the seniors.

742
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,245
- Your brothers seem to like him.
- Mom.

743
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:25,438
- I like him too.
- Yeah, I get that.

744
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:29,285
I really can't afford
any distractions right now.

745
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:32,189
Chemistry isn't just in a class, kiddo.

746
00:51:33,544 --> 00:51:36,293
- And you guys have it.
- Right.

747
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:39,237
Then what happens? I fool myself
into thinking he's Prince Charming?

748
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,918
We get married
and live happily ever after?

749
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,493
Then all my work
goes down the drain

750
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:45,858
because I'm too busy
shopping for groceries

751
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:48,324
and picking my kids up at soccer.

752
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,783
Sweetie,

753
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,155
it really wasn't as bad as all that.

754
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:56,390
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I know.

755
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,455
But we're not talking about me.

756
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,145
I made my choice.

757
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:05,340
This is about you making
the right choice for you.

758
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:08,837
OK, we're getting ready
for the super-modified class.

759
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:11,519
OK, your brothers
are getting out there.

760
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,508
We have a Le Mans-style start.

761
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:16,772
The engines will be off.
The drivers, on the gun,

762
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,975
will be running on foot
across the track,

763
00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:20,353
- Go, Eddie.
- onto the mowers,

764
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,941
start the mowers and start racing.

765
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:25,991
All right, this one's for all the marbles.

766
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:29,027
And they've set themselves up
on the line now.

767
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:31,046
Boys, you've been waiting
all summer for this.

768
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,695
They're getting ready here.
They're champing at the bit, folks.

769
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:38,183
All set. Listen for the gun
to start it off.

770
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:41,759
- Shut up.
- And they're off. There they go.

771
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,748
- Oh, Williams and Kopetsky collide.
- Get up.

772
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:46,847
Williams is on the ground. Get out
of there before they run you over.

773
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:49,414
They're firing the machines up now.
Number five is up.

774
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:51,878
Number seven's up.
Kopetsky pulls right out.

775
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:56,513
Looks like Williams is having trouble
getting his engine going.

776
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:58,559
And as they head
into the first turn,

777
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,126
Kopetsky on number eight
is in the lead.

778
00:53:04,745 --> 00:53:06,501
Look at that.
Williams got it running.

779
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:09,951
But he's got a long way to go.

780
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:11,590
Go, go, go!

781
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:14,851
It looks like the Morgan brothers
are really challenging Kopetsky there.

782
00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:16,510
They are chasing him down...

783
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:18,818
- Ride my tail.
- Mike Morgan, on Moovover, second.

784
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:22,246
And his brother, John, on number
seven, is right behind him.

785
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:24,742
Williams now is on the track,
he's catching up.

786
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:27,206
At the back of the pack,
he's starting to move up nicely.

787
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:31,295
And he's putting on some real speed,
but he is way behind.

788
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:40,867
And it looks like we've got a duel
shaping up in the front of the pack.

789
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:43,912
Mike Morgan is really going
after Kopetsky.

790
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:46,207
- Eat it, Morgan!
- Watch it!

791
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:49,086
He's pushed Morgan
towards the hay bale there.

792
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:51,492
It looks like he pushed him
right off the track.

793
00:53:51,689 --> 00:53:54,591
- Damn it! God!
- Keep it clean there, Kopetsky.

794
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:56,354
John Morgan is moving up now

795
00:53:56,554 --> 00:53:59,172
to see if he can snatch the lead
away from Kopetsky.

796
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:03,110
- Come on, Eddie!
- Go!

797
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:05,410
And here comes Williams
on number nine.

798
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,838
He's catching up.
This could be a three-way race, folks.

799
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,757
- Go, go, go!
- Get him!

800
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:15,489
Kopetsky is trying to hold him off now.
Weaving back and forth to the inside.

801
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,056
Williams trying to go outside,
now trying to cut inside.

802
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:22,023
Kopetsky will have none of it.
He's holding him off. One lap to go.

803
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,738
Let them hear it, folks.
Going around the third corner...

804
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:26,563
Go! Go! Go!

805
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:29,314
Williams, the rookie,
is really out for the gold.

806
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:31,585
He's coming after Kopetsky
on the inside.

807
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:34,599
Kopetsky is trying to hold him off
with some quick moves.

808
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:36,833
Watch out for him, Williams.
He'll mess with you.

809
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:42,440
It's Kopetsky and Williams now.

810
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,312
Oh, my God, they bumped!
Did you see that?

811
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:47,488
Williams is coming in first!

812
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,504
Williams, the first-time rookie rider,

813
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:54,113
takes the championship
of the super-modifieds.

814
00:54:54,314 --> 00:54:56,834
Skoal!

815
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,588
That's great.

816
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:03,010
- It's stupid.
- He said it was for all the marbles.

817
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,315
- I won them. I'm going to keep them.
- Hey, you.

818
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:07,208
Fine race, sir.

819
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:08,967
Hey!

820
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:12,899
Right.

821
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,268
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Just try.

822
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:19,299
Mike.

823
00:55:19,498 --> 00:55:22,018
- Hey, you guys. John, stop.
- You couldn't get me, Kopetsky.

824
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,584
- Get off me.
- Get off.

825
00:55:45,419 --> 00:55:47,328
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

826
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,417
Here, come over here.

827
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:03,009
I still think we should've stopped
at that biker bar,

828
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:05,250
shown them your hog.

829
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:06,879
Why?

830
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,025
Are we trying to set some record
of how many times

831
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:11,714
I can get beaten up in one night?

832
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:15,622
If we were fencing, he would've
been in serious trouble.

833
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:17,991
He still would have punched you.

834
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:23,814
Sorry.

835
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,531
I think that people around here
are getting the wrong idea

836
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,803
about you and me.

837
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,837
What idea is that?

838
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:37,092
That we're involved.

839
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:42,276
Which we're not.

840
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,073
No.

841
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,183
Definitely not.

842
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:49,216
Because you hate me.

843
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,325
Yes, very much.

844
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:08,161
What? What's wrong?

845
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,297
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

846
00:57:16,076 --> 00:57:18,825
Which is why I am going
to walk you to your door...

847
00:57:19,596 --> 00:57:21,024
...and bid you good night.

848
00:57:45,804 --> 00:57:47,778
He's been like this
since I got here yesterday.

849
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:53,290
- Give it back!
- Back off, Clearasil!

850
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:17,125
- Stop.
- You stop.

851
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,587
I'm studying.

852
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,812
Eddie, finals are coming up.
You need to be serious.

853
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:50,151
I am serious. OK, I will study.

854
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:54,601
OK. I am. I am.

855
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,695
Study.

856
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:11,619
No. Stop.

857
00:59:58,254 --> 01:00:00,774
God, I've read the same
sentence 1 5 times.

858
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:23,494
Come with me.

859
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:08,839
- Oh, my God!
- Your Highness,

860
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,531
- is she your new girlfriend?
- Go! Go!

861
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,195
- What's her name?
- This is great!

862
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:14,187
Prince Edvard, is this what
you've been doing?

863
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,844
Here! This way!

864
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:17,355
- Come on, hurry!
- Prince Edvard!

865
01:01:17,551 --> 01:01:18,892
- Hurry, hurry!
- Over here!

866
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:22,382
Stop! Stop! Your Highness!

867
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:23,949
Prince Edvard, look over here!

868
01:01:24,143 --> 01:01:26,314
- Prince Edvard!
- What is up?

869
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:28,267
- Go down the stairs.
- OK, OK.

870
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:30,088
- Over here, Prince Edvard!
- This way!

871
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,174
- What's her name?
- Hurry!

872
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:33,959
I think we have it.

873
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,800
What the hell was that? Why were
they calling you Prince Edvard?

874
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,308
Because that's my name.

875
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:44,680
What? That's crazy!

876
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:47,846
You're a prince and that's why
they were taking photos of us?

877
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:49,257
Yes.

878
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,993
Are there a lot of princes where
you're from, or are you kind of it?

879
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:57,738
I'm it.

880
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:02,857
- You must be freezing. Let's get you...
- You lied to me!

881
01:02:03,055 --> 01:02:07,178
No, I didn't lie to you. I just didn't want
to be Prince Edvard for once in my life.

882
01:02:08,368 --> 01:02:10,506
I never should have started this.

883
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:14,217
You are exactly the kind of distraction
I was trying to avoid.

884
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:17,415
Are those pictures gonna
be in the newspaper?

885
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,589
- Yes. Lots of them.
- Are you sure?

886
01:02:19,824 --> 01:02:23,140
Yes. This isn't my first indiscretion.

887
01:02:23,728 --> 01:02:25,931
I'm... I'm sorry.

888
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:27,850
- Paige, wait.
- Stay away from me.

889
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:30,021
- I love you.
- You love me?

890
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:31,783
Why should I believe that?

891
01:02:31,984 --> 01:02:34,569
- You were just pretending.
- No, I wasn't pretending.

892
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:37,133
No, I wasn't pretending!

893
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,865
Outside! I said, outside!

894
01:03:32,593 --> 01:03:33,967
- Outside!
- Right over here.

895
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:42,412
- I will not tell you again!
- I'm so sorry.

896
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,171
Let's go to work.

897
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,090
Eddie, I think this may be for you.

898
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:28,427
- Hello?
- Soren, put Edvard on the line.

899
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,796
One moment, Your Majesty.

900
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,740
Hello?

901
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:36,523
- Edvard.
- Hello, Mother.

902
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:38,696
Edvard, you have
to come home now.

903
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:40,807
For your father's sake.

904
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,310
He's very ill.

905
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:45,512
Lady Macbeth may have
convinced him to kill Duncan,

906
01:04:45,745 --> 01:04:47,883
but he knew it was his fate
long before she even tried.

907
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:50,120
Destiny is not something
that you can fight against.

908
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,939
But what about circumstance?
Take Othello, for instance.

909
01:04:53,138 --> 01:04:57,611
Was Othello fated to kill Desdemona,
or did lago create the circumstance?

910
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:01,546
I think it's both. On the surface,
lago is the bad guy.

911
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:04,615
But if we look closer, we see
that the crack lago exploited

912
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,200
- was of Othello's own making.
- But still, Othello made choices.

913
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:09,962
Bad ones.

914
01:05:10,162 --> 01:05:13,511
Othello had love, but he
chose not to listen to his heart.

915
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:15,945
Love doesn't come around every day,
and when it does,

916
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,323
you gotta grab it and hold on.

917
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,868
I mean, they could've lived
happily ever after.

918
01:05:22,482 --> 01:05:25,132
I know that that's
a corny schoolgirl fantasy...

919
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:29,485
...but what if the fantasy
actually became true and...

920
01:05:32,146 --> 01:05:33,968
What if there really
is a handsome prince?

921
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,911
- Miss Morgan...
- But he's a really good kisser.

922
01:05:37,106 --> 01:05:38,534
And...

923
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,835
- What if you just know you're in love?
- Miss Morgan...

924
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:44,586
And all the things you thought were
important don't matter anymore,

925
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:46,696
because the most important
thing is to be with him.

926
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,385
- Miss Morgan.
- Then it's not some silly fantasy.

927
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:51,496
It's actually real.

928
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:55,176
I mean, don't you think those
two people should be together?

929
01:05:56,626 --> 01:05:58,032
- Yes.
- Yes.

930
01:05:58,227 --> 01:05:59,404
Yes.

931
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:00,845
I do too.

932
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,269
Hi. Where's Eddie?

933
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:24,078
Oh, you mean Prince Ate-My-
Triscuits-and-Didn't-Replace-Them?

934
01:06:24,307 --> 01:06:26,412
He left after his last final.

935
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,689
Someone dropped
that off for you.

936
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:53,233
- Where are you going?
- Denmark.

937
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,314
- Why?
- It's in the note.

938
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:02,186
The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears

939
01:07:02,387 --> 01:07:04,045
Still not really getting it here, Paige.

940
01:07:04,243 --> 01:07:06,577
You've got to look
underneath the surface.

941
01:07:08,115 --> 01:07:10,384
So you're just gonna show up
at some castle in Denmark,

942
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:13,613
- knock on the door and ask for Eddie?
- I don't know what I'm going to do.

943
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:16,681
I've never felt this way before.
My stomach is all in knots.

944
01:07:16,884 --> 01:07:18,225
Sounds like you're in love.

945
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,208
I'm not thinking like
a sane person right now.

946
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:24,494
I just know that if I don't see him,
I'll spend the rest of my life wondering.

947
01:07:32,596 --> 01:07:35,857
- So 31 0 on this one.
- Two sixty on this one.

948
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,434
- One thirty-seven on this one.
- And 700 on this one.

949
01:07:39,636 --> 01:07:41,458
What?

950
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,634
Daddy.

951
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,107
Oh, thank you.

952
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,394
Excuse me, what's that building
over there?

953
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:14,734
This is the old stock exchange.
You see on the roof?

954
01:08:16,436 --> 01:08:20,462
You know, that's dragons
twisting their tails.

955
01:08:50,036 --> 01:08:52,141
Yeah, we're stuck here until it's over.

956
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,544
- Until what's over?
- The parade.

957
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,129
Every time the royal family
steps out of the house, you know,

958
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,056
- they close down half the city.
- Really?

959
01:08:59,284 --> 01:09:00,658
- Yeah.
- You know, it's OK.

960
01:09:00,853 --> 01:09:02,030
I'll just get out here.

961
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:08,780
Excuse me. Excuse me.

962
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:11,306
Excuse me. Excuse me.

963
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:14,737
Excuse me. Excuse me.

964
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:16,912
Excuse me.

965
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,513
Long live the queen!

966
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:28,719
Eddie!

967
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,607
Eddie!

968
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,201
Eddie!

969
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:38,099
Eddie! Eddie!

970
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:40,016
Eddie!

971
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:44,978
Eddie! Eddie!

972
01:09:45,173 --> 01:09:47,594
- It's Paige Morgan!
- Paige Morgan?

973
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,684
- Paige Morgan?
- Paige Morgan.

974
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:51,851
Look, there's Paige Morgan
from the newspaper!

975
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,067
Hi.

976
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:58,516
- Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!
- Eddie, it's Paige Morgan!

977
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,430
Paige Morgan!

978
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:07,793
Eddie! Eddie!

979
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:21,907
His Royal Highness,
the crown prince, and a guest.

980
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:29,460
- Just wait here.
- OK.

981
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:36,049
Hi.

982
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:44,939
I now proclaim this session
of Parliament open.

983
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:49,132
Let's go.

984
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:58,251
- Oh, no.
- What?

985
01:11:58,455 --> 01:12:01,007
You didn't tell me you lived
with your parents.

986
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,989
- Hi.
- My word.

987
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:21,965
- Miss Paige.
- Soren!

988
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,880
Oh, hugging the help?

989
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:27,217
You're going to fit in
very well around here.

990
01:12:27,415 --> 01:12:29,324
Right. I will see you
in a moment.

991
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:32,396
And Soren will show you
where to go.

992
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:40,305
- May l?
- Absolutely.

993
01:12:40,504 --> 01:12:42,030
My pleasure.

994
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:46,572
This is the south courtyard.

995
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:49,493
You, of course,
came through the private gate.

996
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:51,825
- Hi.
- Miss Paige.

997
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:53,877
Right. Hi.

998
01:12:54,808 --> 01:12:56,236
This is where we keep the mops.

999
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,006
- Absolutely not!
- I love her and she loves me.

1000
01:12:57,048 --> 01:12:58,422
- Absolutely not!
- I love her and she loves me.

1001
01:12:58,616 --> 01:13:00,590
- And we will do as we please.
- Oh, love.

1002
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,166
And when has it ever
been about that?

1003
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:04,246
It has taken us a lot to get
where we are today.

1004
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,716
All we want is to be together.

1005
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:08,301
It has taken you a lot to get
to where you are?

1006
01:13:08,504 --> 01:13:12,432
It has taken us 1 200 years
to get to where we are.

1007
01:13:12,632 --> 01:13:14,835
In a few weeks' time,
you will ascend the throne as king,

1008
01:13:15,032 --> 01:13:17,584
and I will let nothing
stand in the way of that.

1009
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:22,483
Certainly not some tawdry little affair
with a gold-digging American girl

1010
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:24,784
who dreams of becoming
the next Princess Di.

1011
01:13:25,016 --> 01:13:27,830
Mother, you cannot tell me whom
to love and how to live my life.

1012
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:32,148
Edvard, I am sure she
has outstanding qualities.

1013
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:36,150
But once the news of your father's
illness becomes public,

1014
01:13:36,857 --> 01:13:39,028
the people will
require reassurance.

1015
01:13:39,224 --> 01:13:41,973
Yes, and I will proudly
and confidently ascend the throne.

1016
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,543
- Good.
- As soon as you allow me

1017
01:13:43,737 --> 01:13:45,165
to choose my own bride.

1018
01:13:45,368 --> 01:13:46,578
Out of the question.

1019
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:49,135
She is a commoner.

1020
01:13:49,368 --> 01:13:52,597
Well, then I hope you think
that Arabella is fit to be the queen

1021
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:54,352
at the age of 1 2.

1022
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:56,495
Oh, no, I'm forgetting
about Nestor.

1023
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:57,905
Oh, don't threaten us!

1024
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:00,493
Cousin Bartholomew's
idiot son, Nestor.

1025
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:04,471
The 47-year-old virgin in diapers.
Oh, the people will rejoice.

1026
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:06,453
Enough!

1027
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:08,787
Edvard, you will be
the next king of Denmark.

1028
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:10,894
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:15,957
Now, about your young lady.

1030
01:14:16,153 --> 01:14:18,324
If you say you love her
as you do,

1031
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,717
and you believe she will make
you happy, then marry her.

1032
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:24,952
Haraald, you can't mean that.

1033
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,284
Maybe this is not a good time
to discuss...

1034
01:14:27,481 --> 01:14:29,204
No, it's a perfect time.

1035
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:33,176
It is at the end of a man's life
when he realizes

1036
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:35,440
how important his decisions
were at the beginning.

1037
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:43,602
And in 1 502, King Gustav lV fell,
hit his head on a rock,

1038
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:46,102
had his famous moment
of enlightenment. Claimed he saw God

1039
01:14:48,121 --> 01:14:49,582
at the bottom of this lake.

1040
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:52,819
He went charging off through
the castle to tell everyone.

1041
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:54,871
Unfortunately,
he was carrying a torch.

1042
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:57,301
Curtains caught fire,
burnt down half the palace.

1043
01:14:57,498 --> 01:15:00,083
Thus, observe the new wing.

1044
01:15:00,313 --> 01:15:03,891
He takes great pleasure
in twisting my ancestors' history.

1045
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:15,477
Today has been the most
incredible day of my life.

1046
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:18,936
Come with me.

1047
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:26,228
I have something important
to tell you.

1048
01:15:26,682 --> 01:15:28,023
Yeah?

1049
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,868
The reason I had to come back...

1050
01:15:31,354 --> 01:15:34,670
...is because my father has
decided to pass the crown to me.

1051
01:15:36,026 --> 01:15:37,487
So you're gonna be king.

1052
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,056
Yes.

1053
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:47,028
I love you so much.

1054
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:51,127
And I know the sacrifices
you would have to make.

1055
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:55,154
What are you doing?

1056
01:16:03,162 --> 01:16:05,016
Paige Morgan,

1057
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:06,552
will you marry me?

1058
01:16:12,346 --> 01:16:14,069
Yes.

1059
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,236
Oh, good morning.

1060
01:17:17,435 --> 01:17:19,322
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

1061
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:25,205
- Coffee?
- Oh, I can get it myself

1062
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:27,061
if you show me
where the kitchen is.

1063
01:17:27,259 --> 01:17:29,015
Or a Starbucks?

1064
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:38,518
- Grande decaf nonfat latte.
- Yes, ma'am.

1065
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:41,748
Congratulations!

1066
01:17:41,947 --> 01:17:44,281
You and Edvard getting married!
It's so romantic!

1067
01:17:44,731 --> 01:17:47,120
- You must be Arabella.
- Call me Ari.

1068
01:17:47,324 --> 01:17:49,625
Isn't it wonderful?
We're going to be sisters.

1069
01:17:53,116 --> 01:17:54,642
More hugging?

1070
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:57,015
- Whatever will we do with you?
- Thank you.

1071
01:17:57,212 --> 01:18:00,081
Well, then, I thought we might run
through your schedule for the day.

1072
01:18:00,283 --> 01:18:01,460
I have a schedule?

1073
01:18:02,203 --> 01:18:03,828
As of this morning you do.

1074
01:18:04,028 --> 01:18:05,337
Come on.

1075
01:18:05,531 --> 01:18:08,465
At 9:00, you have a groundbreaking
with Edvard.

1076
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:11,098
Also attending
will be Countess Yungen.

1077
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:14,160
Remember, if you're facing her,
the good eye is the left one.

1078
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:16,152
At 1 0:1 5,
there's a photo opportunity.

1079
01:18:16,348 --> 01:18:19,282
Holding hands with Edvard
on the royal yacht.

1080
01:18:19,484 --> 01:18:22,200
Opening of a Miro exhibit
at the museum at noon.

1081
01:18:22,396 --> 01:18:25,178
1 2:40 is when you can
call your parents.

1082
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:28,667
Yes, a 1 :00 luncheon
with the queen.

1083
01:18:30,524 --> 01:18:32,149
Deep breaths.

1084
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:35,031
You'll get through this
in spectacular fashion.

1085
01:18:35,228 --> 01:18:38,577
After all, that's what the people
expect of our future queen.

1086
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,361
Oh, my God.

1087
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:42,774
What?

1088
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:44,791
Queen.

1089
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:48,566
I mean, I knew it worked that way, but
I hadn't really thought about it like that.

1090
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:52,180
Do you think that people are gonna
mind if I'm gonna be their queen

1091
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,965
- and all I've seen is the airport?
- No.

1092
01:18:58,013 --> 01:18:59,419
Anna.

1093
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,870
Do you a have dress
for Eddie's coronation ball yet?

1094
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,905
- No.
- You may come in now.

1095
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:10,035
This is Margueritte.
She can design anything you like.

1096
01:19:10,268 --> 01:19:13,431
Chanel, Dior, Armani, Prada.

1097
01:19:13,852 --> 01:19:15,859
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Turn.

1098
01:19:16,093 --> 01:19:17,499
Excuse me?

1099
01:19:17,692 --> 01:19:19,120
Turn.

1100
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:21,333
Come, ladies.

1101
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:24,978
Long torso.

1102
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,248
Good figure.

1103
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:29,943
Terrible American posture.

1104
01:19:31,997 --> 01:19:33,971
I don't work with hunchbacks.

1105
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:37,875
- When is the wedding, Miss Morgan?
- Good morning.

1106
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:40,152
When these plants are completed,

1107
01:19:40,349 --> 01:19:42,291
Denmark will lead
the European community

1108
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:46,234
in vegetable oil
and specialty fat production.

1109
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:05,366
Farm girl.

1110
01:20:15,837 --> 01:20:18,684
So where do the future king and queen
go on their honeymoon?

1111
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,568
I was thinking Morocco.

1112
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:22,871
It's really hard
to organize security there.

1113
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:24,279
Oh, right, OK.

1114
01:20:24,477 --> 01:20:26,037
What about Spain?

1115
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,448
Yes, Spain is good.

1116
01:20:27,646 --> 01:20:30,809
I'm sure King Juan Carlos won't
mind lending us his private island

1117
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:32,914
for a few weeks in the summer.

1118
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,171
I swear.

1119
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,560
Well, it's hanging well in the front.

1120
01:20:41,694 --> 01:20:43,581
Is this part supposed to be loose?

1121
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:45,496
- She doesn't speak.
- At all?

1122
01:20:45,726 --> 01:20:47,318
To you.

1123
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,437
Well, is this part
supposed to be loose?

1124
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:52,019
Well, it has been worn that way
for the past 200 years.

1125
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:23,671
The opening of this new wing of the
Dangard Pediatric Hospital illustrates...

1126
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:25,724
- Where's Paige?
- I don't know.

1127
01:21:25,918 --> 01:21:28,438
...our country's commitment
to improving healthcare

1128
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:29,980
for all of our people...

1129
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,845
There she is.

1130
01:21:39,614 --> 01:21:41,304
I was just being nice to some kids.

1131
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:44,185
Which every paper
felt compelled to report.

1132
01:21:45,118 --> 01:21:47,027
Well, what's wrong with that?

1133
01:21:47,231 --> 01:21:51,224
That you did it in a new,
state-of-the-art, government-funded,

1134
01:21:51,455 --> 01:21:53,342
billion-kroner hospital,

1135
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:57,179
which suddenly all these newspapers
have no interest in mentioning.

1136
01:21:58,687 --> 01:22:01,753
We had an opportunity
on the eve of a national strike,

1137
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,699
to show the people what their
healthcare system can do for them.

1138
01:22:04,895 --> 01:22:07,316
Instead, all they know
is that you are nice to children.

1139
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:09,307
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

1140
01:22:09,503 --> 01:22:11,892
It's gonna take me a while
to get the hang of things.

1141
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,160
Being royal is not like
being famous or being rich.

1142
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,780
It is something much, much more.

1143
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,340
It is a way of being that can
only be learned from birth.

1144
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:24,086
It is an embodiment

1145
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:28,792
which requires you to sacrifice
who you are for who you must be.

1146
01:22:29,663 --> 01:22:33,492
Well, I'm Paige Morgan
from Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

1147
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:36,116
Paige Morgan can no longer exist.

1148
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:37,977
She is gone.

1149
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,465
You are now
the future queen of Denmark...

1150
01:22:42,431 --> 01:22:44,089
...plain and simple.

1151
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:53,976
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1152
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,949
Your Royal Highness,
it's time to leave.

1153
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,159
All right. Thank you, Soren.

1154
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:13,753
His Royal Highness,
the crown prince.

1155
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:15,990
- Royal Highness.
- Prime minister.

1156
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:19,159
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
In the interest of expedience,

1157
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,173
I've asked the lead negotiator
for the national unions

1158
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,247
and the lead negotiator for our nation's
corporate interests to join us.

1159
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:26,813
Good morning.

1160
01:23:27,008 --> 01:23:29,910
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you again.

1161
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:32,729
Your Royal Highness.

1162
01:23:32,928 --> 01:23:36,637
I know your exposure to these
proceedings has been rather limited...

1163
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:39,580
Mr. Anderson, I'm well aware
of the traditions and the protocols

1164
01:23:39,776 --> 01:23:41,401
of this chamber,
and while I respect them,

1165
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,666
we only have six hours
before all hell breaks loose.

1166
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,767
So don't you think the time
for gamesmanship has passed?

1167
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:50,073
- Yes, sir.
- Then we are in agreement.

1168
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:52,126
Please be seated.

1169
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,229
And get comfortable

1170
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,165
because we're not leaving here
until this is solved.

1171
01:24:01,216 --> 01:24:03,387
And where will this
additional money come from?

1172
01:24:03,584 --> 01:24:05,755
Well, perhaps management
will tighten their belts.

1173
01:24:05,952 --> 01:24:07,839
- Our belts?
- Yes! It might do you some good

1174
01:24:08,032 --> 01:24:10,552
- to go without.
- These are businesses, not charities.

1175
01:24:10,752 --> 01:24:12,639
If we can't come to
a resolution about wages,

1176
01:24:12,832 --> 01:24:14,774
perhaps we can discuss
concessions on benefits.

1177
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,798
- No concessions!
- You take and take

1178
01:24:16,993 --> 01:24:19,327
- and will give nothing in return!
- You are impossible!

1179
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,887
Gentlemen, please. Let's remember
this is not about us.

1180
01:24:27,424 --> 01:24:29,627
You know, when I was in America,

1181
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:33,567
I spent some time
with Paige's family on her farm.

1182
01:24:33,761 --> 01:24:35,321
And they explained
something to me.

1183
01:24:35,552 --> 01:24:37,112
That we are all interdependent.

1184
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,159
So we had better start caring
for our opposition

1185
01:24:40,352 --> 01:24:42,490
as much as we do for ourselves.

1186
01:24:44,384 --> 01:24:47,995
I wonder if anyone on this table knows
what it's like to work for a tiny wage.

1187
01:24:48,737 --> 01:24:52,053
And then to see that wage get
sliced up even further by taxes.

1188
01:24:52,257 --> 01:24:55,256
Now, I can tell you from experience,
it can be a mighty struggle.

1189
01:24:56,385 --> 01:24:59,254
But then I suspect it would be
substantially more difficult

1190
01:24:59,457 --> 01:25:01,017
to see your job...

1191
01:25:01,249 --> 01:25:04,315
...and your benefits
disappear altogether.

1192
01:25:04,865 --> 01:25:08,542
Now, at the moment,
we are six percent apart. Correct?

1193
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,512
Now, if the goal is to let
the workers keep more

1194
01:25:11,714 --> 01:25:13,470
without damaging the corporation,

1195
01:25:13,665 --> 01:25:16,031
then perhaps there's
a third path to consider.

1196
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:20,310
He was brilliant. He got the unions
to lower their demands,

1197
01:25:20,513 --> 01:25:22,007
the corporations to raise their offer,

1198
01:25:22,209 --> 01:25:24,991
and Parliament to cut the workers'
wage tax to make up the difference.

1199
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:27,705
Now, that's impressive.
OK, about the dress.

1200
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:29,399
Am I supposed
to be able to breathe?

1201
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:32,569
- No.
- Oh, well, then it's perfect.

1202
01:25:33,505 --> 01:25:36,319
Miss Paige, the queen would
like to see you immediately.

1203
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:41,238
Don't worry. I'll be by your side
the entire time.

1204
01:25:52,705 --> 01:25:55,454
- Soren, get out.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1205
01:25:56,289 --> 01:25:57,663
Thanks.

1206
01:25:59,682 --> 01:26:01,721
These are my new babies.

1207
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,412
My new hopefuls.

1208
01:26:14,114 --> 01:26:15,674
I know you think I don't like you.

1209
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:25,371
I like traditions.

1210
01:26:26,242 --> 01:26:27,768
I like traditions,

1211
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,719
and I like consistency
and continuity,

1212
01:26:31,106 --> 01:26:33,113
and I don't like change.

1213
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,598
But...

1214
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:39,805
...when that change is for the better...

1215
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,415
...when it helps turn a boy
into a man...

1216
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:47,064
...then I have to reconsider.

1217
01:26:48,802 --> 01:26:52,992
Two weeks ago, I thought you were
the end of the monarchy.

1218
01:26:54,371 --> 01:26:57,218
Now I see you may be the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1219
01:26:59,427 --> 01:27:00,604
Thank you.

1220
01:27:04,035 --> 01:27:06,401
And now we have that settled...

1221
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:09,593
...we have to make you
into the best queen

1222
01:27:09,827 --> 01:27:12,128
that Denmark has ever had.

1223
01:27:12,419 --> 01:27:14,241
Come with me.

1224
01:27:15,266 --> 01:27:20,765
Between you and me, Paige,
being queen is not without its charms.

1225
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:58,338
So, my dear,

1226
01:27:58,531 --> 01:28:02,109
what would you like to wear
to the coronation ball?

1227
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:19,291
Very beautiful.

1228
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,715
Your ears will be killing you by the end
of the evening, though. Trust me.

1229
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:46,272
Harry Winston.

1230
01:28:48,452 --> 01:28:50,491
It's very appropriate.

1231
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:24,026
- Sorry. Would you excuse me?
- Certainly, sir.

1232
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,437
Yes, Your Highness.

1233
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,650
Sorry. Pardon me.

1234
01:29:30,853 --> 01:29:33,635
Paige, may I have this dance?

1235
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,486
Of course.

1236
01:29:41,188 --> 01:29:44,832
I hope you don't mind,
but I've requested our song.

1237
01:29:45,028 --> 01:29:46,937
We have a song?

1238
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:52,352
We have a song.

1239
01:30:38,118 --> 01:30:39,940
Let's go somewhere.

1240
01:30:57,766 --> 01:30:59,969
It kind of bothers me.

1241
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:02,883
Right. Come with me.

1242
01:31:22,022 --> 01:31:25,153
Excuse me, sir. I know that you and
your father wanted to speak privately

1243
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,975
with the king of Norway
before he left.

1244
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,804
Right, of course.
Thank you, Soren.

1245
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:37,019
Listen, when I get back,
I've got a special treat for you.

1246
01:31:37,222 --> 01:31:40,964
Oh, good. I was wondering when
I was going to start being treated well.

1247
01:31:51,814 --> 01:31:53,570
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

1248
01:31:53,766 --> 01:31:55,140
Edvard.

1249
01:31:55,334 --> 01:31:57,919
- You remember my son, Edvard?
- Very nice to meet you.

1250
01:31:58,151 --> 01:31:59,525
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

1251
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:02,566
Father, I really think
you should be sitting down.

1252
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,638
Did those Egyptian photographers
make you pose

1253
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:08,132
for all those photos
riding on camels?

1254
01:32:08,326 --> 01:32:10,497
- Yeah.
- lnteresting creatures.

1255
01:32:11,398 --> 01:32:14,267
They store all that water,
but they never seem to bathe in it.

1256
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,356
Oh, yeah.

1257
01:32:16,839 --> 01:32:18,977
So down to business.

1258
01:32:19,303 --> 01:32:21,637
We have to talk about fishing rights.

1259
01:32:21,831 --> 01:32:23,554
We've both signed a treaty.

1260
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:26,849
The main thing is to maintain stock
and to respect...

1261
01:33:27,815 --> 01:33:30,367
Right, I've got something
to show you.

1262
01:33:30,823 --> 01:33:32,448
Stay there.

1263
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,901
Now,

1264
01:33:41,095 --> 01:33:43,844
relax, my dear, as I make you...

1265
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,083
...the perfect sandwich.

1266
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,938
I think you'll find...

1267
01:33:48,232 --> 01:33:49,606
...that the student

1268
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,101
has now become the teacher.

1269
01:33:53,448 --> 01:33:55,684
I can see how proud
your father is of you.

1270
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,341
Yes.

1271
01:34:04,584 --> 01:34:08,031
Eddie, this has all been extraordinary.

1272
01:34:08,744 --> 01:34:10,150
A real life fairy tale.

1273
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,454
But I can't do it anymore.

1274
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,694
What?

1275
01:34:23,272 --> 01:34:24,897
What are you saying?

1276
01:34:25,576 --> 01:34:27,485
I'm saying I can't stay.

1277
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:31,909
Well, what's the matter?

1278
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:38,179
When I first met you,

1279
01:34:38,408 --> 01:34:41,571
I was so focused
because I was scared.

1280
01:34:42,057 --> 01:34:43,202
And you got me out of that,

1281
01:34:43,432 --> 01:34:46,214
which is the greatest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1282
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:51,326
But I'm still me, and all the things
that I want to do are still a part of me,

1283
01:34:51,593 --> 01:34:54,592
and I thought I could make myself
forget about that,

1284
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,711
but I can't.

1285
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,617
What about us?

1286
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:02,142
You belong here, not me.

1287
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:05,415
And your father needs you
to be there...

1288
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,191
...for your mother and Arabella.

1289
01:35:16,072 --> 01:35:18,438
I mean, is that it?
We never see each other again?

1290
01:35:20,969 --> 01:35:22,823
I don't know.

1291
01:35:26,632 --> 01:35:28,355
I don't know.

1292
01:35:46,953 --> 01:35:49,124
I can't make you stay, can l?

1293
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:53,285
I can't make you stay.

1294
01:37:00,938 --> 01:37:05,094
Long live His Majesty,
King Edvard lll.

1295
01:37:28,106 --> 01:37:33,343
Today marks a profound, though
bittersweet, milestone for all of us...

1296
01:37:33,962 --> 01:37:38,718
...as we bear witness
to both an end and a beginning.

1297
01:37:39,978 --> 01:37:42,661
And while we must continue on,

1298
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:44,581
we must also be grateful

1299
01:37:45,803 --> 01:37:48,169
to have been blessed
with someone

1300
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:51,623
who has so ably guided us
to where we are today.

1301
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:58,629
When there has been so much love...

1302
01:38:00,651 --> 01:38:03,040
...and happiness for someone...

1303
01:38:04,203 --> 01:38:06,853
...it is natural to be reluctant...

1304
01:38:07,243 --> 01:38:10,690
...to close such a wonderful chapter
in our lives.

1305
01:38:13,323 --> 01:38:16,389
- Excuse me.
- For moving forward

1306
01:38:16,587 --> 01:38:20,842
is rarely accomplished without
considerable grief and sadness.

1307
01:38:24,011 --> 01:38:26,913
And while our sorrow
may be profound...

1308
01:38:28,299 --> 01:38:30,600
...the clouds will clear...

1309
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:33,543
...and the sun will shine on us again.

1310
01:38:37,067 --> 01:38:40,034
And in that warm, bright light...

1311
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:44,643
...we will find ourselves
facing a glorious future.

1312
01:38:46,348 --> 01:38:49,162
A future of exciting challenges...

1313
01:38:49,676 --> 01:38:52,228
...and infinite possibility...

1314
01:38:53,643 --> 01:38:56,992
...in which the horizon
will stretch out before us...

1315
01:38:58,187 --> 01:39:00,456
...rimmed in the heavenly glow...

1316
01:39:00,748 --> 01:39:03,366
...of the sunrise of our tomorrow.

1317
01:40:03,757 --> 01:40:04,934
Can everybody...?

1318
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:07,075
Can we get the girls together
for a group shot?

1319
01:40:07,276 --> 01:40:11,204
Just a quick one. OK.
Great. All right.

1320
01:40:11,404 --> 01:40:13,291
OK. Amy, sweetheart.

1321
01:40:13,484 --> 01:40:16,997
All right, Amy. Amy, here.
All right, girls? Girls?

1322
01:40:17,197 --> 01:40:19,400
- Say, "Cheese curds".
- Cheese curds!

1323
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,568
Excellent.

1324
01:40:21,772 --> 01:40:23,233
Beautiful, girls.

1325
01:40:24,748 --> 01:40:26,951
I'm so proud of you.

1326
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:30,022
Let me see.

1327
01:40:30,285 --> 01:40:31,430
Oh, sweetheart...

1328
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:34,147
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful

1329
01:40:51,693 --> 01:40:53,154
I want you in my life, Paige.

1330
01:40:55,245 --> 01:40:57,187
I want to marry you.

1331
01:40:57,389 --> 01:40:59,844
If that means I have to wait
until you finish medical school,

1332
01:41:00,301 --> 01:41:02,602
become a doctor
and anything else you want to do,

1333
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:04,357
then I'll do it.

1334
01:41:06,285 --> 01:41:07,462
I'll wait.

1335
01:41:08,621 --> 01:41:11,435
Denmark isn't ready
for a queen like me.

1336
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:15,240
Well, then they'll have to be...

1337
01:41:17,422 --> 01:41:18,731
...because I am.
