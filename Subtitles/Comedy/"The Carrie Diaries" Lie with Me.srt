00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:41,876
- What's wrong?
- I just saw

180
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:44,145
Sebastian and Donna...
Together.

181
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:45,981
Where?!

182
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,685
Nobody comes out here at night.

183
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:53,605
We could do anything
and not get caught.

184
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:56,608
You make everything sound
like a come-on.

185
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,777
Everything is.

186
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,495
(Chuckles)

187
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,497
I can go find them,
figure out what they're doing.

188
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,783
I don't want you to spy on Sebastian.

189
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:05,950
I trust him.

190
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,669
Well, do you trust Donna?

191
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,171
You know she's gonna be
all flirty and pouty

192
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:11,406
and talking about sexy things.

193
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,459
You know, I lost my virginity
on this very bench.

194
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,447
Have I shocked you?

195
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,082
Were you hoping to?

196
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:25,770
It would be fun to get <i>some</i> kind
of reaction out of you.

197
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:27,472
If Sebastian is stupid enough
to fall for that,

198
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:28,973
then he isn't worth it.

199
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,693
And by "that," do you mean
the big lips or the big boobs?

200
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,094
(Sighs) He's a guy, Carrie.

201
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,979
Guys always fall for that.

202
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,148
(Laughing)

203
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,367
(Laughs) So funny.

204
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:42,954
(Continues laughing)

205
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:46,374
(Chuckles)

206
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:57,052
I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm sure nothing happened.

207
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:59,471
Just ask him about it
at school on monday.

208
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:02,424
And if he has nothing to hide,
then he'll be honest.

209
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,342
I will. I'll ask him.

210
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:05,560
(Sighs)

211
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,962
(School bell rings)

212
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:11,433
In two weeks, my purse will be
in "Interview" magazine.

213
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,600
You're gonna be famous.

214
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,686
Well, my bag will be.

215
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:17,021
You still wanna hang with me
when your bag's so important?

216
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,656
Mm, I'll try to find time for you.

217
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:20,358
My bag may have a lot going on.

218
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,361
You know, parties, clubs,
openings to attend.

219
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,663
While I'll be stuck here,
hanging at the country club.

220
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:28,316
Did you have fun?
Bump into anyone interesting?

221
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,452
Nah. Uneventful.

222
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:32,704
<i>I knew it wasn't the whole truth.</i>

223
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,424
<i>The question was,
would he step up and be honest?</i>

224
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,129
Sebastian.

225
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:43,465
<i>Turns out someone else was
planning on stepping up</i>

226
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,016
<i>and butting in.</i>

227
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,434
Did you have a good weekend, Carrie?

228
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:48,052
Yeah. Thanks for asking.
You?

229
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:50,355
You know, I can always make my own fun.

230
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,723
Mm.

231
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:56,511
Oh. I forgot
to give you this back.

232
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,342
Thanks for keeping me warm.

233
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,984
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,819
For lying or that you got caught?

235
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:30,656
Both.

236
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:32,941
Finally the truth.

237
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,444
Can I...

238
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,562
Yeah.

239
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:47,906
Donna was at the country club
with her parents.

240
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,242
I was there with my dad.

241
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,177
We hung out,

242
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,097
but nothing happened.

243
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:09,945
It's because of Carrie?

244
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,099
Apparently, enough happened

245
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,968
that she's all snuggled up
in your clothes.

246
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,569
I mean, it was cold out.

247
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,437
Were you playing night golf?

248
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,943
We might have been smoking some pot.

249
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,995
Okay.

250
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:28,914
I didn't want you to know that.

251
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,448
Why?

252
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,669
You're not that kind of girl.

253
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:36,305
One who likes to have a good time?

254
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,473
No wonder you'd rather
hang out with Donna.

255
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,225
I'd rather hang with <i>you.</i>

256
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:43,595
But I'm grounded.
I'm not fun.

257
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:47,599
I'm not gonna lie and say
I don't like to party.

258
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:48,817
I do.

259
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,069
Maybe even need to sometimes.

260
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:54,406
I get it.
You want to escape.

261
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:56,992
But not when I'm with you.

262
00:10:56,994 --> 00:11:01,263
Wow. You're good.

263
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,166
I try to be.

264
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,003
I should've just told you.

265
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,088
Yes, you should've.

266
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,007
It won't happen again.

267
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,826
I believe you.

268
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,878
So we're okay?

269
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,680
<i>I wasn't sure if it was a lie,</i>

270
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,799
<i>but I wanted it to be true.</i>

271
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,468
Yeah. We're good.

272
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,487
<i>I feel like being grounded</i>

273
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,839
<i>is destroying my chances
with Sebastian.</i>

274
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,175
It's only one more week.
That's nothing.

275
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,476
(Mouth full) Hello?
This is High School.

276
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,111
Time here is like dog years in reverse.

277
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:34,396
(Mouth full) Wait.

278
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:36,315
So does that mean a week is
less time than a week or more?

279
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,400
It means time moves fast
and things change... quick.

280
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,118
So I think you mean

281
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,341
- it's just like dog years, period.
- Yeah, I think mouse is right

282
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,603
because dog years
happen faster than human years.

283
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,657
Okay, whatever, people.

284
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,875
Let's do get bogged down
with the details.

285
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,361
So the point is,
anything can happen in a week.

286
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:50,796
And right now

287
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,130
you and Sebastian are basically
just friends that flirt.

288
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,882
You need to take it
to the next level, pronto.

289
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:56,001
I disagree.
If he's worth it, he'll wait.

290
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:58,003
But of course he won't
because guys are jerks.

291
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,705
I know you're still upset about
Seth, and you should be, but...

292
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:02,090
But you shouldn't take it out
on all guys

293
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:03,759
'cause not all of us are jerks.

294
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,477
It's true. Some of them won't
have sex with you and dump you.

295
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,362
They just won't
have sex with you at all.

296
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:14,219
Maybe we should get back
to Carrie and Sebastian.

297
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:16,772
Mm! And Donna, because let's
face it, she's not gonna wait.

298
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,607
I'm sorry, but Sebastian isn't
some kind of trophy

299
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,992
that goes to the first person
to cross the finish line.

300
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:22,077
(Scoffs) Tell that to Donna.

301
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,161
She thinks he's the ultimate prize,

302
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:25,230
and that girl will stop at nothing.

303
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,616
So what do I do?
I'm grounded.

304
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:28,950
Your dad's still
letting you swim, right?

305
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,086
Yeah, but, I mean...
But nothing.

306
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,204
Invite him to the swim club.

307
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,872
And lie to my dad again?
Mm-hmm.

308
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:36,508
I think what your dad
doesn't know won't hurt him.

309
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,759
But I'm not for lying.

310
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:41,129
You cannot let that fake baking,
big-boobed bitch win.

311
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,181
(Laughs) That, too.

312
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,633
(Maggie laughs)

313
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:45,934
(Smack) (Boy) Ow!

314
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,135
You've gotta start looking out
for you, Carrie.

315
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:48,804
Nobody else is gonna do it.

316
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:51,390
Is something going on
with you and Walt?

317
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,141
What do you mean?

318
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,477
Well... I don't want to butt in
where I don't belong,

319
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,947
but it seems pretty clear
you and Walt haven't had sex.

320
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,115
But you told us you...

321
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,284
Yeah, well, I lied, okay?
We haven't.

322
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:04,269
So why would you say you had?

323
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,538
I don't know.

324
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,106
I got embarrassed.

325
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,125
Mouse was talking about
her and Seth, and... (Sighs)

326
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,793
(Coins drop) I've been dating Walt
for two years,

327
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,946
and we haven't, and...

328
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,966
It's not because I don't want to.

329
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,468
Don't you think that's weird?

330
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,086
<i>I knew the kindest thing was to lie.</i>

331
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,588
Well, maybe he's just waiting
for the perfect time.

332
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,507
Maybe you're right.

333
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,725
Timing is everything.

334
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,610
(Can thuds)

335
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:30,628
And you should keep that in mind
with Sebastian.

336
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,964
I mean, between being grounded
and your sister

337
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,850
and your internship at that law firm,

338
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,518
you don't seem like
you have time for him.

339
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,303
Make it,

340
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:40,822
or you'll regret it.

341
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:49,481
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

342
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,833
You better get moving. Your bus
is gonna be outside any minute.

343
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,168
Going.

344
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,337
Oh, uh, did you want me to sign
that, uh, permission slip

345
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:56,671
for your video class?

346
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:59,824
Actually, I'm meeting Carrie
at the pool instead.

347
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:00,890
If you still want to?

348
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,468
Of course. Tomorrow
afternoon, you and me.

349
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,045
Cool.

350
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:05,347
(Horn honks in distance) Bye!

351
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:08,016
Bye.
Okay. (Sighs)

352
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:09,718
(Door opens and closes)
Ready to head into the city?

353
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,220
Yeah, I guess.

There's a lot going on at school,

358

Is this internship getting
in the way of your schoolwork?

360
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,484
No. No, I can handle it.

361
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:26,952
Because if... if you're
having problems,

362
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,537
you need to talk to your teachers.

363
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,121

have enough to make 56 binders,

What is that?

603
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,556
It's a scarf.

607

641
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,504

I'd hang with her at the pool.

642
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:39,755

643

She's not so bad.
I kinda feel sorry for her.

It feels like she needs me,

The only time my sister
even acknowledges me

646

647

648
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,986

Mnh-mnh. That's not what
Larissa thinks.

655
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:11,487
It's weird. After Larissa
told me to fake it,

656
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,922
I had to go back to my office

657
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:15,124
and pretend I wasn't terrified
of bitchy Barbara.

658
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:18,794
You know what? It worked.
It saved me from being fired.

659

660
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:23,082

Yeah.

662

you got your homework.

673
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,277
Okay, you guys can only stay
here for a little while longer.

674
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,746
All right? Carrie is
still grounded, after all.

675
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,114
Leaving in five.

676
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,085

678
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,921

big-lipped bitch get him.

680
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,359
She's kind of an evil genius.

681
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,261
I completely underestimated her.

682
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,963
She called me cute

683
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,115
and said that she was happy to see me

684
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:14,717
in front of Sebastian.

685
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:17,153
She actually seemed nice.

686
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:18,554
Donna.

687
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:19,805
Nice.

688
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,774
Okay, that is terrifying.

689
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:24,744
(Chuckles) You better move, and fast.

690
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,120
You wanna meet at the swim club today?

691
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:36,288
I thought you were grounded?

692
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,208
That's for me to worry about.
So do you wanna meet or not?

693
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,160
Of course.
Meet there at 4:30?

694
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:42,828
Make it 4:00 and I'm yours.

695
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,163

696
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,640

701
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:13,807
So you're not mad?

702
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,476
Of course not. I get it.

703
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:17,978
(Sighs) Okay, so I'll see you
at home. You're okay walking?

704
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,930
Sure. No problem.

705
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,066
We can hang when I get back.

706
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,319
<i>I told myself that Dorrit was fine.</i>

707
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:27,104
<i>I wasn't sure if I believed it,</i>

708
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,273
<i>but I didn't have time to dwell on it.</i>

709
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,609
<i>And while I hurried to get ready...</i>

710
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:33,377
(Doorbell rings) <i>Walt waited...</i>

711
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,462
<i>For Maggie.</i>

712
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:47,458
<i>Unfortunately,
Maggie hadn't waited for Walt.</i>

713
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,759
Oh, thank God it's you.

714
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,427
Oh, I don't know who else it'd be.

715
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,296
Well, see, my dad's
the chief of police,

716
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,299
so he has this car with, like,
the lights and the siren thingy.

717
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,934
You're such a smart-ass.

718
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,135
Isn't that what you like about me?

719
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,386
Come on. Get in.

720
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:00,754
Thought you'd never ask.

721
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,941
(Engine starts)

722
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,094
<i>While Maggie was all bravado,</i>

723
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:09,930
<i>I tried to fake I wasn't nervous</i>

724
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,483
<i>but was doing a lousy job.</i>

725
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:28,799
(Police radio chatter)

726
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,833
I love how aggressive you are.

727
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,251
I am not. Shut up.
(Laughs)

728
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,304
That time at your parents' barbecue...

729
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:35,089
I never thought of you
as anything more than a kid.

730
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,057
You showed me.

731
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,476
(Radio chatter continues)

732
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,514
Oh.

733
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:44,765
Well, I hate to break up the party,

734
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,984
but we should probably get going.

735
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,770
Hey, can you, um...

736
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,772
Can you just lie with me?

737
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,473
It's getting kinda late.

738
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,326
Just for a minute or two.

739
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,528
You just can't get enough, can you?

740
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,451
<i>It was getting harder and harder</i>

741
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:08,455
<i>for Maggie to lie to herself
that this was real intimacy.</i>

742
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,345
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

743
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:17,297
You're home from the pool early.

744
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,632
Everything okay?

745
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,184
(Door slams)

746
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,724
So you didn't think I'd be on time?

747
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:30,027
I never said that. I was
just impressed that you are.

748
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,312
I hate people who are late.

749
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,615
My mom's always late.

750
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,450
You'd think after 18 years
of being screamed at by my dad,

751
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:38,452
she could have figured out
how to be on time.

752
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,854
Yeah, but we ladies have
a lot more to do

753
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:42,656
than you to get ready, you know?

754
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:45,743
We've gotta pick an outfit
and do our makeup and hair.

755
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,028
You don't need any of that.

756
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,546
Don't lie.

757
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,915
I'm not lying.

758
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:57,337
I want you to kiss me.

759
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:59,206
So kiss me.

760
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,678
(Door opens in distance)

761
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:10,234
Carrie?

762
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:13,161
<i>It looked like my lies
were catching up to me.</i>

763
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,945
(Engine starts)

764
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,363
Let's go, Carrie.

765
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:26,016
Mr. Bradshaw?

766
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,536
I want to apologize.
For corrupting my daughter?

767
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,705
I asked him there.
It was my idea.

768
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:34,242
But I said yes.
I-I apologize, sir.

769
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:37,161
I'm Sebastian,
Mr. Bradshaw.

770
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,219
That's a nice handshake.

771
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:46,804
Thank you, sir.

772
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:49,807
My grandfather taught me
the handshake makes the man.

773
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,894
(Chuckles) Yeah, mine, too.

774
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:54,879
What did you say your name was?

775
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,848
Sebastian. Sebastian Kydd.

776
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,649
Garret's son?

777
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,901
You know my dad?

778
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:01,385
I do. Yeah.

779
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,572
Now if, uh, you'll excuse us,
Sebastian, we have to get going.

780
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:05,857
(Under breath) So I can be punished

781
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,391
for the rest of my life.

782
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:10,178
(Car door closes)

783
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,280
(Engine starts)

784
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,090
Walt.

785
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:25,343
(Dog barking in distance)
What are you doing here?

786
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:28,012
Waiting for you.

787
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:30,131
For how long?

788
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,415
The last four hours.

789
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,601
You waited here all that time?

790
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,104
I came here

791
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:38,973
because I thought I was ready.

792
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,143
That tonight was it.

793
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,063
But...

794
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:49,033
The longer I waited
and wondered where you were...

795
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,235
I wasn't with anyone, I swear.

796
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,588
It doesn't matter.

797
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,490
That's weird, right?

798
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:59,010
That I wouldn't care.

799
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:02,046
I don't know. Maybe you're not
the jealous type.

800
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,998
(Sighs deeply)

801
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,116
I wanted to believe
that I was in love with you

802
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,702
in the way that it matters.

803
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:10,621
But the longer I stood here,

804
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:13,674
I realized I wasn't.

805
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:15,726
What are you saying?

806
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:18,479
I think we should break up.

807
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:20,898
(Voice breaks) Um, d-did I do
something? Because I can change.

808
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,568
We can make it work.
It's not you. You're perfect.

809
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,986
Then why don't you love me?

810
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:26,737
(Sighs) Mags, I do.

811
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,406
(Crying)

812
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,391
Just...

813
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:31,609
Not in that way.

814
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:33,995
(Continues crying)

815
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:37,314
But I'll always be here for you.

816
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,116
Always.

817
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,870
(Whispers) I'm sorry.

818
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:51,045
<i>And for the first time,
Walt wasn't lying.</i>

819
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:55,383
<i>It was hard, but at least
it was the truth.</i>

820
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,278
Morning, daddy.
I made you breakfast.

821
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,448
Strawberry with frosting.
Your favorite.

822
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,516
And your coffee.

823
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,184
(Coffee pouring) Yeah, buttering me up

824
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,320
isn't gonna change
what happened last night.

825
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,623
Will I be able to
leave the house before college?

826
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,541
Your punishment is done today.

827
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:23,794
I said two weeks,
and it's been two weeks.

828
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,913
Is this a trick?
(Mug clatters)

829
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:28,866
I'm not gonna lie to you.

830
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:32,003
I never would've expected
this kind of behavior from you.

831
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:33,754
I'm sorry.

832
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:35,473
Just...

833
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,925
Please know you <i>can</i> trust me.

834
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:40,261
Can I? You lied to me.

835
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:43,097
And I shouldn't have.

836
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,849
I know that.

837
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,101
(Sighs) Does it help that I feel awful?

838
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:48,552
If Dorrit hadn't told me,

839
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,905
I never would've even known
that you disobeyed me.

840
00:34:50,907 --> 00:34:52,723
I can't be with you all the time,

841
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:54,391
but I have to trust that you're
gonna make the right choices,

842
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:55,693
even when I'm not there.

843
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:57,828
I need you to...

844
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,163
Prove to me

845
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,581
that you're the daughter
that I think you are.

846
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,951
I will. I promise.

847
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:07,237
Good. Because if you don't,
there will be consequences.

848
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,422
I know.

849
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:09,974
Like no more internship.

850
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:12,426
Okay. I got it.

851
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:14,762
No more screwups.

852
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,931
Good.

853
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:22,269
So... you're okay
if I go out tonight?

854
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,940
Yeah, but not with that Sebastian.

855
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:28,693
What?

856
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,427
Wait, are you telling me I can't date?

857
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,430
Because we're gonna have
a serious problem.

858
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,648
No, I'm telling you that
you can't date <i>him.</i>

859
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,952
I... know a little bit
about him and his family,

860
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,821
and, uh, I'm telling you to stay away.

861
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,373
Why?

862
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,274
Because I said so.

863
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,844
You expect me not to see
the cutest guy at school,

864
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,746
and your reason is "because I said so"?

865
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:51,115
Yeah.

866
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:59,390
<i>Pinocchio was a puppet
that wanted to be a real boy.</i>

867
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:01,258
<i>All he had to do was be truthful,</i>

868
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,477
<i>and his wish would come true.</i>

869
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:06,130
<i>And even then,
he couldn't help but lie.</i>

870
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:10,134
<i>Doing the right thing is hard.</i>

871
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:13,687
<i>Maybe because lying is often
easier than the truth.</i>

872
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:18,142
<i>And sometimes it actually
gets you what you want.</i>

873
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:20,494
<i>But at some point,
like Pinocchio's nose,</i>

874
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:22,163
<i>the lies just keep growing</i>

875
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:26,000
<i>until it's hard to tell
what's real and what's not.</i>

876
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,671
<i>And we can either live
in that world of make-believe</i>

877
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:31,789
<i>or face the truth</i>

878
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,009
<i>and everything that comes with it.</i>

879
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,882
(Clatter)

880
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,552
Hey.

881
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:45,803
I know you're mad.

882
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,839
I'm not mad.

883
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,191
Not at you.
(Sighs)

884
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:53,727
At myself... (Sighs)
For blowing you off.

885
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,546
That wasn't cool.

886
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,064
No, it wasn't.

887
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,199
I'm sorry.

888
00:36:58,201 --> 00:36:59,984
I was hoping to make it up to you.

889
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,869
You wanna hang out?
We can make a night of it?

890
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,221
I think, uh, mouse is coming over.

891
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,440
Maybe watch "The Wall" or something?

892
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:07,741
Are we gonna be stoned?

893
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,693
No.

894
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,862
Then I don't get it.
What's the point?

895
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,349
I bought a bootlegged copy
of "Purple Rain."

896
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:16,667
How'd you get that?

897
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:18,836
I think it's better if you don't know.

898
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,387
(Sighs) Huh.

899
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:21,739
You're something, Dorrit.

900
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,341
I know.

901
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,676
(Doorbell rings)

902
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,262
That's probably mouse now.

903
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:36,904
Hey.

904
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:40,024
Hey.

905
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:42,359
So that was weird yesterday.

906
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,896
Yeah. My dad's
really overprotective.

907
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:47,832
You grounded for life?

908
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,733
Uh, surprisingly, no.

909
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,736
So you can hang out tonight?
We can go to the concert.

910
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,588
Actually, I can't.

911
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,624
- Oh.
- It's not that I don't want to.

912
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,042
I do. A lot.

913
00:37:58,044 --> 00:38:01,345
Uh... it's just, things have
been tense in my house.

914
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:04,348
Yeah, it's fine, Bradshaw.

915
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,101
You can't be that mad at me
since you called me "Bradshaw."

916
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,969
Does it bother you?

917
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,171
No. I like it.

918
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:13,474
Okay then, Bradshaw.

919
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,693
I'll see you on monday.

920
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,695
Okay, Kydd.

921
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:18,779
I'll see you then.

922
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,197
<i>All along,</i>

923
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,083
<i>I thought I was juggling
my new guy and my new city.</i>

924
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,153
<i>In reality,
it was a lot more complicated.</i>

925
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:30,824
<i>I would need to choose between
Sebastian and my dad.</i>

926
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,877
(Sighs) Who was that?

927
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:35,412
Um, door-to-door salesman.

928
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,515
Apparently, he thinks we need
more encyclopedias.

929
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,616
I told him we didn't.

930
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,586
(Chuckles) So what are you
gonna do tonight?

931
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:43,954
Uh, mouse is on her way over.

932
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:46,140
We're gonna watch "Purple Rain"
with Dorrit.

933
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,625
<i>It turns out.</i>

934
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,295
<i>I was a lot more like Pinocchio
than I thought.</i>

935
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,764
I don't understand why
the movie looked like that.

936
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,983
Did someone videotape it in a theater?

937
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,067
Yes.

938
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,403
It looked like crap.
Who would bother?

939
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,571
Me.

940
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:02,273
(Door closes)

941
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:05,776
Hey. Um, I hope it's okay
I just let myself in.

942
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,745
Mags, I thought you were
hanging out with Walt tonight?

943
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:11,065
He... he broke up with me.

944
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,167
Oh.

945
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,755
I'm sorry.

946
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:19,540
(Sniffles)

947
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,491
(Carrie) It's okay.

948
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,846
Dorrit, get in here.
Come on.

949
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:27,047
(Chuckles)

950
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,216
(Sniffles) Mmm.

951
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,355
(Madness' "Our House" playing)

952
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,942
Men are so damn complicated.

953
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:39,509
Especially the dad-kind.

954
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,178
I can second that.

955
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,730
Or the ex-boyfriend-kind

956
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:45,866
who calls you up after two weeks
and tells you they miss you.

957
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:48,452
What? Seth called?

958
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:49,570
What did you say?

959
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,188
I said hi.

960
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,273
So are you gonna take him back?

961
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,876
(Sighs) I don't know.

962
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,463
I just know I miss him.

963
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,098
I miss Walt.

964
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,050
I miss Sebastian.

965
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,669
You guys are so lame.

966
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:10,040
(Mouse, Carrie,
and Maggie laugh) Totally!

967
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,925
Now give me one of those sandwiches.
