01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:13,198
DOCTOR.

925
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,207
WE'RE DOCTORS.
WE'RE TWO BIG DOCTORS.
WE'RE NOT IMPOSTORS.

926
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:25,210
DR. TEMKIN,
COULD WE PLEASE ?
BIG DOCTOR.

927
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,713
EYES, EAR, NOSE
AND THROAT.
PLEASE, MAY WE ?

928
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,716
MAY WE, DOCTOR, PLEASE ?

929
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,721
NICE WORK.
THAT'S A BAD BREAK.  THEY
THINK WE'RE SOMEONE ELSE.

930
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,224
I KNOW.  IF WE'D FOLLOWED
ERNO'S INSTRUCTIONS,
EVERYTHING'D BE OKAY.

931
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,727
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ABOUT ERNO ANYMORE.

932
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,730
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ME S-STUTTER.

933
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,733
IT'S ALWAYS ERNO.
I'M TIRED OF HEARING
ABOUT HIM.

934
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,235
NO MORE ERNO.
SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP !

935
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,738
ALL RIGHT.

936
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,746
[ Man's Voice ]
GENTLEMEN, NONE OF YOU HAVE
EVER MET BEFORE...

937
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,749
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
OF SECURITY.

938
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,251
BUT NOW
AIRES DAY IS HERE.

939
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:10,756
I REALIZE
THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
WILL COME AS A GREAT SHOCK.

940
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,259
HOWEVER, I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.

941
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:18,263
TEN MONTHS AGO,
OUR LEADER SUFFERED
A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT...

942
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,768
WHEN A BOMB, PLANTED
IN HIS HOME BY MEMBERS
OF THE UNDERGROUND, EXPLODED.

943
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,270
NATURALLY,
IT WAS KEPT QUIET.

944
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,774
BUT SINCE THEN,
WE HAVE VIRTUALLY BEEN
A LEADERLESS SOCIETY.

945
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:32,277
UNFORTUNATELY,
PREPARATIONS FOR A SUCCESSOR...

946
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,279
HAVE NEVER BEEN
ADEQUATELY CLEAR.

947
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,283
IN SHORT, WE HAVE
BEEN IN THE THROES
OF A MAJOR CRISIS.

948
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,786
AS FOR OUR LEADER,

949
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:46,291
THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
RUSHED TO THE SCENE
OF THE ACCIDENT IMMEDIATELY,

950
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,795
BUT ALL THAT REMAINED
OF HIM WAS THIS.

951
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,297
THIS IS OUR LEADER'S NOSE.

952
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:55,801
USING GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND,

953
01:15:55,801 --> 01:16:00,305
WE RUSHED THE NOSE
TO OUR CLOSEST DELTA LABORATORY
WHICH IS HERE...

954
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:03,809
WHERE, THROUGH MASSIVE
BIOCHEMICAL EFFORT,

955
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,312
IT HAS BEEN KEPT ALIVE
FOR NEARLY A YEAR.

956
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:11,316
OUR DREAM HAS BEEN
THAT BY CLONING,

957
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:15,821
WE WOULD REDUPLICATE
THE ENTIRE LEADER AGAIN.

958
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,825
CLONING, FOR THOSE OF YOU
UNFAMILIAR WITH BIOLOGY,

959
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,829
IS A PROCESS BY WHICH
USING ONE SINGLE CELL,

960
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,332
A DUPLICATE OF THE PERSON
IT CAME FROM COULD BE FORMED.

961
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:32,838
TILL NOW WE'VE ONLY HAD
LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL SUCCESS.

962
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:37,342
BUT ALL EFFORTS
HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO CLONING
OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS.

963
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:40,846
AND NOW WE FEEL CONFIDENT
WE CAN REPRODUCE OUR LEADER...

964
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,348
IN PERFECT TACT
FROM HIS NOSE.

965
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:48,353
GENTLEMEN, WITH GOD'S HELP,
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS,

966
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,355
WE WILL HAVE
OUR LEADER BACK.

967
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,859
AND WE WILL THEN COORDINATE
AIRES PHASE TWO...

968
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:57,863
WHICH WILL EXTERMINATE
ALL DISSIDENT FACTIONS
ON SIGNAL...

969
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,365
FROM OUR REBORN LEADER.

970
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,373
MILES, IT'S A NOSE.
YES, I KNOW.
I WAS RIGHT HERE.

971
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:11,877
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ?
RADIO ERNO IMMEDIATELY.
NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE.

972
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,380
THE LEADER IS SUFFERING
FROM A TERRIFIC HANDICAP.
HE HAS NO HEAD OR BODY.

973
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,883
WE'RE NOT FULLY PREPARED.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY'RE IN A STATE OF CHAOS.

974
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,386
IF WE STRIKE QUICK,
WE GOT 'EM.
OKAY, GIVE ME THE RADIO.

975
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,388
I DROPPED THE RADIO.
YOU DROPPED THE RADIO ?

976
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,891
IT FELL OUT OF MY POCKET
WHEN I WAS HANGING OUTSIDE.
FELL OUT OF YOUR POCKET--

977
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,893
WILL YOU STOP REPEATING
EVERYTHING I SAY ?

WILL YOU STOP REPEATING

GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.

979
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,398
WE GOTTA STOP 'EM.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.
WE GOTTA STEAL THE NOSE.

980
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,401
HOW ?
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER STOLE AN ORGAN BEFORE.

981
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,404
WAIT A MINUTE !
I GOT AN IDEA.

982
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,907

 THE OPERATING CHAMBER.
RIGHT.

COME UP UNDER THE NOSE
AND HIDE IT UNDER MY COAT.

985
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,917
IT'S A STUPID PLAN.
THERE'S NO CHANCE.
WHAT'S WRONG ?

986
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,919
BECAUSE IT'S TOO SUBTLE.
WE HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT.

WE GO INTO THE OPERATING ROOM.

AND I'LL STEAL THE NOSE.
GREAT !

BEEN HIDING IT ?

THE COMPUTER IS FAILING
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT...

01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:00,545
IS WHAT I CALL
THE PINOCCHIO FACTOR,

THAT THE SQUARE ROOT

UNDER MY MASK ?

1074
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,702
NOTHING.  WHY ?
IS--  DOES-- DOES
IT LOOK EXCESSIVELY BULBOUS ?

1075
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,705
HE'S GOT THE NOSE.
HE'S GOT THE NOSE
UNDER HIS MASK.

1076
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,707
HE'S GOT THE NOSE.

1077
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:44,209
QUICK !  QUICKLY !

1078
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:49,714
ALL RIGHT, NOBODY MOVE
OR I SHOOT YOUR PRESIDENT.

1079
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,217
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.

1080
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:02,227
DON'T COME NEAR ME.
I'M WARNING YOU, OR HE
GETS IT RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

1081
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,230
HE'LL DO IT.
I'VE SEEN HIM SHOOT A NOSE.

1082
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,732
PLEASE, PLEASE,
 PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

1083
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:10,235
YOU DON'T REALIZE
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DEALING...

1084
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,237
WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST
MINDS YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

1085
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:15,240
YEAH, AND HIS
ISN'T SO BAD EITHER.
YEAH.

1086
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,742
DON'T COME NEAR US.

1087
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,245
ALL RIGHT.
GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

1088
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,248
HE'S BLUFFING.
HE WOULDN'T
SHOOT THE NOSE.

1089
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,250
BLUFFING, AM I ?

1090
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,253
OKAY, CLOWNS,
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

1091
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,817
MILES, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT WE ACTUALLY DID IT.

1092
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:35,820
AN EYE FOR AN EYE,
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
AND A NOSE FOR A NOSE.

1093
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,323
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL THAT MEANS,
BUT IT SOUNDS BRILLIANT.

1094
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,825
OH, MILES, YOU WERE
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.

1095
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,328
JUST THINK.
ERNO'S PLAN WORKED.

1096
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:46,831
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ERNO'S PLAN ?
WHAT WAS I THROUGH
ALL OF THAT ?

1097
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:48,833
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ?
IT WAS ERNO'S PLAN ?

1098
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:51,836
LOOK, I CANNOT GET
INTO THIS DISCUSSION
ABOUT ERNO WITH YOU.

1099
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,340
I'M GETTING A HOSTILITY ACHE,
AND I'M-- A MIGRAINE
HEADACHE NOW.

1100
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,842
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
MY ANALYST IN 200 YEARS.

1101
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:00,345
AND HE WAS
A STRICT FREUDIAN.

1102
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,848
AND IF I'D BEEN GOING
ALL THIS TIME, I'D PROBABLY
ALMOST BE CURED BY NOW.

1103
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:07,852
MILES, ERNO'S GOING
TO LEAD THE REVOLUTION
AND HEAD THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

1104
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:12,357
LOOK, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
IN SIX MONTHS, WE'LL BE
STEALING ERNO'S NOSE.

1105
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,859
POLITICAL SOLUTIONS DON'T WORK.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

1106
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:17,362
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO'S UP THERE.
THEY'RE ALL TERRIBLE.

1107
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:20,365
THE POLITICAL MEN--
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT FOR ?

1108
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:24,369
I THINK
YOU REALLY LOVE ME.

1109
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,871
OF COURSE I LOVE YOU.

1110
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:29,374
THIS IS WHAT--
 THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

1111
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:32,377
AND YOU LOVE ME.  I KNOW THAT.
 AND I DON'T BLAME YOU, HONEY.

1112
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:35,380
YOU KNOW, I-- I-- I--
AND I'M NOT KNOCKING ERNO.

1113
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,882
HE'S GREAT
IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIKE...

1114
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:43,388
A TALL, BLONDE PRUSSIAN,
NORDIC, ARYAN NAZI TYPE.

1115
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:47,392
BUT, MILES, MEANINGFUL
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
MEN AND WOMEN DON'T LAST.

1116
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:49,394
THAT WAS PROVEN
BY SCIENCE.

1117
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,897
YOU SEE, THERE'S
A CHEMICAL IN OUR BODIES...

1118
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,401
THAT MAKES IT ALL SO THAT
WE ALL GET ON EACH OTHER'S
NERVES SOONER OR LATER.

1119
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,903
HEY, THAT'S SCIENCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.

1120
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:02,407
YOU KNOW, SCIENCE IS
AN INTELLECTUAL DEAD END.

1121
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,910
YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT
OF GUYS IN TWEED SUITS
CUTTING UP FROGS...

1122
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,912
ON FOUNDATION GRANTS AND--

1123
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,415
OH, I SEE.  YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.

1124
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,918
AND YOU ALSO DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THE POLITICAL
SYSTEMS WORK.

1125
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,421
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN GOD, HUH ?
RIGHT.

1126
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,424
SO THEN,
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN ?

1127
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,927
SEX AND DEATH.

1128
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,930
TWO THINGS THAT COME
ONCE IN MY LIFETIME.

1129
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,434
BUT AT LEAST AFTER DEATH
YOU'RE NOT NAUSEOUS.
