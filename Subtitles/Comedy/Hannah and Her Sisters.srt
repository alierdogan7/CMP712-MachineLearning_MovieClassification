1
00:01:56,545 --> 00:02:00,300
(man) God, she's beautiful.
She's got the prettiest eyes.

2
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,887
She looks so sexy in that sweater.

3
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:07,184
I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her

4
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:11,440
and tell her how much l love her
and take care of her.

5
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,444
Stop it, you idiot! She's your wife's sister.

6
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:19,867
l can't help it. l'm consumed by her.
lt's been months now.

7
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:23,497
l dream about her,
l think about her at the office.

8
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,419
Oh, Lee. What am l gonna do?

9
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:32,467
l hear myselfmooning over you,
and it's disgusting.

10
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:36,556
Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway

11
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,226
and l smelt that perfume
on the back of her neck...

12
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,230
Jesus, l thought l was gonna swoon.

13
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:48,488
Easy. You're a dignified financial advisor.
lt doesn't look good for you to swoon.

14
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,032
Elliot?

15
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:52,743
- Elliot? Sweetheart?
- Mm?

16
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:56,916
Have you tried these? They're wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.

17
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,253
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

18
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:03,257
l know, l know.
She has all the cooking talent.

19
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:06,344
- No, you've got tons as well.
- l've eaten five of these.

20
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,225
- Holly, why don't you open a restaurant?
- Mm, we practically are.

21
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,273
Well... not a restaurant, but...
April and l are gonna do some catering.

22
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:17,734
- What? You're kidding.
- No, we decided.

23
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,737
Perfect.

24
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,158
We like to cook for friends, so...
until an acting job comes through,

25
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,578
we could make money
doing private parties.

26
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:29,792
- Great idea. That's where your talent lies.
- l know.

27
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,253
Get outta here.
Could l speak to you privately?

28
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,548
l'm her husband. She tells me anything.

29
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,927
Hannah, l need more money.
Don't get upset.

30
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,889
- l never get upset over that.
- This is the last time.

31
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:43,935
- l'm keeping strict accounts.
- Please, don't insult me.

32
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,855
- Someday l'll pay it back.
- l know. How much do you need?

33
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,025
- $2,000.
- Uh-huh?

34
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:53,406
l know it's a lot, but April and l have
this catering idea. lt's gonna be great.

35
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,283
You admit we're great cooks.

36
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,413
ln order to get started, there are a few
things to buy and some old debts to pay.

37
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,334
Just tell me one thing.
Are we talking cocaine again?

38
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:06,381
l swear. We've already got some
requests to do dinner parties.

39
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:11,054
Obviously l'm not gonna be a caterer
for ever. We both still go on auditions.

40
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,767
Something could come up at any
moment, but the parties are at night.

41
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:18,271
l can still take my acting class.
l haven't done drugs in a year.

42
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:22,944
\ A whimpering, simpering child again

43
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,867
\ Bewitched, bothered and bewildered...

44
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,664
Mom and Dad are floating
down memory lane again.

45
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,460
- Have you tried Holly's shrimp puffs?
- They're fantastic.

46
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:40,091
l need an antihistamine for Mom's asthma
before she turns into Camille.

47
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:42,219
Mom's Camille every morning.

48
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,807
- At least she isn't drinking.
- Doesn't she look great in that dress?

49
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,185
She knows it
cos she's flirting with the men.

50
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,858
When she's 80 she may stop straightening
her garter belt when there's a guy around.

51
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:57,531
- Where's the antihistamine?
- Elliot's got them somewhere.

52
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,993
- Frederick didn't come with her.
- When does he ever?

53
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,665
He's such an angry...
He's such a depressive.

54
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,086
- l thought she was moving out.
- l don't know.

55
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:11,090
\ A pill he is

56
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:13,718
\ But still he is

57
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:18,808
\ All mine and l'll keep him until he is

58
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,228
\ Bewitched...

59
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,314
Watch out, you guys! Beep-beep!

60
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,570
Your kids are so adorable.
lt gets so lonely on the holidays.

61
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,158
Oh, gosh. Well, that's why
l invited Phil Gammage tonight.

62
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,495
- Hannah, he's such a loser.
- He's not a loser at all.

63
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,958
- He's the head of Daisy's school.
- He reminds me of lchabod Crane.

64
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,962
His Adam's apple jumps up and down
when he gets excited.

65
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,133
He's a lot better than your ex-husband.
He's got a good job.

66
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:46,469
- He's not a dope addict.
- Give me a break.

67
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:49,139
- Am l interrupting any sister talk?
- Mm-mm.

68
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:52,686
Good, because there are no
interesting single men at this party.

69
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:57,942
Well, listen. Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil Gammage? The tall guy?

70
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,071
Oh, yeah, l met Phil.
He looks like lchabod Crane?

71
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:04,075
l love that. That's my type. No, really!

72
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,788
No, we mustn't get discouraged.

73
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:12,294
Hannah will invite some men over
who don't look like lchabod Crane.

74
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:17,468
Maybe at Christmas, or if not Christmas,
New Year's, or maybe next New Year's.

75
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:18,719
Ouch!

76
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,139
- lt must be here someplace.
- (Lee) Oh, you know?

77
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,642
l love that book you lent me,
The Easter Parade.

78
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,479
You were right.
lt had very special meaning for me.

79
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,732
How's Frederick? He didn't come.

80
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:31,569
You know. One of his moods.
But it wasn't a bad week.

81
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:33,864
- He sold a picture.
- Oh, great.

82
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:37,577
Yeah, it was one of his better drawings,
a very beautiful nude study.

83
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,371
Actually, it was of me.

84
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:43,877
lt's a funny feeling to know you're being
hung naked in a stranger's living room.

85
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:47,799
But you can't tell it's me, although...
You're turning all red, Elliot.

86
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:50,052
Oh, really?

87
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,930
- So... what else? What are you up to?
- l don't know.

88
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,100
My unemployment cheques
are running out.

89
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:58,020
l may do a course at Columbia
with the last of my savings.

90
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,273
- Like...?
- l don't know, exactly.

91
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:02,443
Sociology, psychology, maybe...

92
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,863
l always thought
l might work with children.

93
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:08,117
lncidentally, l always have
clients furnishing places.

94
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:12,497
Someone might be interested
in buying art. Shall l call you?

95
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,960
Yeah, sure. Frederick would
really be grateful for a sale.

96
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,921
(Hannah) Hey, guys! Dinner's ready!

97
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,174
You look so beautiful. Doesn't she?

98
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:24,096
l bumped into your ex-husband on
the street the other day. He's still crazy.

99
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:27,809
- He was on his way to get a blood test.
- Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

100
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:31,981
l wonder how he'd handle if there was
ever anything really wrong with him.

101
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:35,861
- (glass being tapped)
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...

102
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,239
- Dad...
- (glass rings)

103
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:41,577
- Dad...
- No, now this is a toast...

104
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,623
This is a toast. This is a toast.

105
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:51,632
You know, this beautiful Thanksgiving
dinner was all prepared by Hannah.

106
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:54,761
l had a little help from Mavis.
Also, Holly and April...

107
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:58,641
No, no. You did it. She did it.

108
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,478
And we drink to her,

109
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:07,277
and we congratulate her on her wonderful
accomplishment during this last year.

110
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,448
Her great success in A Doll's House.

111
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,659
(all cheer)

112
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,457
l played Nora.
l'd hate to tell you what year.

113
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:21,796
And it's very difficult to behave
like Torvald's little chipmunk

114
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:25,718
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

115
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:29,973
Now, l think that lbsen would have been
damned proud of our Hannah.

116
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,934
Speech! Speech!

117
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,813
No, no. l've been very, very lucky.

118
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,316
When l had the kids,
l decided to stop working

119
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:41,446
and just devote myself to having
the family and l've been very happy.

120
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:45,660
But l've always secretly hoped that
maybe some little gem would come along

121
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,205
and tempt me back on the stage.

122
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,086
Now l got that out of my system, l can go
back to the thing that makes me happy.

123
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:55,757
Bravo! Bravo!

124
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:12,862
ls it my imagination
or does Elliot have a little crush on me?

125
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:16,325
lt's funny. l've had that thought before.

126
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,953
He pays a lot of attention
to me all the time.

127
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,416
And he blushed tonight
when we were alone in the bedroom.

128
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,378
l wonder ifhe and Hannah are happy.

129
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:30,135
lt's funny. l still feel
a little buzz from his flirting.

130
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,896
- You want some coffee or tea?
- (man) No, thank you.

131
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,983
- How about something to eat?
- No, nothing.

132
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,570
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

133
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:47,365
What am l gonna do with you? God!

134
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:53,540
Why didn't you come tonight? We all had
a terrific time. You would have enjoyed it.

135
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:58,129
l'm going through a period of my life
where l just can't be around people.

136
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:02,760
- l didn't want to abuse anyone.
- You wouldn't. They're all so sweet.

137
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,056
Lee, you are the only person
l can be with,

138
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,476
who l really look forward to being with.

139
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:12,773
You're too harsh with everyone.
You know that, don't you?

140
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:18,030
- lsn't it enough that l can love you?
- You're such a puzzle!

141
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:22,286
So sweet with me, and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

142
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,748
There was a time when you were
very happy to be only with me.

143
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:29,629
You wanted to learn everything
about poetry, about music.

144
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:34,385
Have l really taught you everything
l have to give? l don't think so.

145
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,312
Elliot said he might have
a couple of clients for you.

146
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:45,649
l'm sure those morons he handles
have a deep feeling for art.

147
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:49,488
You never know, they might.
He was just trying to do the nice thing.

148
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:51,824
- Because he likes you.
- Me?

149
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,703
Yeah. Elliot lusts after you.

150
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:58,332
Based on what? You never even see him.

151
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,587
When you see him, you come home
full of books he's recommended,

152
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:05,842
- or films you must see.
- Oh, no, no. He's my sister's husband.

153
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:10,390
And l think if you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

154
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,811
He's a glorified accountant
and he's after you.

155
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:19,777
And l prefer to sell my work to people
who appreciate it, not to rock stars.

156
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,697
You understand?

157
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,755
- Why can't we do the sketch?
- Standards and Practices say it's dirty.

158
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,092
They saw the rehearsal. They just
figured out what the words mean?

159
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:41,722
- Mickey, we got a half-hour to air.
- The show is five minutes short.

160
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:46,145
- How? We timed everything long.
- With no sketch, we're ten minutes short.

161
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,358
- How can they do that to us?
- lt's because our ratings are low.

162
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,987
- l have a migraine.
- Hey, Mickey! Listen.

163
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,909
You'd better go to Ronny's dressing room.
He took about 1600 Quaaludes.

164
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:00,288
- l don't think he can do the show.
- Why me, Lord?

165
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:04,126
You Standards and Practices?
Why is the sketch dirty?

166
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,588
Child molestation is a touchy subject...

167
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:09,675
- Half the country's doing it!
- Yes, but you name names.

168
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,639
- We don't. We say ''The Pope''.
- That sketch cannot go on the air.

169
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:17,519
Hey! Who changed
my sketch about the PLO?

170
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,980
l had to make cuts. lt's four lousy lines.

171
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,109
- The whole premise is ruined!
- lt's not so delicate.

172
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:27,907
- Everybody's married to every line.
- l don't care! Don't tamper with my work.

173
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,661
- OK...
- You want 'em cut? l'll cut 'em myself.

174
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:35,500
Mickey, listen. lnstead of the child
molestation sketch, why don't we repeat

175
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,588
the Cardinal Spellman-Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?

176
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:42,843
- l don't feel good, Mickey.
- What did you do? Swallow a drugstore?

177
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,971
- l lost my voice.
- Oh, Jesus!

178
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:48,350
Ronny, you know, you do
have to go on in 25 minutes.

179
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,605
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer's startin' to kill me.

180
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,732
You want a Quaalude?

181
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,112
(Mickey)
Christ, this show is ruining my health.

182
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,532
Meanwhile, my ex-partner
moves to California

183
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:03,912
and every stupid show he produces
turns out to be a big hit.

184
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:07,000
Brother, what am l gonna do with my life?

185
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:12,090
Speaking of that, l gotta remember
to see my ex-wife tomorrow.

186
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,345
- Hi.
- l know.

187
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,851
- Glad you could put in an appearance.
- l got two minutes. The show is killin' me.

188
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,063
l got a million appointments today.
lt just fell this way.

189
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:27,860
- l gotta see new comedians...
- Just two minutes on your sons' birthday.

190
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:30,614
- lt's not gonna kill you.
- Happy birthday, fellas!

191
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,159
(Hannah) Daddy brought presents!

192
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:36,955
Hey, a little hug? What is this?
How about a little action from the kids?

193
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,458
- How is everything?
- Everything's fine.

194
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:42,921
OK, you can open the presents now.
l wanna get a little reaction.

195
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,007
- How's Elliot?
- He's fine.

196
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:49,722
l'm trying to convince him to produce
a play. l think he'll find that satisfying.

197
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,518
l like him. l think he's a sweet guy,
the few times that l've met him.

198
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:57,315
Cos he's a loser. He's awkward
and he's clumsy, like me.

199
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,444
- l like an underconfident person.
- This is really nice.

200
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,740
- He's been wanting a mitt.
- You have good taste in husbands.

201
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,243
Thanks. That's a beauty!

202
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:08,705
lsn't that great? Come on, let's go!

203
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,709
Go out by the Sung vase and catch this.

204
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,544
- Watch the...
- (crash)

205
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:18,926
Hannah's sweet, although sometimes
l still do get angry when l think of things.

206
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:22,639
What the hell.
At least l'm not paying child support.

207
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,769
God, l hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me.

208
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:29,649
- So what's the problem this time?
- l really think l have something.

209
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,861
l'm absolutely convinced.
Not like that adenoidal thing,

210
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:36,240
where l didn't realise l'd had them out.
But l was younger.

211
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:40,204
l saw your father this week about his
sinus and he complained of chest pains.

212
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:44,167
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac
of the family. He's, you know...

213
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,088
- You said you'd had some dizziness.
- Yes, a little.

214
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:50,134
And l think l'm developing
a hearing loss in my right ear.

215
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,931
Or my left ear. No, l'm sorry...
My right or my left ear. l can't remember.

216
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,559
OK, let's take a look.

217
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,551
Well, you have had a significant drop in
the high-decibel range in your right ear.

218
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:23,969
Really?

219
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:27,474
Have you been exposed to
a loud noise recently, or had a virus?

220
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:32,021
No, l've been perfectly healthy. You know
me. l always imagine that l have things.

221
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:36,986
- When did you first notice this?
- About a month ago. What do l have?

222
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:41,617
You've had some dizzy spells.
What about ringing or buzzing?

223
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,787
Yes, now that you mention it,

224
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:49,210
l have buzzing and also ringing.
Ringing and buzzing. Am l going deaf?

225
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,296
- lt's just in one ear?
- Yes.

226
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:55,009
ls it healthier to have
problems in both ears?

227
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:59,140
l'd like to make an appointment
for you at the hospital.

228
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:03,062
- l'd like to have them run some tests.
- The hospital? What kind of tests?

229
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:05,314
Now, don't get alarmed.

230
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,071
These are more sophisticated audiometry
tests than l can run here. lt's nothing.

231
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,699
Then why do l have to go
into the hospital at all?

232
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:17,080
l hear fine. So l'm a little weak on the
high decibels. l won't go to the opera.

233
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:20,584
There's no reason for panic.
l just wanna rule out some things.

234
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,548
- Like what?
- lt's nothing. Will you trust me?

235
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,013
Hello, Dr Wilkes? This is Mickey Sachs.
l wanna ask you a question.

236
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:34,853
- Sure, Mickey. What's up?
- lf you have a hearing loss in one ear,

237
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:40,527
and it's not from a virus or a loud noise
or anything, what are the possibilities?

238
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:46,535
Anything. Often it's hereditary.
Flu. Even a small noise'll do it.

239
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,370
Right, but nothing worse?

240
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,460
Well, yes, l guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumour.

241
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,090
Really?

242
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,511
- OK, so here's the new pages.
- Did Cards get these?

243
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:02,806
- Not yet, no.
- Let's hope it's good.

244
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:07,020
Yeah, really, really.
We'll be down in a minute, OK?

245
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:10,274
- (phone ringing)
- Mickey, what's the matter with you?

246
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,319
l feel dizzy, you know? l don't feel well.

247
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:16,115
Do you hear a ringing?
ls there a ringing sound?

248
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,243
Yeah, yeah. l hear it, l hear it.

249
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,744
- No, not that.
- Hello?

250
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,331
Yeah, we're gonna be
working late tonight.

251
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,459
No, we'll order out.

252
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,754
lf l have a brain tumour,
what am l gonna do?

253
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,050
You don't have a brain tumour.
He didn't say you had one.

254
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,388
No, they're not gonna tell you because
sometimes the weaker ones will panic.

255
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:36,808
But not you?

256
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:41,189
- Can you hear buzzing?
- Come on, we got a show to do.

257
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:44,694
- l can't keep my mind on the show.
- There's nothing wrong with you.

258
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,073
lf there isn't, why does he
want me to come back for tests?

259
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,993
- He has to rule out certain things.
- Like what?

260
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,999
- l don't know. Cancer.
- Don't say that. l don't wanna hear that.

261
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:59,129
- Don't mention it while l'm in the building.
- You don't have any symptoms.

262
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:01,716
l got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumour.

263
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:04,761
Two months ago you thought
you had a malignant melanoma.

264
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:08,725
Naturally. The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

265
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,231
- lt was on your shirt.
- Was l to know? Everyone was pointing.

266
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:17,403
- We've got to make booking decisions.
- l can't think of it.

267
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:21,283
This morning l was so happy.
Now l don't know what went wrong.

268
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:23,244
You were miserable this morning.

269
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,873
We got bad reviews, terrible ratings,
the sponsors are furious...

270
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:30,586
No, l was happy, but l just
didn't realise l was happy.

271
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:37,429
(woman) These are delicious!
What are they?

272
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:41,017
- Those are quail eggs. Aren't they good?
- They're very good.

273
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:43,812
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

274
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:47,024
- Oh, thank you. That looks good.
- l make those.

275
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,361
Excuse me.

276
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,197
Oh, thank you.

277
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,659
- The stroganoff is ready.
- We're a big hit!

278
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,831
ln this we are. Yesterday l auditioned for
Come Back Little Sheba. Not such a hit.

279
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:01,627
You will be. You'll get five jobs next week.

280
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:05,674
- Excuse me. Are there any more clams?
- Yeah, a few. Do you like 'em?

281
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:08,386
- l can't resist.
- Really? How flattering.

282
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:12,182
- Did you try the shrimp puffs?
- You are too attractive to be caterers.

283
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,352
- Something's wrong.
- We're actresses.

284
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:17,064
- ls this your first job?
- ls the food that bad?

285
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,357
No, not at all.

286
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,903
We need more bread and
bechamel sauce for the lasagne. Hi.

287
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,657
You're an actress with
a great flair for shrimp puffs.

288
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:28,912
No, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.
l do the crepes caviare.

289
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,916
- The quail is responsible for the eggs?
- Let's hope so.

290
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,920
Here, l stole you a couple of extra clams.

291
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:39,050
- lncidentally, l'm David Tolchin.
- Oh, April Knox. Hi.

292
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,260
- You're Holly?
- Yeah.

293
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,722
We're the Stanislavski Catering Company.

294
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:47,478
Now l'm gonna tell you the truth. l really
came in because l was bored by the party.

295
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,397
How are we more interesting?

296
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,735
Actually, l'm gonna listen to Aida,
if l'm not in your way.

297
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,028
(both) Oh, no.

298
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:58,075
We saw Pavarotti in Ernani
at the Met, and l cried.

299
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,036
l cry at the opera.

300
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:03,374
(April) l go limp in
the last scene of La Traviata.

301
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,252
Me too. l have a private box at the Met.

302
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:10,717
l bring a bottle of wine. l open it, l sit
there, l watch and l cry. lt's disgusting.

303
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,220
- What do you do?
- l'm an architect.

304
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,265
- What kind of things do you build?
- Are you interested?

305
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,435
Yeah.

306
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,604
What time do you get off?

307
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,194
- (Holly) The red one?
- (April) lt's magnificent!

308
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,114
The design's deliberately
noncontextual, but l wanted

309
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:33,288
to keep the atmosphere of the street,
and the proportions, and in the material.

310
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:37,042
- That's unpolished red granite.
- (April) ls that what it is?

311
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,713
- lt has an organic quality about it.
- Right.

312
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:44,302
Almost entirely, wholly interdependent,
if you know what l mean.

313
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:48,975
l can't put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

314
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,604
You know, people pass by vital
structures in this city all the time

315
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:57,027
and never appreciate them. l get the
feeling you tune into your environment.

316
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,446
Oh, it's really important.

317
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:02,158
- What are your favourite buildings?
- Wanna see some?

318
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:04,662
- Yeah.
- Well, let's do it.

319
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:51,723
(Holly) lt's just so romantic.
l just wanna put on a long gown

320
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:54,852
and open the French doors
and go on the balcony.

321
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:59,691
(David) lt's romantic. And it's got a
handsome partner sitting right beside it.

322
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:04,072
They fit right in together. And your eye
goes along, lulled into complacency,

323
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,536
- and then... look at this.
- (April) That's disgusting. A monstrosity.

324
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,916
(Holly) lt's really terrible,
and it ruins everything else.

325
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,796
- (David) lt does.
- (April) We have seen a lot of stuff today.

326
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:19,884
- Maybe we should start going home.
- Oh, jeez, yeah.

327
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:24,390
- Who gets dropped first?
- Oh, gee, l don't know.

328
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:28,646
- Well, l live downtown.
- Yeah, we both live downtown.

329
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:34,445
- lt depends on what way you wanna go.
- l know. lf we took Fifth,

330
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,908
- then we'd get to your house first.
- We could do that.

331
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:43,039
- Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
- Well, sometimes.

332
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:45,459
- You live in Chelsea, don't you?
- Yeah.

333
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,755
Well, l guess if you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

334
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,175
- Oh. OK.
- And then April.

335
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,927
Right.

336
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:04,150
Naturally, l get taken home first.
Obviously he prefers April.

337
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:06,820
Of course, l was so tongue-tied all night.

338
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:09,699
l can't believe l said that
about the Guggenheim!

339
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,871
My stupid little roller-skatingjoke.
l should never telljokes.

340
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,501
Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah,
but l kill 'em.

341
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:23,091
Where didApril come up with that stuff
about Adolph Loos and ''organic form''?

342
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:26,596
Well, naturally, she went to Brandeis.

343
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:29,600
But l don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

344
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,353
Could you believe the way
she was calling him ''David''?

345
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:37,360
''Yes, David. '' ''l feel that way too, David. ''
''What a marvellous space, David. ''

346
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:40,113
l hate April. She's pushy.

347
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:44,578
Now they'll dump me and
she'll invite him up. l blew it.

348
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:47,915
And l really like him a lot.

349
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,254
Oh, screw it. l'm not gonna get
all upset. l've got reading to do.

350
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:57,553
Maybe l'll get into bed early, turn on
a movie and take an extra Seconal.

351
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:24,207
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, Elliot! What are you doing here?

352
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:27,586
- l'm looking for a book store.
- ln this section of town?

353
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:31,800
Well, yes. l'm killing time. l have
a client near here and l'm quite early.

354
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,469
- How about you?
- Well, l...

355
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:36,640
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?

356
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:39,936
- Where are you headed?
- l was just going to my AA meeting.

357
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:43,148
Why do you still go to those?
You never touch alcohol.

358
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:48,697
You didn't know me before Frederick. l'd
start with a beer about ten in the morning.

359
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:52,994
- You must have been very unhappy.
- Yeah, unhappy and fat.

360
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,957
And l still find the meetings
very comforting.

361
00:25:56,082 --> 00:26:00,504
l'll never understand it. You're so
bright and charming and beautiful...

362
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:03,842
l think to myself ''What problems
could she possibly have?''

363
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,887
Don't let me get started on my childhood.

364
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:10,684
Oh, you know what? There is a book store
a couple of blocks from here.

365
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,855
lf you don't know about it,
you should. You'd love it.

366
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,024
Well, if you have some free time...?

367
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,194
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

368
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,658
lsn't this great?
They have everything here.

369
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:25,245
- Yes, it's wonderful.
- What book did you want?

370
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,372
- What?
- You wanted to buy a book.

371
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:31,044
No, l'm killing time. l just want to browse.

372
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,256
You've picked the right place.
You can stay all afternoon,

373
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:36,092
not buy anything and just read.

374
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:39,847
Unless, if you have some time,
we could get some coffee.

375
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:43,101
- No, l don't have time.
- No, l understand completely.

376
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,771
No problem. You're busy. l...

377
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,733
- You seem tense. ls everything OK?
- No, no.

378
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,653
- No?
- Uh, yes.

379
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:53,531
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah. How are you?

380
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:55,534
l'm... all right.

381
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,954
- How's Frederick?
- Fine.

382
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,999
We went to the Caravaggio
exhibition at the Met.

383
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,922
lt's such a treat to go through a museum
with Frederick. You learn so much.

384
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:10,053
- Do you like Caravaggio?
- Oh, yes. Who doesn't?

385
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:11,805
Look.

386
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:16,311
ee cummings. l'd like to get you this.

387
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:21,317
- Oh, no. l can't let you get me that.
- Yes, l'd like to, very much.

388
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:24,613
l read a poem of you
and thought of his last week...

389
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,617
a poem of his and thought of you!

390
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:30,997
- You'll be fine, though.
- This is great.

391
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:34,960
- l love ee cummings, but...
- Listen. l'd love to get you this.

392
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:39,007
- Are you sure?
- Maybe we could discuss it sometime.

393
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:47,810
- Well, thanks a lot.
- Thanks for showing me the book store.

394
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,148
Perhaps you could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

395
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:53,735
- l'd love to see what goes on.
- Yeah, you'd love it.

396
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,156
lt's really entertaining.
l know you'd have a good time.

397
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:00,744
And don't forget the poem on page 1 1 2.

398
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,330
- lt reminded me of you.
- Really?

399
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:10,006
Page 1 1 2.

400
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:11,967
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

401
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,106
(Lee) ''your slightest look
easily will unclose me

402
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:25,818
though i have closed myselfas fingers,

403
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:30,491
you open always petal by petal
myselfas Spring opens

404
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:34,955
(touching skilfully, mysteriously)
her first rose...

405
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:39,335
..(i do not know what it is
about you that closes

406
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:43,925
and opens,; only something
in me understands

407
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,972
the voice of your eyes
is deeper than all roses)

408
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:54,564
nobody, not even the rain,
has such small hands''

409
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:55,768
l wasn't too happy with the results
of your ENG or your BSER, either,

410
00:29:55,893 --> 00:30:00,858
which is why l sent you to Tomography,
where you saw that stuff rolling around.

411
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:03,570
You see this little grey area here?

412
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:07,408
That grey area's what l had hoped
that we wouldn't run into.

413
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:11,497
l'd like you to come in Monday morning
for a CAT scan.

414
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:16,253
- A brain scan?
- Mr Sachs, let's take it one step at a time.

415
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:21,593
We won't make any decisions until we
have all the information in front of us.

416
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:27,226
OK, take it easy.

417
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,937
He didn't say you had anything.

418
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:33,651
Hejust doesn't like the spot
on yourX-ray, that's all.

419
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:38,115
lt doesn't mean you have anything.
Don'tjump to conclusions.

420
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,034
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

421
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,996
You're in the middle of New York City.
This is your town.

422
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,793
You're surrounded by people
and traffic and restaurants. God...

423
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:50,130
How can youjust one day vanish?

424
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:54,803
Keep calm. You're gonna be OK.

425
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:56,847
Don't panic.

426
00:30:57,515 --> 00:30:59,684
l'm dying! l'm dying!

427
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,521
l know it! There's a spot on my lungs!

428
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:06,777
All right, now take it easy.
lt's not on your lungs, it's on your ear.

429
00:31:06,902 --> 00:31:10,991
lt's the same thing, isn't it?
Jesus, l can't sleep!

430
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:14,746
God, there's a tumour in my head
the size of a basketball!

431
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:17,916
Now l keep thinking
l can feel it every time l blink!

432
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,630
Oh, Jesus!
He wants me to do a brain scan

433
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,300
to confirm what he already suspects.

434
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,553
Look, l'll make a deal with God.

435
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:30,433
Let itjust be my ear, OK?
l'll go deaf, and blind in one eye, maybe.

436
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,437
But l don't want a brain operation.
Once they go into my skull,

437
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:37,859
l'll wind up like the guy with the wool cap
who delivers for the florist.

438
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:42,824
Relax, will ya? Your whole life, you run
to doctors, the news is always fine.

439
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:46,036
No, that's not true. What about years ago?

440
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,624
l'm sorry to say, Mr Sachs,
that you cannot have children.

441
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,796
Gee.

442
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,715
ls there no chance?

443
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,928
This doesn't mean that
you can't have a normal sex life,

444
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:02,099
but Mr Sachs' tests indicate
that he is infertile.

445
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,936
Small sperm volume and infertile.

446
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:07,439
ls there anything l can do?
Push-ups? Hormones?

447
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,318
- l'm afraid not.
- l gotta get a second opinion.

448
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:13,155
- This is the second opinion.
- Well, a third opinion.

449
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,366
l realise this is a blow.

450
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:19,830
My experience is that many very fine
marriages become unstable

451
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:24,419
and are destroyed by an inability
to deal with this sort of problem.

452
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,923
l hope you won't make too much of it.

453
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:32,221
One can adopt children, and there are
various artificial methods of fertilisation.

454
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,310
- l'm so humiliated.
- Could you have ruined yourself?

455
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:40,190
- How could l ruin myself?
- l don't know. Excessive masturbation?

456
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:43,236
Hey, you gonna start
knockin' my hobbies? Jesus!

457
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:47,700
- Maybe we can adopt a child.
- What about artificial insemination?

458
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:50,620
- What are you talkin' about?
- l would get implanted.

459
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:54,792
- By a stranger?
- They have banks where they're frozen.

460
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:58,547
- You want a defrosted kid?
- l want to experience childbirth.

461
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:02,594
- With a stranger?
- Just think about it, that's all l ask.

462
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:06,432
Oh, that was a wonderful show.
That's the best show you two ever wrote.

463
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:10,855
The funniest show that Mickey and l ever
did was the one we won the Emmy for.

464
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,278
l think as far as plain laughs go, that was
probably the best thing that we ever did.

465
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:21,076
Yeah, it was funny, but the show about
the two Frenchmen was funny and warm.

466
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:25,040
- We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
- Remember that summer in France?

467
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:27,376
Hannah, you had jet lag for six weeks.

468
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:31,298
Yeah, but it was... l guess
we had fun when we were there.

469
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,551
Sorry. Coffee?

470
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:36,304
Listen, you guys... Want some more?

471
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,268
We had something
we really wanted to discuss with you.

472
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,523
Yeah. Jesus, this is very delicate.

473
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:47,903
And l only bring this up amongst friends.

474
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:53,118
This should not go
any further than this room.

475
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:55,287
l'm all ears.

476
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:59,960
Hannah and l can't have any children.

477
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:05,300
Now, l don't wanna get into whose
fault it is. lt's my fault that we can't.

478
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,595
The details are too embarrassing to...

479
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:13,436
We've decided, after a lot of discussion,
that we'd try with artificial insemination.

480
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,148
Yeah, l'm not so sure
that l like that idea myself.

481
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:21,697
And l didn't want to go to a sperm bank
and have some anonymous donor.

482
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,699
l just wouldn't want that.

483
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:27,871
We felt, if we were gonna do it, we'd like
somebody who we knew and liked,

484
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:30,542
and was warm and bright...

485
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,087
(Hannah) You can say no.
Feel free to say no.

486
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:35,798
We realise it has all kinds of implications.

487
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:40,555
The point that we're making here
is that we need some sperm.

488
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:45,019
Gee.

489
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:51,527
Well, my first reaction, after the initial
shock, is flattered that you'd ask me.

490
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:55,491
l would be the father. You would
just have to masturbate into a little cup.

491
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:00,414
- l can handle that.
- Obviously we wouldn't have intercourse.

492
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:04,502
Gosh, listen. l've gotta tell you the truth.
l'm a little uneasy about this.

493
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:09,551
- l know it's a lot to ask.
- Well, l feel for you, l do. l...

494
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:13,389
l'm gonna cry. You want
my husband to have a child with you?

495
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:18,687
Don't answer now. Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

496
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:24,195
l gave blood before...
and clothing to the poor.

497
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,449
OK, Norman, listen.
l really wanna talk about this at home.

498
00:35:27,574 --> 00:35:31,204
l think it's a matter for
your analyst, and mine.

499
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,956
And maybe my lawyer.

500
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:37,962
We understand completely
if you feel you'd rather not.

501
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:44,304
l didn't mean to spoil the evening.
Let's move on to another topic.

502
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:48,351
So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins.

503
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:53,107
And maybe that did cause some trouble,
but l think we were drifting apart anyhow.

504
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:56,320
Now, instead of man and wife,
we'rejust good friends.

505
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:59,991
Boy, love is really unpredictable.

506
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,578
(\ aria from ''Manon Lescaut'')

507
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,106
Lee? Frederick? Say hello to Dusty Frye.

508
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,691
- Hi, Dusty.
- Hi.

509
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:01,821
Dusty's just bought a huge house in
Southampton and he's decorating it.

510
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:06,536
Yeah, it's kind of a weird place.
A lot of wall space. How you doin', man?

511
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:09,540
l told him about your work
and he's very excited.

512
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:12,544
l got an Andy Warhol,
and l got a Frank Stella too.

513
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:16,298
lt's very beautiful. Big, weird, you know?

514
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:20,763
lf you stare at that Stella too long,
the colours just seem to float. lt's weird.

515
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:23,266
Are you excited about
becoming a collector?

516
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:27,897
Yeah. l got a lot more to learn, though.
l really wasn't into art when l was a kid.

517
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:30,525
Do you appreciate drawings?

518
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,944
Yeah.

519
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:35,365
Oh, hey, wow. She's beautiful.

520
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:41,456
But really l need somethin'...
l'm lookin' for somethin' big.

521
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,460
- Frederick, show him the oils.
- They're in the basement.

522
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:47,589
Frederick's done a new series
that l'm sure you'd love.

523
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,468
- Are they big?
- Yeah, some of them are.

524
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:52,637
Cos l got a lot of wall space there.

525
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:56,058
l don't sell my work by the yard.

526
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:57,852
Oh, Frederick!

527
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:06,030
- How's everything?
- Oh, you know.

528
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,908
l talked to Hannah this morning.

529
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:11,579
She said you were going to
the country this weekend.

530
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,957
Yes, she loves to go out in the woods.

531
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:17,211
But l go nuts. lt's a conflict.

532
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:23,678
- l have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
- Oh, that's nice.

533
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,392
l figured l'd get
Frederick and Dusty together.

534
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:32,397
- Yeah, that's really nice of you.
- This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.

535
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:36,945
- He's got six gold records.
- Oh, speaking of records,

536
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,281
l bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

537
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:42,118
The man in the shop showed me
another one you'd love.

538
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:45,665
lt's another Bach, second movement.

539
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,211
You have that one? l'd love to hear it.

540
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:53,967
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

541
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:57,889
Well, that's nice.
l'd love to see her wind up settled.

542
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:00,058
She's a tense one.

543
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:11,365
lsn't that beautiful?

544
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,242
l know this.

545
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:17,289
Bach, F Minor Concerto.
lt's one of my favourites.

546
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:22,671
Uh...

547
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:25,967
Did you ever get around to ee cummings?

548
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:28,345
Yes, he's just adorable.

549
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:34,102
They have a very large gay clientele
where l get my teeth cleaned.

550
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:38,066
All the hygienists now wear gloves
because they're afraid of AlDS.

551
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:40,235
Oh, right.

552
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:46,452
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 1 1 2?

553
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:51,709
Yes, it made me cry,
it was so beautiful, so romantic.

554
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,964
(Elliot) l want so badly to kiss her.

555
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,677
Not here, you idiot.
You've got to get her alone someplace.

556
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:05,018
But l've got to proceed cautiously.
This is a very delicate situation.

557
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:06,812
OK, uh...

558
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,274
Ask her ifyou can see her for lunch,
or a drink tomorrow.

559
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,196
And be ready to make light
of the offer ifshe's unresponsive.

560
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:18,869
This has to be done very skilfully
and very diplomatically.

561
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:21,038
Did you ever read this one...?

562
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:25,544
- Elliot, don't!
- Lee, l'm in love with you!

563
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,965
- (recordjumps)
- What are you doing?

564
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:32,345
l'm sorry. l have to talk to you.
There's so much l want to say.

565
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,016
- l've been in love with you for so long...
- (Frederick shouting)

566
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,437
Forget it! l'm not interested in selling it.

567
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,858
l only asked if you had
something with a little puce in it!

568
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:43,860
What's wrong?

569
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,446
l don't care about your interior decorator!

570
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:50,952
l can't commit to anything without
consulting her first. That's why l have her.

571
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:55,291
This is degrading! You don't buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa!

572
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,504
lt's not a sofa. lt's an ottoman!

573
00:40:58,629 --> 00:41:02,259
God, forget it.
Let's just get outta here, Elliot.

574
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:06,055
What a weirdo that guy is. Paranoid...

575
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,311
- What's the matter with you?
- l'll be OK.

576
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:14,024
- lt's no big deal. We just didn't hit it off.
- No, you go on ahead.

577
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:17,570
- Are you OK? You're sweating.
- Yeah, l just need some fresh air.

578
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:22,034
lt's probably something l ate.
l'll walk, you go ahead. Go on.

579
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:41,017
- (phone rings)
- Hello.

580
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,270
Hello?

581
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:45,899
Hello!

582
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,995
Oh, there you are! l was looking for you.

583
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,999
l must apologise.
l'm sorry. l'm so mixed up!

584
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:01,168
How do you expect me to react?

585
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,839
l know, but l am in love with you.

586
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:07,552
- Oh, don't say those words!
- l'm sorry. l know, it's terrible.

587
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:10,472
- You know the situation.
- l know. l realise.

588
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:14,603
- What do you expect me to say?
- Hannah and l are in the last stages.

589
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:17,732
She's never said so, and
we're very close. She'd tell me.

590
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:20,068
lt's so sad. She's crazy about me,

591
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:23,406
but somewhere along the line,
l've fallen out of love with her.

592
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:27,161
- Not because of me, l hope?
- Oh, no, no... Well, yes! l love you.

593
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:32,000
- l can't be the cause of anything...
- No, it was inevitable that we part.

594
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,337
- Why?
- For a million reasons.

595
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:38,467
- But not over me?
- No, we're going in different directions.

596
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,595
- Poor Hannah.
- But how about you?

597
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:44,475
Do you share any of my feelings, or
is this an unpleasant embarrassment?

598
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,897
- l can't say anything.
- Be candid. l don't want you to feel bad.

599
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:52,819
Yes, l have certain feelings for you,
but don't make me say anything more.

600
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:57,784
OK, OK, you've said enough. lt's my
responsibility now. l'll work things out.

601
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,789
Don't do anything for me. l live with
Frederick, and Hannah and l are close.

602
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:06,628
- Yes, but you do care about me?
- Elliot, please, l can't be a party to this.

603
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:09,674
l'm suddenly wracked with guilt
just talking to you.

604
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:12,595
Your guilt is because you feel the same.

605
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,141
Oh, please, l have to go.
l have to get my teeth cleaned.

606
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:20,313
l have my answer. l have my answer.

607
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,359
l'm walking on air!

608
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:43,051
- God, am l glad to see you!
- Hi. How's she doing?

609
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:46,430
She's in the kitchen there.
lt's the same thing.

610
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:49,559
She promises, promises.
And it's all lies, always.

611
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:51,478
Don't make it worse, Dad.

612
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:53,564
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

613
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,111
l'll get you some coffee.
That's enough of that. What triggered it?

614
00:43:57,236 --> 00:43:59,614
We were making a commercial
at the mayor's office.

615
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,783
There was this young salesman

616
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:06,623
and your mother was throwing
herself at him in a disgusting way.

617
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:11,838
Then she found she was too old to seduce
him, that he was just embarrassed by her.

618
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:13,173
Liar! Liar!

619
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:18,639
At lunch, she got drunker and drunker,
and finally she became Joan Collins.

620
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:23,186
All my life l've had to put up
with insults from this non-person!

621
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:26,899
This haircut that passes for a man!

622
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:31,530
He could never support us. lt's
a good thing we had a talented daughter.

623
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:34,326
l can only hope that she was mine!

624
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:38,289
With you as her mother, her father
could be anybody in Actors' Equity!

625
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:41,126
She's talented,
so it's unlikely she's yours.

626
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,756
Dad, could you stay in the other room
and let me take care of her?

627
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:50,096
You never know when she's gonna fall off
the wagon and humiliate everybody.

628
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,599
Here, Mom. Drink this.

629
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:56,021
You know, you're awful.
You probably were flirting.

630
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:59,483
No! l like to joke around and have fun

631
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:02,446
and he gets angry
because l get the attention.

632
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:07,494
He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older
and l've tried to stay young... at heart.

633
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,580
You promised to stay on the wagon.

634
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:12,250
The sacrifices l've made
because of that man...

635
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:17,632
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering, his... mediocrity!

636
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,843
OK, stop being so dramatic.

637
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,430
He's the one that's laid
every ingenue in stock!

638
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:24,558
OK, OK.

639
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,936
- They wanted me for a screen test.
- l know.

640
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,981
But l knew that he'd get up there
and flounder around

641
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:34,529
with his expensive haircuts
and hairdos and clothes.

642
00:45:34,654 --> 00:45:36,657
He's all show.

643
00:45:36,782 --> 00:45:41,955
Now, how can you act when
there's nothing inside to come out?

644
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,127
(\ piano playing)

645
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:57,183
(Hannah) She was so beautiful
at one time, and he was so dashing,

646
00:45:57,308 --> 00:46:02,524
both of themjust full of promise
and hopes that never materialised.

647
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,114
Then the fights and the constant
infidelities to prove themselves

648
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,118
and blaming each other. lt's sad.

649
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:16,750
They loved the idea of having us kids,
but raising us didn't interest them much.

650
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:22,091
But it's impossible to hold it against
them. They didn't know anything else.

651
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:28,390
You know, of all of us in the family, you
were the one blessed with the true gift.

652
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:33,981
My true gift is luck, Mom. l just had
a lot of luck, from my first show.

653
00:46:34,106 --> 00:46:36,735
l thought Lee was the one
destined for great things.

654
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,783
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't
have your spark. She knows it.

655
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,413
She worships you.
She wouldn't dare get up there on stage.

656
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:50,085
- Now, Holly's not shy.
- Holly's game for anything.

657
00:46:50,252 --> 00:46:52,088
- Holly takes after me.
- True.

658
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:54,758
l'd have been a great dope addict.

659
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,263
Remember this, Hannah?

660
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:25,084
Mr Sachs, l'm afraid the news is not good.

661
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,174
lf l can show you exactly
where the tumour is,

662
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:34,137
and why we feel that
surgery would be of no use...

663
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:38,601
lt's over.

664
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:41,188
l'm face to face with eternity.

665
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:44,234
Not later, but now.

666
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:49,616
l'm so frightened,
l can't move, speak or breathe.

667
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:56,041
Well, you're just fine.
There's absolutely nothing here at all.

668
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:58,419
And your tests are all fine.

669
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:03,717
l must admit, l was concerned,
given your symptoms.

670
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:06,805
What caused this hearing loss,
we'll never know for sure,

671
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:12,061
but whatever it was, it's certainly not
anything serious. l'm very relieved.

672
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:14,231
(\ livelyjazz)

673
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:32,588
What do you mean, you're quitting? Why?

674
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:36,927
The news is good.
You don't have canc... the thing.

675
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:40,306
Do you realise what a thread
we're all hanging by?

676
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:43,102
You're off the hook.
You should be celebrating.

677
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:46,022
Can you understand how
meaningless everything is?

678
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:50,153
l'm talking about our lives, the show,
the whole world. lt's meaningless.

679
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:54,408
- Yeah, but you're not dying.
- No, l'm not dying now, but...

680
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,372
When l ran out of the hospital, l was so
thrilled because l was going to be OK.

681
00:49:58,497 --> 00:50:01,667
l'm running down the street,
and suddenly l stop. lt hit me.

682
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:05,381
So l'm not gonna go today,
l'm not gonna go tomorrow,

683
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:08,051
but eventually
l'm gonna be in that position.

684
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:12,431
- You're just realising this now?
- No, l've known it all the time.

685
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:14,893
But l stuck it in the back of my mind

686
00:50:15,018 --> 00:50:18,815
because it's a very
horrible thing to think about.

687
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,401
- Can l tell you something? A secret?
- Yeah, sure.

688
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:25,198
A week ago, l bought a rifle.
l went into a store and bought one.

689
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,409
lf l had a tumour, l was gonna kill myself.

690
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:31,248
The only thing that might've stopped me
is my parents would be devastated.

691
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:33,417
l would have had to shoot them first.

692
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,838
And then my aunt and uncle.
lt would have been a bloodbath.

693
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:41,344
Well, you know, eventually
it is going to happen to all of us.

694
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:46,601
But doesn't that ruin everything for you?
lt takes the pleasure out of everything.

695
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:50,564
You're gonna die, l'm gonna die, the
audience, the network, the sponsor...

696
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:53,068
- l know, and your hamster.
- Yes!

697
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:56,572
Listen, kid. l think you snapped your cap.

698
00:50:56,739 --> 00:51:00,953
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda
or something, or go to a whorehouse.

699
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,247
l can't stay on this show. l need answers.

700
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:07,294
Otherwise, l'm telling you,
l'm gonna do something drastic.

701
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:29,865
- l thought you weren't coming.
- l almost didn't.

702
00:51:30,908 --> 00:51:33,996
- l didn't sleep all night.
- No, l'm sure.

703
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:38,585
What are we doing, meeting
in a hotel room? lt's terrible.

704
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,589
l couldn't think where to invite you
without taking risks.

705
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:45,552
l promised myself l wouldn't let this
happen till you were living alone.

706
00:51:45,678 --> 00:51:47,597
l was so torn when you called.

707
00:51:47,722 --> 00:51:52,061
l've wanted to call you every day
since l first told you how l felt.

708
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:54,439
l resisted so many times.

709
00:51:57,234 --> 00:51:59,279
Don't think badly of me.

710
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,076
This is not an easy situation.

711
00:52:04,202 --> 00:52:06,246
l know it isn't.

712
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,312
That was just perfect.

713
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,859
You've ruined me for anyone else.

714
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:32,071
l don't want anyone else ever to have you.

715
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:35,784
l was so worried
l wouldn't compare with Hannah.

716
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:39,956
Oh, my God. You really do have
those thoughts, don't you?

717
00:52:40,082 --> 00:52:42,126
All the time.

718
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:44,629
l know she must be
a really passionate person.

719
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:50,136
Yes, she's very warm and giving,
but it's me that wants to be giving to you.

720
00:52:50,261 --> 00:52:55,310
l wanna do things for you.
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

721
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:59,816
Oh, l'm being presumptuous.
Not that you need me...

722
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:02,360
l want you to take care of me.

723
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:06,616
And l love when you do things to me.
