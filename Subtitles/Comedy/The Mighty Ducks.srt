1
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,613
[Announcer] ...The Minnesota Pee Wee
Championship is up for grabs.

2
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,242
Both teams playing like there's
no tomorrow. Duluth, in the Hawks' zone,

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,786
looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.

4
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,664
There's a pass out to the blue line.
lntercepted by Gordon Bombay!

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,000
Bombay! He's got a breakaway.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,711
Across the blue line all alone
for a chance to win the game!

7
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,589
He's pulled down from behind
by Fox of Duluth.

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,842
Fox definitely pulled him down
from behind and this could be --

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,762
Yes, the referee calls
for a penalty shot.

10
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:10,028
Gordon, it's up to you. l don't wanna
see any goats around after the game.

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,365
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot...

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,910
you're not just lettin' me down,
you're lettin' your team down.

13
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,642
[Announcer]
A pressure situation he's in now.

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,396
The 1973 Pee Wee State
Championship now rests...

15
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:49,401
on the little shoulders
of number 9, Gordon Bombay.

16
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,112
[Cheering]

17
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,412
[Crowd chanting]
Gordon! Gordon!

18
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,166
[Chanting]
Gordon! Gordon!

19
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,909
Let's go, son!
All right!

20
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,287
[Crowd cheering]

21
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,415
[Whistle blowing]

22
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,809
[Announcer] He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!

23
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,937
Little Gordon Bombay
had the chance --

24
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:49,145
All my client did was attempt
to give you what you wanted!

25
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,189
lsn't that right?

26
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,192
This man put his neck
on the line for your greed.

27
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,361
Objection. Your Honour?

28
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,655
Will both counsellors
approach the bench?

29
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,328
[Man]
What's he doing?

30
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,997
l don't have anything to tell you.
l just wanna make a point.

31
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,500
So nod like l'm saying
something important.

32
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,712
- Mr Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?

33
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,589
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.

34
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,050
This drives him nuts
and l love it.

35
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,596
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?

36
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh, Mr Bombay,
l'm so glad you could make it.

37
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,353
Please restrict yourself
to a relevant cross-examination!

38
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,773
Your Honour, the applicability
of societal intent...

39
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,234
vis-a-vis individual action
is well established.

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,195
l'm citing
Minneapolis V. Higgins.

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,367
The appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony.

42
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,580
Now, if l'm not mistaken,
that was... you.

43
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,582
Wasn't it, Judge Weathers?

44
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,045
l stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.

45
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,923
[Frank] Oh, you really stooped
to an all-time low on this, Bombay.

46
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,677
l'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low l can stoop.

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
l don't mind losing.
l would just like to lose fair.

48
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,350
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.

49
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,102
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.

50
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,189
lt was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!

51
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,942
Next time do your job,
Frankie boy.

52
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,403
- 30 and 0! l remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?

53
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,531
We don't count that one because
l scored with the court reporter.

54
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,284
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.

55
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,286
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.

56
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,622
What's he waiting for?
l saw him in the back of the courtroom.

57
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,916
How about some kudos here, huh?

58
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,919
Mr Tolbert dropped off a couple ringside
seats for tonight's North Stars game.

59
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,338
Hockey? [Raspberry]
Forget it!

60
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,465
Gordon, here's the research
for the Pearlstein Project.

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,676
- Can you get started?
- Jane!

62
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,679
Can't you see l'm reveling here?
Today l'm 30 and 0!

63
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,016
- 30 and one.
- Type, Jeannie, don't speak.

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,061
- [Ringing]
- Mr Bombay's office.

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,606
Yes. lt's Ducksworth.
You're right. He wants to see you.

66
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,276
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr Ducksworth!

67
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,823
lt was nothing, Mr Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr Ducksworth.

68
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,659
[Door closing]

69
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,286
Gordon, another fine job today.

70
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,123
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.

71
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,710
Score. Don't spike.

72
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,462
l'm not sure l understand
what you mean, sir.

73
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,049
This is a business.
lt isn't a game.

74
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,635
Next time a little
restraint might be in order.

75
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,599
[Tyres squealing]

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,567
* Hey, man, get off my back
l'm doin' the best l can, yeah *

77
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,196
* You bust my neck
Cut no slack *

78
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:51,202
- * Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh-huh *
- [Siren]

79
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,373
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,546
** [Muffled rock]

81
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,217
- * Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah *
- Licence, please.

82
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,930
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.

83
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,058
l guess it was a "widdle" noisy.

84
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,226
A "widdle"?

85
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,188
Okay, l'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?

86
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,899
No, thanks, l'm full.
[Laughs]

87
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,277
Okay, out of the car. Now.

88
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,490
The charges against Mr Bombay
are driving under the influence,

89
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,410
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment.

90
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,081
And to think l almost
stayed home this morning.

91
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,541
l assume you're
representing yourself?

92
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:43,046
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?

93
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,715
Okay, let's talk business.
What am l facing?

94
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,885
Suspension of licence?
Fines? What?

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,263
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges.

96
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,684
But that's solely
up to the prosecutor.

97
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,853
The city of Minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case.

98
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,857
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,736
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

100
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,743
Mr Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,621
l own the place.
How about you?

102
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,457
Just goin' over a few cases.
RlCOH Statute stuff.

103
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,836
Oh, l thought you might be
researching your defence...

104
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,048
against D.U.l.
and reckless endangerment.

105
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,218
Did you think l wouldn't
find out, Gordon?

106
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,470
There was no reason to concern you
with it, sir. They have no case.

107
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,141
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
l found a loophole. l'm gonna plead not guilty --

108
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,352
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.

109
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,230
There's not going to be a trial.
l am not going to have you drag...

110
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,399
this firm's good name
through the mud.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,070
l've talked to Judge Weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case.

112
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,949
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence...

113
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,618
and 500 hours
of community service.

114
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,620
And a leave of absence
from the firm.

115
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,999
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.

116
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,419
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. l am.

117
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,006
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.

118
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,093
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.

119
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,723
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.

120
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,810
lt'll teach you compassion,
a sense of fair play, how to fit in.

121
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,856
- Community service? This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.

122
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,109
And hopefully you'll come back
a better person and a better attorney,

123
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,364
which is why l'm keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you.

124
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:37,702
You know, in the early '70s l drove the
tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.

125
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,039
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties,

126
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,208
amps cranked up to about
eight jillion decibels.

127
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,003
All that loud music damaged my hearing,
but l got no regrets...

128
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,548
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?

129
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,260
Community service...
coaching hockey!

130
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,557
l found one!
l'm comin' out!

131
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,893
[Boy] Karp, you finally found
something for once in your life.

132
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,729
Dumpster Dave comes through!

133
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,025
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,654
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.

135
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,407
- Thanks, Peter. Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?

136
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,911
- Yeah! Right there!
- Yeah!

137
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,622
Here, Petie. Here, boy.

138
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,125
A little chili
to keep you warm, buddy.

139
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,630
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!

140
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,258
[Peter]
l can't believe he ate the can too.

141
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,760
[Averman]
He sniffs.

142
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,681
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.

143
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,225
[Averman]
He sniffs some more. He stops.

144
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,228
l think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.

145
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,774
- He squats! He scores!
- Yes! We did it!

146
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,695
[Groaning]
Full load.

147
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,948
Stinks!

148
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,367
[Averman]
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!

149
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,453
- [Peter] Hurry it up already.
- l'm hurryin', okay?

150
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,122
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah! All right! Let's do it!

151
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,339
Oh, come on. Stop!

152
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,092
- Yes!
- Okay! Here we go.

153
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,641
Yeah. There's more inside.

154
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,810
[Karp]
He's takin' off with it.

155
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,772
This guy deserves what he gets.

156
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,656
- [Tyres squealing]
- [Screaming]

157
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,327
[Laughing]

158
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,205
Oh, guys, he saw us.

159
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:12,148
Oh, my!
[Groaning]

160
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,531
[Cheering]

161
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,366
Rink's gotta be
around here someplace.

162
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,202
Just look for a sign
that says "Personal Hell."

163
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,998
How could he do this to me?
l hate kids. They're barely human.

164
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,459
[lndistinct chatter]

165
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,837
Come on! Over here!

166
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,588
Keep it down, please!

167
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,508
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.

168
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,677
Let's talk, come on.
l'm your friend, aren't l?

169
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,973
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to
stop it. l'm tired of chasin' the puck.

170
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,018
Be careful, man.
lt almost hit me that time.

171
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,895
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
lt's supposed to hit you.

172
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,023
Does that sound stupid
to anyone else?

173
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,948
Good God.
That's the hockey team.

174
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:07,078
Drive out on the ice.
lt'll be all right.

175
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,916
[lndistinct chatter]

176
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,005
l ain't scared.

177
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,592
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.

178
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,136
[Peter]
We're gonna get in big trouble.

179
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,097
- l'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, l just know it.

180
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,528
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.

181
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,657
This is my dominion. This is
a drug-free zone, you understand?

182
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,495
We ain't buyin' nothin'.
l'm feelin' generous today.

183
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,414
So l'm gonna let you get your
sorry vanilla bootie outta here...

184
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,502
before we be usin'
your eyeballs as hockey pucks.

185
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,882
Thanks, bro, but l'm not goin' home
'til l take care of business.

186
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,260
He's got a gun.
Stand back.

187
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,598
Whew!

188
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,184
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.

189
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,687
l'm Gordon Bombay.
l'm the new coach.

190
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,856
[Laughing]
What a joke!

191
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,693
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.

192
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,322
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.

193
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,742
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.

194
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,997
Here's the long and the short of it.
l hate hockey and l don't like kids.

195
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,374
What's this supposed to be,
a pep talk?

196
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,669
l'm sure this'll be
a real bonding experience.

197
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,672
Maybe one day one of you
will even write a book about it in jail.

198
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,133
- Funny.
- ls there a goalie?

199
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,260
Only for a little while.
l'm movin' back to Philly.

200
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,470
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.

201
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,974
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.

202
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,477
Uh, just so you know.
We really suck.

203
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,063
l'll decide
who sucks around here.

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,612
- Get off me.
- They really suck.

205
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,035
The Pete-meister.
Mr Rabble-rouser.

206
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,204
Passing the puck
over to Jesse-roonie, the enforcer.

207
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,582
- [Grunt]
- Ouch!

208
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,584
That hurt!

209
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,339
Oh, it's the Connie-meister,
the velvet hammer.

210
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,341
Hi, coach. l'm Connie.

211
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,927
- Do you play?
- No. So what's our record anyway?

212
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,097
0 and 9. One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.

213
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,975
We almost scored a goal too.

214
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,728
So what do we do now... coach?

215
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,689
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.

216
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,692
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?

217
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,321
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us,
"Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?

218
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,034
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast--" [Gasping]

219
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,578
Heart attack. Great.

220
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,206
All right, look.
l gotta make a phone call.

221
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,292
Keep scrimmaging. You, you, you,
you and you against you four.

222
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,629
- We got names, you know?
- l'm sure you do.

223
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,256
And l'll bet they're very nice names.
l might even learn 'em.

224
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,175
For now, l'll be in my office.

225
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,595
Oh, and if you
need anything, fax me.

226
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,806
Geez, what a jerk.

227
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,642
Where do they find these coaches anyways?
We're impressionable kids, right?

228
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,894
Shouldn't we check
his qualifications or somethin'?

229
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,023
Jeannie, who told you
not to give me my messages?

230
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,277
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?

231
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,363
- On three!
- Jane!

232
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,407
- One, two, three! Charge!
- Are you kidding me?

233
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,243
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to --

234
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,286
Hold on a second!

235
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:40,291
- [Kids shouting]
- Hey! Get your mouth off the windows!

236
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,839
- Hey!
- Get off there!

237
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,175
- [Shouting]
- Get off the car!

238
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,888
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!

239
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,100
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!

240
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,477
- ls that a real phone?
- Yes, and l'm really on it.

241
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,521
- Not any more.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,108
- Let's see, who should l --
- Watch the upholstery.

243
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,403
[lndistinct chatter]

244
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,407
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!

245
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,118
[Chanting]
We wanna ride! We wanna ride!

246
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:19,039
- We wanna ride!
- l could kill one of 'em just to set an example.

247
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,001
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!

248
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,046
[Cheering]

249
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,511
This looks good.
l'm gonna eat it.

250
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,638
- Wow, l feel like Madonna.
- You wish!

251
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,515
Seats ten comfortably.

252
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,978
- Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
- [Growling]

253
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,231
- Yeah, l see your point.
- [Sniffing]

254
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,275
Oh.

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,404
- [Sniffing]
- [Together] Goldberg!

256
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,574
- lt wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?

257
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,410
- Nothing! lt wasn't me!
- Open a window!

258
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh, man! lt's my mom!

259
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,124
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.

260
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,171
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.

261
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,467
Goldberg, why'd you
have to ruin the fun?

262
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,762
Are you out of your mind? What were you
thinking putting that car on the ice?

263
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,056
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.

264
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,101
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take. One crack!

265
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,936
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?

266
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,356
- l'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?

267
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,067
They send you over here to coach
the team and you endanger their lives.

268
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,195
What danger? l grew up on the ice;
l know when it's safe to drive on.

269
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,948
- How do you know?
- l just know! All right?

270
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,994
Well, listen, Mr Zen Master, you may be
in tune with the ice universe,

271
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,455
but when it comes to my kid,
"l just know" doesn't cut it.

272
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,542
Charlie, let's go.

273
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,963
- Mom?
- Give me my candy! All of it!

274
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,675
Well, l guess practise is over.

275
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,512
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- lt's all right, Charlie.

276
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,640
Coach, gonna be
at the game tomorrow?

277
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,269
By order of the state
of Minnesota, yeah.

278
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,024
[Chanting]
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

279
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,027
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

280
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,779
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

281
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,075
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!

282
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,495
- One, two, three, four, five!
- [Whistle blowing]

283
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,922
- Hi, girls.
- Karp! No!

284
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,092
Goodbye.

285
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,162
The hawks. My first game
and it had to be the Hawks.

286
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,333
Gordon? Gordon Bombay.

287
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,336
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.

288
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,421
Why don't you
just call me Jack?

289
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,758
Hey, come back
to see your old coach, huh?

290
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:21,346
Well, actually l'm, uh,
coaching... Pee Wee.

291
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:26,976
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'. You got a kid on the team or something?

292
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:31,189
No, l'm here because l need
to be of service to the community.

293
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,943
How about this, huh? Whoever thought
we'd be coachin' against each other?

294
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,612
Yeah, who'd have thought?

295
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,448
So, who's your hotshot
player this year?

296
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,909
- Anyone good?
- l got a kid named Banks.

297
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,705
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.

298
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,666
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.

299
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,588
Oh, boy,

300
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:01,511
l wish they would
take that one down. Don't you?

301
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,682
Well, good luck.

302
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,852
You're gonna need it.

303
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:13,356
lt's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just...

304
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,192
letting me down, you're letting
your whole team down too.

305
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,070
l wish your dad
could be here to see this.

306
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,449
Make him proud of you!

307
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:26,077
[Chanting]
Win! Win! Win!

308
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,124
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.

309
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,085

- Win. Win.

310
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,464
Win! Win! Win!

311
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,717
- Win?
- Win! Win! Win!

312
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,095
Yeah, we're fired up.

313
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,936
All right! Watch this!

314
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, great. Good concept, guys.
Nice -- ouch!

315
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,902
Nice goin', fool!

316
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,197
- Sorry, l didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "l didn't mean to."

317
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,616
Yeah, sure,
you're on my own team.

318
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,118
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.

319
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,371
Would you get off me
before l clock you?

320
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:13,708
Let's go, Jesse!
Go, Terry!

321
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,629
[Whistle blowing]
Let's go! Come on in.

322
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,465
What's this?
The Oreo line!

Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

Good show. Sloppy pass.

Way to stuff it, Banks!

[Whistle blowing]

339
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,204
Oh, man! How could you
let him get by you?

340
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,584
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.

Hey, you!
Come back here! Oh!

345
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,983
- [Whistle blowing]
- Why me?

346
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,573
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!

347
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,910
How many times do l have to tell you:
Get those rebounds,

348
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,871
get your heads up,
get those loose pucks.

349
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,915
- Get -- Just --

All right!

352

Hey, hey! Way to play it, Banks!
All right!

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,072
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!

357
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:52,158
Nice fan, Charlie. Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.

358
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,452
Hey, hey, hey,
knock it off!

359
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:58,248
Against this team we should have
twice this many! Now let's run it up!

360
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:02,919
Remember it's not worth winning
if you can't win big!

361
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,963
[Reilly]
All right!

362
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,093
Guys! No! Come on,
let's talk about this!

363
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,637
Be civilized!
Come on! Please!

364
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:18,601
[Crowd cheering]

365
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,021
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again! Please!

366
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:25,275
Just take the goal.
Fine! l don't care!

367
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,194
- l'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.

368
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,490
[Buzzer]

369
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,492
All right!
Hey, knock it off!

370
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,370
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.

371
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:41,541
l want you guys
to stay hungry out there!

372
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,502
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.

373
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,505
- Okay, boys. Let's go.
- All right!

374
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,342
Hey, Gordon! Nice game.

375
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,386
l enjoyed it thoroughly.

376
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,682
At least l can handle the puck!

377
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,809
[lndistinct arguing]

378
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,897
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!

379
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,107
l thought we came
here to play hockey.

380
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,069
- You know, l knew we forgot something.
- [Laughing]

381
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,988
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?

382
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,532
Well, not at first,
but once you get the hang of it.

383
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,701
We're the ones out there
gettin' our butts kicked.

384
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:20,246
Yeah, it's not like you coach us
or anything. At least we try.

385
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,332
You didn't listen
to a word l said.

386
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,376
l said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.

387
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,378
l said, hustle.
You went slower!

388
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,005
That was the sloppiest
playing l've ever seen.

389
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,759
Why the hell don't you
just listen to me?

390
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:36,721
Why the hell should we?

391
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,100
l don't care.

392
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,479
You want to lose, fine. You're the ones
who look like idiots out there.

393
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,197
[Reilly]
Great game!

394
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,241
Hans?

[Cheering]

396
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,965
l don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?

397
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,969
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.

398
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:19,180
Forget it, Karp.
l can see this every day on MTV.

399
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:23,727
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.

400
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,314
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea, Jesse!

401
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,401
l was just kidding, okay?

402
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,862
Hey! Give that back!

403
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,451
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?

404
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,203
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.

405
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,788
That'll make great bathroom reading.

406
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,832
That's mine, you jerk!
l found it!

407
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,834
You don't even know
what to do with it, wuss-breath.

408
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,463
- You gonna let him call you wuss-breath?
- No!

409
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,382
Hey! Hey!
[Grunting]

410
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:58,303

- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.

One, two, three! Boom!

What are you laughing at,
cream cheese boy? Go!

420
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:35,048
[Bombay] lf we're gonna cheat,
we gotta make those falls look real.

Keep it up! Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.

Come on, get angry! Oh!

424
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,104
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!

l am hurt.

426
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,733
Good, good.
Now say it again!

[Together] Take the fall!
Act hurt! Get indignant!

- One more time!
- Take the fall! Act hurt! Get indignant!

429
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:06,037
Good! You guys are ready.

[Buzzer]

432
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,879
Give me a break, ref! Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?

433
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:19,509
Goldberg, you don't take the fall
while they're shooting at you.

434
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,387
Oh! Well, l guess you didn't
explain that very well, did ya?

435
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,098
- District Five!
- l throw myself on the ice --

436
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:29,060
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, l forfeit to the Jets!

437
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,980
What? l'm insulted by that!

438
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,278
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Quit it!

439
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,540
[Whistle blowing]
Face-off! Let's go!

440
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,418
Charlie!

441
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,094
That guy is twice your size. The next
time he gets you in a corner like that,

442
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,389
l want you to grab your eye
like it's cut and then hit the ice!

443
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:11,311
- Got it? Let's go.
- [Referee] Let's go! Face-off!

444
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,646
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.

445
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,067
Hey --

446
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,947
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.

447
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,994
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!

448
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,083
Damn it, Charlie!

449
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,544
We can't even win when we cheat.

450
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,964
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- [Connie] That was embarrassing.

451
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,302
Charlie! What the hell
is the matter with you?

452
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,805
When l tell you to do something,
you do it! You got it?

453
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,309
Look at me.

454
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,480
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.

455
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:03,321
Jesse, Terry, let's go.

456
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,824
This is what l gave up
my overtime pay for?

457
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,868
To see my kids takin' falls?

458
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,415
Gordon.

459
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,877
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.

460
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,297
Just like you used to.

461
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,966
You'd spend hours
watching me do this.

462
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,260
What do you think?

463
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,262
ls this sharp enough? Ow!

464
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:12,974
- Did you cut yourself?
- No. [Chuckling]

465
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,393
You always fell for that.

466
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,938
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, l'm Scandinavian.

467
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:22,609
- lt's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.

468
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,695
You probably thought
l was dead.

469
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,907
l saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?

470
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,452
You were so busy
screaming at the kids.

471
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,954
l didn't want
to spoil the moment.

472
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:50,261
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.

473
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,098
Why should my store?

474
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,433
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.

475
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,436
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?

476
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,189
Well, l hardly
ever lose a case.

477
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,651
That is not what l asked.

478
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,654
Hmm! l see you still have this up.

479
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,491
- Thanks very much.
- lt is important to remember the past.

480
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:14,160
l'd just as soon forget it.

481
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:19,040
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.

482
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:23,420
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.

483
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:27,340
l found this not long ago.

484
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,594
He was proud of you.

485
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,930
l miss him.

486
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,356
You scored 198 goals
in that season, Gordon.

487
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,817
lt's a shame you quit. You --

488
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,612
- Could have gone all the way. Yeah.
- No!

489
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,782
You really loved to play.

490
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:57,287
You remember? You remember...

491
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,956
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark,

492
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,917
until your father
called you back.

493
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,462
You really flew
on that ice, Gordon.

494
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,131
That's all l ever wanted to do.

495
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,761
Then why did you stop? Reilly?

496
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,890
l saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.

497
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:21,019
- The guy wins.
- lt's not about winning. lt never was.

498
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:26,524
Just show they how to play. Show them
how to have fun. Teach them to fly.

499
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:31,529
That is what they'll remember long after
you've gone back to being a doctor.

500
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,990
Lawyer.

501
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,535
And long after they've stopped
buying skates from me.

502
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:41,039
Here... there you are.

503
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,416
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.

504
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,336
- What's this?
- Your new skates.

505
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,422
That is why you came here
tonight, isn't it?

506
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:54,803
- l figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, l'm a nine.

507
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:59,683
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.

508
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:02,954
Here comes Bombay
on an end-to-end rush.

509
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,541
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!

510
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,918
He fakes once,
he fakes twice.

511
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,464
Fakes three times!
Shoots! Scores! Yes!

512
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,842
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What a play!

513
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,386
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!

514
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:23,224
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.

515
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,769
Come here, son.

516
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,065
You look great out there. Come on,
let's go inside, get something to eat.

517
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,443
A few more minutes?

518
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,279
Please?

519
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,615
- Go on. Get outta here.
- Thanks.

520
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,682
[Sighing]

521
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,106
[Knocking]

522
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,904
- Hi, uh --
- Please, just go away. Charlie doesn't want...

523
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,949
to be on the team any more, and neither
he nor l have anything to say to you.

524
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,660
- Well, l have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?

525
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,870
Door-to-door mistreatment now.

526
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,498
Now the team can feel miserable
between games too, huh?

527
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:33,753
l came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.

528
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:37,757
- What?
- Apologize.

529
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,803
Well... you should.

530
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,517
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.

531
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,896
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?

532
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,736
l was just, uh, walkin'
around thinkin' and, uh --

533
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,742
Wanna give us a minute?

534
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,579
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:17,213
Listen, it was
very wrong of me...

536
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,507
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat.

537
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,345
l never should have said to you what l said to you.
l was angry. l was frustrated.

538
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,891
lt took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right. l admire that.

539
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:32,896
And, uh, l just wanted
to tell you that, uh,

540
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,774
that l'm --

541
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,443
Oh, boy, this is difficult.

542
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:40,779
- l'm --
- You're sorry.

543
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:44,824
l'm sorry. [Louder]
l'm sorry. All right?

544
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:50,038
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be
a lot more fun this time around.

545
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,415
What do you say?

546
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,502
Do you want to stay for dinner?

547
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,380
- What?
- Charlie!

548
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,425
Uh, no, l --
l can't. Uh --

549
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:08,264
Well, what are you havin'?

550
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,229
Mr Ducksworth,
there are two reasons l came by.

551
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,898
First off, l want to let
you know things are going well.

552
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:20,026
l'm learning a lot about teamwork,
fair play and all that junk.

553
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,321
Good, good.
And the second thing?

554
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,199
Well, sir,
fair play doesn't come cheap.

555
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:28,868
These kids, my team,
have no money.

556
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,330
They can't afford rink time,
safe equipment, proper uniforms,

557
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,541
which makes it difficult
for them to compete.

558
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:39,087
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice...

559
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:43,133
with old copies of the "Enquirer"
taped to your shins instead of pads.

560
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,135
The point l'm trying to make, sir,

561
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,971
is that you wouldn't be taken seriously
and neither are these kids.

562
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,891
So l thought maybe
the firm could help 'em out.

563
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,685
How much are we talking about?

564
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,063
- $15,000.
- No way.

565
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:01,526
Wait a minute. Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.

566
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:06,031
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross,

567
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:10,327
the firm that gives back
to the community.

568
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,746
Come on.
l'll get you your own jersey.

569
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,460
* Ooo, yeah *

570
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,880
* Can you feel it baby
Ooo *

571
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,759
* l can too, Ooo *

572
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,347
* Ooo *

573
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,101
* Ooo, come on swing *

574
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,145
* Come on swing *

575
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,272
* Come on swing *

576
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,483
* C-Come on swing
Ooo *

577
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,570
* Ooo *

578
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,076
* lt's such a good vibration *

579
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,664
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

580
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,542
* lt's such a good vibration *

581
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,629
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

582
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,964
Who is that kid?

583
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,966
Thanks, Fulton.

584
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,511
- Fulton Reed. He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?

585
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,389
He only plays football. Some preppie
school gave him a scholarship...

586
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,432
as long as he doesn't play hockey.

587
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,434
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- l heard it was colleges.

588
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,603
He's been accepted to four of 'em.

589
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,440
- Yeah, but l heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.

590
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:26,236
Gordon Bombay?

591
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,738
Bombay was a Hawk.

592
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,157
* ...Good vibration *

593
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,661
* lt's such a sweet sensation *

594
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,748
* Feel the vibration
lt's such a good vibration **

595
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,460
Dude, check 'em out, man.

596
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,462
Holy cow.

597
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:47,924
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?

598
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:52,429
That's Tommy Duncan. He's in my science
class. That's his sister, Tammy.

599
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,473
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- [Together] Yeah!

600
00:41:55,598 --> 00:42:00,020
Go get dressed.
l'll do the negotiating.

601
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,191
Just think of it
as figure skating... with a stick.

602
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,653
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!

603
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:12,407
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!

604
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,826
Mom isn't gonna
like this at all.

605
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,954
So what? You want me to figure skate,
then you gotta play hockey.

606
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,041
What do l know about hockey?

607
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,626
More than you think.

608
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:27,672
Back to basics! Skating!

609
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:32,427
Go! Go! Side to side.
Shift your weight.

610
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:36,556
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.

611
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,184
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.

612
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,228
That's okay, Charlie.

613
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,651
Soft hands.

614
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:52,530
You don't shoot the puck
to your teammate. You sail it to him.

615
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,241
Karp, on your feet.

616
00:42:55,367 --> 00:43:00,538
- You send it.
- Oh! Gross!

617
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:04,626
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it. Cradle it.

618
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,796
- Oh!
- Again!

619
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,090
Concentration, not strength.

620
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:13,677
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on! Wax off!"

621
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,513
Just shut up and try it, Averman!

622
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,224
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.

623
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,685
Good, Averman. Charlie.

624
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,022
That's good. Good.
Now sail it back.

625
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:30,443
Oh! Way to go!

626
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:34,072
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.

627
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:36,491
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.

628
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,868
- [Splattering]
- Oh!

629
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,204
Here it comes.
Nice and easy. Good.

630
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:46,167
- l did it! l did it!
- All right.

631
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,837
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.

632
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:53,133
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?

633
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:57,262
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.

634
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:01,099
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.

635
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:04,436
Coach, l think you got the ceremonies
mixed up. lt's more like a circumcision.

636
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,564
Coach! Will you come back here?
What'd l ever do to you, man?

637
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:11,234
District Five! Ready!

638
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,945
Oh, man, l'm gonna die.
l'm gonna die.

639
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,614
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.

640
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,825
- Oh, please! No!
- Fire!

641
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,413
[Screaming]

642
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,583
l wanna go home!

643
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,419
[Screaming]

644
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:32,255
[Laughing]

645
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,632
This doesn't hurt!

646
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,093
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!

647
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:39,679
Oh! Come on!
That's good!

648
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:43,391
Hex goal! Goalie boot save!
Whoa! Nice shot, man!

649
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:46,353
l'm a dog! l'm a crazed dog!
Come on!

650
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:50,857
[Chanting]
Goldberg! Goldberg!

651
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,861
l am Goldberg!
The goalie! [Growling]

652
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,241
Good! Good!
All right, Charlie!

653
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,244
Good hustle! Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!

654
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,455
- You guys hungry? Tired?
- [Together] Yeah!

655
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,334
- Do you ache? Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!

656
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:13,672
Good! That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.

657
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:16,549
[lndistinct chatter]

658
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,845
Hey, guys! Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!

659
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,683
Ha-ha! Good joke.
Very funny. l like it.

660
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:27,769
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!

661
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,355
Coach, come on, don't leave me
hangin' like this!

662
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,691
Coach, don't make me
come after you, coach.

663
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:50,375
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks for the ride.

664
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,503
You did real well in
practise today, Charlie.

665
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:56,715
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?

666
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:04,347
Mom and l left him. l don't really
remember, but that's what she says.

667
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:08,268
You know, when l was a boy,
l had to take care of my mother too.

668
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:10,603
Really?
What happened to your dad?

669
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:14,107
He passed away.

670
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:19,529
You do a good job
takin' care of your mom.

671
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,698
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?

672
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,410
- Okay. We'll see ya.
- Okay. Hey, coach.

673
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,704
- What's that?
- Huh?

674
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,873
- Oh!
- Victory! [Laughing]

675
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:33,960
[Bombay laughing]
You've just entered the tickling zone!

676
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:36,046
[Laughing]

677
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,261
So l'm right in the middle of my
cross-examination and l say to the guy,

678
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:47,098
l usually defend heels like you,
you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.

679
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:49,434
[Chuckling]
That's a good one, sir.

680
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,436
Whoa!

681
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:57,067
[Screeching]

682
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:03,406
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

683
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:08,745
Hold it!

684
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,498
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

685
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,792
Look, it was an accident,
all right?

686
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,461
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

687
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,630
l didn't learn.
l just do it.

688
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,965
Do it again.

689
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,770
Yargh!

690
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:40,151
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?

691
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:43,530
Yeah. Well, one out of five.

692
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:46,908
Fulton, is it true what they say?

693
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:49,160
About the scholarships and how
they won't let you play hockey?

694
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,329
People talk.
lt don't mean nothin'.

695
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:54,040
- Why don't you play for us?
- l can't.

696
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:56,543
- What do you mean?
- l mean, l can't.

697
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:00,964
- You afraid? - No, l mean l can't,
you moron. l don't know how to skate.

698
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,845
Whoa!

699
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,888
ls that all that's stoppin' ya?

700
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:12,976
[lndistinct shouting]

701
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:22,235
* l ride the top of the line
l can't settle for less *

702
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,321
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.

703
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:27,032
Side to side, good!
Follow me.

704
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:31,494
[Screaming]

705
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:35,582
Aaah!

706
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,960
Watch it!
Get out of the way!

707
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,212
[Screaming]

708
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:43,590
Sorry!

709
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,884
* This is all we got baby
lt's got to be enough *

710
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:48,219
* l'd like to try to quit
But l don't know how *

711
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:52,140
* l needed it then and baby
l need it right now *

712
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:54,392
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!

713
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:57,395
- * l gotta keep movin' 'til l'm satisfied *
- Hey!

714
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,191
* Come on, Come on
lt's gonna be all right **

715
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:07,072
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?

716
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,616
Man, what brain-dead jerk
came up with that name?

717
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:14,788
As a matter of fact, l did. But l didn't
have a choice. We're being sponsored.

718
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:18,375
By who? Donald and Daisy?

719
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,170
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks?
You'd rather be District Five? Some stupid number?

720
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:25,423
Better than some stupid animal.

721
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:29,761
l'll have you know, Peter,
that the Duck is one of the most noble,

722
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:32,472
agile and intelligent creatures
of the animal kingdom.

723
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,141
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.

724
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,186
Neither do hockey players.

725
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,481
Have you guys ever seen a flock
of ducks flying in perfect formation?

726
00:49:41,606 --> 00:49:45,902
lt's beautiful. Pretty awesome
the way they all stick together.

727
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:49,239
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?

728
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:53,952
No way. Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.

729
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,080
They know that
if they mess with one duck,

730
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:00,625
they gotta deal
with the whole flock.

731
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,879
Oh, man!

732
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,007
l'm proud to be a duck.

733
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:10,468
And l'd be proud to fly
with any one of you.

734
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:13,096
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?

735
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:23,148
l'll be a Duck.

736
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:27,527
Yeah. Me too.

737
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:31,489
[lndistinct chatter]

738
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,619
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!

739
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:43,084
- Now we're the Ducks!
- [Cheering]

740
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,712
- The Mighty Ducks!
- [Cheering]

741
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:48,006
- What are we?
- [Together] The Ducks!

742
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,181
What the hell are they doing?

743
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,603
Every time you get the puck,
you're the quarterback.

744
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:05,440
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.

745
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,235
Come on, guys. This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.

746
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,571
What a weird-ass team.

747
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:13,823
How you doin'?

748
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,867
- You ready?
- l think so.

749
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,872
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.

750
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:32,509
My God!

751
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:45,063
Wow!

752
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:55,532
- [Crowd gasping]
- One out of five.

753
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:01,579
All right,
Let's forget the past.

754
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:05,333
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.

755
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,961
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.

756
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:12,382
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right! Yeah!

757
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:14,801
Quack, quack.

758
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,929
- Quack. Quack.
- [Together] Quack! Quack!

759
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:21,433
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack!

760
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:25,228
[Chanting]
Quack! Quack!

761
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:28,356
Go... Ducks!

762
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,942
- [Cheering]
- What the hell was that?

763
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:37,782
[Bombay]
Let's go, Ducks! Defence! Defence!

764
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:45,165
Dig it outta there!

765
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,627
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah!

766
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:53,423
Let's go, Ducks!

767
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:56,301
Throw it! Throw it!
To the crease!

768
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:00,722
[Cheering]

769
00:53:07,562 --> 00:53:10,982
Yes! The Oreo line!

770
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:13,902
That's my boy!
[Laughing]

771
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,995
Defence, Karp!
Defence! Come on.

772
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:30,168
[Crowd gasping]

773
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,845
l don't wanna go
to school today, Mom.

774
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,098
- How many fingers am l holdin' up?
- He wouldn't know.

775
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,725
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?

776
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:50,397
- Look at this.
- The Karp-ster used his head to stop the puck.

777
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:54,317
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.

778
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,783
Get him on the bench, Charlie.

779
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:06,329
Okay, Ducks,
we still got a chance here.

780
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:09,332
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy,
time for the secret weapon.

781
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:13,211
Okay, Fulton.
Remember, just like we talked about.

782
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,506
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.

783
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:21,469
[Cheering]

784
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:26,224
Oh, no.

785
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:29,769
- Go! Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.

786
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,319
That's it.

787
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,321
Aaah!

788
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,990
Whoa!

789
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:50,081
[Cheering]

790
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,339
Whoo! Yeah!

791
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:11,227
That tie of yours might be what you need
to make the play-offs.

792
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,396
- The ducks have a shot at the play-offs?
- Sure.

793
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:16,858
Everyone but the last two teams
are in, remember?

794
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,903
Panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season.

795
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:23,531
So, you beat the Huskies
and you'll make the play-offs.

796
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:27,077
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?

797
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,205
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since l played.

798
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,290
Actually, one little thing
has changed.

799
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,251
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.

800
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:39,881
They redrew the district
lines last year.

801
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:42,300
The lake is not
the boundary any more.

802
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:45,387
You see? You'd be a Duck.

803
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:49,432
l'd be a Duck.

804
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,937
Excuse me. Coach Reilly?

805
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,939
- Yeah?
- l'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.

806
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:59,150
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.

807
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:02,862
Banks! Over here!

808
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,948
- This is a joke, right?
- l'm afraid it's no joke.

809
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,076
- Problem?
- No, just a mistake.

810
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:12,831
Are you this boy's father? 450 North
Hennipen, is that your address?

811
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,958
- Yes.
- l'm afraid there's no mistake.

812
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,294
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?

813
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,131
According to league rules, Adam Banks
should be playing for District Five.

814
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:26,636
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- ls this your doing, Gordon?

815
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,097
l'll expect to see him
at our next game.

816
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,975
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.

817
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,562
My son would rather not play
than play for your team.

818
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,814
Fine, if that's the way
you want it. But remember,

819
00:56:37,939 --> 00:56:41,860
if Adam plays for the Hawks,
you'll forfeit every game for the rest of the season.

820
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,113
Boy, l'd hate to see that.

821
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:49,117
Look, l'm sorry this had to happen,
but you can see on the map.

822
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:54,080
Gordon? Hey, Bombay!

823
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:57,417
You stop when
l'm talking to you, son!

824
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:00,003
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?

825
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:03,089
The law's a bitch when it
works against you, isn't it, Jack?

826
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:05,633
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.

827
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:09,804
Even with Banks, what do you think you're gonna prove,
you and that bunch of losers?

828
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,182
That's right, coach.
They are losers.

829
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:16,019
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.

830
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:21,566
Maybe Banks won't make a difference,
but at least we're playing by the rules.

831
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:26,321
Why'd you turn against me,
Gordon? For six years...

832
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:29,199
l taught ya how to skate,
l taught ya how to score.

833
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,534
l taught ya how
to go for the "W."

834
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,245
You could have been
one of the greats.

835
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:37,207
And now look at yourself.

836
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:41,127
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.

837
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:53,515
Going to the play-offs! Whoo!

838
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,977
One win!

839
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:00,855
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.

840
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:05,443
All right, everyone, listen up.
l got some good news.

841
00:58:05,568 --> 00:58:07,988
We're getting a new player,
Adam Banks.

842
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,657
- What?
- [lndistinct chatter]

843
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,701
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.

844
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,578
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.

845
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,915
- We don't need him.
- l'm the coach. l say we do need him.

846
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,501
- lf we make it to the play-offs, he could be a big help.
- [Karp] lf?

847
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,712
All of a sudden you don't
think we're good enough.

848
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,756
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.

849
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:30,677
- What?
- We heard what you said.

850
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:33,888
You said we were losers,
we didn't deserve to live.

851
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:38,768
- That's not what l meant.
- l saw that picture of you missing that goal.

852
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:43,064
You were a Hawk, weren't you? Guess
you guys stick together to the end.

853
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:46,943
You know what?
l don't need your stinkin' equipment.

854
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:51,281
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.

855
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,576
- l'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.

856
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:59,164
lf you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.

857
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,461
Where do you guys
think you're goin'?

858
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:11,760
l don't believe this.
[Sighing]

859
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:16,097
All right, l'm goin' up to the bench
because that's where l'm supposed to be.

860
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:20,018
Anyone who wants to join me
can join me. Anyone who doesn't --

861
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,813
Well --

862
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,954
Ten minutes to game time, coach.

863
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,956
Yeah, yeah, they'll
be out in a minute.

864
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:45,085
They're, you know, working
themselves into a frenzy.

865
00:59:57,305 --> 00:59:59,683
Not much of a frenzy.

866
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:05,397
We forfeit.

867
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:07,899
Ducks forfeit. Flames, you win.

868
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,408
Hey. Can l sit?

869
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,410
Sure.

870
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,580
You talk to the guys?

871
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:26,084
l tried. They think l'm a traitor
for even showing up.

872
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:28,837
l guess they
really hate me, huh?

873
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,965
ls it true you were
really a Hawk?

874
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:35,218
Yeah.

875
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:39,431
Peter said you blew
a really big game once.

876
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,433
Yeah, well, Peter's right.

877
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:43,727
lt was the last game
of the state finals.

878
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,396
We were tied 2-2
in the end of the third period.

879
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,398
l get a penalty shot.

880
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:52,402
l go in, l triple deke.
l fake the goalie right out of his pads.

881
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:54,404
The puck's headed in,
and then...

882
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,240
- Clang! Hits the post.
- [Groans]

883
01:00:57,365 --> 01:00:59,743
We lost in overtime.

884
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,912
A quarter of an inch this way
and it would have gone in.

885
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,956
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.

886
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:09,419
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way
and you'd have missed completely.

887
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,421
l never thought of it that way.

888
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:13,965
At least you got to play
in a championship game.

889
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,219
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey. Can l get you a cup of coffee?

890
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:20,597
l'd love one.

891
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:26,436
You know, she has many fine qualities
that men find attractive.

892
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,356
l know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.

893
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,067
So, what kind of guys
does she usually date?

894
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,569
Jerks. l mean,
most of them like her,

895
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:36,696
but as soon as they
catch a glimpse of me --

896
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:39,991
Pow! Warp speed!
They are gone!

897
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:42,285
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, l wouldn't even care...

898
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,329
except it's not fair to my mom.

899
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:47,082
She deserves somebody nice.

900
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:50,168
Are you gonna come over
for dinner again?

901
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:52,170
l don't know, Charlie.

902
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:55,173
l'm not sure
it's such a good idea.

903
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:57,884
See, that's what l wanted
to talk to you about.

904
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:02,389
l, um, talked
to Jesse and Terry's dad,

905
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,517
and he's gonna take over
coaching for the rest of the year.

906
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:08,687
- You're quitting?
- l'm stepping aside to keep the team together.

907
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,689
The guys can't play for
somebody they don't trust.

908
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,857
l trust you.
The other guys do too.

909
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:15,026
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.

910
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:18,113
- l've done all l can.
- No, you haven't.

911
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:21,366
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.

912
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:23,535
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.

913
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,538
We are too! We weren't even
the Ducks until you came along.

914
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:29,708
You made us and now
you're stuck with us.

915
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,710
Charlie.

916
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:38,383
That's right.
The red is oxygen.

917
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:41,219
Now what are the blue balls?

918
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,179
[Students giggling]

919
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:45,432
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?

920
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,726
ls correct.
Now put them together...

921
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:51,938
and you have a molecule
that makes up 96 %%% of your body.

922
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:54,232
- What is it?
- Pizza?

923
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:56,359
[Students giggling]

924
01:02:56,484 --> 01:03:00,363
- [Knocking]
- lt's the principal. l'll be right back.

925
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:05,285
Work on H2 C03.
lt's a goody.

926
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:11,082
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?

927
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,460
Leave me alone, guys.
l don't want to talk about the team.

928
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,420
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.

929
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:17,756
Everybody knows
he likes you best.

930
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,592
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!

931
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,594
Take it back now!

932
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,554
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.

933
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,765
- [Connie] Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!

934
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,933
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.

935
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,935
[All arguing]

936
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:33,438
Atoms away!

937
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,739
My atoms!

938
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:44,866
You! Sit!

939
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:49,329
Sit now!

940
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,165
ln your seats now!

941
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,466
l have never in my life --

942
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:04,803
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

943
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,805
Quack.

944
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:11,309
[Chanting]
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

945
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:14,104
Thanks for coming by
on such short notice, Gordon.

946
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:16,106
By the way, your court
release came through.

947
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,109
- Congratulations. Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.

948
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,611
So you wanted to talk
about my coming back to work then?

949
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:23,780
- Well, actually --
- Oh, you got your jersey. Great!

950
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:27,867
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.

951
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:32,205
Gordon, you know
Coach Reilly and Mr Banks.

952
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,207
[Mumbling]
Sir, they're the bad guys.

953
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:37,043
No, actually, Phil is
one of my oldest friends.

954
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:41,381
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together
here to try to work out this little problem.

955
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,217
You see, my son Adam
wants to play for the Hawks.

956
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,511
His older brother was a Hawk.

957
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:49,973
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.

958
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:53,893
lt's a tradition. You understand that,
Gordon. You played.

959
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,563
But the league's
already ruled on it.

960
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,649
We've talked to the league,
and we worked out a little deal.

961
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:02,861
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.

962
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:07,073
The long and short of it is that Adam stays
on the Hawks for the rest of the season.

963
01:05:07,198 --> 01:05:09,909
And then next year,
they redraft the lines.

964
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,746
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.

965
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,748
What's that?

966
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:17,751
That you withdraw your protest.

967
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,756
- That's great.
- Good, good.

968
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,758
Well, that's settled then.

969
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,260
No, sir, you don't understand.

970
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:29,554
l can't withdraw my protest.

971
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,223
- What?
- Mr Ducksworth,

972
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,726
you wanted me to learn
about fair play...

973
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:37,729
and how to be part
of a team...

974
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:40,732
and l may not have
learned everything yet,

975
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:43,735
but l remember something
my father said to me.

976
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,738
A team isn't a bunch
of kids out to win.

977
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:50,075
A team is something
you belong to,

978
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,078
something you feel,

979
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:56,081
something you have to earn.

980
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:59,250
And l'm not gonna
let those kids down.

981
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,264
Gordon, l'm going
to make this simple.

982
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:19,104
Are you prepared to lose your job
over some kids? Some game?

983
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:22,440
Let me ask you, sir.

984
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:26,945
Are you prepared to fire me
over some kids? Some game?

985
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:31,741
Collect your personal
belongings, Gordon.

986
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:37,372
Yes, sir, Mr Ducksworth!

987
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,374
Thank you very much,
Mr Ducksworth!

988
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,419
Quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, Mr Ducksworth!

989
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:46,297
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.

990
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,051
[Quacking]

991
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:54,806
You may have paid for this jersey, sir,
but you didn't earn it.

992
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:58,351
l'll see you in the play-offs.

993
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,854
[Bell rings]

994
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,944
- Excuse me. There are some students
here that l'd like to see. - Who are you?

995
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,946
l'm their hockey coach.

996
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:14,409
lf you could tell me where
l can find each of them, please.

997
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:16,953
They're in room 223.

998
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:20,999
- All of them?
- All of them.

999
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:26,338
"l will not quack
at the principal."

1000
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:31,176
"l will not quack
at the principal."

1001
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,678
- What do you want?
- l want to talk to you guys.

1002
01:07:33,803 --> 01:07:36,681
- People.
- People, right.

1003
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:38,683
Sit down, please.
All of you.

1004
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:43,313
Okay, don't sit down.

1005
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,690
Look, what's done is done.

1006
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,360
l want to be your coach again.

1007
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:50,904
You're gonna coach
a bunch of losers?

1008
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,740
- No, l want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?

1009
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:56,076
You said we didn't
deserve to live.

1010
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,871
Karp, l was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?

1011
01:07:59,996 --> 01:08:03,041
- No.
- Okay, then you do.

1012
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,710
l didn't mean those things
the way they sounded.

1013
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,588
You guys know what it's like
to be misunderstood, right?

1014
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:11,424
- Yeah, of course. We're kids.
- So...

1015
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,928
Can you forgive me?
Can l be your coach again?

1016
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,556
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.

1017
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,433
He should have been
with us all year.

1018
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:24,729
lt's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!

1019
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:28,608
- We're a team, right?
- [Ducks] Yeah.

1020
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:33,113
l made you guys,
and l'm sticking with you.

1021
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:37,367
So, what's it gonna be?

1022
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,704
We can play tomorrow night and still
have a shot at the play-offs...

1023
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:45,917
or we can forfeit again
and the season's over.

1024
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:48,128
Peter, what do you say?

1025
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:51,131
Well...

1026
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,968
l guess it would help
if we practised first.

1027
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:57,971
All right. Let me see if l can
get you out of detention.

1028
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,265
- Yes.
- Take that.

1029
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,434
You really quacked
at the principal?

1030
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,728
Yeah.

1031
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:07,439
Are we Ducks, or what?

1032
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,274
Yeah!

1033
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,403
Look at your mother.

1034
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:16,406
Let's see how it is
in ten minutes.

1035
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,408
l'm gonna kill you!

1036
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,757
Hey. Wasn't sure
if you'd show up.

1037
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,759
Yeah, whatever.

1038
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:38,261
- l just want to play hockey.
- Good.

1039
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,431
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.

1040
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,767
On behalf of the Ducks,
l'd like to say welcome.

1041
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,686
Cake-eater.

1042
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:50,148
Ooh, the Jess-man, dissin' the new guy!
The Jess-ster!

1043
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,442
Shut up, Averman!

1044
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,278
[Averman]
lt's just a joke.

1045
01:09:55,403 --> 01:10:00,950
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey
doesn't mean you're a real Duck.

1046
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:30,021
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- l bet.

1047
01:10:30,146 --> 01:10:33,692
Well, suit up.
l'll see you on the ice.

1048
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:49,416
On your left!

1049
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,211
Over here!

1050
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,547
l'm open!

1051
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:59,092
Come on, right here!
Up front!

1052
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:03,138
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!

1053
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,725
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!

1054
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,438
Yeah! All right!

1055
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:16,109
Way to go, Banks!

1056
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,236
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!

1057
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:23,116
[Ducks talking excitedly]

1058
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:25,618
Goldberg, you're gonna
sit this one out.

1059
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,747
What? You're pulling
the goalie when we're tied?

1060
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:30,749
Listen, listen, listen!

1061
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:33,752
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.

1062
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,713
Okay, Fulton,
you're our extra man.

1063
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:39,883
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.

1064
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:42,761
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?

1065
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,972
No, take your shot. You may only
get one, so it's gotta be good.

1066
01:11:46,097 --> 01:11:49,100
- But, coach, one outta one?
- [Germaine] Soft hands, Fulton.

1067
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:52,270
- Concentration, not strength.
- [Bombay] That's right!

1068
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,648
Okay? Let's get the Huskies!

1069
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,775
Let's go! Come on!

1070
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,495
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one. Let's go!

1071
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:16,753
- Get in there!
- Come on!

1072
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,470
[Jesse]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1073
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,640
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!

1074
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:39,985
We won!

1075
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,658
We made the play-offs!

1076
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,257
[Charlie]
Boy, this is great.

1077
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,509
[Connie]
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.

1078
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:07,846
- Oh, man.
- lt's Mike Modano!

1079
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:12,851
- ...Believe this?
- Cool!

1080
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,853
This is too cool.

1081
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:17,105
l can't believe this.

1082
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:20,442
[Connie]
This place is humongous.

1083
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,944
What are we doing here?

1084
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:25,071
lt's a little play-offs present.

1085
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,997
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?

1086
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:36,499
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.

1087
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:40,211
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- l heard you were a farmer.

1088
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,213
Actually, l became a lawyer.

1089
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,549
But l'm coaching Pee Wee now
and this is my team, the Ducks.

1090
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:48,720
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- [Ducks] We can see that.

1091
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:50,722
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!

1092
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,766
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.

1093
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,102
lf you ever want a shot, l'll get you
a tryout in the minor league clubs.

1094
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:59,230
- Thanks.
- No problem. Hey, nice seein' ya.

1095
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:01,524

1120
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:56,723
You know, l heard the North Stars
wore the same underwear...

1121
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:59,726
all through the play-offs
last year for luck.

1122
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:01,728
So l'm doin' the same thing.

1123
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:04,731
Hmm. Maybe l should've cooked.

1124
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:08,777
You know, l'm thinkin' maybe we can all
go down to the winter festival tonight.

1125
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,779
- All three of us?
- Sure.

1126
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,198
l don't think l should,
'cause l got a lot of homework.

1127
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,701
You should go. With my mom.
By yourselves.

[Door slams]

1129
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:21,748
Mmm, smells great!

1130
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:24,376
Hello.

1131
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,753
[Whispering]
Go for it.

1132
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:28,963
Hi.

1133
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:34,719
[Casey]
l don't know how they sculpt these.

1134
01:16:34,844 --> 01:16:37,055
Hmm, l wonder.

1135
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,767
l used to sculpt,
but now l do mostly paintings.

1136
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:44,062
How do you think
they do the details?

1137
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:48,400
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.

1138
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:51,403
Oh.

1139
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,405

You probably think l'm weird.

No, l think you're great.

1143
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:17,262
When l was a little girl, l used
to pretend that that was an ice castle.

1144
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:20,432
And that was my room,
that window right up there.

1145
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,600
And last winter
l gave Charlie that one.

1146
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:25,770
What about me?
Which window's mine?

1147
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:29,274
l want to live there too.

01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:37,324
What? What did l say?

1149
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:41,369
- lt's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?

1150
01:17:41,494 --> 01:17:43,705
Casey, l was just
playin' around.

1151
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,708
Look, l don't know
how you feel about me.

1152
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,002
l don't even know
how l feel about you.

1153
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:52,505
But l do know there's
a little kid back home...

1154
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:56,092
who's absolutely falling
in love with his coach...

1155
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:58,428
and if you
can't deal with that,

1156
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:00,805
if you're just playing around,
then you better let me know.

1157
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,807
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?

1158
01:18:02,932 --> 01:18:05,727
- l have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.

1159
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:08,730
Charlie's gonna be there
when we get back.

1160
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:11,983
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.

1161
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:14,486
Look, l can take it.

1162
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:19,741
But if Charlie
gets too attached --

1163
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:23,578
Every time this happens,
it gets...

1164
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:26,164
a little rougher on him.

1165
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,919
Just on him?

1166
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:55,151
l'm glad to be here with you.

1167
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,530
Me too.

1168
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,741
[Announcer] The surprising Ducks
are still in this game...

1169
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:04,369
against the Hornets.

1170
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:07,789
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!

1171
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:17,549
lt's getting rough out there
between the Ducks and the Hornets.

1172
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:21,136
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots. He scores!

1173
01:19:26,182 --> 01:19:30,895
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots! Score!

1174
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:35,066
The ducks win it,
5-3 over the Hornets.

1175
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:37,402
And now it's on
to the semifinals...

1176
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:40,905
where the Ducks
will face the Cardinals.

1177
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:51,791
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
The Ducks and the Cardinals!

1178
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:54,252
Cardinals with it in their own zone,
tryin' to clear it out.

1179
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:56,379
Pass to the blue line,
intercepted by the Ducks.

1180
01:19:56,504 --> 01:20:00,759
Here's their star, Adam Banks. Banks
has great speed. Right down the middle!

1181
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:04,429
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!

1182
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,431
He scores!

1183
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:24,074
Come on! Come on, Jesse!

1184
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,493
[Announcer]
Ducks with it again.

1185
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,746
Here's Averman,
now getting it over to Banks.

1186
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,748
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!

1187
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,792
He shoots, he scores!

1188
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,628
Germaine put it off
the goaltender's glove into the net!

1189
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:39,964
And that does it! The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?

1190
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:45,762
4-2, and the Ducks now get set
to face the Hawks in the state finals.

1191
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:10,120
[Reilly]
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.

1192
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:13,456
Now, you miss this shot,
you're not just letting your team down,

1193
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:16,126
you're letting me down too.

1194
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,962
Remember, it's not worth playing --

1195
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:22,257
- lf you can't win.
- That's right. Okay, son, let's go.

1196
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:35,270
Let's go, son!
[Yelling]

1197
01:22:41,878 --> 01:22:46,591
* ...Oh, say does
that star-spangled *

1198
01:22:46,716 --> 01:22:50,804
* Banner yet wave *

1199
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:55,225
* O'er the land of the free *

1200
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:00,772
* And the home of the brave **

1201
01:23:00,897 --> 01:23:03,942
- Let's go!

1223
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:52,157
[Booing]

1224
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:57,829
Hey, Banks.

1225
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:00,832
Don't forget what side you're on.

1226
01:24:00,957 --> 01:24:04,627
He's a Duck, Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.

1227
01:24:22,312 --> 01:24:24,439
[Announcer]
And the game is underway,

1228
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:27,984
and right off Larson and McGill
with a heavy hit.

1229
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:32,697
That gives you an indication
of what you're going to see tonight.

1230
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:35,700
[Reilly] Good hit! That's the way
l want you guys to play it!

1231
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:45,585
The Ducks in green
chasing it down against --

1232
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,421
A hard hit out at centre ice!

1233
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,674
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!

1234
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:53,051
Heavy hitting continues
in this championship game.

1235
01:24:53,176 --> 01:24:56,054
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks' zone.

1236
01:24:56,179 --> 01:24:59,391
Back in again to Larson,
the man behind the net.

1237
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:17,409
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!

1238
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,870
Banks, two comin' hard!

1239
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,581
Banks still looking
for an opening, moves it up --

1240
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:28,378
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.

1241
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:32,340
Here's Larson, over to Brown. Brown,
in front, goes backhand. He scores!

1242
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,992
Come on! Hustle!

1243
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,252
Come on, you guys!

1244
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,758
Hawks with a 1-0 lead,
come back to centre ice.

1245
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,760
Larson gives it up to McGill.

1246
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:19,262
Here's McGill, inside,
the lead at centre ice.

1247
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:22,182
He's up on the blue line
and around the net.

1248
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,184
And he scores!

1249
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:30,899
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.

1250
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:40,617
Good save, Goldberg!

1251
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,299
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey...

1252
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,301
l want to see
played all day, boys.

1253
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:03,723
Larson stopped at the blue line,

1254
01:27:03,848 --> 01:27:06,184
but the Ducks can't clear it out.

1255
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:08,561
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots! He scores!

1256
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:18,321
The Hawks lead late
in the first period, 3-0.

1257
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:21,574
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.

1258
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,744
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.

1259
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:27,914
- Let's fly! Come on, let's go!
- [Ducks cheering]

1260
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:30,417
[Reilly] All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!

1261
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:32,419
All right, hold it, hold it.

1262
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:36,506
l want you to drop Banks like a bad
habit. l want him outta the game.

1263
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,717
- Finish him off. You got it?
- Yeah.

1264
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:40,385
Okay, boys, let's go.

1265
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:42,721
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

1266
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:45,557
Face-off for the second period,
and the Hawks win the draw.

1267
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:48,393
They get it back to Stickler.
3-0, Hawks lead.

1268
01:27:48,518 --> 01:27:51,730
Stickler to the blue line of the Ducks.
His pass taken away by Conway.

1269
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:53,440
[Bombay]
Go after him!

1270
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:55,942
Taken by Adam Banks.
Here's Banks across the blue line!

1271
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:57,944
McGill from behind!
Knocks Banks down!

1272
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:00,363
Banks shoots! He scores!

1273
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:03,116
Adam Banks with a great goal
for the Ducks!

1274
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:07,746
McGill knocked him down
from behind, but Banks scored.

1275
01:28:13,084 --> 01:28:14,961
Adam.

1276
01:28:15,086 --> 01:28:17,047
Adam, are you okay?

1277
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:21,384
- What'd you do?
- My job.

1278
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:25,305
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.

1279
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,724
Oh, my God.

1280
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:30,018
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.

1281
01:28:36,816 --> 01:28:38,693
Number seven, McGill.

1282
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:40,862
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.

1283
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:43,698
[Hawk]
Don't worry, guys.

1284
01:28:48,828 --> 01:28:50,955
Did it go in?

1285
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:55,043
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.

1286
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:57,087
Kick some Hawk butt.

1287
01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,090
All right, cake-eater.

1288
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:07,722
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.

1289
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:10,225
Hell of a job, son.

1290
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:15,897
They score against us,
they're gonna pay the price.

1291
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:19,067
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.

1292
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:21,152
You got somethin'
to say to me, Bombay?

1293
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:26,658
To think l wasted all those years
worrying about what you thought.

1294
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:31,705
You're goin' down, Reilly.

1295
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:42,424
- Let me go after 'em, coach. Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.

1296
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:47,429
Look, look, it's time
to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.

1297
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,932
- All right? Now we got the power play.
- [Ducks] Yeah. All right.

1298
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:55,687
We're gonna hit 'em
where it hurts the most: up there.

1299
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,897
Fulton, you're in.

1300
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:00,025
- Coach, they'll be rushin' him.
- Right.

1301
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,569
Jesse, make sure you give
Fulton plenty of time.

1302
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:04,362
- Right, coach.
- [Charlie] Jesse, do good.

1303
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:05,822
Let's go!

1304
01:30:05,947 --> 01:30:08,491
- [Ducks] Yeah!
- Hold it! Wait! Whoa!

1305
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:10,368
Let's have fun out there.

1306
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:12,370
- [Ducks] All right!
- All right!

1307
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:14,289
Let's go!
Let's go!

1308
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:17,709
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they
call on number 44, Fulton Reed...

1309
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,211

[Announcer]
...who has a big, booming shot.

1311
01:30:22,672 --> 01:30:25,383
And the Ducks get it
back to Fulton Reed.

1312
01:30:25,508 --> 01:30:29,346
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.

1313
01:30:33,516 --> 01:30:35,727
He scores!

1314
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:39,522
Fulton Reed has scored,
and the Ducks are back in the game!

1315
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:42,484

1318
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:53,203
More fun! More fun!

1319
01:30:53,328 --> 01:30:57,248
Of all the sloppy ass -- Ladies,
they don't need our help out there!

1320
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,751
Now l want that
Fulton Reed covered.

1321
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:02,253
He better not make another shot.
You got it?

1322
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:07,759
l'm tellin' you, you blow this game
and nobody makes the team next year!

1323
01:31:07,884 --> 01:31:10,261
All right, get out there!

1324
01:31:30,573 --> 01:31:32,409
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!

1325
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:34,411
The puck comes around,
now to Blake on the right side.

1326
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:37,414
Blake through the slot
with a backhand. Scores!

1327
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:39,666
Blake with a backhanded goal,

1328
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:44,129
and the Hawks regain
the two goal lead at 4-2.

1329
01:31:44,254 --> 01:31:46,256
Guys, guys, guys,
listen up, listen.

1330
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:49,259
We have got to stay
fired up and focused, all right?

1331
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:51,386
lt ain't over 'til it's over.

1332
01:31:51,511 --> 01:31:55,765
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks
something really different. Come here.

1333
01:31:55,890 --> 01:32:00,145
All right.
l want you guys to start up here --

1334
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:04,607
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2,
trying desperately to get back in the game.

1335
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:07,027
The Ducks with Tammy
and Tommy Duncan on the ice.

1336
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,654
Tammy Duncan goes in front
of the net, Tommy with the puck.

1337
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:12,991
Tammy's spinning,
and the Hawks are just looking at her.

1338
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:14,826
- Come on.
- Come on!

1339
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:17,495
Now!

1340
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,873
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!

1341
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:22,208
Yes! Yes!
We're still alive!

1342
01:32:30,842 --> 01:32:33,011
[Crowd booing]

1343
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:35,555
l'm on, coach.

1344
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,641
Yes, we're still in there!

1345
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:40,727
He Grabs McGill from behind...

1346
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:43,355
and throws him over the boards
into the bench.

1347
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,066
Now he wants to pick a fight
with the entire Hawks team.

1348
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:48,735
Fulton Reed has to be restrained
by the referee.

1349
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,071
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.

1350
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:53,073
l'm off, coach.

1351
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:55,325
He barely touched him.

1352
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,921
Oreo line!

1353
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:11,091
l want you to remember
what we learned.

1354
01:33:11,216 --> 01:33:13,426
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!

1355
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:15,762
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."

1356
01:33:15,887 --> 01:33:17,263
- All right!
- All right!

1357
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:19,683
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!

1358
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:22,894
[Jesse] Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!

1359
01:33:32,862 --> 01:33:34,447
Come on! Come on!

1360
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:36,533
Flying "V"!

1361
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:41,037
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net,
joined by the rest of his team.

1362
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:45,875
Here they come from behind the net!
lt's the flying "V"!

1363
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:50,422
Come on! Come on!

1364
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:54,426
Terry Hall, with the puck,
moves the puck ahead to brother Jesse.

1365
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:58,471
They stay onside the blue line.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.

1366
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:02,267
Moves down the right side,
now in front of the net. Jesse scores!

1367
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:18,283
[Crowd quacking]

1368
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:28,418
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal
will decide the championship.

1369
01:34:28,543 --> 01:34:31,421
Tremendous pressure. Neither team
can afford any mistakes now.

1370
01:34:31,546 --> 01:34:34,132
23 seconds left to go in regulation.

1371
01:34:40,513 --> 01:34:42,891
Looking for
the game-winning goal,

1372
01:34:43,016 --> 01:34:45,602
here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.

1373
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:49,648
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!

1374
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:53,818
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.

1375
01:34:53,943 --> 01:34:56,112
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!

1376
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:59,824
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line,
down the middle! He could win the game!

1377
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:07,499
Hey! Where's the call?

1378
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:12,003
No time left on the clock, but
the referee is calling a penalty shot!

1379
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:15,090
[Reilly]
What kind of call is that?

1380
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,759
Okay, we've got a penalty shot
for the Ducks.

1381
01:35:17,884 --> 01:35:21,096
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.

1382
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:25,767
All right, Ducks,
who's gonna take it?

1383
01:35:25,892 --> 01:35:27,769
- l think he should take it.
- Me?

1384
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:29,771
What about Charlie?

1385
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:32,023
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.

1386
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:34,025
Let's let him finish
what he started.

1387
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:37,028
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.

1388
01:35:37,153 --> 01:35:40,699
Come here. You been practising
that triple deke?

1389
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:42,993
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.

1390
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:45,495
You may make it, you may not.

1391
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,707
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.

1392
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:50,709
Look around.

1393
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:53,545
Whoever thought
we'd make it this far?

1394
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:58,049
One, two, three.
Triple deke.

1395
01:35:58,174 --> 01:36:00,760
Take your best shot.

1396
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:05,390
l believe in you, Charlie,
win or lose.

1397
01:36:05,515 --> 01:36:09,561
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.

1398
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:15,734
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.

1399
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:29,372
