00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,852
She gets all baked out and makes me
feel like I have to impress her.

341
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,855
And you know what?

342
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:30,448
I'm okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.

343
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:35,894
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.

344
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:37,932
I gotta go.

345
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,666
Hi, I'm Andrew Largeman.
I'm sorry.

346
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:47,902
- I'm really late for my appointment.
- Andrew. Andrew.

347
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,446
Okay, Andrew. I'm gonna need you
to fill out this paperwork for me.

348
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,708
As soon as we're ready,
we'll call you in.

349
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:56,182
- Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Have a seat.

350
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,185
- Hello, Miss Lubin.
- Oh, hello there.

351
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,812
Just have a seat.
We'll be with you soon, okay?

352
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,118
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

353
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,816
How's it going?

354
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,613
- [Growls]
- Get off.

355
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,622
Get off.

356
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:47,168
- Heel.
- [Girl Giggles]

357
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,568
- Heel!
- [Giggling]

358
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:56,704
Got any suggestions?

359
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,746
Oh, what?

360
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,976
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

361
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,553
Kick his balls.

362
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,221
Yeah, but I don't wanna destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

363
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,227
Don't worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.

364
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:16,765
If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly,
I'd never get anything done.

365
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,834
But he's gotta be close
to finishing by now.

366
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,834
Not yet.

367
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:23,063
Here comes the lipstick.

368
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,470
Mrs. Lubin?
We're ready for you now.

369
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:28,475
- Okay. Come on, Arthur.
- [Whines]

370
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,118
- I feel so used.
- [Laughs]

371
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,985
Thanks for your help.
For, at least, your good intentions.

372
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:45,524
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

373
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,926
No, not from high school.
From TV.

374
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,692
- Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,790
Are you
really retarded?

376
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,103
No, I'm not.

377
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,332
Cool.

378
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,069
Great job, man. I mean,
I thought you were really retarded.

379
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:05,340
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

380
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,608
If there was some
sort of retarded Oscar...

381
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:11,277
you would win like
hands down, kick his ass.

382
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:14,083
Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

383
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,657
I have to fill out
this form though, so...

384
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,659
- Right on.
- Thanks.

385
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,925
My cousin's an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.

386
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,935
Doubt you've ever
heard of him.

387
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:32,440
He was, like, on Xena once as a gnome
or something. That's really cool though.

388
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,975
Thanks.

389
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:38,312
Oh, my God.

390
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:40,314
That scene.
That last scene...

391
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,680
where you give the speech
to the whole stadium...

392
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:45,583
and your dad... oh, your dad
gives you the thumbs up.

393
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:48,589
Aw. That was, like...

394
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:50,591
That was emotional.

395
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:54,095
So, you got
anything else coming out?

396
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:56,426
No. You know,
I'm auditioning...

397
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:58,466
I can't believe
you're not really retarded.

398
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,467
I mean, Jake's not
a very good actor.

399
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:03,629
You can't really tell on Xena
'cause he's in the hairy gnome suit...

400
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:07,266
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really, really low-budge...

401
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:09,640
renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
musicals in our attic.

402
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:12,714
And they were awful.!

403
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:15,045
Like, so bad.
[Laughing]

404
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:20,547
It sucks, though, because there's not
that much work for little people, you know?

405
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,124
- [Laughs]
- Anyway, I'm talking too much.

406
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:25,955
I'll just...
You got to fill out your forms.

407
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,154
What are you
listening to?

408
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:30,231
The Shins.

409
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,698
- You know them?
- No.

410
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:36,134
You gotta hear this one song.
It'll change your life. I swear.

411
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:39,799
Oh, I'm sorry. You have to...
You gotta fill out your forms.

412
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,808
Conundrum.
Think you could, uh...

413
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,243
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.

414
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,315
Yeah? Okay.

415
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:51,250
## [Vocalizing]

416
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:03,294
# Gold teeth and a curse

417
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,726

00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:09,360
# Only, I don't know how

00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:11,598
#They got out, dear #

420
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:13,607
#Turn me... ##

421
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,609
It's good.
I like it.

422
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:20,872
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?

423
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:23,110
Waiting for a friend. You?

424
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,386
I, uh...

425
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,888
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I'm sorry. [Scoffs]

426
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:32,620
I am so nosy. I didn't...
I didn't mean to be. I'm sorry.

427
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:35,925
No, I just... I get these headaches.
I just want to have it checked out.

428
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:38,022
Cool.

429
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,033
- [Woman] Andrew Largeman?
- Yes.

430
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:43,468
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.

431
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:46,473
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. I'm Sam.

432
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,202
Andrew.

433
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,746
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.

434
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,781
Thanks.

435
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,548
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

436
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,075
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.

437
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:32,278
- There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
- What?

438
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:35,413
Just kidding.
How would I know that? Uh...

439
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:38,926
I'm Dr. Cohen.

440
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:43,189
What can we do
for you today, Andrew.

441
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,932
Um, I've been getting these
really intense headaches.

442
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:50,266
Um, they last for
like a split second.

443
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:54,206
It's like lightning, like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

444
00:31:58,013 --> 00:31:59,947
Lithium?

445
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,107
How long have you been
on the lithium?

446
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:06,711
Um, I've been on some form of it
since I was 10 or so.

447
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:11,822
And the Paxil,
Zoloft, Celexa...

448
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:13,861
Depakote...

449
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:16,453
did they, uh,
help you at all?

450
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:18,465
No.

451
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,592
I mean,
I don't know. Uh...

452
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:25,036
It's recently occurred to me I might not
even have a problem. [Chuckles]

453
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,543
Only, I'd never know it because as far back
as I can remember, I've been medicated.

454
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,875
I left them
in L.A. though.

455
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,212
This is, uh, the first time I haven't had
medicine in my body for... a long time.

456
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:38,878
You know that stuff will
leave your body pretty fast.

457
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:43,424
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about
taking a little vacation.

458
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:45,823
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

459
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:49,261
Uh, well,
my psychiatrist is my dad.

460
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:53,959
Yeah. So I think he'd
prefer me to stay on it.

461
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:57,266
He... likes to think
it makes me happy.

462
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:02,439
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things...

463
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,910
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

464
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:07,743
Uh...

465
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,685
I found my ex-best friend's
cuff links in my wife's purse.

466
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:17,952
I couldn't get an erection
for a year and a half...

467
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,960
for example.

468
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:25,062
[Exhales]
Wow. Um...

469
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,000
But I don't really think
that's it because I don't...

470
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:31,470
I don't really feel like
stressed or anxious at all.

471
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:35,304
'Cause all the lithium he's had you on.
It's amazing you can even hear me now.

472
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,776
Look, Andrew, uh,
first of all...

473
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:43,340
I think you do need to find
a psychiatrist that isn't your father.

474
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:46,250
That's something that should have
been remedied years ago.

475
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:48,255
He knows better.

476
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:51,349
And secondly, uh, I'm in
no position to comment on...

477
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,055
whether you should stay on the meds or not
because I don't know your story.

478
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:59,122
But my opinion,
since you're paying for it...

479
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:02,829
is that, yeah, those drugs may help you
as a means to an end...

480
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:05,634
but sooner or later, if you're not
in some sort of therapy...

481
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:09,973
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its little head out of the water.

482
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:12,239
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

483
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:14,406
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

484
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,349
[Laughs] Come on.
I'll take a look at you. Come.

485
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:23,246
I'll need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.

486
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,919
#[Man Singing]

487
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:56,152
#[Ends]

488
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:58,556
So why were you
really there?

489
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,685
Charging.
I'm a robot.

490
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,791
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?

491
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,869
Enough for people
to call you a liar.

492
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,497
- People call me lots of things.
- Is one of them "liar"?

493
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,473
I could say no, but how would
you know I'm not lyin'?

494
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,067
I guess I could choose
to trust you.

495
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,647
- You can do that?
- I can try.

496
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:22,046
Whose bike is that?

497
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:26,382
It was my grandfather's.

498
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:30,982
It was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

499
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:33,084
And I like it.

500
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,999
So this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if I'd like a ride home.

501
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:42,263
- It is?
- Yep.

502
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:46,439
Would you like a ride home?

503
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:52,572
Fine. But I'm not
getting in that sidecar.

504
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:55,377
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.

505
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:58,214
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

506
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,880
Thus, I will ride
on the back.

507
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:11,064
- Whoa.
- Hold on tight.

508
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,225
Okay. Holdin'.

509
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:18,999
My hair is blowin'
in the wind.

510
00:36:23,845 --> 00:36:25,745
What, are you
like a hang glider?

511
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,315
My boyfriend was gonna
pick me up so I brought it.

512
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:31,875
- But then he couldn't.
- What does he have? One of those tandem things?

513
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:34,717
No. He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

514
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:38,281
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.

515
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:40,918
- Anyway, how's your head?
- I should live through the day.

516
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:42,929
Cool.
Make a right here.

517
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:50,500
Are you doing
anything right now?

518
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:53,699
- Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
- I know this guy, Jesse.

519
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,834
He bought this mansion
that's right up here...

520
00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:57,844
and he wants me
to come visit him.

521
00:36:57,946 --> 00:37:02,144
But I don't want to stay very long.
I was thinking, like if you came too...

522
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,651
I could just say I have to take you home
when I'm ready to go.

523
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:08,917
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

524
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:11,492
- I know.
- "Nice to meet you. Can I use you?"

525
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,584
- No.
- It's the Hollywood in you, I guess.

526
00:37:13,695 --> 00:37:16,129
No. Come on.
It's not like that. It'll be fun.

527
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:19,462
I'll tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.

528
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:22,594
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

529
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:26,697
And then I'll be like, "Oh, I got to
take her home." And then we'll go.

530
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:30,435
Can we have
code names too?

531
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,979
If you want.

532
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:35,982
Okay. But don't try
and like kidnap me or anything...

533
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:39,986
'cause my step-uncle's a bounty hunter
and he could have you tracked and killed.

534
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:42,215
[Scoffs]
You're such a liar.

535
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:46,593
[Sam]
Whoo!

536
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,360
Okay. You ready?

537
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:14,488
I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
you've ever brought home?

538
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:16,523
No. But, um...

539
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,753
I lied to you before when I told you
my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

540
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:22,887
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, I don't have a boyfriend.

541
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:26,763
But, you know,
he might drive a Ninja.

542
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:30,031
- Wherever he is.
- Wow. We're off to a great start.

543
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:34,302
Okay. So...
So sometimes I lie.

544
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,105
I mean,
I'm weird, man.

545
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:40,238
About random stuff too.
I don't even know why I do it.

546
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,248
It's like...
It's like a tic.

547
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,787
I mean, sometimes I hear myself
say something, and then I think...

548
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:49,356
"Wow, that wasn't even
remotely true."

549
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,017
So how do people know
what's real?

550
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:56,154
Well, I always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

551
00:38:57,365 --> 00:38:59,265
Can you trust that?

552
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:02,393
[Chuckles]
Open the door.

553
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:05,373
Okay.

554
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:06,271
Okay.

555
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,535
[Dogs Barking]

556
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,869
Kevin, down.
Mom!

557
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:15,814
Come on. Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.

558
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,112
Mom!

559
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,121
All right! Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?

560
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,454
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

561
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,221
Kevin!
Get off!

562
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,628
I'm so sorry. Wejust don't have
the time to train them.

563
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,927
Who's got the time
to train them?

564
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:35,730
- Mom, this is Andrew.
- Welcome.

565
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:37,737
Welcome.
I'm sorry the place is a wreck.

566
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,206
Honey, I asked you to get
the metal wheel out of the hamster cage.

567
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:44,210
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly's dead.

568
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,439
Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.

569
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:48,982
We have to get
the only hamsters on planet Earth...

570
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,245
who can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel.

571
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:53,480
There's a tin box
on the kitchen counter.

572
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:56,148
You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.

573
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:58,249
- It's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
- Yes.

574
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,658
Andrew.
Very nice to meet you.

575
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:03,322
Samatha, put the clothes
in the dryer and buryJelly.

576
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,166
So this is it.

577
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,773
[Cat Meowing]

578
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:20,107
- It's nice.
- No, it's not.

579
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,945
Don't say that just 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

580
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:25,383
I'm not. I'm not.
It's... It's very cozy.

581
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:27,955
You guys are a little early
on the tree though.

582
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:32,015
Yeah, we never got around to taking it down.
When it got to be fall again...

583
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:34,027
we figured,
"Just leave it up."

584
00:40:34,129 --> 00:40:37,394
Oh, my God. You're totally freaked out.
You're totally freaked out right now.

585
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:40,662
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- I'm not. I'm not. I like it.

586
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,397
- It's very nice.
- Well, you wanna see my room?

587
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:45,405
Sure.

588
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:48,341
- Hey.
- Hey.

589
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:51,503
Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

590
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:55,140
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

591
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,343
- I'm sorry aboutJelly.
- Oh, that's okay.

592
00:40:57,452 --> 00:41:00,080
I saved some mac and cheese for you.
It's in the fridge.

593
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:02,213
Thank you.

594
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,597
Anyway, I'm late for class.
It's nice meeting you.

595
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,496
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you later.

596
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,870
So here we are.

597
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:21,100
It's nothing fancy,
but you know... What?

598
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:25,437
Uh, it's... Titembay, right?

599
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:28,311
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

600
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,715
You're running for the door. It's okay.
You can go. Don't feel bad. It's really...

601
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,788
- Stop doing that.
- What?

602
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:37,221
The whole thing you just did. I wanna be here.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be.

603
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:40,055
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours. Okay?

604
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:41,788
Okay.

605
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,763
So, Titembay.

606
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:48,597
- Yeah, he's my brother.
- Is he adopted or...

607
00:41:48,703 --> 00:41:51,695
Kind of. My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers like years ago.

608
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:55,469
One of those "For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.

609
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:59,104
Where she's like, "How can you
just sit there and not help the children?"

610
00:41:59,214 --> 00:42:02,581
And we couldn't. We just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

611
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:06,017
So we start sending him like
pictures and letters and stuff for years...

612
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:09,887
but then I got really into ice-skating,
so we sort of forgot about him.

613
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:13,017
Then one day we get this phone call
and it's Titembay.

614
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,323
And he's at the dry cleaners
around the corner.

615
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,160
And he's like, "I'm at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms...

616
00:42:18,266 --> 00:42:21,724
but I'm used to living with my tribe
so I'd rather live with a family."

617
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:24,270
And he's been living
with us ever since.

618
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:26,806
Wow.

619
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:29,843
Yeah. I know.
He's the most amazing guy.

620
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:33,778
You gotta hear his stories. He struggled
through so much because he wanted to learn.

621
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,009
When I think of what
he's accomplished, I just...

622
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:38,051
I just feel,
like, lazy. You know?

623
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:40,986
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,
and when he was a baby...

624
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:44,354
he was one of those kids with,
like, the flies all over his face.

625
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,991
Wow.
[Chuckles]

626
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:49,996
I mean,
i-it's a crazy story.

627
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, I know. I mean, that's a true story.
I am not that good.

628
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:57,661
This is Tickle.

629
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:02,072
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle's my favorite thing in the whole world.

630
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:05,146
It's all that's left
of Nanny, my blanket.

631
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,441
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:09,983
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
- Shut up.

633
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:13,451
No, I mean, I've had this
since I was a baby.

634
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:16,285
It's what they brought me home
in from the hospital.

635
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:20,584
- It's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?

636
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:23,027
Uh, the Wailing Wall
is like this, uh...

637
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:26,692
It's like the most holy place
forJews to go and pray in Israel.

638
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:31,465
It's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

639
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:34,371
So you're like
reallyJewish.

640
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:36,376
- What?
- You are, aren't you?

641
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:38,571
- You are. [Laughs]
- No, I'm not.

642
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,580
l-I'm Jewish,
but I'm not reallyJewish.

643
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:43,446
I don't do anything Jewish.
I don't go to temple or anything.

644
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:45,781
But I don't know anyJews
that go to temple.

645
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:48,014
TheJews I know,
they go on one day.

646
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:51,114
- It's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
- Okay.

647
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:54,024
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls...

648
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,495
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent...

649
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,329
they can actually make the room
big enough to hold everyone?

650
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:03,029
I don't really
believe in God.

651
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:05,901
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, I believe in Tickle.

652
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:10,534
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?

653
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:13,443
I'm sorry. [Scoffs]
I just totally ruined that moment, didn't I?

654
00:44:13,548 --> 00:44:16,176
- No, no.
- It's just that we're not gonna make out, okay?

655
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:18,411
- Oh, no, I hadn't planned on trying...
- Oh, my...

656
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,045
I am so lame.
That was like really... I am...

657
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:23,316
I'm sorry.
Forget I just said that. I am...

658
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,358
That was dumb. And...

659
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,623
- You know what I do
when I feel completely unoriginal?
- What?

660
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:33,299
# La, blah, blah
Blah, la, la ##

661
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:36,962
I make a noise or I do something
that no one has ever done before.

662
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:40,871
And then I can feel unique again
even if it's only for like a second.

663
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,603
So, no one's
ever done that?

664
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:47,807
No, not in this spot. No. You just witnessed
a completely original moment in history.

665
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,384
- It's refreshing. You should try it.
- Oh, no. Thanks.

666
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:53,215
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.

667
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:55,482
Come on.
What are you, shy?

668
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,888
This is your one opportunity
to do something...

669
00:44:57,992 --> 00:45:02,429
that no one has done before and that no one
will copy again throughout human existence.

670
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,933
A-And if nothing else, you'll be remembered
as the one guy who ever did this.

671
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,935
This one thing.

672
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,596

674
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:20,246
How was that?

675
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:22,578
Oh, I've done
that one before.

676
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:24,085
- [Laughs]
- So, uh...

677
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:25,052
- [Laughs]
- So, uh...

678
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:28,122
I gotta go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

679
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:30,918
Wanna help? Hmm?

#[Man Singing]

681
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:45,535
- Wow.
- Yeah.

682
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,801
- I mean, this is, uh...
- I know.

683
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:50,969
It's not that we're bad
pet owners or anything.

684
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,981
It's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

685
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,347
Besides,
a lot of these are fish.

What are you
thinking about?

691
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:28,042
- Now?
- Yeah.

692
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:31,175
- Right now?
- Yeah.

693
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:35,119
Right now, I was thinking I've been
going to a lot of these things lately.

694
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:37,657
- What, dates?
- Not dates.

695
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:40,785
Is this a date?
This isn't a date.

Funerals.

697
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:44,898
Why? Who else died?

698
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:48,931
Oh, uh...

699
00:46:49,037 --> 00:46:52,939
That's why I'm home actually. I guess
I haven't even told you that yet. Um...

700
00:46:57,178 --> 00:46:59,271
My mom just died.

701
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:07,480
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

702
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:11,489
My mom just died.
And, uh...

703
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,117
Yeah, that's why I'm home.

704
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,594
I'm so sorry.

705
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:18,723
God, I'm so sorry.

706
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,700
And here I am, like, putting you
through another one of these.

707
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,737
Not thatJelly's like
anywhere near your mom's.

708
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,602
I mean,
we loved Jelly but...

709
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,608
I'm so sorry.

710
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,440
No, it's okay.
It's all right.

711
00:47:31,546 --> 00:47:33,480
I'm all right with it.

712
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,243
Anyway, I think it's
what she wanted, so...

713
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,750
How'd she die?

714
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:42,322
She drowned actually.

715
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:47,727
Yeah, my, uh...
My mother was a paraplegic.

716
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:50,354
She was in a wheelchair
so she, uh...

717
00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:52,592
You know, and, uh...

718
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,793
I guess she was
taking a bath...

719
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:56,893
and she must have
slipped or something.

720
00:47:57,004 --> 00:47:59,939
That's what they say.
I don't... I don't know. But...

721
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,066
needless to say,
she drowned and...

722
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:05,168
that's how she...
sh-she died.

723
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,679
When?

724
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:10,182
This was, uh...

725
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:13,153
Sunday.

726
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:15,552
Oh, my God.

727
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:23,029
Why are you crying?

728
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:27,034
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

729
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:30,599
Because... I'm not
usually like this.

730
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:35,199
It's just like...
It's just so sad.

731
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:37,869
You know, it's like...

732
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:40,846
It's so tragic, isn't it?
It is. It's like...

733
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:44,782
It's like real life
tragedy or something.

734
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:47,821
Anyway, let's change
the subject, okay?

735
00:48:47,922 --> 00:48:50,015
Let's really bring
the focus back toJelly...

736
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:53,218
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died...

737
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:55,989
when you're in the act of
burying a close friend?

738
00:48:56,097 --> 00:49:00,295
- Well, what should we do?
- I don't know. I've only been
to one of these things.

739
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,528
You appear to be
the expert.

740
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:05,470
Well, we usually
say something.

741
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:08,371
Okay, uh,
I'll go first. Um...

742
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:13,445
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what I hear, you were a good pet.

743
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,982
- Little trouble with the wheel but...
- That's not funny.

744
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,880
Jelly, you were
a great pet.

745
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,220
I'm sorry I forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

746
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,094
I'm so, so sorry
about that.

747
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:35,659
Good-bye.

748
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,931

with people around here.

There's nothing wrong with you.

to figure that out myself.

like later tonight?

- Absolutely.

She could have gone to the Olympics.

I couldn't have.

not want him to see how talented you are?

- I'm dusting for prints.

Well, could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

I want to show Andrew
Sam's skating.

actually showing him this.

- And...

- All right.

All right, go on!

811
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:42,359
Go on. Get away.
Wait a minute.

00:54:42,461 --> 00:54:44,622

- Have a good night.

- Come on! You're giving me a hug too.

- I'll take a hug.

00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,865
All right, so what are
we laughing at you about?

826
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:33,467
Mm.
I lied again.

827
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:37,640
- I have epilepsy.
- Which part are we laughing about?

828
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:41,411
I, um...

829
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,784
I had a seizure at
the law office where I work.

830
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:47,222
And they told me their insurance wouldn't
cover me unless I wore preventative covering.

831
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:51,990
- What's preventative covering?
- The helmet I was wearing.

832
00:55:52,097 --> 00:55:53,997
Oh, come on!
[Laughing]

833
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:55,999
That's funny.
That's really funny.

834
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:58,365
I mean, I'm the only person
who wears a helmet to work...

835
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:03,100
who isn't, like, putting out fires,
or, like, racing for NASCAR.

836
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:06,803
Well, what do you do? I mean,
I can't quit. Their insurance is amazing.

837
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:09,346
What do you do?
You laugh, you know?

838
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:13,976
I'm not saying I don't cry.
But in-between, I laugh.

839
00:56:14,086 --> 00:56:17,146
And I realize how silly it is
to take anything too seriously.

840
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:22,019
Plus, I look forward
to a good cry.

841
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:24,027
Feels pretty good.

842
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,230
I haven't cried since
I was a little kid.

843
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:33,465
I didn't cry at my mother's funeral.
I tried, you know?

844
00:56:33,572 --> 00:56:35,733
I thought of all the saddest
things I could think of.

845
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:39,641
Like, things in movies, this...

846
00:56:39,745 --> 00:56:42,077
There's this image from Life magazine
that's always haunted me.

847
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,741
I just focused in on it,
you know?

848
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,546
But nothing came.

849
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,587
That actually made me
sadder than anything...

850
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:52,156
the fact that
I just felt so numb.

851
00:56:52,257 --> 00:56:54,953
- What do you mean?
- Just that...

852
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,154
Hey, Vagina.!

853
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:03,462
Hey, what's up, guys? Uh, Sam,
that's Mark, Dave and you rememberJesse.

854
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:05,560
- Hey.
- What's up?

855
00:57:05,671 --> 00:57:08,663
Hey, nice to meet you. I'm sorry
I said "vagina"just now.

856
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:10,901
- I didn't know you were here.
- Oh, that's okay.

857
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:15,777
- Nice. Let's get fucked up.
- [Chuckles]

858
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:21,112
[Together]
One, two, three! Whoo!

859
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:30,522
- What are you doing?
- [Dave] Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.!

860
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:33,029
- It's so warm!
- [Laughing]

861
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,532
Can't you swim?

862
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:37,693
Of course I can swim.

863
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:59,015
Dude, maybe you should stay on the steps.
I don't know C.P.R.

864
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:03,752
- You look like a wet beaver.
- [Laughing]

865
00:58:06,732 --> 00:58:09,292
[Chattering]

866
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,343
[Andrew] There's a handful
of normal kid things I kind of missed.

867
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:25,213
[Sam] There's a handful of normal
kid things I kind of wish I'd missed.

868
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:30,681
You know that point in your life when
you realize the house you grew up in...

869
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:32,689
isn't really
your home anymore.

870
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:36,420
All of a sudden, even though you have
some place where you put your shit...

871
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:39,019
that idea of home is gone.

872
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,631
[Sam] I still feel at home
in my house.

873
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:49,231
[Andrew] You'll see one day when you move out.
Just sorta happens one day, and it's gone.

874
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:52,902
You feel like you
can never get it back.

875
00:58:53,011 --> 00:58:55,844
It's like you feel homesick
for a place that doesn't even exist.

876
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:01,575
Maybe it's like
this rite of passage, you know?

877
00:59:01,687 --> 00:59:05,418
You won't ever have that feeling again until
you create a new idea of home for yourself.

878
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:08,721
You know, for... For your kids.
For the family you start.

879
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:11,295
It's like a cycle
or something.

880
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:15,966
I don't know. But I miss
the idea of it, you know?

881
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:23,065
Maybe that's all
family really is.

882
00:59:23,175 --> 00:59:26,372
A group of people that miss
the same imaginary place.

883
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:31,373
[Laughing, Whooping]

884
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:33,451
[Splashing]

885
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:38,890
Maybe.

886
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:53,727
[Mark] How about some
fuckin' furniture, dude?

887
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,399
[Jesse] I bought a chair,
but I didn't like it.

888
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:58,601
- [Sam] Where is it?
- It's keeping us warm.

889
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,735
[All Chuckling]

890
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:11,178
- [Sizzles]
- Silent Velcro.

891
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:14,882
- You lucky motherfucker.
- [Chuckling]

892
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:18,520
I feel like if I had showed up at school
and presented the idea of silent Velcro...

893
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,996
they would have sent me away
a whole lot sooner.

894
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:24,694
- Why did they send you away?
- Oh. Listen to this girl.

895
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:28,000
- They didn't "send me away."
- You just said they sent you away.

896
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:30,438
I mean, they sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.

897
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,976
"Sent me away" sounds like
I went to some asylum or something.

898
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:36,707
- There were no straps involved.
- Why did they send you to boarding school?

899
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,380
They sent me to
boarding school because...

900
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:42,715
they thought
I might be dangerous.

901
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:46,587
"Oh, are you freaked out?
You're like running for the door.

902
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:48,990
- You can go. It's okay. Don't feel bad."
- That's really funny.

903
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:51,562
- [Chuckling]
- It's really funny.

904
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:53,563
Why would they think
you'd be dangerous?

905
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:56,225
You're like
a little detective.

906
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:58,132
- Want to know?
- Yeah.

907
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,104
- You're gay.
- [Laughing]

908
01:01:01,206 --> 01:01:04,266
No. Drumroll.

909
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,649
I was the reason
she was in a wheelchair.

910
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:15,720
I pushed her.

911
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:19,216
So there that is.

912
01:01:21,493 --> 01:01:23,757
- Shut up!
- Fuck off.

913
01:01:23,862 --> 01:01:27,093
- No. That's the truth.
- Why?

914
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:29,394
It was just a complete
freak accident, you know?

915
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:32,698
It's one of those things you replay
a million times in your head...

916
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:36,535
and you see how clearly it was
just a complete freak thing.

917
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:39,702
My-My whole life, she was
depressed for no reason.

918
01:01:39,811 --> 01:01:41,836
And... one day,
you know...

919
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:44,279
I was a little kid.
I was nine years old...

920
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:47,181
and I just
hated her for that.

921
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,754
And... I pushed her.

922
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:52,255
And it was innocent.
I was just completely frustrated.

923
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:54,416
- 'Cause...
- 'Cause you couldn't make her happy?

924
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:57,893
Yeah! Fuck, yeah!
And any other time, you know...

925
01:01:57,996 --> 01:02:01,625
any other day, she would havejust
yelled at me and sent me to my room.

926
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:04,395
But this day...

927
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:07,097
on this particular day...

928
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:11,039
the door of the dishwasher...

929
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:13,634
had fallen open...
the latch on it was broken.

930
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:16,043
And it would just
randomly fall open.

931
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:18,912
That fuckin' latch,
you know.

932
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:23,818
It's really amazing how much of my life has been
determined by a quarter-inch piece of plastic.

933
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:25,822
But...

934
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:28,654
So, anyway, she, uh...
she fell back over the door...

935
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,197
and, uh, hit her neck on the kitchen counter,
paralyzing her from the waist down.

936
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:39,070
- Wow.
- Still want to compare fucked-up families?

937
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:41,799
But your mom was in the wheelchair
long before you left.

938
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:44,899
Yeah. Well, I was nine.

939
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,036
So they sent me to therapy
and put me on these drugs...

940
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:50,239
that were supposed to
"curb my anger,"

941
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,250
and I've been on some
form of them ever since.

942
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:57,948
And when I was 16, my psychiatrist dad
came around to the conclusion that...

943
01:02:58,056 --> 01:03:01,787
it probably wasn't the best environment
for me to be growing up in, so...

944
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:03,952
he sent me to boarding school.

945
01:03:04,062 --> 01:03:06,553
- And I haven't been home since.
- Until now.

946
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:10,294
- For her funeral.
- Till now for her funeral.

947
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:14,996
[Jesse] I can't believe the retarded
quarterback's a pill-popper.

- [Laughing]
- [Woman]Jesse?

950
01:03:19,311 --> 01:03:22,109
Where's the sauna?

951
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:24,705
- I'll show her.
- No, l-I got it.

952
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:27,080
- No, you get her a towel.
- Wait. Wait.

953
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:32,986
[Mark]
Want a ride, sweetheart?

956
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:46,864
You're in it
right now, aren't you?

957
01:03:46,972 --> 01:03:50,135
- What do you mean?
- My mom always says that when she can see...

958
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:53,871
I'm, like, working something out in my head,
she's like, "You're in it right now."

959
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:56,209
And I'm lookin' at you,
and you're...

960
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:59,249
telling me
that story, and...

961
01:03:59,351 --> 01:04:01,478
you're definitely
in it right now.

962
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:05,288
I think you're right.
I am in it.

963
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:11,286
Okay. I mean, whatever. All right.
Can we just change the subject, okay?

964
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:14,160
Let's just... Let's just
talk about good stuff.

965
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:19,829
- Good stuff?
- Yeah, like "glass half-full" shit.

966
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:23,772
- What do you got?
- Got a little buzz. [Chuckles] Got that.

967
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:27,473
- What you got?
- I got a little buzz goin'

968
01:04:31,116 --> 01:04:33,084
And I like you.

969
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:36,177
[Chuckles]

970
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:44,618
So there's that.
I guess I have that.

971
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:53,169
I can tap-dance.
You want to see me tap-dance?

972
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:55,466
I would love
to see you tap-dance.

- What are you doing?
- You collect Desert Storm trading cards?

978
01:06:24,362 --> 01:06:26,887
Fuck yeah. Those things
are collector's items, man.

979
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:29,728
You have any idea how much
those things are gonna be worth one day?

980
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:32,462
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. That's just like an investment.

981
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,539
I have lots of little investments
all over the place.

982
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:37,574
One day I'm gonna sell all of'em
just fuckin' live off of it.

983
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:40,868
So, like how much
is this one worth?

984
01:06:40,979 --> 01:06:45,177
- Which?
- "Night Vision Goggles."

985
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:48,446
I don't know. Mint?
Uh, two, maybe three.

986

- Yeah.

987
01:06:50,722 --> 01:06:54,089
It's too early. You don't sell 'em yet.
Don't you know anything about investing?

988
01:06:54,192 --> 01:06:56,217
I'm gonna
live off that shit.

989
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,888
If you have a complete set,
it's worth, like, thousands.

990
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:02,626
- So do you have the complete set?
- Almost.

991
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:06,329
The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire,"
and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer."

Whaddya got to do today? 'Cause, uh...

994
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:18,240
I got you a little
going-away present...

995
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,787
but, uh, I gotta kind of
track it down first.

996
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:27,415
- So can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah. I just, uh...

997
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:31,825
- What?
- No, nothin'. I just, uh...

998
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,421
Say it. Speak.

999
01:07:36,901 --> 01:07:39,768
I kinda told Sam I was gonna
hang out with her today.

1000
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:42,931

- Oh, gymnastics Tina?

1020

- I don't know. She wasn'tJewish. I didn't bury her.

Nice to meet you.

1039
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:34,476
Why is it always the losers that get
caught up in the pyramid schemes?

1040
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:37,946
Why can't it be some charming, hot girl
nagging you incessantly to buy some shit?

1041
01:10:38,049 --> 01:10:41,485
- Is that what he's doin'?
- Yeah. It's detergent or some shit.

1042
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:44,646
Why are you buying knives?
I don't need knives.

1043
01:10:44,756 --> 01:10:47,623
- I'd like to return these.
- You got a receipt?

1044
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:51,821
- Actually, no. They're a gift.
- Why are you returning these?

1045
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:55,161
- They're not sharp enough.
- They're not sharp enough?

1046
01:10:55,266 --> 01:10:57,632
No. Not for what
we need them for.

1047
01:10:57,735 --> 01:11:01,671
- They couldn't cut cans.
- You bought them to cut cans?

1048
01:11:01,773 --> 01:11:05,106
No, but in the commercial,
it said if I wanted to cut cans, I could.

1049
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,145
- With these knives, I can't.
- It comes with a sharpener.

- Did you try it?
- Yeah. They're just... [Sighs]

1053
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:23,692

return policy is that they permit returns...

without receipts
on items below $40.

1055
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:28,856

01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:32,698

and then I wait until they hire new ones.

01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:35,068
Luckily, nobody stays at
Handi-World for very long.

told us what we're doin'.

- Yes, you are! All right?
That's what I like about you.

1110
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,220
I don't want this guy taking you to,
like, some sketchy quarry...

1111
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:14,291
in the middle of nowhere to find, like,
crack whores huffing turpentine...

- He likes me.
- Don't be cute.

this was here.

1125
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:01,462
[Mark] I've heard about it. They were
supposed to build a mall here, I think.

1126
01:16:01,572 --> 01:16:05,099
[Sam] Yeah. I remember reading about that
in the paper, that they were...

1127
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:08,042
digging or something, and they break
into this natural phenomenon.

1128
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,512
It's like an underground
Grand Canyon or something.

1129
01:16:10,615 --> 01:16:14,016
Now they're in some huge legal battle
over whether they can build here or not.

1130
01:16:14,118 --> 01:16:18,111
Can you imagine the guy whose job it is
to fight for his right to build a mall...

1131
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:20,486
- on some, like, geological phenomenon?
- [Chuckles]

1132
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:23,617
They love their
malls here, man.

1133
01:16:23,728 --> 01:16:26,196
All right. Let's find
this guy and get out of here.

1134
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:29,858
- You're not gonna tell us what we're getting?
- It's a surprise. You'll see.

I don't tease you about being an asshole.

1139
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:54,049
Okay!

1140
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:07,437
- Mark?
- Yeah. Albert?

1141
01:17:08,606 --> 01:17:10,665
Come on in.

1142
01:17:12,009 --> 01:17:14,170
[Thunder Rumbling]

1143
01:17:14,278 --> 01:17:17,873
Oh, man. You guys
must be freezing.

1144
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:21,145
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
I'm just gonna go put her down.

1145
01:17:21,252 --> 01:17:23,311
Okay? I'll be
right back out.

1146
01:17:26,157 --> 01:17:29,149
[Laughing]

1147
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,321
Ah, I must say, I'm continually impressed
with how each place you bring us...

1148
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:36,764
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean? This is nice.

1149
01:17:36,868 --> 01:17:40,702
Oh, nothing. Just hangin' out on an old boat
at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.

1150
01:17:40,805 --> 01:17:42,932
It's hardly
the bottom, dude.

1151
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,008
Did you check out
that cliff down there?

1152
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:48,943
Hey.! This is my wife, Faye.

1153
01:17:49,046 --> 01:17:51,480
Hi.! Welcome.
[Laughs]

1154
01:17:51,582 --> 01:17:54,676
[Albert] Please. Have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1155
01:17:58,055 --> 01:18:00,580
Man, it's really
comin' down out there.

1156
01:18:00,691 --> 01:18:02,716
- It just started pouring all of a sudden.
- Well...

1157
01:18:02,827 --> 01:18:07,161
in a bad storm, I like to pretend that
this old boat's my own private ark.

1158
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:10,325
Um, unfortunately,
if this is the apocalypse...

1159
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:13,494
- I'm not quite sure it still floats.
- Yeah, I don't know.

1160
01:18:13,604 --> 01:18:17,267
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- I'd love some. Thank you.

1161
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:20,310
- [Teapot Whistling]
- Do you want some? I'll be right back.

1162
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:24,579
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?

1163
01:18:24,682 --> 01:18:26,673
Well, we're calling it
Kiernan's Fault. It's, uh...

1164
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:29,776
No one really knows what it is because
we haven't been able to explore it.

1165
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,788
Meanwhile, while they're locked
in litigation, they hired me...

1166
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:36,485
- to make sure no one comes inside.
- Wow.

1167
01:18:36,594 --> 01:18:40,428
But what they don't know is
that at night I climb down.

1168
01:18:40,531 --> 01:18:43,329
So, how deep does it go?
Thank you.

1169
01:18:43,434 --> 01:18:45,959
You know... Thank you.
No one really knows.

1170
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,937
But I like to pretend
it's infinite.

1171
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,702
It's kind of an odd job.

1172
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:55,939
- Guardian of an infinite abyss.
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.

1173
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:58,515
But we also trade and deal
in antique jewelry.

1174
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:03,820
I suppose it is odd that
we live down here like this.

1175
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:06,822
- No.
- Not at all.
- Never crossed my mind.

1176
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:10,291
[Chuckles] Well,
we think it's important.

1177
01:19:10,394 --> 01:19:14,490
Why? What is it that you
think you're gonna find?

1178
01:19:14,598 --> 01:19:17,226
I guess I just like the idea
of discovering something.

1179
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:20,566
Of doing something
that's completely unique...

1180
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:22,662
that's never
been done before.

1181
01:19:22,773 --> 01:19:25,833
- "Albert's Abyss."
- Well, maybe. Who knows?

1182
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:29,379
But, you know what?
That's all ego.

1183
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,246
None of that really matters. If I get to be
with this person right here...

1184
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:36,149
and our beautiful baby...

1185
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:39,189
that's all I need.

1186
01:19:43,794 --> 01:19:47,423
Well, I suppose you want
what you came all the way down here for.

1187
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:49,499
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

1188
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,194
It took me a while
to track this piece down...

1189
01:19:52,303 --> 01:19:54,601
but I owed Diego huge.

1190
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:59,041
That's it.
Thank you so much.

1191
01:19:59,143 --> 01:20:01,771
- Yeah.
- Really.

1192
01:20:01,879 --> 01:20:06,213
Good luck in the rain. Um, do you guys
want some garbage bags or something?

1193
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:10,285
- Yeah.
- Okay. That'd be great.

1210

What is it?

1211
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:16,905
It's my mom's
favorite necklace.

1212
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:20,465
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it was my plan all along.

1213
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:24,139
But... I got it back to you, right?
That's gotta be worth something.

was about this?

1215
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:32,816
You didn't want it
down there with her.

1216
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:35,221
It's better it's with you.

1217
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:36,918
Okay.

1218
01:23:41,098 --> 01:23:44,898
Hey.! If you ever need a Kato,
you know where to find me.

1219
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:02,982
It's funny. This, uh...

1220
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:06,921
This necklace reminds me of this really
random memory of my mother.

1221
01:24:09,326 --> 01:24:13,387
I was a little kid, and I was cryin'
for one reason or another.

1222
01:24:13,497 --> 01:24:15,465
And, uh...

1223
01:24:18,769 --> 01:24:22,364
She was just like, you know, cradling me
and rocking me back and forth.

1224
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:27,001
I can remember seeing the little balls
in this thing just floating back and forth.

1225
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:29,079
And, uh...

1226
01:24:30,981 --> 01:24:34,417
And there was just, like,
snot dripping down my nose, right?

1227
01:24:34,518 --> 01:24:36,986
And, uh...

1228
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:40,250
She gave me her sleeve...

1229
01:24:40,357 --> 01:24:43,190
and she told me
to blow my nose into it.

1230

[Chuckles]

1231
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:52,328
And I remember thinking,
even as a little kid, like...

1232
01:24:52,436 --> 01:24:54,404
"Wow!

1233
01:24:57,941 --> 01:25:00,569
This is love."

1234
01:25:03,547 --> 01:25:05,640
"This is love."

1235
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:10,376
Large?
I think I see one.

1236
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:12,978
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I do. Wait. Wait, wait.

1237
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,422
We should save it
or something.

1238
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:21,688
Okay. Don't move.
Okay.

1239
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:29,166
We could put it in my scrapbook,
if I had a scrapbook.

1240
01:25:29,273 --> 01:25:33,334
- That it?
- I think so. I don't really feel any more coming.

1241
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:38,014
Well, if you do, just let me know.
I'll get the cup, okay?

1242
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:41,749
This was such a good idea.

1243
01:25:41,852 --> 01:25:44,286
- Who are you?
- I'm your new friend Sam.

Fuck, this hurts so much.

01:26:05,876 --> 01:26:07,810
Yeah, I know.

1249
01:26:08,912 --> 01:26:10,880
But that is life.

1250
01:26:12,449 --> 01:26:15,213
If nothing else,
that's life, you know.

1251
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:19,722
It's real.
Sometimes it fuckin' hurts.

1252
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,492

angry about.

for everyone to be happy again.

but when was that?

that we were all so happy?

1282
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:36,619
You know, you and I need
to work on being okay...

in the cards for us.

I was a little boy, and
somebody made a shitty latch.

That's what I think. That's what
I think about the whole thing, okay?

And I'm not gonna take those drugs anymore.
They left me completely fuckin' numb.

I have felt so fucking numb to everything
I have experienced in my life, okay?

And for that...

For that, I'm here
to forgive you.

You always said all you wanted was for us
to have whatever it is we wanted.

Maybe what Mom wanted more than
anything was for it to all be over.

what I want more than anything in the world
is for it to be okay with you...

something again.

01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,691
Well, you're going against
your doctor's recommendation.

1302
01:29:43,794 --> 01:29:46,592
That's a pretty weighty experiment
to take on, don't you think?

1303
01:29:49,066 --> 01:29:51,864
[Sighs]

1304
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:54,802
This is my life, Dad.

1305
01:29:54,905 --> 01:29:56,896
This is it.

1306
01:29:57,007 --> 01:29:59,168
I spent 26 years waiting for
something else to start.

1307
01:29:59,276 --> 01:30:01,642
So, no, no, I don't think
it's too much to take on...

1308
01:30:01,745 --> 01:30:03,645
because it's
everything there is.

1309
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:06,807
I see now
it's all there is.

1310
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:13,789
You and I are going to be okay.
You know that, right?

1311
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:23,927
We may not be as happy as you always
dreamed we would be, but...

1312
01:30:28,372 --> 01:30:33,105
for the first time, let's just allow ourselves
to be whatever it is we are.

1313
01:30:35,946 --> 01:30:37,914
And that'll be better, okay?

1314
01:30:42,219 --> 01:30:44,915
I think that'll be better.

[Sam] What are you
thinking about?

1317
01:31:08,078 --> 01:31:10,569
- You're not coming back, are you?
- Come on, Sam.

1318
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:12,672
- Of course I am.
- No, you're not.

1319
01:31:12,783 --> 01:31:16,583
You don't realize this is good.
This doesn't happen often.

1320

In your life, you know?
I mean, this...

1321
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:22,254
We can work
this stuff out.

1322
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:25,021
I want to help you,
you know?

1323
01:31:25,128 --> 01:31:28,325
We need each other.
I haven't even lied in, like, two days.

1324
01:31:29,499 --> 01:31:31,763
Is that true?

1325
01:31:31,868 --> 01:31:34,598
- No.

This isn't a conversation
about this being over.

It's... It's...

1329
01:31:43,914 --> 01:31:46,382
I'm not puttin' a period
at the end of this, you know?

1330
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:49,680
I'm puttin', like,
an ellipsis on it.

1331
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:52,277
Because I'm-I'm worried
that if I don't go figure myself out...

1332
01:31:52,389 --> 01:31:54,653
if I don't go, like,
land on my own two feet...

1333
01:31:54,758 --> 01:31:58,125
then I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up,
and this is too important.

1334
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,793
I gotta go. l...

1335
01:32:05,902 --> 01:32:08,894
Gotta go.

1336
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:11,872
I fired my psychiatrist.
I gotta go find a new one.

1337
01:32:14,578 --> 01:32:16,773
Look, I'm gonna call you
when I get there.

1338

I'm gonna call you.

01:32:31,027 --> 01:32:32,995
Look at me.

1341
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,665
You changed my life.

1342
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:51,948
You changed my life,
and I've known you four days.

1343

This is the beginning
of something really big.

01:34:42,626 --> 01:34:46,892
- What are you doing?
- Remember that idea I had about
working stuff out on my own...

1354
01:34:46,997 --> 01:34:49,795
- and then finding you once I figured stuff out?
- The ellipsis?

1355
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,562
Yeah. The ellipsis. It's dumb.
It's dumb. It's an awful idea.
