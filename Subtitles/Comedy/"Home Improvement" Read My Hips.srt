1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,470
Thank you very much
and welcome to Tool Time.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,371
l'm your host, of course,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor,

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:14,641
and you all know my assistant
Al "l can't find a better job" Borland.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:20,947
Anyway, all this week Al and l
will be doin' our salute to safety,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,821
'cause, after all, Al, a safe workplace
is a happy workplace. Right?

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,882
l wouldn't know, Tim.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:34,323
And who better to help us
with our salute to safety week,

8
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,266
than the boys
at K&B Construction Company?

9
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,770
Let's get 'em out here with a big round
of applause from the Tool Time crowd.

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,534
Come on, get 'em out here.

11
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,815
- Welcome aboard, guys.
- Always great to be here, Timmy.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,479
The reason l asked these guys down here
is a darn good one.

13
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,784
The guys probably have
the toughest job in construction

14
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,324
in the state of Michigan -
workin' on the high steel.

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,226
And these guys have a perfect
safety record for the last 195 days.

16
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,161
195.

17
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,789
- Think about that--
- Timmy.

18
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,357
l'm afraid that record stopped at 194.

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,597
Good night, nurse. What happened?

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,540
Well, yesterday, somebody
had a little accident with a rivet.

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,739
Well, you see, Tim, l was so excited
about coming back on your show,

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,215
l let one of those red-hot rivets slip.

23
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,275
Yes, you did.

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:33,759
Hey, look on the bright side.
You didn't burn any hair.

25
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,285
Tim, rivet accidents
are no laughing matter.

26
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,957
And neither are you, Al.

27
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,501
Hey, before we get
to our safety demonstration,

28
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,005
l'd like to get to a letter
on a very controversial subject.

29
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,974
By a Charles Eddington,
from Grosse Pointe, Michigan.

30
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,806
He writes, "Dear Tim."

31
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,041
"You've taken this masculinism bit too far.

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,814
"All you do is use loud tools,
act macho and grunt like an ape.

33
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,446
Your show makes me sick and so do you."

34
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,757
He continues,

35
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,700
"l'd like to see a lot less of that Al guy.
l hate Al."

36
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,535
- Can l see that, Tim?
- We don't have time for that, Al.

37
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,133
You know...

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,203
Maybe Chas is right. Maybe we should
stop this gruntin'. What do you think?

39
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,306
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

40
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,941
Folks, what do you think?
Stop the gruntin'?

41
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,849
No.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,820
Well, Chucky, l tried.

43
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,327
l think it's time to give this letter
back to the complaint department.

44
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,487
Lisa.

45
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,201
- Here you go, Tim. All loaded.
- Thanks, Lisa.

46
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,260
Chucky, this...

47
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,573
is the complaint department.

48
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,470
Al.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,542
Wanna hold that letter up for me?

50
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,584
l don't think so, Tim.

51
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:14,284
l'd like to respond by saying,
"Charlie, thanks for sharing your feelings."

52
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,426
Please feel free to write anytime.

53
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,627
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids in the middle?

54
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,671
Mom, why are you
dropping flowers on the table?

55
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,476
They're petals, see? lt's romantic.

56
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,743
l'm gonna give your father
this surprise dinner tonight

57
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,877
and l want everything to be perfect for him.

58
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,515
Then why aren't you eating
in front of the TV?

59
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,926
Why don't you go get your suitcase?
Randy, come on, move it.

60
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,396
Not yet.
l think Brad and Jennifer are gonna kiss.

61
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,365
What?

62
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,666
Well, they've been looking
at each other like that for an hour.

63
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,263
l have never seen him
stare at anything that long.

64
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,175
Maybe l should just glue
his history book to her face.

65
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,509
They're coming.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,346
- Bye, Mrs. Taylor.
- Jennifer. l didn't know you were still here.

67
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,442
Bye.

68
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,420
- Will l see you tomorrow?
- Yeah, l'll be playing football at the park.

69
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,513
- Maybe l'll come by.
- That'd be great.

70
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,023
- Bye.
- Bye.

71
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,289
Well, Jennifer punched you.

72
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,660
Kathy Kramer said
when a girl punches a boy,

73
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,064
she wants to get a hot kiss on the lips.

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,203
That is not what it means.

75
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,435
Well, Kathy Kramer should know, Mom.
She went to school in France.

76
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,000
You stay away from her.

77
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,350
And Brad, you are way too young
to be thinking about kissing.

78
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,715
There's other things
that you need to think about first.

79
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,311
Like... shaving.

80
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,118
l've shaved.

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,682
Not a cat, stupid.

82
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,489
We'll go pack.

83
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,705
You're representing Tool Time here.

84
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,076
You do better when you don't concentrate.
Just don't concentrate.

85
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,878
- That's it.
- Time.

86
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,621
All right, let's see. Rock, you've got...

87
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,056
1 4 peanuts in your hat.

88
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,889
Tim...

89
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,394
- you've got 1 5.
- Yes!

90
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,623
No! Count 'em again!

91
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:44,466
Still champion. Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
The crowd goes wild. Yeah. Yeah.

92
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,701
lt's gettin' late, guys.
l'm gonna call my wife real quick.

93
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:52,302
No, wait, Tim. Am l hearing this right?
You have to check in with the little woman?

94
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,609
Those pants come
in a man's size, Timmy?

95
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,209
Hey, back off, fellas. l'm showing a little
consideration. You got a problem with this?

96
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,628
- Hello.
- Hey, butthead.

97
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,495
Excuse me?

98
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,534
Honey. you're not a butthead. of course.
I got hit with a peanut.

99
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,966
Tim, where are you?

100
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,833
l'm down at Big Mike's
with the guys from K&B.

101
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,999
Well, l thought you said this morning
that you were coming right home.

102
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,907
I know I said that. But we had a great
show so we stopped by for a few beers.

103
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,639
- Is that all right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,908
That sounds like fun.

105
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,478
But l want you to know that
l'm really looking forward to seeing you.

106
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,547
Same here, you know. l'll be home
real soon. 15 minutes tops. l'm on my...

107
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,184
on my way out the door right now.
Set your timer.

108
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,754
OK. l'm just gonna be
listening to a little...

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,332
- Billie Holiday.
- Yeah, l'm comin' right home.

110
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,031
- l'll be waiting.
- OK. bye-bye.

111
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,595
Bye-bye.

112
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,641
- Hey, guys, l think l gotta get outta here.
- No. You just got here.

113
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,339
You can't leave.
Your peanut crown's on the line.

114
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,575
You've been challenged
in the Peanut Plunge.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,141
- By who? l beat everybody.
- Except me.

116
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,881
Oh.

117
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,184
- One more.
- Set it up. Set it up.

118
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,299
Two hours. Unbelievable.

119
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,359
"Set the timer."

120
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,535
Hello.

121
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,805
lt's me.

122
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,649
Hey, Jill.
What are you doin' sittin' here in the--

123
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,380
Uh-oh.

124
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,421
Hey, looks like
you planned something special.

125
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,394
- Yeah.
- You put together a little dinner for--

126
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,590
Uh-huh.

127
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,429
Hey, where are the kids?

128
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,969
Your mother came and picked 'em up.

129
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,528
No kids. Oh, no.

130
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,905
Yeah, so we could have a nice
romantic evening alone together,

131
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,436
just me and that chicken on your plate.

132
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,847
So you must have had to
carry the conversation.

133
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,017
l just wanna know what happened to
"15 minutes. Set the timer."

134
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,724
Honey, l'm really sorry, but the guys and l
got in some real serious discussions

135
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,494
about...

136
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,793
relationship things,
you know, men-women stuff.

137
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,863
Sharing feelings.

138
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,432
Pretty heavy stuff.

139
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,110
l spent two days planning this evening.

140
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,884
Do you have any idea how long it's been

141
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,353
since we had a quiet,
romantic evening together?

142
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,253
l was on the phone.
Why didn't you say, "Come home"?

143
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,725
- l wanted to surprise you.
- Well, l'm surprised.

144
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,054
Come on, Jill. Lighten up. l didn't
understand what you meant on the phone.

145
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,361
Well, what did you think l meant
when l said all that stuff

146
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,030
about how l was looking forward
to seeing you and "l'll be waiting"?

147
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,700
Like you said it like
that - "l'll be waiting."

148
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,142
Well, l wanted to be more subtle.
What did you want me to say?

149
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:18,616
"The kids are gone, l'm home alone.
Come and take me, big daddy."

150
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,053
That l understand.

151
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,857
- Good night.
- Come on, Jill.

152
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,589
l don't go out with these guys every night.
What's making you so angry?

153
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,028
l am angry because you said

154
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,293
you were going to be home in 15 minutes
and then you weren't.

155
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,598
Because l'm flirting with you like crazy
on the phone and you didn't even notice.

156
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,071
And most of all, because
l went to all this trouble for nothing.

157
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,509
l spent the whole evening by myself, and
now you're stuck with a plate of cold food.

158
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,172
Don't worry about me,
l ate at the bar.

159
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,775
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
l didn't have dessert.

160
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,515
When a girl punches you...

161
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,289
do you think she wants to kiss you?

162
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,265
lf it's an uppercut, no.

163
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,996
lf it's a short jab
to the shoulder, maybe.

164
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,334
That's what l thought.

165
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,636
Has Jennifer been
giving you jabs or uppercuts?

166
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,739
Jabs.

167
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,807
- Does that worry you?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,876
Me too.

169
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,487
But when you and Mom kiss,
do you ever bump noses?

170
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,050
Are you kiddin'?
We got the tilt thing down.

171
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,221
When you kiss a woman,
you gotta lean to one side,

172
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,528
she's gotta go the other side,
so you don't mash noses.

173
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,659
Unless you could find a woman
whose nose is big enough

174
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,931
you could fit right into it.

175
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,875
- Listen...
- Dad...

176
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,637
Don't rush into this kissing thing, OK?

177
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,273
That's what Mom said.
She said l'm too young.

178
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:00,751
She's right. She's really smart.
We didn't start kissing till last week.

179
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,880
- Hey, doof, wanna go play some football?
- Don't punch me.

180
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,947
He punched you, gotta kiss him. Come on.

181
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,016
No way.

182
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,758
Hey, hey. Leave those eggs alone, please.
That's my breakfast.

183
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,095
Where's Mom?
And how come you're eating alone?

184
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,294
- No reason.
- You and Mom have a fight?

185
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,667
No, we did not have a fight.

186
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,336
- So what did you do wrong, Dad?
- l didn't do anything wrong.

187
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,843
Remember that, little mister.
Now go out and play or do something.

188
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:31,645
OK, OK. Just because he has a fight
with Mom, he has to take it out on me.

189
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,752
Tim, about last night...

190
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,258
Did you make me breakfast?

191
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,124
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:58,267
- This is really sweet.
- Well, you're worth it, honey.

193
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,370
l was just...
l got up this morning and l was thinking:

194
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,109
"What could l do for Jill?"

195
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,854
And it just came to me - eggs.

196
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,621
- Thank you. They're delicious.
- Mm.

197
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,421
- Tim, l feel really bad about last night--
- Hey, Dad.

198
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,430
- Don't interrupt.
- How come Mom gets to eat your eggs?

199
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,331
There's no name on these.

200
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,835
- Kids.
- Great.

201
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,562
- Your eggs.
- What's mine is yours, honey.

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,235
No, Tim. What's yours is yours.
You see, that's the difference between us.

203
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,440
l would have made you breakfast
because l'm always focused on you.

204
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,379
Are you saying l don't
do anything romantic for you?

205
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:42,512
That's not what l'm saying. ln fact,
that whole thing last night was your idea.

206
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,113
- That was my idea?
- Yeah. You know the other night,

207
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,955
when we were watching that
Charles Boyer movie on the late show,

208
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,121
and there was that real
romantic candlelight dinner scene

209
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,721
between lngrid Bergman
and Charles Boyer?

210
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,598
You said,
"Wouldn't it be nice if we did that?"

211
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,160
l meant talk with accents.

212
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,412
Why don't you just ever tune in to me?

213
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,278
What am l supposed to do?
Read your mind?

214
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,376
At least when l want something,
it's pretty clear what it is l want.

215
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,354
Well, that's true, Tim.
Your signals are real clear.

216
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:22,986
You crush a beer can on your head,
that means, "l need another one."

217
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,825
You belch...

218
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,489
...that's, "l'm done."

219
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,595
And, "Honey, l took a shower,"

220
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,969
that's, "Wake up, l'm ready."

221
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,710
Safety on the job site
is a priority.

222
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,304
That's why proper equipment
is essential.

223
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,907
Custom-designed hard hat.

224
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:54,858
And proper safety goggles to protect
your eyes from unexpected objects.

225
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,026
Anyway, these goggles
are specially coated to reduce glare

226
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,126
and prevent scratching.

227
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,540
And they're vented
for your added comfort.

228
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,940
And so is Al.

229
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,872
Anyway, the important thing here
is safety on the job site.

230
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,387
And safety starts
at a little spot right here.

231
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,788
You must have direct and clear
communication between your coworkers.

232
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,850
Look out!

233
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,457
See? See?

234
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,260
Had this been a real emergency,
Al would be safe

235
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,133
because l gave him
a clear and direct signal.

236
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,467
And as Al's coworker,
l'm concerned with his safety.

237
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,201
Just as Al is concerned with mine.
Right, Al?

238
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,470
What's your point, Tim?

239
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,308
Good direct question.

240
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,342
My point is, l don't think women
are as clear with their signals as men.

241
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,716
l know they're not.
On a job site, for instance,

242
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,746
if a man holds up a stop sign,
he means, "Hey, stop there!"

243
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,624
lf a woman holds up the stop sign...
lf she designed this, it'd say:

244
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:07,962
"lf you really knew me,
you'd know what you should do right now."

245
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,162
Come on, come on.
Hurry up. They're coming.

246
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,404
Boy, Billy really hit you hard
on that touchdown.

247
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,811
Yeah. No big deal.

248
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,872
ls your arm OK?

249
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,716
Just tore off a hunk of skin.
lt doesn't hurt.

250
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:33,656
l fell off of my bike once and cut my knee.
lt was all green and full of pus.

251
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,717
Ew! Cool.

252
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,320
- You wanna see the scar?
- Sure.

253
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,829
Jill? Hey, Jill.

254
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,267
l... Sorry,
l didn't mean to interrupt anything.

255
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,711
Excuse me a minute, Jennifer.
Brad, where's your mom?

256
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,342
- l don't know.
- She went to the store.

257
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,715
Come on down from there,
you little monkeys. Come out here.

258
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,624
- You guys are dead.
- Get out of that tree.

259
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,060
- Come on, Jennifer. l'll walk you home.
- OK.

260
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,564
- Bye, Mr. Taylor.
- Bye, Jennifer.

261
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,658
What do you think you're doin' up there?

262
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,896
Hope you're satisfied.
You embarrassed your brother on his date.

263
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,303
Yeah, that was the plan.

264
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,706
Bad plan. Go embarrass somebody else.

265
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,836
lt had to be you

266
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,574
lt had to be you

267
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,742
l wandered around, finally found

268
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,048
Somebody who

269
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,546
Hi-ho, tone-deaf neighbor.

270
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,055
Hey, Wilson.
What are you doing with that feather?

271
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:47,292
Tim, l'm practicing
an ancient Japanese technique.

272
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,357
Sumo tickling.

273
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,102
No, no, Tim. l'm cross-pollinating irises.

274
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,505
You take a feather
and move the pollen from the stamen...

275
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,941
lt had to be you

276
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,739
...to the pistil.

277
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,803
lt had to be you

278
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,748
- Why do you sing?
- Gets 'em in the mood, Tim.

279
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,013
Here's to l'amour.

280
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,548
There won't be any l'amour
at this house tonight.

281
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,648
Tim, l think l hear a problem.

282
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,159
lf you got a minute, Wilson, listen.

283
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,289
Jill says she's sending out signals
that l'm not picking up.

284
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,597
l say the signals are so subtle
no man could pick 'em up.

285
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,970
Well, Tim, l think men are capable
of grasping very subtle ideas.

286
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,807
- What are you saying?
- Well, maybe not all men.

287
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,811
Tim, you're putting a bored-out small-block
350 engine into your hot rod, right?

288
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,116
You bet l am. 400 crank, 30 to a 383.

289
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,917
That's a very complex piece of machinery.

290
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,926
400 ponies. Holley double pumper.
Yeah, you betcha.

291
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,657
2200 rpm stall-converter.
Purrs like a kitten. Maybe a big cat.

292
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,730
lf something went wrong with that engine,
you'd be able to hear it?

293
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,394
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

294
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,961
King-king-bing-ding-ding-ding.

295
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,373
Metal-to-metal noises - valve train.
Maybe camshaft, lower end. Bad news.

296
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,845
Arcing sounds, always electrics, just dead.
You can pick up on that stuff.

297
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,405
That's very, very subtle.
Must be hard to pick up on that?

298
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,249
Not if you're tuned in,
really paying attention.

299
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,585
lt had to be you

300
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,455
lt seems like it's always me. Yeah.

301
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,260
Hi, ma'am. Telephone repairman
here to fix the phone.

302
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,134
- Tim, what are you doing?
- The name's Fred, ma'am.

303
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,299
- Fred?
- Yeah, Fred.

304
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,071
Got a report
of some crossed signals at this house.

305
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,009
That the faulty unit over here?

306
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,708
Yeah, Fred. l've been having some trouble
getting through to my husband.

307
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,013
l can fix that, ma'am.

308
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,576
Are you here by yourself?

309
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,927
Must be hard on a woman
as fine-looking as you, big house like this,

310
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,991
get a little lonely, huh?

311
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,867
Do you like gladiator movies?

312
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,435
Tim, l don't think you should do that.

313
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,480
lt's not Tim, it's Fred.

314
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,847
There's your problem.
The receiver's just not pickin' up signals.

315
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,011
Well, maybe it's my fault.

316
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,521
Maybe...

317
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,616
sometimes l don't speak clearly enough.

318
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,026
No, it's not your fault.
Your signals are quite clear.

319
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,863
There's your problem right there, ma'am.

320
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:39,063
The attentive wire is faulty.
Let's tighten it up, make it...

321
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,605
- Tim, no, no, no, no, no.
- Fred.

322
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,074
- Fred.
- Just needs a little tweakin'.

323
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:53,111
Well, Fred. While you're tweakin',
maybe l should get us a glass of wine.

324
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,377
Do you usually talk to repairmen like this?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,221
No, it's just something
about that name, Fred.

326
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,961
Well, there she is.

327
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,864
Good as new.

328
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,201
Does this mean that my husband
will pick up on all my signals now?

329
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,036
Loud and clear, babe.

330
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,336
Well.

331
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,776
Do you think that he'll
pick up on this one?

332
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,907
Rotator cuff problem?

333
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,791
How about this one?

334
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,763
You want me to steal second?

335
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,133
- Maybe l'm being too subtle.
- Look out, lady.

336
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,238
You don't wanna pay your bill,
do you, lady?

337
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,595
You remember
the first time you kissed me?

338
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,162
lt was outside my dorm after Casablanca.

339
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:21,137
l thought it was after That Darn Cat.
starring Dean Jones.

340
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,107
l often get those films confused.

341
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,770
l remember, l hesitated.

342
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,613
Then you shut your eyes.
Boy, my heart was going crazy, wasn't it?

343
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,019
- Oh, yeah, boom-boom-boom-boom.
- Di-di-di-di-di.

344
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,988
And then we did the tilt thing wrong.

345
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,118
Then we locked.

346
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,054
Mommy and Daddy
sittin' in the tree,

347
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,361
k-i-s-s-i-n-g.

348
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,800
We're in the tree, stupid!

349
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,604
A quality safety hat.

350
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,604
And goggles.

351
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,581
l completely whacked him!

352
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,443
And proper equipment is essential.

353
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,323
A safety hat.

354
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,899
Safety...
