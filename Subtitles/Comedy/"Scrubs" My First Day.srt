1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,167
<i>I've always been able</i>
<i>to sleep through anything.</i>

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>Storms, sirens, you name it.</i>
<i>Last night, I didn't sleep.</i>

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>I guess I get a little goofy</i>
<i>when I'm nervous.</i>

4
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,212
<i>You see, today isn't just any other day.</i>

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,672
<i>It's my first day.</i>

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,135
I'm the man.

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,614
<i>Three years of pre-med</i>
<i>and four years of med school</i>

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>have made me realise one thing...</i>

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,911
Could you drop an NG tube
on the patient in 234

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,924
and then call the attending?

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,918
<i>...I don't know Jack.</i>

12
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,619
<i>So this is my story.</i>

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,450
- I'm supposed to be in intensive care.
- We just turfed him there.

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,324
<i>I became a doctor to help people,</i>
<i>but orientation yesterday</i>

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,134
<i>didn't really focus on patient care.</i>

16
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,158
The hospital doesn't wanna be sued.

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,365
Being sued is not a good thing.

18
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,370
- Hey, Turk?
- What's up?

19
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,771
You know how I'm down
with the rap music?

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,951
Dude, be whiter.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:34,068
<i>Chris Turk's my best friend. We roomed</i>
<i>together in college and med school.</i>

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,733
<i>We even got accepted</i>
<i>by the same hospital.</i>

23
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,487
Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr Dre,

24
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,564
in most of their songs, they use
an extremely volatile racial slur.

25
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,532
- The ''N'' word.
- I got it.

26
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,683
My question is this:
if we're both singing along,

27
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,336
and I would
never use the word otherwise,

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,646
- am I allowed to say...
- No.

29
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,019
That's good for me to know.

30
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,594
Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake,
don't admit it to the patient.

31
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,943
Of course, if the patient is deceased,
and you're sure,

32
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,964
you can feel free to tell
him or her anything.

33
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,783
I found us an apartment.

34
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,846
OK, gang, I'm Dr Bob Kelso,
and I'm your Chief of Medicine,

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,297
so I just want to encourage you all
to think of me as your safety net.

36
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,354
Because I promise you,
we're a family here.

37
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,728
Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,621
The surgical interns
are gonna go grab a beer.

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,342
The medical interns are having
a Pac-Man tournament. We're all twelve.

40
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,101
I love Pac-Man.

41
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:51,277
Me, too. I love watching it,
I love playing it, I love all of it.

42
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,148
- I'm Elliot.
- Ell-i-ot.

43
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,774
Don't do that.

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm JD. This is Turk.

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,294
Are you medical or surgical?

46
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,507
Medical.

47
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,563
<i>Hello.</i>

48
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,924
Every male in my family is a doctor.
That's why Dad gave me a guy's name,

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,544
made me play sports, date girls. Joking.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,247
I know.
I would've laughed if you'd paused.

51
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,000
I know what you're thinking.

52
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,874
<i>Your butt looks like</i>
<i>two Pringles hugging.</i>

53
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,908
- No, you don't.
- I'm Miss ''Hyper-Competitive.''

54
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,828
It used to be a big problem for me.
Used to. Past tense.

55
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,174
Are we racing?

56
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,656
Yes!

57
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,867
<i>I'm not that desperate.</i>

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,330
No!

59
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,552
You do a lot of cardio?

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,099
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,199
Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great.

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,521
One, I am your resident,
Dr Jeffrey Steadman. Not ''Jeff'.

63
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,386
Two, here are your manuals.

64
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,976
<i>Notice how quickly people</i>
<i>make an impression?</i>

65
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,808
I am a tool. I am a tool.
I am a tool, tool, tool.

66
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,520
- An unbelievably annoying tool.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,266
These are your beepers.
From now on, they control your life.

68
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,865
Thanks. Move it.

69
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,527
<i>Back to today.</i>

70
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,610
- I was paged.
- First day, Bambi?

71
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,904
Don't look at me
when we're moving someone.

72
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,333
Why?

73
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,367
- We're waiting for Dr Cox.
- Hi, doctor...

74
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,878
- Place an IV for me.
- We'll talk later.

75
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,701
Carla, do you spray the perfume on
or fill your bathtub up

76
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,461
- and splash around in it?
- I smell nice.

77
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,176
<i>You've done this to cadavers.</i>
<i>He's alive.</i>

78
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>Poke it through his skin. Now!</i>

79
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,807
Time's up.
Carla, will you do it for him?

80
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,877
- Why tell her?
- Shut up and watch.

81
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,276
Be nice to Bambi.

82
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,655
Why's he got to try and die
every day during my lunch?

83
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,002
That's insensitive.

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,579
<i>Mistake.</i>

85
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,521
Man's 92, has dementia,
doesn't know we're here.

86
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,479
He is inches from Carla's rack
and hasn't flinched.

87
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,565
- That is so sweet.
- Yeah, it is.

88
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,685
What about his subconscious?

89
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,097
Eisenhower was a sissy.

90
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,299
I think we're gonna be OK.

91
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,326
From now on,
whenever I'm in the room,

92
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,846
you're definitely not allowed to talk.

93
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,421
Dr Dorian, can you tell me
what ailment most often...

94
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,470
<i>Rounds is like being on a game show.</i>

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,997
What is uraemia?

96
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:48,367
That's my boy. Nice clean job
on the Foley catheter.

97
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,118
<i>I had a nurse do it.</i>
<i>I'm still afraid to touch anybody.</i>

98
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,773
<i>I've been thinking a lot about Elliot.</i>
<i>A whole lot.</i>

99
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,211
Dr Reid, you're late.

100
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,153
I got puked on.

101
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,597
You're off the hook if you can tell me
what to look for in a uraemic patient.

102
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,503
<i>Anyway, I'm going for it.</i>

103
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,695
- Infection.
- Infection?

104
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,587
That's my girl.

105
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,430
Moving on.

106
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,459
- I knew the answer.
- I'm sure you did.

107
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,220
- I'm just frazzled.
- How could you not be?

108
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,616
If there's anything
I can do for you...

109
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,313
You could let me take you to dinner
tomorrow night.

110
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,543
Around seven?

111
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,995
Or eight?

112
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,016
Why not?

113
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,456
Nice!

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,433
<i>''Why not?'' That's what she said.</i>

115
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,397
<i>''Why not?''</i>

116
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,634
<i>Daddy, why did you marry Mommy?</i>

117
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,376
<i>Tiger, I gave her</i>
<i>an answer during rounds</i>

118
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,241
<i>and she screwed my brains out.</i>

119
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,210
<i>You're the man.</i>

120
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,882
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

121
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,757
Did you actually just page me

122
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,960
to find out how much Tylenol
to give to Mrs Lenzer?

123
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,247
I was worried
it could exacerbate...

124
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,183
It's regular-strength Tylenol.
Here's what you do.

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,550
Open her mouth,
take a handful and throw it at her.

126
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,364
Whatever sticks,
that's the correct dosage.

127
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,523
Under no circumstances are you to
compromise our no-talking agreement.

128
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,132
Dr Kelso is always saying...

129
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,313
I'm gonna say this
as carefully as possible,

130
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,045
so I don't overstate it.

131
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,955
Dr Kelso is the most evil
human being on the planet

132
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,595
and may in fact be Satan himself.

133
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,427
It's just that this isn't
what I expected.

134
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,778
Most of my patients are...

135
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,413
older and sorta
checked-out, mentally.

136
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,670
Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.

137
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,644
Advances that keep people alive
who should've died a long time ago.

138
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,325
Back when they lost
what made them people.

139
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,754
Your job is to stay sane enough so when
someone does come in that you can help,

140
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,381
you're not so braindead
you can't function.

141
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,642
For the love of God, what?

142
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,777
Should we be talking
about this in front of...

143
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,984
Her? She's dead.

144
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,722
Write this down.
If you push around a stiff,

145
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,873
nobody'll ask you to do anything.

146
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,882
You've been like a father to me.

147
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,560
If they find out
nurses are doing your procedures,

148
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,632
you'll be kicked out so quick,
your head'll spin.

149
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,072
<i>And there it is.</i>

150
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,017
Have a terrific day.

151
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,796
I'm not really dead.

152
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,413
Bambi, here's Mrs Lenzer's tox screen.

153
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,040
<i>Is Turk having</i>
<i>the same experience I am?</i>

154
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,464
- I am such a stud.
- <i>Probably not.</i>

155
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,372
I had my hands
inside of a guy's chest.

156
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,646
I couldn't even see them. I should not
be allowed to do stuff like that.

157
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,669
Wassup?

158
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,138
- You weren't scared?
- One way or another,

159
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,811
everyone stops bleeding.

160
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,153
- That is so deep.
- No, it isn't.

161
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,530
It's a little deep.

162
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,104
- About the apartment...
- T-Man!

163
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,480
Word up, boy, how you doing?

164
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,114
- All right.
- Todd, JD.

165
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,822
- JD, this is my man Todd.
- What's goin'...

166
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,621
<i>I was back in high school.</i>

167
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>Surgical interns are all</i>
<i>slice 'em and dice 'em.</i>

168
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,445
<i>Medical interns are trained</i>
<i>to think about the body.</i>

169
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,685
<i>Diagnose, test.</i>
<i>Medical interns...</i>

170
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,657
You got a stain.

171
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,508
<i>...we're the chess club.</i>

172
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,532
I just have bad gas.
What are you testing me for?

173
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,542
To see if your gas
could be harmful to others.

174
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,645
<i>He's just scared. Talk to him.</i>

175
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,831
Look, Mr Burski, I heard
a systolic murmur in your heart,

176
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,324
which is most likely nothing,
but if I don't check you out,

177
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,864
- I'll worry about you all day.
- Then I'll do it. For you.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,692
You're a good man.

179
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,286
I'm waiting for someone.

180
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,479
The door is broke. Probably
the fifth time or so it don't open.

181
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,458
Maybe a penny's stuck in there.

182
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,733
- Why a penny?
- I don't know.

183
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,601
- Did you stick a penny in there?
- No, I was making small talk.

184
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,791
If I find a penny in there,
I'm taking you down.

185
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,043
Welcome to rounds, kids.

186
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,126
<i>Elliot is the only thing</i>
<i>keeping me from losing my mind.</i>

187
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,014
<i>She is my dream girl.</i>

188
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,853
The necrosis and infected stool
most likely indicate what, Dr Dorian?

189
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,299
I don't know.

190
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,199
Sir, I have no idea.

191
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,314
Dr Reid, can you help him out?

192
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,919
Superior mesenteric insufficiency.

193
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,438
That's my girl.
Patient number two.

194
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,757
''Superior mesenteric...''

195
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,922
<i>Draining stomach fluid</i>
<i>will get my spirits up.</i>

196
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,008
- Circles for you.
- Shut up and do it.

197
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,892
<i>Fantastic. Now just suck out the fluid</i>
<i>with the giant needle.</i>

198
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,171
Needle's too big.
I'm gonna get a nurse.

199
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,658
Come on, man. Learn by doing.

200
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,122
<i>Why couldn't I do that?</i>
<i>I hated him at that moment.</i>

201
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,244
OK, maybe the needle
was a little too big.

202
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,640
- You think?
- What's going on?

203
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,938
Nothing. This is totally normal.

204
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,396
So are you gonna
move your stuff in?

205
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,207
That's why I came by. I think it's
better if we both branched out.

206
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,176
<i>Tell him that's stupid.</i>
<i>Tell him you need him.</i>

207
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,971
I feel the same way.

208
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,222
What's it like
being a young hotshot doctor?

209
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,627
Did you ever go see a movie
everyone told you was great

210
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,479
and because of all the expectations,
you were disappointed?

211
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,562
Movies nowadays
have too many special effects.

212
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,526
That was my point.

213
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,118
<i>My first code. Someone's heart fails,</i>
<i>they beep everyone.</i>

214
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,673
<i>The first doctor in</i>
<i>has to run the room,</i>

215
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,141
<i>decides if a patient lives or dies.</i>

216
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,318
<i>What, am I crazy?</i>

217
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,864
You chicken.

218
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,193
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>Turk was there, ''learning by doing''.</i>

219
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,093
- Charged.
- Clear.

220
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,792
<i>The guy was just sleeping,</i>
<i>attached to a faulty monitor.</i>

221
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,843
I thought we cared for each other.

222
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,164
You just wanna sleep with me.

223
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,466
I don't wanna sleep with you now.

224
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,246
Do me right here.

225
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,793
See?

226
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,066
Right. Pass me a trach kit.

227
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,676
Thanks.

228
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,312
Our date is totally cancelled.

229
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,513
<i>I was sitting on the floor</i>
<i>for two reasons.</i>

230
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,749
<i>One, I tried to lock Elliot in that</i>
<i>supply closet and she kicked me. Hard.</i>

231
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,281
<i>And two, the on-call room was locked.</i>

232
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,940
Come on,
I got ten minutes to sleep.

233
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:25,877
Wait.

234
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,084
Tell me if I'm going too fast, OK?

235
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,415
Lose the clothes.

236
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,216
<i>I heard Turk</i>
<i>was gonna move in with Todd.</i>

237
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,310
<i>I'm surprised that freak</i>
<i>isn't in there with him.</i>

238
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,084
Damn, this is hot.

239
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,049
Nice.

240
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,517
Your turn.

241
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,091
No, I gotta get back,
but very nice.

242
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,236
Hey, Bambi.

243
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,425
I'll call you, OK?

244
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,218
Give me a big ''ahh''.

245
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,334
A big-boy ''ahh''.

246
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,621
Turk almost had sex
in the on-call room.

247
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,871
You realise, of course,
I have no idea who Turk is,

248
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,244
but good for him.

249
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,900
You see, Billy, it turns out
that sex is life-affirming.

250
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,698
What do you say?
Got a urine sample for me?

251
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,613
I just did five minutes ago.

252
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,569
But here's the thing.

253
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:22,362
Take this, put it on the ground, close
your eyes and go nuts. What do you say?

254
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,929
- Cool!
- Attaboy. Go get 'em.

255
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,792
- Why are you here?
- Seems like a good kid.

256
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,508
You're worried
about being on call tonight.

257
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,024
<i>Yeah.</i>

258
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,820
Look, worst-case scenario,

259
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,476
you kill somebody,

260
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,983
and it's with you
the rest of your life.

261
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,005
But that is the absolute
worst-case scenario.

262
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,368
Just have the nurses do the stuff
you're too chicken to do,

263
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,110
which is everything, and if you
have a really rough admission...

264
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,418
Call you?

265
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,629
No! Hide in the closet again.

266
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,461
This is fun.

267
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,561
- Nurse?
- I'm a doctor.

268
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,611
The stethoscope, the beeper,
a doctor, got it?

269
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,934
Relax.

270
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,459
I hate the ''darlings'',
the ''sweethearts''.

271
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,728
No need to tell me how hard it is
being a woman here.

272
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,864
You're helping by wearing a thong
and hooking up in the on-call room.

273
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,030
Word gets around.

274
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,522
You talk like that,
do you even know my name?

275
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,420
I spend every second of my life
either here or taking care of my mom,

276
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,392
so, yeah,
maybe I needed a little closeness.

277
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,868
You never had a quickie
at the club, right?

278
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,410
Or snuck some skinny college boy
up to your sorority room.

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,552
And my thong?
I think it makes my ass look good.

280
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,408
And some days, I need
to feel good about something.

281
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,960
And you judge me?
Well, guess what?

282
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,743
Word does get around,
Ms Out-For-Herself.

283
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,459
So you can dump on everyone here
if you want, but you will not hurt me.

284
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,789
Her name's Carla, by the way.

285
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,151
Hey, champ.
First night on call starts soon, huh?

286
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,867
You must be excited.

287
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,582
You betcha.

288
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,200
About Mrs Pratt.

289
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:28,151
I heard you wanted to put her
on the hospital's transplant list.

290
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,715
I'd recommend
keeping her on dialysis a little longer.

291
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,259
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- No problem, sir.

292
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,249
Great. Have a ball.

293
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,051
On call.

294
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,242
Little poem for ya.

295
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,791
Bambi, let's go.

296
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,071
I'll check on you every ten minutes,
Mrs Marino, OK?

297
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,301
I need to see you in Mr Burski's room.

298
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,435
Are you flirting with me?

299
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,157
You are, aren't you?

300
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,952
He crashed. The attending
thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.

301
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,314
No way anyone could've caught it.

302
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,564
- You have to pronounce him.
- Why didn't anybody page me?

303
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,301
Could you just pronounce him
so I can go home?

304
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,641
<i>I'll never forget that moment.</i>

305
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,348
<i>The way he looked exactly the same,</i>

306
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,501
<i>only completely different.</i>

307
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,636
<i>The shame that all I could think about</i>
<i>was how hard this was for me.</i>

308
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,164
Time of death 0200.

309
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,602
<i>I just wanted to help people.</i>

310
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,519
<i>The hardest part is how quickly</i>
<i>you have to move on.</i>

311
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,930
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.

312
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,323
I lied before.
I'm scared every second.

313
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,651
Really?

314
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,980
It's a good thing they make
surgical masks. If they didn't,

315
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,802
everyone would know my face
was like this the whole time.

316
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,923
I think it's OK to be scared.

317
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,202
I need you to tell me that.

318
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,737
<i>He needs me?</i>

319
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,480
I just came to check up on you,
see how you're doing.

320
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,315
<i>Ask him to move in again.</i>

321
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,034
Turk, the offer still stands...

322
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,616
I already took the keys
out your bag.

323
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,450
I love you.

324
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,429
<i>And like that, I got a second wind.</i>

325
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,897
I'm watching you.

326
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,953
- How you holding up?
- <i>There he is. My safety net.</i>

327
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:37,849
I saw that you're still pushing to put
Mrs Pratt on the transplant list.

328
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:42,334
Bad news, though. She doesn't
have the insurance to cover it.

329
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,636
But she's a second away
from total renal failure.

330
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,604
OK...

331
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,730
Did you ask the Burski family
for permission to do an autopsy?

332
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,496
They're still with him.

333
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,802
It's a teaching hospital,
you gotta ask.

334
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,147
<i>Tell him you can't see</i>
<i>Mr Burski again, he'll understand.</i>

335
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,086
Sir, do you think I could skip
just this one?

336
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,595
Why, sure, sport.

337
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,940
<i>See? Every story needs a good guy.</i>

338
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:13,001
In fact, why don't you
just head on home?

339
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,165
You look kinda tired.

340
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,490
I am pretty tired.

341
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,952
Dr Dorian, do you not realise

342
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,808
that you're nothing but
a large pair of scrubs to me?

343
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,118
The only reason
I carry this chart around

344
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,700
is so I can pretend to remember
your names.

345
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,889
If the patient has insurance,
you treat them.

346
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,464
If they don't,
you show them the door.

347
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,292
And if somebody dies,
you get the autopsy.

348
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,005
Get it by rounds tomorrow or I'll
scratch your name off my chart. Clear?

349
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,355
Answer me!

350
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,608
Crystal clear.

351
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,269
Great, sport.

352
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,012
<i>If he's the jerk...</i>

353
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,506
<i>...then who's the good guy?</i>

354
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,186
Car accident.
Crashed on the way up.

355
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,855
Relieve the pressure on his chest.
JD, do it.

356
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,284
<i>God, no.</i>

357
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,264
Look at me. You can do this.

358
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,393
- <i>And I believed him.</i>
- Chest tube tray.

359
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,832
<i>You know, kind of.</i>

360
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,972
Come on, baby, let's go.

361
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,108
<i>You can do this.</i>
<i>You have to do this.</i>

362
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,708
JD, cut him or lose him.

363
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,782
Give me the tube.

364
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,083
I can't get through the pleura.

365
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,282
Don't be gentle, get it in there.

366
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,494
Connect it, please, Carla.

367
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,447
- Normal rhythm.
- No way!

368
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,704
It's a piece of cake.
It's your patient.

369
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,963
You're leaving?

370
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,841
That's your patient, doctor.

371
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,873
Good.

372
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,013
- That's enough.
- Sorry.

373
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,182
It's a very big moment for me.

374
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,638
<i>I guess that's it for now.</i>
<i>31 hours, 12 minutes, and I am...</i>

375
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,498
You finally off?

376
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,536
Almost. I have one more
annoying thing I gotta do.

377
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,497
If it's the Burski autopsy,
I called the family

378
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,617
and they said fine,
and to thank you, and I'm sorry.

379
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,028
They didn't say that last part,
I did.

380
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,567
<i>The worst part was knowing</i>
<i>I could never forgive her.</i>

381
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,831
<i>I forgive her.</i>

382
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,125
<i>You see, I can't survive on my own.</i>

383
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,181
I'm a dork. A dork. I'm a dork.

384
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,381
<i>Even now,</i>
<i>when I get to go home,</i>

385
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,356
<i>I'll know the hospital's still here,</i>
<i>wide awake.</i>

386
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,836
Get out while you still can.

387
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,623
<i>But what the hell.</i>

388
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,653
<i>The important thing is</i>
<i>I got through my first three days</i>

389
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,977
<i>without looking</i>
<i>like a complete idiot.</i>

390
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,494
<i>I'm the man.</i>

391
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
