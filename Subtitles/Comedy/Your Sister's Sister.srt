1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,847
- You guys...
how long were you dating?

2
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,576
- About a year.

3
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,810
- And you met in college, right?

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,840
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

5
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,682
It was about
seven years ago.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,813
But I'm more... I'm friends
with Jack, you know.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,451
(people chattering)

8
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,428
- He used to take a frying pan
and just put cheese in it.

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,089
And he'd roll it up.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,156
- Is this true?
- It's absolutely true.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,167
You've said that before.
- It's absolutely true.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,762
- He'd call it... he's like,
"Oh, I made my cheese log."

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,204
- I needed a wheelchair.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,973
So one night, we went
to an emergency room entrance,

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,605
and we stole a wheelchair
and took it out back.

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,137
And he was pushing me
down the hill.

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,410
- Tom did that?

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,546
- Yeah, it was... he knew
that I needed a wheelchair.

19
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,045
- He used to have one of those,
uh, those Sunfishes,

20
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,321
you know, the boats
that have the one...

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,520
- The one sail?
- The one sail.

22
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,153
Yeah, yeah, free version.

23
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,788
He would go out,
and he would be gone

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,128
for, like, six or seven hours.

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,565
And we'd be, like,
really worried,

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,932
because we couldn't see him
from the shore.

27
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,197
- What was that band called?

28
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,467
- It was a band called Bigfoot.

29
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,871
- No, it was...

30
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,466
(all talking at once)

31
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,976
- 'Cause he was
a marine biologist.

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,171
He liked big fish.

33
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,009
- Well, yes, but the thing is,
there was a name

34
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,537
attached to the wheelchair.

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,345
So it was for someone.

36
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,011
- Yeah, we've been friends
for a long time.

37
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,112
- Yeah.

38
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:33,114
- Mark was one of these guys who
would, like, walk into a room.

39
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,093
You know, like we could be
at a party.

40
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,755
You could have the one person
in the room,

41
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,956
playing you, for example.

42
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,589
Like, no one was talking.

43
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,065
(all chattering)

44
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,228
- No, but there's something
to be said for just somebody

45
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,827
who just makes people
feel comfortable.

46
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,860
- He did.
He did.

47
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,897
(people chattering)

48
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,603
- We were just walking down
the street.

49
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,013
(all chattering and laughing)

50
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,211
(glass clinking)

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,241
- Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

52
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,447
- You got it.

53
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,949
- Trying make this, like,
a respectable event.

54
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,759
Uh, I...

55
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,860
uh, it's been a year.

56
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,233
And, uh,

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,033
I thought it was
really important

58
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,769
that we do this for Tom.

59
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,836
It's so hard to eulogize someone
who you look up to, you know,

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,179
'cause Tom was amazing.

61
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,547
He was the best fucking guy.

62
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,176
I mean, he was a better friend
to all of us

63
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,379
than we were to him.

64
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,547
I mean, at least,
that's how I feel.

65
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,886
I just think back.

66
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,255
We were roommates at UW.

67
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,317
And, like, I remember, like,

68
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,592
at one point,
Sara came to visit me.

69
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,863
And he moved all of his stuff
into the common room

70
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,062
to sleep there.

71
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,263
No, and he really...

72
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,635
and I was like,
"It smells bad."

73
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,537
And he was like, "No"...
He was like, "No, no, no.

74
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,804
I'm gonna do it
so you can have sex."

75
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,539
And I was like,
"We're not having sex."

76
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,410
I would... and he was like,

77
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,744
"But I'm optimistic, you know."

78
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,807
And so I...

79
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,944
and he was just so generous,
you know.

80
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,681
He was just...
he was the best.

81
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,189
And I was just thinking today,
I mean,

82
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,125
I saw <i>Hotel Rwanda</i> came on TV.

83
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,290
And he... he and I saw it
together in the theater.

84
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,323
And the day after it came out,

85
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,565
he started donating time at
the shelter in downtown Seattle.

86
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,936
That's what he was like.

87
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,406
You'd sit there
thinking about it,

88
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,533
and he would do it.

89
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,702
And just cheers... you know,

90
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,176
I just want to say "cheers"
to that.

91
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,372
ALL: Cheers.

92
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,675
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

93
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,375
- Cheers.

94
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,145
- Tom and I were big
into movies,

95
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,245
you know, growing up.

96
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,414
Actually, Tom and I, like,

97
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,654
had a seminal
movie experience together

98
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,254
not dissimilar
from <i>Hotel Rwanda,</i>

99
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,355
except it was with
<i>Revenge of the Nerds.</i>

100
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,730
(all chuckle)

101
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,064
And it was fascinating.

102
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,536
It sort of...

103
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,004
it changed him,

104
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,375
um, 'cause Tom
was not like you know him

105
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,641
when he was younger.

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,945
Tom was...

107
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,815
he was the bully,

108
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,912
I found out, like, when I went
to pick him up from school.

109
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,788
And, um, he was
quite emotionally

110
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,224
and physically manipulative.

111
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,820
And when I watched him watching
<i>Revenge of the Nerds,</i>

112
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,489
just something clicked in him,

113
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,157
which was, he was learning
that, like,

114
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,828
the bullies and the assholes
end up last,

115
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,996
and the nerds
and the nice guys win.

116
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,598
And his little brain
started clocking away

117
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,006
and going "Oh, fuck."

118
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,566
"If I'm gonna gain favor
in this world,"

119
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,736
"I'm gonna be nice."

120
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,473
"I'm gonna be altruistic."

121
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,004
"I'm gonna watch <i>Hotel Rwanda</i>
and volunteer at a shelter,"

122
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,573
"'cause girls will like that."

123
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,777
"I will get laid."

124
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,910
"I'll get better job."

125
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,352
"I'll succeed forward
in the life"...

126
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,650
- I don't think
that's what it is.

127
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,815
- But the purist vers...

128
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,290
- I don't think that
that's accurate.

129
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,383
- Al?
Hey, Al?

130
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,893
I know you spent
some time with him

131
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,054
in the last couple of years,
but I... but he's my brother.

132
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,121
- I just think you're gonna hold
someone to something

133
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,065
that happened when they were
fucking 14 years old

134
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,590
or whatever he was
when that happened.

135
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,603
- If we're gonna toast the man,
let's toast the man.

136
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,764
Let's not eulogize somebody like
a fucking bullshit...

137
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,899
- Just the way you're saying
it is just like he's a dick.

138
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,738
And it's like, he wasn't a dick.
He was amazing.

139
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,142
- You're calling my brother
a dick?

140
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,475
I'm not calling my brother
a dick.

141
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,037
- Jack!

142
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,412
- I'm just saying,

143
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,885
let's not do what everybody does
at a funeral

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,819
or a commemoratory ceremony

145
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,788
where we just say,
"Uh, they were amazing,

146
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,790
and they were generous,"

147
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,155
'cause that's fucking bullshit.

148
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,489
And it's a dishonor to the man.

149
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,085
- So cheers.

150
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,028
- No, I think
I'm gonna finish, Al,

151
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,292
'cause I'm his brother.

152
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,163
If we're gonna raise our glass,

153
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,690
I want to raise our glass
to the man.

154
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,863
You know half of the man,
and I know the whole man, okay?

155
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,805
Who was fucking beautiful.

156
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,934
He knew how to make himself work
and weave in the world.

157
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,307
And I think
that's fucking great.

158
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,937
And I would never call him
a dick for that,

159
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,571
so fuck you
for saying that.

160
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,343
But let's raise a glass
to the whole man.

161
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,509
Cheers.

162
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,950
Thank you.

163
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,390
(quietly)
Cheers.

164
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,568
So, anyway, I was...

165
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,036
we should say something.

166
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,562
But does anyone
want another drink?

167
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,801
Or, uh...

168
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,170
(groans)

169
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,481
Oh, boy.

170
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,479
(sighs loudly)

171
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,182
- How'd that go for you?

172
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,747
When you wrote it,

173
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,057
how did you see that
actually playing out for you?

174
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,790
(groans)

175
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,459
I will say this.

176
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,196
Some parties are forgettable.

177
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,204
(chuckles)
- You know what I mean?

178
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,706
But I got to say,
this party...

179
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,538
- Had great guacamole
and amazing public speaking.

180
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,203
- Great public speaking.

181
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,906
They'll remember it.

182
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,645
- You got to stop.

183
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,618
You know that, right?

184
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,382
- Oh, this is...
this is that moment...

185
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,221
- This is your intervention.
- Isn't it?

186
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,160
This is...
this is hard Iris.

187
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,220
- I miss you.

188
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,461
I miss my friend.

189
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,990
I know you're sad.

190
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,630
I'm sad too.

191
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,196
- Yeah.

192
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,074
You know what I always
think about?

193
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,277
I think about, like, you're...

194
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:37,415
that must have been so hard
for you to leave Tom.

195
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,052
That fucking guy loved you.

196
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,287
Man.

197
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,125
You are so...
but you were right,

198
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,427
and you were so brave,
and you were so right.

199
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,694
- It wasn't right with us.

200
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,634
- No, it wasn't right
with you guys.

201
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,231
But that's okay.

202
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,070
Can I tell you something?

203
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,975
I turned down the Trinity job.

204
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,445
- Why?

205
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,312
- I don't want to go to Trinity

206
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,976
and show them who I am
right now,

207
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,076
because they'll never
hire me again.

208
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,986
And so that almost means,
like,

209
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,353
I don't want to go another party

210
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,948
and show them
who I am right now.

211
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,550
And I don't want to go to a girl

212
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,891
and show her who I am
right now...

213
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,021
- You're a mess.

214
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,828
- Well...

215
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,461
- I've been watching you
for a year now,

216
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,596
and whatever you're doing,

217
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,902
and whatever you think
is helping you,

218
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,170
I have a responsibility
as your friend

219
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,904
to tell you
that it's not.

220
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,309
- I knew this was coming,
by the way.

221
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,313
- Okay.

222
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,814
- Just tell me what to do.
- Okay.

223
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,839
- That's basically where I'm at.
Just tell me what...

224
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,044
- Okay, all right.

225
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,609
- You know better than I do.
You know I...

226
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,086
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

227
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,315
- I know.
I have a plan.

228
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,482
- You have a plan?

229
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,821
- I just want you
to hear me out.

230
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,655
It's just a plan right now.
- I love your plans.

231
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,684
- You might not love this one,
but just hear me out.

232
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,957
- But I don't have any plans.

233
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,158
- Um, that's the good news.

234
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,259
You know, uh, you know that
nice red bicycle that you have?

235
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,269
(belches)
Yes.

236
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,998
- Yikes.
- Sorry.

237
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,472
(laughing)
What you're going to do...

238
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,372
you're gonna dust off
Old Red,

239
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,001
you're gonna wheel him
out of the shed,

240
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,978
and you're gonna get on a ferry.

241
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,571
I'm sending you
to my dad's place.

242
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,412
You know my dad's place
on the island?

243
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,917
It's beautiful in the winter.

244
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,581
It's idyllic and crisp
and peaceful and...

245
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,886
- Like, by "beautiful" you mean,
"rainy and cold."

246
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,586
- I'm sorry;
I got so distracted,

247
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,457
'cause all I heard was
pissing and moaning.

248
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,860
- Right.
Sorry, I started pissing.

249
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,693
I'm not pissing.
I'm not pissing and moaning.

250
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,894
I'm done.
I'm done.

251
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:33,804
- You just need
some head space, okay?

252
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

253
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,773
So then you're gonna take
a right on a road

254
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,078
called Dunhill Road.

255
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,108
And the house is right
at the end of the street.

256
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,586
And it's the only house
on the lane.

257
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,918
<i>- Okay.</i>

258
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,448
<i>Um, I mean, seriously,
I'm just going not...</i>

259
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,221
<i>like, what am I doing out here?</i>

260
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,525
- You just sit there,
and you look out at the water,

261
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,258
and you think
about your life.

262
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,697
<i>- Really?
I'm just gonna sit?</i>

263
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,859
- You're just gonna sit.

264
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,300
There's no TV.
There's no internet.

265
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,667
There's nothing.
It's just you.

266
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,137
<i>- Do they have forks,
'cause I might...</i>

267
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,161
- They have a couple...

268
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,503
we have a couple of forks,
yeah.

269
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,133
<i>- I might need to stab myself
in the face.</i>

270
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,268
(laughs)

271
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,335
<i>- Will you please come visit me,
please?</i>

272
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,280
- No, Jack.
I can't.

273
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,045
This is... I can't anyway,
'cause I'm slammed.

274
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,044
But I can't because this is...
this is for you, you know.

275
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,115
Don't make me feel bad
about sending you off.

276
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,217
<i>- All right, I'm gonna go have
the greatest time ever</i>

277
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,522
<i>doing nothing.</i>

278
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,087
<i>And if I don't come back
within a week,</i>

279
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,065
<i>bring a razor
and deodorant.</i>

280
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,194
(laughs)

281
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,205

282
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,839
♪ ♪

283

Hi, hi, I'm...

- Ahh!
- Okay.

294
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,434
I think I have the wrong house.
And I... I...

295
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,778
Hey, Hannah!
You're Hannah!

296
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,113
Oh, my God, I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

297
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,516
I'm Jack.
I'm Iris' friend Jack.

298
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,214
- You're Jack?

299
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,846
- Yes, I'm so sorry
I freaked you out.

300
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,754
- Holy fuck!
- Sorry.

301
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,258
- Are you kidding me?

302
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,887
What are you doing, like,
creeping around my house?

303
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,692
- I was looking for the key.
And I'm so sorry.

304
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,891
I didn't... I didn't even see
anything, so it's fine.

305
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,662
- Fuck me.

306
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,066
- Sorry, that's my fault.

307
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,626
That's...

308
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,783
Anyway, not to beat
a dead horse,

309
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,946
but just to be super clear,

310
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,421
I was looking
for the key out front,

311
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,617
and I thought maybe
it was on the side.

312
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,353
You know, and that's really...

313
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,726
- Ring the bell.
Just ring the bell, dude.

314
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,754
- Yeah, but I didn't know
anybody was here,

315
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,198
so why would I ring
the bell?

316
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,202
- You know what?
Just... let's drop it, okay?

317
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,704
It's just...
it's done.

318
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,366
- Anyway, sorry.

319
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,935
But look, you obviously
came here to, what,

320
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,241
get some alone time,

321
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,248
and I'm clearly barging in.

322
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,375
So I don't know, I'll just get
a cheap hotel, I think,

323
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,782
and it'll be fine.

324
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,787
- No, it's fine.
You can... you could stay.

325
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,288
Yeah, it's fine.

326
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,222
Stay.

327
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,589
- I don't want to intrude.

328
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,287
I really don't.

329
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,555
- Look, Iris invited you up.

330
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,960
You're a guest.

331
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,659
You're welcome to stay.

332
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,326
- You sure?

333
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,131
- Yeah, I'm sure.

334
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,466
There's plenty of room.

335
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm sure we won't even
run into each other.

336
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,305
Are you hungry?

337
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,209
There's bananas.

338
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,475
- Those are bananas?

339
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,948
- Well, they're dehydrated.

340
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,008
- Oh, okay.

341
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,452
I'm good.
Thank you.

342
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,956
But yeah, if you're okay,
I'm... I will crash.

343
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,753
- Okay, I'm okay.
Stop saying, "Are you okay?"

344
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,487
- Well, I just want to make sure
you're okay.

345
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,927
Um, what... is there a bedroom
I should take?

346
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,797
- Yeah, just go past
where we had the standoff,

347
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,165
and it's the first bedroom
on the right.

348
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:41,002
- Oh, past the... the creepy guy
with the bike helmet?

349
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,001
- Yeah, where the crazy lady
was brandishing the oar.

350
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,604
- She was scary.

351
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,875
I hope she's gone.

352
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,075
- Good night.

353
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,447
- Do you think
we'll see her again?

354
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,008
- Maybe.

355
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,994
(sighs)

356
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,485
(sighs)

357
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,824
(groans)

358
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,812
(object clatters)

359
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:14,323
(door clicks)

360
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,357
Can I come in?

361
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,930
(sighs)

362
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,479
- There's glasses
on the windowsill,

363
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,643
you know,
if you want to join me.

364
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,151
- You sure?
- Yeah.

365
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,552
- Thanks.

366
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,759
One thing in common
with your little sister.

367
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,490
- What, the lush factor?

368
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,828
- Ah, the self-aware
lush factor.

369
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,833
- Oh.
- Very important.

370
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,859
Big difference.

371
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,568
So you're on an island.

372
00:17:56,608 --> 00:18:00,806
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and you're drinking by yourself.

373
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,007
- Yeah.

374
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,882
- What's going on?

375
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,147
- Really?

376
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,212
- I'm not good for small talk,

377
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,021
so I apologize
if I'm, uh, barging through

378
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,720
the doors of your privacy
right now.

379
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,956
- Yeah, it's okay.
You kind of are, but, it's...

380
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,486
- I am.
I apologize.

381
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,021
Let's talk about your slippers.

382
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,864
- Okay.
Let's talk about my slippers.

383
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,871
- Your slippers are awesome.

384
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,304
- I just walked out
on a seven-year relationship.

385
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,440
- Whoa.

386
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,315
- Hence the tequila.
- Hence the tequila.

387
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,554
- What's your story?

388
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,994
Mm, nothing really.

389
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,587
I just kind of had
a shitty year.

390
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,397
You know, thought it'd be nice
to have a little sabbatical,

391
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,630
get some alone time.

392
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,035
- Okay, good place for it.

393
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,334
- Good place for it.

394
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,362
- Obviously.

395
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,034
- Getting the alone time.

396
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,476
But I got to say,
not so terrible

397
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,106
to have a drinking buddy.

398
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,548
- Yeah.

399
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,886
- You are not
what I expected, Hannah.

400
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,890
- How so?

401
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,916
- You are, uh...
I don't know.

402
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,056
Just not how Iris
described you to me, I guess.

403
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,089
- How did she describe me?

404
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,431
- She... well,
if you don't know already,

405
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,596
she worships you
and looks up to you

406
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,003
and thinks you are amazing.

407
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,098
And she loves you.

408
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,267
- Yeah?

409
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,776
- It's true.

410
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,175
- What else?

411
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,304
- Well, I don't...

412
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,506
- Give me the dirt!
Come on!

413
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,106
- What am I supposed to say?
She loves you.

414
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,377
She thinks you're amazing.

415
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,975
- Well, I love her.
I think she's amazing.

416
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,452
- Well, good.
Well, drink your drink.

417
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,580
- You drink your drink.
Don't tell me to drink my drink.

418
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,613
- Well, I'm drinking my drink.
You drink that one.

419
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,094
Watch this.

420
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,256
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

421
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,663
- Wham!
Okay.

422
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,098
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

423
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,432
- Now you're talking.
I had a brother.

424
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,664
- That's right.

425
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,699
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

426
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,370
- I knew that.
- Don't.

427
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,879
- That's... I'm sorry.
That's my bad.

428
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,905
- Why are you sorry?
- I don't know.

429
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,383
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.

430
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,579
I used to have a brother,
and I don't anymore.

431
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,417
And that's what it is, you know?

432
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,013
It's like,

433
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,649
it is what it is,
and it sucks.

434
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:31,425
And it... you know, it was,

435
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,328
you know,
it was terrible, obviously.

436
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,128
But, um...
but I'm good.

437
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,158
And, um, thank you for that.

438
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,760
But it's not necessary.

439
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,829
- To your brother.

440
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,172
- To your sister.

441
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,906
And her sister, being you.

442
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,935
- That would be me.

443
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,573
- Yeah.

444
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,844
- I guess
I better drink then.

445
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,976
- Come on.

446
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,453
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm.

447
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,853
- I can't.

448
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,413
- Look, if we're gonna
drink to someone

449
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,255
as awesome as your sister
and my dead brother,

450
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,487
we're throwing
the shit back.

451
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,017
- Okay.
- Come on, wham it.

452
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,723
Mm!

453
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,924
There it is.

454
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,193
- Holy shit.

455
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,724
- Yet another similarity
with you and Iris.

456
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,293
I can talk her into drinking
anything.

457
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,100
I can't believe you let me
talk you into that.

458
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,606
That's really great.

459
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,869
You want another one?

460
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,877
(festive salsa music)

461
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,936
♪ ♪

462
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,470
Okay, my best friend
is your sister.

463
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,948
- Right.

464
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,042
- It's like a kind of in-law,
of sort, that makes us.

465
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,579
You know what I'm saying?

466
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,750
- What are you talking about?

467
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,589
- I'm doing...
- Yeah, no, no, no, go, go, go.

468
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,651
I cut you off when you were

469
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,162
actually going
with something good.

470
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,096
- I'm drawing
a brilliant parallel.

471
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,259
Go again.
(mumbling)

472
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,496
Going down.

473
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,994
Getting weird with the...

474
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,901
(slurring) All right,
let me tell you something.

475
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,703
- Yeah!

476
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,043
- All right,
it's not that I was...

477
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,173
I was in love with her.

478
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,705
I was totally fucking
in love with her.

479
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,149
But what I was in love with

480
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,915
was the potential that
she was holding that was me.

481
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,182
- Right.
- Does that make sense?

482
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,314
- Right.

483
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,619
- That's what I was
in love with.

484
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,750
- Right, right.
- Was that.

485
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,351
- And then I started
to realize, like,

486
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,763
it was like I gave her
all my, like, zhuzh,

487
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,788
all my good stuff.

488
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,857
Is this making any sense?

489
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,129
- Yeah.
You shouldn't do that.

490
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,864
- And, like... and she
wouldn't give it back.

491
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,031
So, like, as the... as the...
as, like, the years went on

492
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,541
and everything went on,
I was just, like...

493
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,406
this is gonna sound
so fucking melodramatic.

494
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,677
I was, like, this fucking,
like, little fucking bird,

495
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,774
Like, in a cage.

496
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,580
And finally she came over
and unlocked it,

497
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,711
and I just sat there.

498
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,085
- Wow.

499
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,521
- I sat there
for three more months

500
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,491
when she was hooking up
with a...

501
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,890
(gagging)

502
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,023
Ugh, this woman, girl,
who's so much younger than me.

503
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,190
And I just couldn't...

504
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,893
I just sat there
and waited for her

505
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,834
to be attracted
to me again

506
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,600
or to just look at me
like I was, uh...

507
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,901
- Whoa.

508
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,875
We're gonna stop
this conversation.

509
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,376
I got a sense of it, okay?

510
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,901
And here's the deal.

511
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,641
I've made a decision.

512
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,978
Pam is a fucking moron.

513
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,107
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

514
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,617
- She's not really, but...

515
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,777
- No, here's the deal.

516
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,379
Look, for her to have
given you the sense

517
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,753
in some way that you're not,

518
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,725
Like, young enough
or good enough or pretty enough

519
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,093
or just enough in general
is fucking bullshit.

520
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,121
- It is, right?
- It's bullshit.

521
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:25,000
Because what I see
across from me is...

522
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,594
you have to...
you're gonna have to let me

523
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,230
descend here for a second;
can I descend?

524
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,365
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

525
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,670
I have to tell you something,

526
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,404
and I don't want you
to take it the wrong way.

527
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,275
It's to prove a point, okay?

528
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,779
But it's about your butt.
So when I...

529
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,645
(laughs)
What?

530
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,741
- When I...
when I went to look for...

531
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,275
- You are a fucker.

532
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,513
- I am.

533
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,749
- You were fucking peeping
in the fucking windows.

534
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,984
You're a fucker.

535
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,218
Give me some more.

536
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,521
You are a fucking...
go ahead...

537
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,460
yeah, no, I want to hear
your confession.

538
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,723
Confess.

539
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,855
- I tried to find the key.

540
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:53,922
I went around the door,

541
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,296
all innocent
up until that point.

542
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,527
Innocent, innocent, innocent.

543
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,058
Looking for the key,
total innocence,

544
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,127
total innocence.

545
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:03,574
Through the window:
your butt.

546
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,734
- Pervert.

547
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,141
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,406
- But you made me that way.

549
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,743
- I made you that way?

550
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,577
- 'Cause your butt is
fucking awesome, okay?

551
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,604
- Can you not?

552
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,878
- 'Cause it's, like, super soft.

553
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,215
- How do you know
it's super soft?

554
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,219
- 'Cause I could tell.

555
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,845
- You're so fucking weird...

556
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,150
- I know.
- And drunk right now.

557
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,181
- I know.
I looked at it for a while.

558
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,090
I got a good sense of it.

559
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,424
And let me tell you
another thing

560
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,453
that's even more inappropriate,

561
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,227
but it's super safe
'cause you're a lesbian.

562
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,635
If I were differently equipped

563
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:37,404
or you were
differently inclined,

564
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,002
this night might go
a very different way.

565
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,342
- Really?

566
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,040
- I'm just saying...
- Are you just saying?

567
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:47,279
- I would be super open to that
in a whole other universe...

568
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,786
- Okay.

569
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,382
- Because... and this is just
serving to prove my point of,

570
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,451
Like, you shouldn't feel
not awesome

571
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,487
because she was
not interested in you.

572
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,089
There will be a lot of people...

573
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,100
- Well, I didn't say
she wasn't interested in me.

574
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,499
The fucking thing
ran its course.

575
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,560
But anyway, go ahead.

576
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,696
I like it.
I like it.

577
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:13,576
- To your gorgeous,
supple, soft,

578
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,070
sexy motherfucking butt.

579
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,083
(sighs)

580
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,449
- And all the other things
that I might be thinking about

581
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,647
except for the fact that
I'm not thinking about them.

582
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,021
- I'm just saying...
- Anyway, the point is, you,

583
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,389
you're never going to be happy

584
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,087
if you're eating
this fucking bird food.

585
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,857
You think... you know why
you feel like a bird?

586
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,489
- I love that food.
- You feel like a bird?

587
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,159
Okay, what the fuck is this?
It's a turd.

588
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,326
You can't eat these things.

589
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,964
I am here, Dr. Jack,
to fix you, okay?

590
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,407
So I'm gonna make you round,
tall filet, super awesome.

591
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,034
Grocery store.
Cook it medium-rare.

592
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,840
- I can't do it.
- With the butter.

593
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,347
- I can't eat meat.
You can make me something else.

594
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,906
- Okay, I'll make you
something else.

595
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,081
I'll make you a super
awesome steak medium-rare

596
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,113
with the butter
and the blue cheese

597
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,853
and the truffle oil drizzled
over the French fries.

598
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,622
And I'm gonna put this plate
in front of you.

599
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,357
And it's gonna be
totally different.

600
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,297
It'll be a change of pace.

601
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,562
But you are out of the cage now,
my friend.

602
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,434
And if you want to fucking fly,
you're gonna start with a steak.

603
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,903
That's all I'm saying.
- Let's do it.

604
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,463
- All right, we're going
to the store...

605
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,565
- No, let's do it.

606
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,041
- I'm gonna fucking cook you
a meal.

607
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,101
- Hey!

608
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,515
All right.

609
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,317
I'm gonna take you up
on your offer.

610
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,118
- What are you doing?

611
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,419
- I haven't, uh,

612
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,483
been on that bicycle
in quite some time, but...

613
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,290
- What are you... what?

614
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,821
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

615
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,493
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

616
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,867
I'm single.
You're single.

617
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,031
- I'm single.

618
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,200
- I mean, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

619
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,175
- No, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

620
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,235
- No, we shouldn't do it.
You're a straight guy.

621
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,440
- I'm looking at your boobs.
- It might be too much.

622
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,676
It might be too much for you.

623
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,582
Too much for you to handle.

624
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,577
What?

625
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,251
- You're serious.

626
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,418
- I don't know.

627
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,052
I mean,
I'm game if you're game.

628
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,656
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

629
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,497
- Get rid of this.
Get rid of this.

630
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,400
Holy shit.

631
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,446
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

632
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,352
Shit, shit, shit, I don't have...
I don't...

633
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,358
I didn't bring a...
I don't have a condom.

634
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,587
Well, I didn't...
I thought I was gonna be alone.

635
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,652
- Condom!

636
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,393
- Oh, fuck.

637
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,661
Saran Wrap?

638
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,066
- I think I know where
there's one.

639
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,969
- Okay, oh, all right.

640
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,838
Uh...

641
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,866
Um...

642
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,939
Okay.

643
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,974
(sighs)

644
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,724
Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right there.

645
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,192
Don't move, don't move,
don't move.

646
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,285
I got to show you something.

647
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,989
I've always wanted to do this.

648
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,497
Okay.
You ready?

649
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,898
- Yes.

650
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,266
- Ta-da!

651
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,930
- All right.
- You're very underwhelmed.

652
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,404
Okay, never mind.

653
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,374
- Wait.
All right.

654
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,705
I'm gonna do it.

655
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,075
- Whoa, you're really
going for it.

656
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,477
- Is that on?

657
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,777
- Uh, snap it.
Snap it.

658
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,874
Okay, good.

659
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,145
Give me this.
Give me this.

660
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,584
(yelps)
- Okay, sorry.

661
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,816
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

662
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,118
Okay.

663
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,557
- Let me get these off.

664
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,460
- Yeah.
- Okay.

665
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,828
- Wow.
Wow.

666
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,059
Okay.

667
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,063
- Okay.

668
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,231
- Oh, my God.

669
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,296
(groans)

670
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,035
- Oh, shit, you're amazing.

671
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,067
(both moaning)

672
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,180
- Oh, sorry.

673
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,243
Wait a second.

674
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,378
(squeals)

675
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,388
Oh, shit.
I squealed.

676
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,515
Sorry.

677
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:25,018
(sighing and moaning)

678
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,792
- Did you...
okay.

679
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,799
- Yeah, sorry.

680
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,028
That was...

681
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,004
it wasn't supposed to be
that fast.

682
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,997
- Oh, good.

683
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,407
- I can... I can help, uh...

684
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,502
- No, it's okay.

685
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,739
- Finish for you, if you want.

686
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,838
- Oh, no.

687
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,848
Thank you.

688
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,577
- You sure?
- Yeah.

689
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,608
- Okay.
- Ow, you're on my hair.

690
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,415
- Sorry.

691
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,217
- All right, um...

692
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,385
Well...

693
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,760
You want to snuggle?

694
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,789
- Yeah.
- Okay.

695
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,063
- Go for it.
- Okay.

696
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,366
- Maybe not that close.

697
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,701
- We should get some...

698
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:12,039
we should get some water too
before we go to sleep.

699
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,543
- Okay.

700
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,879
- Good night.

701
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,516
Thank you.

702
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,547
(birds chirping)

703
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,154
(ferry horn blows)

704
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,047
(sighs)

705
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,804
- She's here, she's here,
she's here, she's here.

706
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,066
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

707
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,301
Oh, ew!

708
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,742
Oh, shit.

709
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,937
Fuck.
Where'd it go?

710
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,310
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

711
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,714
Where'd it go?

712
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,944
Okay, you have to get up.

713
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,384
Iris is in the driveway.

714
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,853
Dude, she's in the driveway.

715
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,015
Give me some tissues.

716
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,025
Give me some tissue.
Come on.

717
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,686
Okay.

718
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,059
Very important, okay?

719
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,222
She cannot know about this.

720
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,232
I am running or something.

721
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,665
You are sleeping.

722
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,258
And we're good, okay?

723
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,701
Just...

724
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,039
- What?

725
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,942
- Jack?

726
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,425
What the fuck is that?

727
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,931
- Hey, Bean.

728
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,198
- Oh, my God.

729
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,398
- What's up?

730
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,236
- Puppet?
What the fuck?

731
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,708
Oh, my goodness!

732
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,211
What are you doing here?

733
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,440
- Oh.

734
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,970
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.

735
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,677
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

736
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,709
- Yeah, it's a long story.
- Did you just wake up?

737
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:36,777
You okay?

738
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,948
These are cute.
These are really...

739
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,651
- Holy cow!

740
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,024
- And you've met...
oh, Jesus Christ.

741
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,085
- What?

742
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,595
- What have you come as?

743
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,188
- I was on a run.

744
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,425
- Here she is.

745
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,956
- Hannah showed me
a great path, and...

746
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,195
- Jane Fonda.

747
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,361
- Oh, cut it out.

748
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,734
- Oh, yummy.
You're sweaty.

749
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,170
- Oh, what are you doing here?

750
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,400
What is going on?

751
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,601
- Did you meet my sister?

752
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,007
I've been wanting you
to meet her.

753
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,169
- I did.
We met last night.

754
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,509
Yes, we did.
- How nice is this?

755
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,811
I've been wanting you guys
to meet for so long.

756
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,113
Haven't I been talking about it?
And it's weird.

757
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,982
It's weird that you haven't met,
so I love it.

758
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,248
- I know.
It's crazy.

759
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,380
How... what... why are you...

760
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,889
how did the...
what are you doing here?

761
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,551
- I got off work.
I just was, like...

762
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,355
they moved a shoot
and then axed another one,

763
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,759
so I was, like, "Peace out.

764
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,729
I'm gonna go
and annoy my friend."

765
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,561
- That's so great!

766
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,226
- This is amazing
that she's here as well.

767
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,700
- I know.

768
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,761
You were like, "Go up
for a solo sabbatical except"...

769
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:27,828
- I know.
I know.

770
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,305
You're supposed
to have alone time,

771
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,069
and now you're, like,
double whammy!

772
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,542
(laughs)

773
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,635
- Two of them here.

774
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,940
- That was a big run.

775
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,503
- Yeah, it was really good.

776
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,071
- Yeah.
I need to pee.

777
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,583
I'm literally
gonna pee my pants.

778
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,642
I got you provisions and stuff.

779
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,950
I love that you're here.

780
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,115
Where did you guys sleep?

781
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,994
- That was a bit much.

782
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,620
It's, like, pouring off
your head.

783
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,428
- So... yeah.

784
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,503
- Hey.
- Hey.

785
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,736
- Took my room.

786
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,677
- I hate my room.

787
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,077
- You do hate your room.

788
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,637
Don't be weird
and change the sheets.

789
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,845
It's fine.

790
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,478
- I broke up with Pam.

791
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,318
- What?

792
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,221
Holy shit.

793
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,850
Why...
when?

794
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,053
- A couple of days ago.

795
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,528
I got up here yesterday.

796
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,552
I hitchhiked up.

797
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,894
- You didn't hitchhike up.

798
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,900
Please don't hitchhike.
It's so dangerous.

799
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,697
(sighs)
Shit.

800
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,294
- I had no idea that...

801
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,429
are you all right?

802
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,996
Please don't change
the sheets.

803
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,167
- I want to change the sheets.
- Don't change the sheets.

804
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,336
- Let me change the sheets.
I want to change the sheets.

805
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,111
- I want to talk to you about...

806
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:51,088
I had no idea you guys
were having trouble.

807
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,523
Hannah.

808
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,154
(whispers)
Why didn't you call me?

809
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,788
- I don't know;
I knew we were in trouble

810
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,423
when we weren't
being physical anymore.

811
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,058
But, I mean,
that was totally my fault.

812
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,228
I was just so fucking angry
with her all the time.

813
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,203
- Yeah, of course you were.
She's suffocating.

814
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,671
- No.
Well, she was suffocating.

815
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,673
- She was suffocating.

816
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,140
- No, but it was me too.

817
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,803
It was because
I was buying in to this...

818
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,335
I was...

819
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,108
what did I say to you
last night?

820
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,673
I had a good metaphor
for it last night.

821
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,309
- Did you guys talk
about this last night?

822
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,341
- Yes, I was shitfaced,

823
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,717
and I was
pouring out my heart.

824
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,087
- You know what?
I am gonna need some herbs.

825
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,093
Would you mind getting something
from the garden?

826
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,788
- Do you need it right now,
or do you want to...

827
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,591
- It would be great
so that it could marinate.

828
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,858
- What?

829
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,991
- I do feel like sooner
rather than later would be good,

830
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,125
just so they can marinate.

831
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,362
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,233
Um, but I want to know...
I want to know what the...

833
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,329
- I'll remember where I was.

834
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,361
- I didn't know any of this,

835
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,600
what the breaking point...

836
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,302
- It's not the kind of stuff
you talk about.

837
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,605
- I know.
- Yeah.

838
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,111
- All right,
what do you want me to do?

839
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,408
- Um, real quick.

840
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,914
I've been thinking,

841
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,007
since the bottle of tequila
was pretty much empty,

842
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,484
I think the way we pitch it is,
you were here drinking,

843
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,454
and I came in, and we talked
for, like, 20 minutes.

844
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,785
Then you went to bed.

845
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,381
I stayed up
finishing the tequila.

846
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,449
And then that way, it's like,
we hung out a little bit

847
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,960
but not so much
that it's suspicious.

848
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,826
You know what I'm saying?
Is that cool with you?

849
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,421
- What are you talking about?

850
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,127
I mean, seriously,
what are you talking about?

851
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,500
- Okay,
don't you think we both agree

852
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,232
it's better
if Iris just doesn't know?

853
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,830
- Why?

854
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,639
- Because she's your sister,
and I'm her best friend...

855
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,803
- Yeah?
- And it's weird.

856
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,073
- Weird, what?

857
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,478
Well, it's weird
that we had sex.

858
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,141
I mean, I'm not particularly
proud of it.

859
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,707
But I don't think
she would give a shit.

860
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,343
- What do you mean
you're not proud of it?

861
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,354
- Come on.
Whatever, anyway, go ahead.

862
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,322
You want me to make up a story

863
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,256
to throw her off the track

864
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,419
so that she doesn't know
that we had sex?

865
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,428
- That sounds terrible
when you say it like that.

866
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,486
- Right.
- Okay?

867
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,929
- Do you have a thing
for my sister?

868
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,159
- I knew
you were gonna say this.

869
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,758
This is why I didn't want
to say anything.

870
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,200
I do not have a thing
for your sister.

871
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,430
- You have a thing
for my sister.

872
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,903
- I don't have a thing
for your sister.

873
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,065
Here's the deal.
- Okay.

874
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,471
- I think it would be bad
for all of us

875
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,475
if Iris knows about this.

876
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,874
I'm not just thinking...

877
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,901
- You are freaking me out
on so many levels right now.

878
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,107
- You don't think she'd be upset
if you told her we had sex?

879
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,672
- I don't think
she would give a shit, no.

880
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,978
- Wow.
- I hate to break it to you...

881
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,075
(door clicking)
- Hi!

882
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,210
- Hey!
I've got sage as well.

883
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,550
I don't know if that's any good.

884
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,988
- Uh, sage is great actually.

885
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,183
Perfect.
Thank you.

886
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,487
- So what was the point when...

887
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,084
what was it
when you decided that...

888
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,220
- You know what? I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

889
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,594
- No.
But I haven't heard any of it.

890
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,030
- I'm starting to get
so irritable,

891
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,499
because it's just
a bad topic.

892
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,297
- Let's listen to some music.

893
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,394
Why don't we do that?

894
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,404
- I'll put some music on.

895
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,303
- Yeah, let's do music.

896
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,501
That sounds good.

897
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,511
- Did she tell you about
the Pam thing last night?

898
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,570
- What's that?

899
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,638
- Did she tell you about Pam?

900
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,705
- We touched on it.

901
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,580
- How's this?
- It's okay.

902
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,711
- Can you not talk about me
when I'm in the same area?

903
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,983
- I'm just saying,
I think I'm a little upset

904
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,889
that this guy is, like,
all clued up on your breakup

905
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,222
and I don't know anything.

906
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,818
- Here's the deal.
New rule.

907
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,728
No talking behind anybody's
backs in this house, all right?

908
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,959
- All right.
- Um, we don't do that.

909
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,558
- Okay.
- Yeah, good.

910
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,933
- Okay, I know you don't want
to talk about it anymore.

911
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,267
That's fine.

912
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,465
- Yeah.
- That's totally fine.

913
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,564
- Let's just move on.

914
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,302
- All right.
- Sounds good to me.

915
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,739
This place is incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

916
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,308
- I know you said at some point
it was renovated, but...

917
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,377
- You don't understand
how beautiful this place was.

918
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,718
- You don't understand.
It was...

919
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,383
- I mean, it was insane.
- It was beautiful.

920
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,325
- It was just so pure
and gorgeous,

921
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,419
and then Marilyn came in
and just eradicated

922
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,986
any memory of us.

923
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,090
And, so the house, yes,
is very beautiful...

924
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,828
- Without the stink of us.

925
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,563
- Yeah.

926
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,333
- But Marilyn's only got
a couple more years left.

927
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,566
- It's two and a half, three.

928
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,972
- Two and a half,
three more years.

929
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,908
- Yeah, I think so.
- What, are you...

930
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,002
I'm sorry, what?
Three to go?

931
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,571
- The ten-year itch.
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,550
- Okay, he was with her mum
for ten years,

933
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,711
had an affair with my mum,
who was his secretary.

934
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,721
- Got your mom Lenora pregnant.
- Yes.

935
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,279
- Married her.

936
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,292
- Moved to London.
- Moved to London.

937
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,021
- Got bored of Lenora,
and then he moved on.

938
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,495
And then he kind of philandered
around for, like, seven years.

939
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,862
- He went through
his crazy Warren Beatty phase.

940
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,730
The funny thing, though,
about those years,

941
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,598
when he was so bad
with the ladies,

942
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,501
he was so good with us,
because that was...

943
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,732
- He wasn't.

944
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,239
- No, but that was, like,
six summers

945
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,707
that it was just
the three of us here.

946
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,175
- I know, but you were okay
with that.

947
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,404
I had no respect for that.

948
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,743
He just went... he dodged
from one to the other,

949
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,145
and it was gross.

950
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,376
- That's so crazy.

951
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,850
So he would just, like,
date all these women,

952
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,375
Like, for short periods
of time

953
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,944
with not a lot
of emotional investment?

954
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,387
- Yeah, it was horrible.

955
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,687
- And they were very similar,
and then he would just move on?

956
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,988
- Yeah.
- God, that's just weird.

957
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,289
Who does that?
Oh!

958
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,193
And the patterns emerge!

959
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,788
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

960
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,801
Skinny Jeans George,
Skinny Jeans Harry,

961
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,132
Skinny Jeans Vinnie.

962
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,967
Vinnie lasted
for at least two weeks.

963
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,233
He was one of the longer ones.

964
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,740
- I don't like dating.
You know that.

965
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,969
I don't like dating.

966
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,136
I don't like the...
I don't like it.

967
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,577
I get bored.
I don't like it.

968
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,103
- Do you know how
the Iris dating scheme

969
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,115
works these days?

970
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,946
(laughs)
No, you don't.

971
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,645
- Okay, this is basically
how it works,

972
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,051
I mean, in a nutshell.

973
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,954
So they come in
with the skinny jeans

974
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,925
that... yes, skinnier than these,
by the way.

975
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,861
Then we've got
the rocker stud belt,

976
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,454
the Converse, no socks,

977
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,434
tongue open, no shoelaces,
the swoopy haircut.

978
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,595
- Which you have right now,
by the way.

979
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,969
- Well, I have it
'cause I have hair problems.

980
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,371
These guys are young enough.

981
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,137
They should not be swooping.

982
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,235
It starts out
usually on a Friday,

983
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,905
'cause she met him
at a coffee shop.

984
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,346
Saturday night, we go to either
Fleet Foxes or Band of Horses...

985
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,145
- I like Fleet Foxes.

986
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,277
- Or some sort of
Light in The Attic show.

987
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,344
And then she takes them
to the greasy spoon breakfast

988
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,946
the next morning.

989
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,821
She's like, "I'm such
the greasy spoon girl,"

990
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,758
and then they get
very, very excited about her.

991
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,989
And the next weekend they call,
and she does coffee.

992
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,291
And then it's done.

993
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,161
- And why are you
almost defending them?

994
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,360
You hate all of the guys
that I've been out with.

995
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,959
You've hated all of them.

996
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,095
- Well, the problem is...

997
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,627
- I get very bored.
You know that.

998
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,162
- You have great taste in life,

999
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,300
and you have
terrible taste in men.

1000
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,776
- You have terrible taste
in clothes.

1001
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,109
- Of course I do.
I never said...

1002
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,273
- Those denim shorts are
a horror show.

1003
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,579
- Don't... don't talk about
the jean shorts.

1004
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,346
Don't, don't.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1005
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,944
- The fact that
you've somehow managed

1006
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,512
to get the inner seam higher
than the outer seam

1007
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,990
is so creepy.

1008
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,686
- God is in the details.
I'm sorry.

1009
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,284
- I never want to see
those things again.

1010
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,195
- Remember the guy who asked you
to cut your bush?

1011
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,725
Remember?

1012
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,235
The guy that you
were hooking up with

1013
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,702
that told you to trim
your bush and...

1014
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,170
- Okay, we're good.
- No, no, no.

1015
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,639
She came home in tears,

1016
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,266
because she was hooking up
with this guy.

1017
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,640
Remember that guy?

1018
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,372
And she had a little poof
in her underwear.

1019
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,073
- Okay, you know...

1020
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,638
- And she's like, "I didn't know
I'm supposed to trim my bush."

1021
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,877
(both laughing)

1022
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,077
- I was so embarrassed.

1023
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,915
- And I was, like,
the bad older sister

1024
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,216
'cause I didn't tell her.

1025
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,381
- What the fuck are you doing?

1026
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,720
I didn't.
It was...

1027
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,418
(laughing)

1028
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,689
- Anyway, that's the only
boyfriend story I remember.

1029
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,856
- You suck.
That is so wrong, by the way.

1030
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:41,990
- What?
- That's very wrong.

1031
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,465
- These are the guys...

1032
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,196
- Okay, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

1033
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,669
We're done.
We're done.

1034
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,831
Okay?

1035
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,272
- Okay, we're done.

1036
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,707
I'm just gonna eat another vat
of mashed potatoes.

1037
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,506
- How are you liking
those mashed potatoes?

1038
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,638
- They're outrageous.

1039
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,840
- Yeah?
They taste good?

1040
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,076
- Mm-hmm.

1041
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,777
- How vegan do they taste
to you?

1042
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,651
Come on.

1043
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,056
I put a dollop of butter in.
That was it.

1044
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,287
Don't rinse out.
Come on.

1045
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,988
You've been plowing through
those things.

1046
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,291
Do you know why
they tasted good?

1047
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,059
Because they have dairy in them.
That's why.

1048
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,999
- Why would you do that?
- Because I felt like it.

1049
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,764
- That's five pounds of fear
right there that I just ate.

1050
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,497
- It was meant to be a joke

1051
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,973
just 'cause...
to see if you liked it.

1052
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,339
- It was meant to be a joke.

1053
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,934
- I mean,
it's just so not cool.

1054
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,467
- Okay, okay.

1055
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,774
You're right.
It's not cool.

1056
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,246
Are you allergic to butter,
though?

1057
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,718
- No, I'm emotionally allergic
to butter.

1058
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,549
- I'm sorry.
It was just a little bit.

1059
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,282
It was just a tablespoon.

1060
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,812
I like butter
in my mashed potato,

1061
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,348
and that was all it was.

1062
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,225
- All right.
- Don't, Hannah.

1063
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,529
- That was delicious
and inhumane and...

1064
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,092
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

1065
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,728
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1066
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,102
- I love you,
but I don't like you.

1067
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,436
- All right.

1068
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,168
- Thank you, Jack.

1069
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,199
- Good night, Hannah.

1070
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,341
(birds calling)

1071
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,400
- Hannah?

1072
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,401
- Hmm?

1073
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,869
- Hello.
(giggles)

1074
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,064
- I'm sleeping.

1075
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,574
- I know.

1076
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,007
I can't sleep.

1077
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,572
It's because I'm so excited
that you're here.

1078
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,048
- Well, try.

1079
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,050
- What?

1080
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,051
- Try.

1081
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,780
- I can't.

1082
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,351
(sighs)

1083
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,883
- Do you want to talk?

1084
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:24,916
- Mm-mm.

1085
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,520
(laughs)

1086
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,552
- Go to bed.

1087
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,566
- I can't.

1088
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,090
- Well, sleep here, but, shh.

1089
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,466
- Okay.

1090
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,738
Can I just have one question?

1091
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,372
- Hmm?

1092
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,575
- Do you like Jack?

1093
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,251
- Yeah, he's all right.

1094
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,414
- Hmm?

1095
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,617
- I said he's all right.

1096
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,149
- What do you think of him?

1097
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,729
- I don't know.

1098
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,890
I just met him.

1099
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,331
- Yeah, but, you know,

1100
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,133
you're very good
at working people out.

1101
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,405
- I don't know.
He seems like a nice guy.

1102
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,570
- Mm-hmm.

1103
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,671
- He's a good cook.

1104
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,841
Asshole.

1105
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,180
- Sorry about the potato.

1106
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,982
I hate that bush story.

1107
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,048
- I'm sorry about that.

1108
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,185
- I, like, hate it so much.

1109
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,162
It's so, so embarrassing.

1110
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,289
- It's a good story.

1111
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,596
- Yeah, for you.

1112
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,034
(laughs)

1113
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,231
- I don't know.
He's funny, I guess.

1114
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,433
- He's very funny.

1115
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,933
- And full of himself.

1116
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,707
- Well, it's because
he's nervous, though.

1117
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,875
He just gets a little posture-y
when he's nervous.

1118
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,279
He's really smart.

1119
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,416
- So do you like him?

1120
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,052
- Yeah, he's my friend.

1121
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:11,763
- No, I mean, do you<i> like him</i>
like him?

1122
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,432
- Yeah.

1123
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,538
I think I'm in love with him.

1124
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,380
- Wow.

1125
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,889
- Yeah.

1126
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,950
Do you think that's weird?

1127
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,986
- No.

1128
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,098
No.

1129
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,232
- Because of Tom,
I think it might be weird.

1130
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,610
- I don't know.

1131
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,686
- He made this, like,
really drunken pass at me once.

1132
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:15,357
And it was right after
I broke up with Tom.

1133
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,768
And it was completely
embarrassing, but...

1134
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,234
He was so upset
the next day,

1135
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,303
you know, mortified.

1136
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,338
And...

1137
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:41,550
And I was kind of happy
that it happened.

1138
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,264
So I guess I thought then
that I shouldn't...

1139
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,233
shouldn't tell him.

1140
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,737
Do you think that
I should tell him?

1141
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,007
No.

1142
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,844
- No, not no.

1143
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,249
Uh-uh...

1144
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,152
- He's so sweet.

1145
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,022
- I think you should sleep
on it.

1146
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,357
- Sleep on it?

1147
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,657
I thought you were gonna say,

1148
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,425
"I think you should
sleep with him."

1149
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,955
(laughs)

1150
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,195
- That's my usual advice.

1151
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,100
- I just think
I might fuck everything up,

1152
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,601
because maybe
we know each other too well,

1153
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,908
you know?

1154
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:40,212
And he'd be totally
weirded out, and...

1155
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:46,848
- Sleep on it.

1156
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,879
- Okay.

1157
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,291
- In your own bed.

1158
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,659
- Okay.

1159
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,457
- I'm exhausted.

1160
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,127
- Okay.

1161
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,135
- I love you.

1162
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,194
- I love you.

1163
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,973
It's nice to see you.

1164
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,773
- So good to see you,
Peanut.

1165
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,804
(both chuckling)

1166
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,954
- Okay.

1167
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,730
(sighs)

1168
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,311
- Hi, Stink Bomb.

1169
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,443
- Hey.

1170
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,112
How are you?

1171
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,780
- What are you doing?

1172
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,880
- Just chilling.

1173
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,788
Reading.

1174
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,486
- Are you not sleeping?

1175
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,618
- I can't sleep.

1176
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,128
Can you not sleep?

1177
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,395
Here.

1178
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,366
Thanks.

1179
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,460
- Yeah.

1180
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,141
- What do you think of her?

1181
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,178
- I think she's great.

1182
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,514
You know, I really like her,

1183
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:26,454
and she seems great.

1184
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,890
(laughs)

1185
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,052
Do you not like her?

1186
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,552
- No, I just said I like her.

1187
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,860
I do.

1188
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,094
- Did you... what did you guys
do last night?

1189
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,868
- We, um...

1190
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,267
Nothing.

1191
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,276
You know, it was just,
like, small talk,

1192
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,175
getting to know
each other a little bit.

1193
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,205
And it was nice.

1194
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,281
- Do you think
that she's pretty?

1195
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:03,992
- I think she is
empirically attractive.

1196
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,858
(laughs)

1197
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,921
- What?

1198
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:11,525
- "Technically speaking she is,
uh, pretty attractive."

1199
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,468
- Whatever.

1200
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,936
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah.

1201
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,302
- She's really pretty.

1202
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,931
- She's a pretty girl.

1203
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:18,998
- This is her room.

1204
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,009
Do you know that?

1205
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,010
- This is her room?

1206
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,238
- You're in her room.

1207
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,008
- That's weird.
Why'd she put me in here?

1208
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,537
(laughs)

1209
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,776
She hates this room.

1210
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,978
(laughing)

1211
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,816
- Maybe that's why
she put me in here.

1212
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,947
- She does.
She really hates this room.

1213
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:36,356
She hasn't even unpacked.

1214
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,451
- Wow.

1215
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,121
- Yeah, that's all her stuff.

1216
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,288
Shit.

1217
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,790
- What is that?

1218
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,131
- This is all her paintings.

1219
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,136
I don't know if she even knows
they're here.

1220
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,903
She hasn't picked up a brush
in years, but...

1221
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,500
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

1222
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,033
These are all
from around here.

1223
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:58,275
And this is a nudist beach

1224
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,577
on the other side
of the island.

1225
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,674
- On this island?

1226
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:01,684
- Yep.

1227
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,050
- That's crazy.

1228
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,884
- Anyway...

1229
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,550
- Anyway.

1230
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,262
I got to tell you something.

1231
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,827
- What?

1232
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,072
- I...

1233
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,609
- What?

1234
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:44,587
- I am too old to ride bicycles
to islands.

1235
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,392
(laughs)

1236
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,556
- Anyway,

1237
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:52,125
that's my big confession
for the night.

1238
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,574
(birds chirping)

1239
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,600
(sighing and snoring)

1240
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,479
(gasps)

1241
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,268
You just put your foot
in my face,

1242
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,397
you son of a bitch.

1243
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,428
- What?

1244
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,770
- You just put your foot
in my face.

1245
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:32,866
- No, I didn't.

1246
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,137
- You did.

1247
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,239
- Shit head.

1248
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,272
(laughs)

1249
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,309
(birds chirping)

1250
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,285
(waves lapping)

1251
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,405
- Hey.

1252
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,312
- Hey.

1253
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,481
- You were right.

1254
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,854
- About what?

1255
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:26,157
- It's just, um,
better if she doesn't know.

1256
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,561
Cool?

1257
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,997
- Yeah, that's...
that's good for me, yeah.

1258
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,039
(waves lapping)

1259
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,068
- Just like that.

1260
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,547
- Ew, it's a gloopy.

1261
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:46,640
- I prefer "eye booger."

1262
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,707
- Oh...

1263
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,184
- What are... what are we
in for here?

1264
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,413
- Hmm?
- What are we in for here?

1265
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,681
- I have no idea.

1266
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,189
- Are you guys ready for
the best gluten-free, vegan,

1267
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,522
soy-free pancakes
you're ever gonna eat?

1268
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,924
- Mmm.

1269
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,985
- Absolutely.

1270
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,860
- Seriously,
these are delicious.

1271
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:01,886
- They look really good.

1272
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,296
- You can have a little
sad pancake.

1273
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,300
- There's the little man.

1274
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,631
- Look, two little
sad pancakes.

1275
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,728
- Oh, he is a little sad.
I'll make him happy.

1276
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,932
- Tell me if you miss
anything,

1277
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,634
'cause I would be very surprised
if you do.

1278
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,699
- Okay.

1279
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:13,902
- Um... oh!

1280
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,205
Maple syrup.

1281
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,237
- Maple syrup.

1282
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,885
- Oh, shoot.

1283
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,651
Okay, you know what?

1284
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,387
No maple syrup, but we do have
cashew butter.

1285
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,394
- Mmm.

1286
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,417
Amazing.

1287
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,588
- They're good?
- Mm!

1288
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,097
- Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.

1289
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,359
- That's great.
- So good.

1290
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,026
- They're actually even good
without it.

1291
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,593
But I will try it with.

1292
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:41,626
See how we do.

1293
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,968
- I put that stuff on
everything.

1294
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,973
It is delish.

1295
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,065
- Yeah?

1296
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,112
Mmm.
Good.

1297
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,238
- They're good?

1298
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,249
- Very good.
- Very good.

1299
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,875
- I'm so happy
you guys like them.

1300
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,078
I mean, do you miss it?

1301
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,677
Do you even miss the butter
and the milk?

1302
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,087
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

1303
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,989
- They're terrible.

1304
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,965
(laughing)
No, they're not.

1305
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,466
- They're so bad.

1306
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,696
- They're so good, right?

1307
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:14,863
Aren't they good?

1308
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,462
- I think "terrible"
is an extreme word.

1309
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,531
I think that
they are challenged,

1310
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,701
but they are...

1311
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,074
- I think it's
a very good effort.

1312
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,135
- It's not.

1313
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,304
You know what it is?

1314
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,041
The flax seeds
didn't do a good job.

1315
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,072
I put flax seeds in
to replace the egg,

1316
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,210
and usually I use coconut oil,
but we didn't have any.

1317
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,480
And it's just...

1318
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,317
- Well, you didn't have
the right ingredients.

1319
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,322
- We didn't.

1320
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,618
- This is what I think.

1321
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,783
We'll have a second round.

1322
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:36,849
- Okay.

1323
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,326
- You get all
the right ingredients.

1324
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,454
I'll make my pancakes,
you make yours,

1325
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,964
and we'll have, like,
a pancake-off.

1326
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,161
And then whoever wins will win,
like, a...

1327
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,294
- Trip to, uh, IHOP.

1328
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,326
- A trip to IHOP.

1329
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,861
But make sure you bring
your passport,

1330
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,430
'cause it's international,
you know.

1331
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:52,498
- Right.

1332
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,976
(laughter)

1333
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,808
Well done.

1334
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,108
Sorry, you guys.

1335
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,410
- Don't be sorry.

1336
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,615
- Do you know what
I'm so excited about?

1337
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,586
- What?
- You.

1338
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:05,815
- What do you mean?

1339
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,186
- I'm happy you've left her.

1340
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,850
I think that's what
I'm trying to say.

1341
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,223
- I think I'm happy too.

1342
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,125
- I've kind of missed seeing
your face like this.

1343
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,221
It's the first time I've seen
you look really happy

1344
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,255
in a long time.

1345
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,130
That's awesome.

1346
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,396
Despite the terrible pancakes.

1347
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,562
(laughs)

1348
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,696
- You do.
It's really lovely for me.

1349
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:27,039
I've missed you, you know,
seeing you.

1350
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,169
Fuck Pam.
- Fuck her.

1351
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,339
- Fuck Pam.

1352
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,643
- Fuck Pam.

1353
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,513
- Fuck Pam.
- Fuck Pam.

1354
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,382
Or don't fuck Pam.

1355
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,046
Fuck someone else now.

1356
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,518
You can do anything
you want now.

1357
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,617
That's the thing.

1358
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,820
It's really exciting.

1359
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,351
You can go traveling now.

1360
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,454
You're not stuck in...

1361
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,794
- I can.
I was thinking about that.

1362
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:49,856
- You can go to India.

1363
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,594
You can find yourself,
like Lenora.

1364
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,602
You can do whatever you want.

1365
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,762
You can have a baby now.

1366
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,271
(laughs)
A baby?

1367
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,399
- She's always wanted them.
She's always wanted them.

1368
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,772
- That's right where
my mind goes.

1369
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,674
Let me go have a baby now.

1370
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,236
- No, I've been thinking
about it, that she's...

1371
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,611
she's always wanted one
as well.

1372
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,411
She has actually always wanted
a baby.

1373
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,111
You should try.

1374
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,141
Now is your time.

1375
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,585
I mean, were you trying?

1376
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,987
Were you even trying?

1377
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,217
- Yeah, I mean, we had...

1378
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,885
you know, we'd been
talking about it.

1379
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,621
- She never wanted them,
though.

1380
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,628
- But she said she did.

1381
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,129
- Yeah, she said was gonna...

1382
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,564
she said she was gonna relent
at some point.

1383
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,465
And I don't think she ever
wanted them.

1384
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,630
And you have such
an opportunity now, you know?

1385
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,229
- Yeah.

1386
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,036
- Okay.
Are you embarrassed a bit?

1387
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,066
It's probably embarrassing,
in front of Jack.

1388
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,634
- No. No.
It's just... yeah.

1389
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,736
I mean...

1390
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,508
We just...
it wasn't on the table.

1391
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:39,947
At the end of the day,
it wasn't...

1392
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,783
uh, wasn't to be,
so moving on.

1393
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,980
- All right,
I'm just saying

1394
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,511
that there's
tons of stuff you can do.

1395
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,989
- Travel.

1396
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,083
- No, but you... there's...
don't change the subject.

1397
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,957
This is what you want.

1398
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,587
There's sperm donors.

1399
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,597
There's like...

1400
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,723
- Christ.
- Yeah.

1401
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:57,096
- It's expensive.

1402
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,567
- But what I'm saying now
is that there's, like...

1403
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,728
you can go online.

1404
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,032
There's sperm donors.

1405
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,504
There's sperm in the air.

1406
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,475
You just grab a dude
and preg yourself up.

1407
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,672
- That sounds horrible.

1408
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,701
(both laughing)

1409
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,180
- Pick a guy.
Any guy.

1410
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,843
It would just be one night,
and then you're done.

1411
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,250
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

1412
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,585
Would you like a refill?
- Mm-hmm.

1413
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,021
- Hannah, would you like
something?

1414
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,547
- Ah, yes.
Thank you.

1415
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,684
Refresh, please.

1416
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,852
- Coffee?
Okay.

1417
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,861
Good.

1418
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,055
I'll be right back.

1419
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,930
(whispers)
I need to talk to you.

1420
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,070
(mouthing words)

1421
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,768
(mouthing words)

1422
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,370
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay. Good.

1423
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,711
Um, we're going to go
for a walk, Jack-Jack.

1424
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,615
You're gonna stay here
and think about your life.

1425
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,085
Come on, Hannah.

1426
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,087
- I'm going for a walk.

1427
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,315
- Hey, hey.

1428
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,449
Hey, hey, quick.

1429
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:59,359
Um, just wanted to check in
with you real quick.

1430
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:02,831
So I don't know exactly
how to put this,

1431
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,494
but it definitely was
a little weird.

1432
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,060
I didn't know about you

1433
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,505
and your relationship to,
like, wanting a baby and stuff,

1434
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,031
which is great, obviously.

1435
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,668
But, in terms of, like,
the whole, like,

1436
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,680
"Oh, just grab a guy,
and there's sperm everywhere,"

1437
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,909
Like, it definitely made me
think for a sec.

1438
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,849
Our first night...

1439
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,682
I hate to even bring it up,
but I feel like I should just...

1440
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,245
- We used a condom.

1441
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,981
- That's true.

1442
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,015
Yeah, you're right.

1443
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,153
Sorry.

1444
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,220
Sorry.
Are we good?

1445
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,628
Okay, thanks.
Sorry about that.

1446
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:36,689
I didn't mean to...

1447
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,757
- See you later.

1448
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,767
- Backtrack.

1449
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,269
I just felt like
double-checking.

1450
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,568
Safety first.

1451
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,936
- Yeah, and the thought of it
is scary,

1452
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,376
and it's all
of those things.

1453
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,209
And if I'm gonna do it,

1454
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,112
I just feel like
I should just tell him.

1455
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,448
And I thought about it
all night.

1456
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,217
And we slept in the same
fucking bed, you know.

1457
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:03,248
And it's just the comfort
and the ease that we have.

1458
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,194
I just don't believe
that just evaporates.

1459
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,458
I hope, anyway.

1460
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,830
I just feel like I've got
to take this leap.

1461
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,598
And I was lying there
last night,

1462
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,969
and I couldn't
get to sleep.

1463
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,473
And he's snoring next to me,

1464
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,805
and I'm, like,
"Just tell him.

1465
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,968
Just fucking tell him."

1466
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,604
You know, I just...

1467
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,614
I just have to.
I think it's time.

1468
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,048
And I don't even know
what he's gonna think

1469
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,073
or what he's gonna say.

1470
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,178
I just feel like
I've got to stop

1471
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:35,349
feeling so passive about things,
you know?

1472
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,517
What's the matter?

1473
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,551
Why are you being so quiet?

1474
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,481
(scoffs quietly)

1475
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,482
- You don't think
I should do it?

1476
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,747
- No, I have
to tell you something.

1477
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:42,281
And I have to tell you something
before I tell you something.

1478
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,849
The first thing
that I'm gonna tell you,

1479
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,417
you're going to have
a big problem with.

1480
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,588
So I think I'm just
gonna tell you.

1481
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,824
- Okay.

1482
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:55,901
(sighs)

1483
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,813
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1484
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:05,871
Oh, my God.
Oh.

1485
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,793
(door slams)

1486
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,059
- Iris!

1487
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,732
- Jack!

1488
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,068
- Whoa, whoa.

1489
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,767
What's going on?
What's going on?

1490
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,366
- You fucked my sister.

1491
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,444
You fucked my sister!

1492
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,878
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1493
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,313
- Look, I'm so sorry.

1494
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,475
- You were here for one night.
She's a fucking lesbian.

1495
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:42,506
- It was a total mistake.

1496
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,019
You should never
have known about it.

1497
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,486
I'm so sorry,
but there's something

1498
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,886
much bigger at work here...
Hannah!

1499
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,788
- Iris, I'm so sorry.
- Tell her about the condom.

1500
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,190
Hannah, tell her
about the condom.

1501
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,091
- What's he talking about?
- Tell her.

1502
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,186
I found the condom!

1503
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,856
- What'd you do?

1504
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,330
Why were you looking
for the condom?

1505
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,423
What's going on?

1506
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,660
- Well, well, why?
You know why?

1507
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,396
Because she poked holes
in the condom.

1508
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,835
- Can you just shut up
for one second?

1509
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,236
- No, you poked holes
in the condom.

1510
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,466
It's a fucking rain shower!

1511
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,599
She tried to steal my sperm.

1512
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,006
- I didn't try to steal
your sperm.

1513
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,135
- Well, then, what was that?

1514
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,611
- Did you poke holes
in a condom, Hannah?

1515
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:11,943
- No.
Yes.

1516
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:12,970
- Why?

1517
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,040
- No, I was trying...

1518
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,346
I was trying to get pregnant.

1519
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,080
- With Jack?
- Yeah.

1520
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,246
- No.
Not with Jack.

1521
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,846
With someone.
- Oh, my God.

1522
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,017
- Jack, you didn't even...
you weren't even gonna know.

1523
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,219
- Oh, I wasn't going to know?

1524
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,784
- It was going
into a little plastic sack

1525
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,022
and get thrown
into the trash.

1526
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,030
- Exactly!

1527
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,190
Where sperm belongs

1528
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,029
so it doesn't become
a fucking baby

1529
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:32,329
that I don't know about!

1530
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,302
- Okay, so this...
let me just clear this up.

1531
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:40,799
You potentially could be
pregnant with his baby.

1532
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,640
Is that what...
is that what you're telling me?

1533
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:43,702
- I don't know.

1534
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,373
- Holy shit.
Holy shit.

1535
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,847
You had to pick him,
didn't you?

1536
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,578
You had go pick Jack.
- I didn't pick him.

1537
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,880
- All the guys.

1538
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,910
All of the guys,
and you had to go and pick him.

1539
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,751
- I wasn't trying to pick him.
I was just...

1540
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,256
- Why?
Why did it have to be him?

1541
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,191
- I didn't know you were
in love with him!

1542
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,157
How could I know you were
in love with him?

1543
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,901
I would never have done that.

1544
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,528
I don't want to hurt you.

1545
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,402
I didn't know.

1546
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,471
(whispers)
What are you doing?

1547
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,999
- I don't know.

1548
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:18,013
I just wanted a baby.

1549
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,571
I'm sorry.

1550
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,015
(whispers)
Fuck.

1551
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,450
(whispers)
I fucked up.

1552
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,010
- Fuck.

1553
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,485
(exhales sharply)

1554
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:44,896
I am a really bad person.

1555
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:58,643
(door slams)

1556
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,648
(water lapping)

1557
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,427
(owl hooting)

1558
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,105
(knocking at door)

1559
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,982
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

1560
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:32,010
- No.

1561
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,545
I don't want to talk to you,
Jack.

1562
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,016
(sighs)

1563
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,893
- Hey, hey.

1564
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,994
- I really think your face
is going to annoy me right now.

1565
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,502
I don't want to talk to you.

1566
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,504
- My face always annoys you.

1567
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,699
(sighs)

1568
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,309
- I'm so sorry.

1569
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,613
- Why did you do that?

1570
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:14,657
Did you not think that
that would be weird for me?

1571
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,597
Did you not think that, like,

1572
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:22,036
even if I hadn't found out
that that would be weird thing,

1573
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:26,974
that you'd have to carry that
and still be friends with me?

1574
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,637
- It's weird.

1575
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,669
It's definitely weird.

1576
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:39,245
But it's, like, I...

1577
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,621
I slept with your sister,

1578
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:48,221
and you slept with my brother.

1579
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,391
And I don't know.

1580
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,868
I don't even...

1581
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,170
This is just
so confusing.

1582
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:03,303
There's a lot happening
right now.

1583
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:06,576
But I can't...

1584
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:10,176
I can't come between you
and your sister, okay?

1585
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,312
That is not something
I can ever do.

1586
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:16,791
- I can't even think about her
right now.

1587
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,784
- She...

1588
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:23,026
- I don't want anything to do
with her right now, okay?

1589
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,901
- I just know I saw her
when you left the room,

1590
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:34,240
and she loves you,

1591
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,470
and she's sorry.

1592
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:43,042
You can never understand
how important

1593
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:48,455
the bond is that you have
with your sister.

1594
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,585
You will never understand
the way I do.

1595
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:59,324
I could never live with myself
if I knew, in some way,

1596
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:03,771
I might be coming between you
or the cause of any of that.

1597
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,134
And what I did was a mistake,

1598
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:13,809
and it's the worst fucking
mistake I have ever made.

1599
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,314
But I didn't...

1600
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:26,353
Oh, fuck.

1601
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,387
(sobs)

1602
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,074
I didn't sleep with your sister

1603
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,804
'cause I wanted to sleep
with your sister.

1604
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,142
I slept with your sister

1605
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,581
because I can't be with you.

1606
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,258
I have to go.

1607
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,160
- Where are you going?

1608
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,724
- I don't know.

1609
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,566
- You gonna come back?

1610
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,415
(door slams)

1611
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:33,257
(sighs)

1612
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:36,287
(water lapping)

1613
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,208
(door slams)

1614
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,663
I made some potatoes
if you want some.

1615
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,242
(sighing)

1616
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,357
(sighs)

1617
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,824
(sighs)

1618
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,474
- Iris?

1619
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,006
- Yeah?

1620
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,876
- I'm sorry.

1621
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,356
(water lapping)

1622
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,502
- Morning.

1623
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,275
(both laughing and chattering)

1624
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,832
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do,

1625
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:55,900
you know, if there's a baby?

1626
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,485
- Not really.

1627
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:17,897
- 'Cause I was just thinking

1628
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:21,994
that I wouldn't want you to...

1629
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:25,006
feel alone,

1630
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,737
you know?

1631
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:32,406
And if you wanted any help

1632
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:37,180
that that would be
something I could do.

1633
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:47,188
You know that I could help you
raise the baby.

1634
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,802
I have a spare room.

1635
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:04,076
- Are you sure that's what
you'd be up for,

1636
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:05,636
want to do,

1637
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,115
could bite off?

1638
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,916
I don't know.

1639
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,854
- Yeah, I think it is.

1640
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,028
I could do the 3:00 a.m. feed,
you know?

1641
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,089
I don't know.

1642
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,659
I've just been thinking
about it.

1643
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,264
It's whatever you want.

1644
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,040
- I think I'd like that.

1645
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,104
- Yeah?

1646
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,136
- Yeah.

1647
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,384
Thanks,

1648
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,289
just, you know,
for the offer, even,

1649
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,055
even if there is no baby.

1650
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,488
- It's okay.

1651
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,185
- Warm up?

1652
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:23,717
- Yeah.

1653
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,953
I'm sorry.

1654
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,759
- It's okay.

1655
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,495
(kids chattering)

1656
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,869
(kids laughing and chattering)

1657
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:57,653
- Here comes
the milk police car.

1658
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,820
- Here comes
the milk race car.

1659
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,854
(imitating sirens)

1660
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:10,269
- Whoever has the Sun,
turn it on!

1661
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,905
(chain rattling)

1662
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,115
- Fuck.

1663
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:58,886
(chain rattling)

1664
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,978
Fuck!

1665
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,985
Fuck you.

1666
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,887
Fuck you.

1667
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,361
Fuck you!

1668
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,923
Fuck you!

1669
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,710
(grunts)

1670
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,296
- I think if you see
two together, it's good luck.

1671
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,457
- The crows?

1672
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:21,629
- Yeah, and one
is a spirit guide.

1673
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,195
(both laughing)

1674
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,545
- Hi.

1675
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,411
- Hi.

1676
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:41,479
Hi.

1677
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,356
I have something I want to say
to you guys, okay?

1678
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,322
I'm unemployed,

1679
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,061
and I'm financially unstable,

1680
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:59,233
and I am emotionally, at best,
precarious,

1681
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,435
at worst, a cripple.

1682
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,879
And I'm not in a place
in my life

1683
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:10,248
to be any sort
of father figure, potentially.

1684
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,618
And I'm certainly,
as your best friend,

1685
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,250
no one I would recommend
as a boyfriend.

1686
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,891
And that sucks,

1687
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:26,492
because you...

1688
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,367
might be carrying my baby,

1689
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:34,740
and I'm in love
with your sister.

1690
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,910
But...

1691
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:50,924
I'm tired of being dead,

1692
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,927
and I want
to come back to life.

1693
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:59,628
So if there, you know,
is a baby in there,

1694
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:04,297
you absolutely
should have that.

1695
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:08,867
And I would love to help
if you want me...

1696
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,435
not pushy, just available,

1697
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:15,313
be it friend or uncle
or dad-ish,

1698
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,511
on some level.

1699
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:22,046
And you.

1700
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:29,061
I don't deserve you.

1701
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:32,760
But I would give you

1702
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:36,430
every fucking thing
that I have.

1703
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:44,102
And if you guys would consider
having me,

1704
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,080
I'm asking for a shot.

1705
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,183
(laughs)

1706
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,329
- I love you.

1707
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,126
- And I love you.

1708
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,558
- Come here.

1709
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,570
Come on.
- Come on.

1710
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:11,094
- Come on.
Don't be silly.

1711
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,572
Come here, sperm stealer.

1712
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,599
(laughter)

1713
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,134
(clock ticking)

1714
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,579
(sighs)

1715
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:00,782
(chuckles)

1716
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,880
(alarm rings)

1717
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:03,788
- Okay.
- Okay.

1718
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,191
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

1719
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,355
(sighs)

1720
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:25,212
