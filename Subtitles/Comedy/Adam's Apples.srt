00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
ADAM'S APPLES

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,960
Adam?
Sorry I'm late.

3
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,100
Ivan Fjeldsted.
Call me Ivan.

4
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,193
I'm a bit flustered but I've
been looking forward to meeting you.

5
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,760
Let's get going.

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,293
Let me take your bag.

7
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,316
That was...
Come on.

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
People who have been in prison are
often a bit protective of their stuff.

9
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Have you lived
in the country before?

10
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:44,291
This is our small church.
Just take a look at this.

11
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:50,284
This is our apple tree.
We're very proud of it.

12
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:54,714
There are lots of apples this year.
Lots and lots.

13
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:58,412
It's probably because of
the warm summer.

14
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,555
They're not ripe just yet.
Don't eat that. Come with me.

15
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:23,428
Adam will stay with us.
This is Khalid and Gunnar.

17
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:25,032
I won't talk to the egghead.

18
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,727
Don't worry,
there will be lots of time for talk.

19
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,047
Come on, Adam.

20
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,349
What does the O stand for?
In Adam O. Pedersen?

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,802
What's the story about the O?
Your parents must have told you.

22
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,519
- I forgot to ask.
- That's a good answer.

23
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,463
It says here
that you're a neo-Nazi.

24
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,741
Are you really?

25
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,657
It's not the first thing that springs
to mind by looking at you.

26
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,978
Here it says you're EVIL. What a
rude thing to write on a person's CV.

27
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:12,689
Are you really evil?

28
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,940
I didn't think so. I'll tell you what,
let's just forget about this.

29
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:19,081
There are no evil people.
We don't believe in that.

30
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:26,491
If you only search for evil
then the whole world appears evil.

31
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,624
But you can try to focus on
the silver lining, as we do here.

32
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
That makes everything easier.

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
In recent years, the Devil
has sent his minions to test us -

34
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:42,091
but we have conquered them all.

35
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:46,372
All of us here have
found God in some way.

36
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,214
You just met Khalid and Gunnar.
I saw that you did.

37
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,652
Gunnar was paroled
four years ago.

38
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,433
He was only required to stay for three months,
but he chose to remain.

39
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:02,298
Gunnar was
what you would call an alcoholic.

40
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:06,720
He was a thief and a rapist
but now he's cleaned himself up

41
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:12,939
and is studying theology. He's not
the only one. There's also Khalid.

42
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,138
He used to rob gas stations.

43
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:22,592
Do you remember the young man who got
shot when he went to buy condoms?

44
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:28,506
- No.
- Khalid is still not allowed in any Statoil stations.

45
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:32,042
Yes, there were a few hostage mishaps,
but now he's learning Danish and doing much better.

46
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:37,794
Tell me what I have to do.

47
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,260
I can't do that. You have
to discover that for yourself.

48
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:46,476
All I want is for you
to set yourself a goal.

49
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:50,468
Are you listening to me?

50
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,617
Yes, I believe I am.

51
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:57,080
In any other situation
I would say that you are rude -

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,900
- but let's not talk about that now.
What do you want your goal to be?

53
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,124
I would like to bake a pie.

54
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,015
Bake a pie?

55
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:15,718
Oh, an apple pie?

56
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,251
Yes, an apple pie.

57
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,856
- My goal is to bake a big apple pie.
- With the apples from our garden?

58
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:28,560
- Yes, the apples from the garden.
- That's a good idea.

59
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:32,442
I think we found your goal.
You're going to bake a pie.

60
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:37,630
You'll look after the tree
until the first of August.

61
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:42,863
Then you'll use the apples
to bake an apple pie.

62
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:28,748
I just wanted to give you this. It has
both the old and the new testament.

63
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,279
It's a good thing to have.
Sleep tight.

64
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,556
Evil has many faces -

65
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:08,048
- and it can be difficult to tell
them apart and choose sides.

66
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:13,841
Especially these days where so many
things are said in this and that town.

67
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,348
Everything has so many nuances.
We are all human.

68
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,252
If the game of chess had undergone
the same development as humans -

69
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,782
- the queen would be in front,
the rooks would be crooked -

70
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:33,751
- and the pawn
would be the main piece.

71
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:38,952
We no longer know
who we are and this rootlessness--

72
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,632
Are we boring you, Poul?

73
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:48,265
Is the word of God boring to you?

74
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,742
- Are we boring you?
- I need to go to the loo.

75
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,304
- Can't it wait?
- Not really.

76
00:08:56,512 --> 00:09:00,023
We finish in 20 minutes.

77
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,933
- I think that Poul can wait that long.
- Let him go for fuck's sake.

78
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:06,341
- We can sing now.

79
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,435
- Okay, democracy has spoken.

80
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,279
Go, Poul.
Go take a crap.

81
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,540
- But you can't come back in.

82
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,798
- That's okay.

83
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,798
You have to use the hospital loo
because you can't use ours.

84
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:29,541
- Why not?
- It's locked during the service.

85
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,588
- Why?
- For security reasons.

86
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Let's continue
if it's okay with Poul.

87
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,349
We'll sing 634
"You know my heart".

88
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,463
There's fried pork.

89
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,619
It was a good sermon today.
At least it was shorter than usual.

90
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,405
Too bad for old Poul Nordkap.

91
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,039
Ivan is always on his case.

92
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,945
He leaves during the sermons.

93
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,598
It's not nice of him.
He always does that.

94
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:26,651
It's because he was in
a concentration camp during the war.

95
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,318
He's become restless in his old age.

96
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,718
He's 86.

97
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:37,232
It won't be any fun
when I get that old.

98
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,260
Don't worry about Ivan.

99
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,522
He's okay. Just don't venture
into an argument with him.

100
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,400
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?

101
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,580
- My phone!
- I thought you were sleeping.

102
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,933
And my wallet! Are you stealing
my stuff? Have you gone insane?

103
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,722
- I'm sorry.
- Piss off, fatso!

104
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
- Sleep tight.
- Piss off!

105
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,334
BOOK OF JOB

106
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:04,529
- They're not moving.
- Fucking cheeky bastards.

107
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,607
Fly home, for fuck's sake!

108
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,420
What are we going to do?

109
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:14,778
There won't be
any apples left for your pie.

110
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,098
Let the Paki monkey climb up
and shoo them away.

111
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:22,434
- I'm not talking to you.
- I don't know anything about birds.

112
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:26,353
What do we do
in a case like this?

113
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:34,655
You leave them alone, I think.

114
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:41,053
- Can't we let them eat the apples?
- They're Adam's apples for the pie.

115
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:45,234
- For fuck's sake, he can't bake.
- You don't know that.

116
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:50,648
If Adam wants to bake us a pie
it's our job to support him.

117
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:53,773
- He can't bake shit.
- Shut up!

118
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:58,060
- I can tell.
- What the fuck do you know, Paki?

119
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:03,351
That's the right attitude. That kind
of attitude will get us some pie.

120
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,370
- There's more of them coming.
- That's just plain rude.

121
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,372
That's good.
Very authentic.

122
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:41,200
- No bird will come back now.
- Reverend Fjeldsted?

123
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,741
Yes?
Call me Ivan.

124
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:48,480
- I'm Sarah Svendsen.
- Hi. This is my assistant Adam.

125
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:54,232
I'm not from around here. I wanted
to come to the service but I couldn't.

126
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:58,310
Don't apologize.
You only belittle yourself.

127
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:01,536
What's this?
You don't look so good.

128
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,590
Let's go inside and talk.

129
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,189
- I met this guy.
- The milk has gone bad.

130
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:12,611
- Fine.
- I was thinking about her.

131
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,431
- Me too.
- No, you weren't.

132
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:20,117
Are you saying I wasn't?
Are you?

133
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:26,980
Let's have this discussion right now.
This may be the right time and place.

134
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:33,150
John says: "He came to Canaan
after having turned water into wine. "

135
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:39,111
"A boy was sick. Jesus said: Do unto
others as you would have them do unto you. "

136
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,090
Don't call me inconsiderate.

137
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,404
It's okay.

138
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:48,383
- I don't like milk.
- Maybe we have some cookies.

139
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Adam, could you go see if there's
a few cookies for Sarah and me?

140
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,198
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

141
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:01,784
No, no, no.

142
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,260
- So you met a guy?
- Yeah.

143
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:09,331
I have been in Indonesia working for
the World Wildlife Federation.

144
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:14,680
I made love to a man
and got pregnant.

145
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:17,610
I used to drink a lot before.

146
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:22,188
Now I'm in AA
and I've been sober for 341 days.

147
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,949
Now they're saying that
the baby may be handicapped.

148
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:33,949
- I don't know where the dad is...

149
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,831
- Just a second, Sarah.

150
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,921
Why do I get three cookies and Sarah
only two? Don't you find that odd?

151
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,121
There were five left.
Hers looked bigger.

152
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:53,640
I don't think so.

153
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:54,297
Why?

154
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,570
Did you measure the cookies?

155
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,390
What?

156
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:59,218
Right. Who measures cookies?

157
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:03,086
Alright, let's stop this discussion.

158
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,858
- You would like to get rid of the baby?
- Yes... No!

159
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:14,321
There's a 60% chance
that the baby will be handicapped.

160
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,305
I have to decide within a week
whether or not to keep it.

161
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,334
I can't handle
a handicapped child.

162
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,653
60 percent is high, right?

163
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,819
It's just statistics.
Let me tell you something.

164
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:40,928
When we were expecting our son we
were told that he could be disabled.

165
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:44,668
We could have been intimidated
by the statistics

166
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,688
- but we chose to look
on the bright side, and now...

167
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:55,599
When I see him run around in the
garden or doing his math homework -

168
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:58,935
- we're happy that
we chose to have him.

169
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:02,138
You won't find anyone
to say otherwise.

170
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:08,249
The Devil is testing us all the time.
We have to make the right choices.

171
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:13,374
If we all listened to reason, the
world would be a gloomy place to live.

172
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:19,742
You need to follow your heart
and have the baby.

173
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,731
- Fuck!
- Good morning.

174
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,509
Fuck, that hurt!

175
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:49,811
Why the hell didn't you
turn off the stove!?

176
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,466
This looks bad.

177
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,507
What did reverend Fjeldsted say?

178
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,578
He's a frigging idiot.

179
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:09,781
He may be weird,
but he's a good lad.

180
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:16,632
His life sure as shit hasn't been easy.
Everything went wrong from the start.

181
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:21,238
His mother died
giving birth to him.

182
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:26,495
He lived with his father and sister.

183
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,989
Until they took him away.

184
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,240
Ivan? They took Ivan away?

185
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:36,927
No, nobody took Ivan away.
The father was taken away.

186
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,763
Henning.

187
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:40,740
Why?

188
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:47,820
He beat those kids black
and blue. They could hardly walk.

189
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:53,174
- Shut up and fix this.
- Pardon me for being blunt.

190
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,370
I've learned
it's best to tell it like it is.

191
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
We're all best served
by being told the truth.

192
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,724
Adam?

193
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:11,583
What's this I hear?
Burned by the stove?

194
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,376
- Gunnar forgot to turn it of.
- Take a seat. I'd like to talk to you.

195
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:25,094
Do you know why
all this is happening?

196
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:29,849
Why are all these birds in the tree?

197
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,605
And the stove. Why did you
burn yourself all of the sudden?

198
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:40,471
I think someone is trying to tell you
that you shouldn't go near the stove.

199
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,247
You can't bake
a pie without a stove.

200
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:49,961
I think Satan is testing us.

201
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,469
By not letting me bake the pie?

202
00:21:54,292 --> 00:22:00,058
He's trying to fight us. He's testing
your strength to withstand him.

203
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:04,837
He's always doing it to me.
Look at your hand.

204
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:08,813
You're a complete moron.
Nobody is doing anything.

205
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,860
- Gunnar just forgot to turn it off.
- He always makes sure to turn it off.

206
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
- That fat pig is always hammered!
- Fat and drunk!

207
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:24,892
So many accusations,
but there may be an explanation.

208
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:30,563
You should know that in his youth,
he was the top-ranked Danish tennis player.

209
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:37,102
He won all his matches but then,
one match, a ball was mistakenly called out.

210
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:40,881
Gunnar lost
and everything went downhill.

211
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:44,109
What about Khalid?

212
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,062
This was in his coat pocket.

213
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:52,367
- What are you saying?
- Those two haven't changed.

214
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:56,060
- You're a joke.
- Should we forbid people to wear hats?

215
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:59,622
It's a balaclava, and this is summer.

216
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,544
Khalid is from a hot climate.

217
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,704
- Here's fucking 17,000 in cash.

218
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,517
You're reaching, Adam.

219
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:14,002
Khalid is saving to buy new clothes.
You didn't know.

220
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:22,571
Give me my phone and my wallet
or I'll smash your face in.

221
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,457
That's not fucking mine!

222
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,724
Stay away from my stuff.
Do you understand?

223
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:42,269
You're lucky that I'm going back in
because I would beat you every day.

224
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:49,417
- I'm going to the emergency room,
- Will you pass the market?

225
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:53,433
- I might.
- Could you get me some cough syrup?

226
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:57,372
- Sure, what brand?
- Von Osten.

227
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:03,729
Right. Think about what we can
do concerning the birds, if you have time.

228
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:20,458
Here you go. It can't be traced
but throw it away anyway.

229
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:25,762
Can you shoot with that hand?
Are you going to whack the priest?

230
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:29,994
He's fucked up.
He got it in the ass as a kid.

231
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:33,893
- Now he's all "turn the other cheek."
- You're getting out in 11 weeks.

232
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:38,557
We're all waiting for you.
Espen can't control the guys.

233
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:42,781
- I'm not going to shoot the priest.
- I just want to understand him.

234
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,867
I need to break him.
All that goodness shit.

235
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:52,857
Does it involve the pear pie?
Espen says you talk about a pie.

236
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:56,389
It's an apple pie, okay?
It doesn't matter.

237
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,967
I said that I would bake a pie
and the idiot won't let up.

238
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,678
He says that the Devil is testing us

239
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:07,131
because birds are eating the apples.

240
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,677
Do you need help?

241
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,161
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

242
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
See you.

243
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:52,177
Go on.
Get them!

244
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,896
Don't be afraid.
Go on. Get them.

245
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:58,462
He's making them nervous.

246
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:03,283
- They don't fucking care about the fucking cat.

247
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:07,167
- They're looking right at him.
- Yes. Lambert is not working.

248
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,511
My granddad
had a cherry tree.

249
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:15,212
It was attacked by birds, so he shot
a few in the morning and evening.

250
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,133
Shot them?
With a gun?

251
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,954
No, a waffle iron.

252
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,633
Of course it was a gun.
What gun?

253
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,978
One like this.

254
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,509
You know what?

255
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:36,344
I think that we should try it.
Can you take them from there?

256
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:41,927
We can use guns?
For fuck's sake, why didn't you say so?

257
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:50,142
- Well...
- Lambert?

258
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,057
Lambert, are you okay?

259
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,590
What just happened?

260
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:03,406
He's dead.

261
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:07,148
- It was a shitty cat anyhow.
- He shot my cat.

262
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:10,442
Let's stop with the accusations.
It was an old cat.

263
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:15,146
He just happened to fall down
while we were shooting.

264
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,420
If you want
to discuss it now we can.

265
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Okay.

266
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,517
We talked about your grandfather.
Do you know what I think?

267
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
I think
it's going to be a good day.

268
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:48,369
It's too bad that Khalid won't come in
when we're making his favorite food.

269
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,124
- He's embarrassed about Lambert.
- Where did he get the gun?

270
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,297
- Is he a terrorist?
- He wants to return to Saudi Arabia.

271
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:01,860
You should see his dream house.
It's really nice.

272
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:05,539
With a little more money from
a few more Statoil stations, he can finally go home.

273
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:11,187
- Why not just rob a bank?
- Khalid is very committed to politics.

274
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,351
He only robs multinational companies.
That's why he robs Statoil stations.

275
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:22,428
Statoil stole his father's land for the
oil. Khalid is taking back his property.

276
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:25,943
- Statoil is Norwegian.
- No, I don't think so.

277
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:31,138
- Statoil is Norwegian!
- Remember to tell Khalid that.

278
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,581
- So Ivan knows what he's doing?
- Yes. Ivan just wants him to be calm.

279
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:38,312
Ivan is not exactly normal.

280
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,527
The anniversary
of his wife's death is coming up.

281
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,657
- He had a wife?
- Yes, Linda.

282
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,649
She took some pills and killed herself
because they had a handicapped son.

283
00:29:54,676 --> 00:30:00,751
He's got cerebral palsy. He can't
move at all. She couldn't take that.

284
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:09,619
Can I come in?

285
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:15,560
Adam, there sure is no shortage of
recipes for apple pie in this world.

286
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:29,678
It looks like we've
won round one.

287
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:41,060
What a handsome man. Your father?

288
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:41,951
That's Hitler.

289
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,779
No.

290
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,302
Hitler had a beard.

291
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:53,196
Ah, you're right. I'm thinking of that
Russian guy. Very well..

292
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:58,893
Hitler's enemies didn't
take him seriously either.

293
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:03,721
Don't you think that I do?
That's just plain rude.

294
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:11,343
Old Paul Nordkap--in the
hospital with no will to live -

295
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,624
- he was a bigger Nazi than anyone.

296
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:17,866
Why do you think
they ask me to cheer him up?

297
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,713
Wasn't he in a camp?

298
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:28,119
Sure. He was working there.
He met Goblins and all those folks.

299
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:31,158
- Goebbels?
- He was probably there as well.

300
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:36,541
Come with me to visit. Then we
can see who takes who seriously.

301
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:38,487
Deal?

302
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,400
BOOK OF JOB

303
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,650
Hello!
I'm glad that you could make it.

304
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,580
He's dying. He won't last through
the night. I broke it to him gently.

305
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,232
Well,
let's give him a good sendoff.

306
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,691
- How's the hand?
- Okay.

307
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:49,645
What about the honker, Ivan?
It took quite a beating.

308
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:54,379
You don't have to waste
money on perfume anymore, Ivan.

309
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:58,742
You won't smell anything again.

310
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:01,072
Yes.
Come on, Adam.

311
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:08,383
What's up with you, Poul?
Have you lost your appetite?

312
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,422
 I've brought a guest for you.

313
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,813
- Hello. Adam Pedersen.

314
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:19,138
- Are you feeling a bit low?
- I'm scared.

315
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,123
Relax.
What have you been up to?

316
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:28,669
- Have the nurses been nicer to you?
- Don't make them. I don't deserve it.

317
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:32,783
They have been nagging Poul because
of this past but we put a stop to that.

318
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Didn't we, Poul?

319
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,493
Has Miriam been nicer to you?

320
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:44,396
Yes, she made me hot chocolate
yesterday and tucked me in.

321
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:50,224
- They are all so nice to me.
- That's good. Don't be upset.

322
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:55,841
- I don't deserve it. Let me be.
- Everybody deserves to be tucked in.

323
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:59,825
- Did she fluff your duvet and pillow?
- Yes.

324
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,900
There, there.

325
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,022
I apologize for
trying to skip your sermons.

326
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:12,576
I just don't like
being inside the church.

327
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:15,153
- That's all forgotten now.
- I know that's what you always say.

328
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:23,216
I'm scared, Ivan.
I dare not sleep. I'm so afraid.

329
00:34:23,356 --> 00:34:26,149
Bah!
You have nothing to worry about.

330
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:33,633
Let's focus on the people who care
for you and all your lovely memories.

331
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,840
Oh God!

332
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:43,105
Poul, don't cry anymore.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

333
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:46,581
All has been forgiven.

334
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:51,830
If you only knew what we did...
All those poor people.

335
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,634
- It can't be forgiven.
- Stop it. Nobody remembers anymore.

336
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:00,354
Oh God!

337
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,667
Stop your whining.
It's not all that bad!

338
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,700
We all make mistakes
but we don't let them bring us down.

339
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,664
You're...crazy...

340
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,757
Why do you say that? Why spoil
the mood by being rude?

341
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:26,585
I'd be happy to discuss it,
but this is not the place.

342
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:29,687
Let's focus on the word of God.

343
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,885
God forgives all, Poul.
God forgives all.

344
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:49,729
It's always difficult.

345
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:54,969
Even though I've seen it before
it's still difficult every time.

346
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:08,170
- Did you discuss your wife's death?
- Yes, I talked to a lot of people.

347
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:15,041
- A wife's suicide must be painful.
- Yes, it can't be nice.

348
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,345
- Linda didn't take her own life.
- But she took pills?

349
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:23,468
Yes, but it was an accident.

350
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:26,939
Accident how?

351
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:33,135
Christoffer had been playing with her
pills and had put them in a candy dish.

352
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:38,994
Linda always had a sweet tooth and
she thought they were yellow M&Ms.

353
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,900
Your son Christoffer?

354
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:48,462
- So he's actually able to move?
- Why wouldn't he be?

355
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:53,003
- I thought he was paralyzed.
- No, I wish.

356
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:57,276
There's no slowing him down. Just
yesterday he was playing rounders.

357
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:02,171
I don't believe you, Ivan.

358
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:17,410
- I just don't.
- I've never heard anything that crazy.

359
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:22,721
Has Gunnar tbeen telling tall stories and
playing fast and loose with the truth?

360
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:26,846
If he has
that's just plain rude.

361
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:33,105
Why don't you bring your son tomorrow?

362
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,104
He's already coming. He's been
pestering me all week to come.

363
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,565
Good.

364
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:42,221
Then you can see for yourself.

365
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:03,054
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

366
00:38:10,098 --> 00:38:12,798
Christoffer, this is Adam.
Adam, Christoffer.

367
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,056
Maybe you could go say hello.
Yum, eggs.

368
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,244
Small mouthfuls.

369
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,722
He's paralyzed.

370
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:48,855
What did you say?

371
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:52,670
- I have to go in tower.
- You two stay here.

372
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:54,915
- I need to shoot more crows.
- Sit down.

373
00:38:59,059 --> 00:38:59,993
He's paralyzed.

374
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:05,863
Christoffer,
go into daddy's office. Now!

375
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,518
This will not be pleasant to watch.
What did you say?

376
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:21,026
He's paralyzed.
Isn't he paralyzed, Ivan?

377
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,985
Is he really, Adam?

378
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:27,220
Yes, he has cerebral palsy.

379
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:32,877
That is just crazy.
Khalid, what do you have to say?

380
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,034
Khalid?

381
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,111
He does.

382
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:44,483
Ivan, he's paralyzed.

383
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:52,194
Your son's a retard.
Your wife killed herself.

384
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,235
Your mother died giving birth to you.
Your dad raped you.

385
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,485
Look at me, Ivan.
Look at me.

386
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:13,953
You're bleeding from the ear. You're
bleeding from the ear, for fuck's sake!

387
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:15,173
The other one!

388
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,700
- Ivan was bleeding from an ear.
- That happened to me once.

389
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,684
Just drink milk.
Plenty of milk.

390
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,431
Just give up, Ivan.

391
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,384
Adam.

392
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,003
There's something
you should know.

393
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:51,334
Christoffer is recovering from
a very nasty bout of the flu.

394
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:54,248
I'm the first to admit that
he's been a bit sluggish lately.

395
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,685
- Shut the fuck up!
- If one hurts you, turn the other cheek.

396
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,728
God is on my side.

397
00:42:45,622 --> 00:42:48,461
What is his problem?
He needs to be locked up!

398
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:53,055
I'm not one to gossip -

399
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:56,867
- but he's always been
considered a phenomenon.

400
00:42:56,898 --> 00:43:00,453
- I don't know if you don't.
- How the hell should I know?

401
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,061
- He's sick. Very sick.
- I bloody well know that.

402
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,795
No, not like that.
Well, he is that, too -

403
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:12,694
but...

404
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:16,398
he's terminally ill.

405
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,086
- What's wrong with him?
- Cancer.

406
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:25,125
He has a brain tumor
the size of a volleyball.

407
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:30,125
I've never seen anyone
with such a large brain tumor.

408
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:33,688
I'll bash your face in
if you call him a walking miracle.

409
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:36,592
Have you heard about
the Ravashi syndrome?

410
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,412
Ravashi was
an Indian footballer -

411
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:44,555
- who lost both his feet
in a go-kart accident in 1957.

412
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:52,344
In a state of shock over the accident
he ran home on the stumps of his legs.

413
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:56,828
His brain blocked the fact
that he had no feet.

414
00:43:57,144 --> 00:43:59,948
For two months
he came to practice.

415
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:05,229
- He kept his midfield position.
- Without feet?

416
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:10,749
They were a bad team.
They were maybe in the fifth league.

417
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,464
Ivan has experienced
so much hardship -

418
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,136
- that he needs to find an
explanation in order to live with it.

419
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:26,079
That's why he thinks that
the Devil has it in for him.

420
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,071
Ivan would say that
everything is a test.

421
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,625
You're a test, his cancer is a test,
his son's handicap is a test.

422
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,777
In Ivan's mind he's locked in
fierce battle with the Devil himself.

423
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:48,050
Ivan has no mind to lose and he
blocks out everything like Ravashi.

424
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:55,182
He's in denial about all the bad stuff.
Death, mutilation, hardship, evil.

425
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:57,940
That simply
doesn't exist in Ivan's world.

426
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,741
Why does he bleed from his ears?

427
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:10,633
We have asked ourselves that. I think
it's when something comes too close.

428
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:17,015
Someone once got through to him.
He bled from his ears once before.

429
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,500
That was three years ago.

430
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:25,426
- What happened?
- You don't know his sister Katinka.

431
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,965
An utter whore.
She fucked everybody.

432
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,901
I even fucked her when she was
here to have her tonsils removed.

433
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,667
When she died
Ivan almost fell to pieces.

434
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:42,104
He bled from his ears
and got sick.

435
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,997
- What happened then?
- You know Ivan.

436
00:45:48,505 --> 00:45:51,395
A few days later
he was jolly as ever.

437
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:56,313
You could simply kill him by
making him understand the truth?

438
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:59,368
Yes, in theory.

439
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:19,665
Give up, Adam.

440
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:24,302
God is on my side.
Never forget that.

441
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,030
Hi.
The stove is broken.

442
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,959
- I wanted to make Christoffer a pizza.
- Let's fix it.

443
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:42,901
- I don't know how.
- We'll get by.

444
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:46,113
- Where did Christoffer go?
- He's in your office with a woman.

445
00:46:47,121 --> 00:46:53,737
She's quite upset. Her name is Sarah
and she's a real hottie.

446
00:46:54,973 --> 00:47:00,439
When she saw Christoffer she started
screaming. She didn't want coffee.

447
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:03,712
Well, we'd better...

448
00:47:09,145 --> 00:47:10,945
So nice of you to visit again.

449
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,596
- Has he been good?
- Tell me he isn't yours.

450
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:20,844
I can't because this is Christoffer.
Have you two been introduced?

451
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:24,653
How can you say the things you did?

452
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:27,434
What kind of things?

453
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:33,031
You said that nothing was wrong
with him. That he could do math.

454
00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:36,961
Yes, he can.
Even the complicated kind.

455
00:47:43,504 --> 00:47:47,889
Adam, maybe you should go get
some of the cookies that Sarah likes.

456
00:48:11,074 --> 00:48:12,788
I'll come too.

457
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:19,635
Is anyone hungry?

458
00:48:39,402 --> 00:48:43,705
You can hook up the new stove now.
We'll see if this one lasts a bit longer than the last.

459
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,738
- What are you doing?
- Playing a drinking game with coins.

460
00:48:46,848 --> 00:48:51,786
- Gunnar is good.
- But you're pregnant.

461
00:48:51,832 --> 00:48:56,153
- It's a bit late for that.
- We're rewriting an article.

462
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:59,213
- About what?
- The tigers in the Orient.

463
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,025
Here it says that
there's only 400 left.

464
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,564
It won't be long before they're extinct.

465
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:12,215
- Like the last round at the pub.
- What do you do then, Gunnar?

466
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:16,641
- You buy a pint and a chaser.
- The fuck you do!

467
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:21,149
Gunnar is right.
We have to do something.

468
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,476
- Shut up, man!
- Stay out of it.

469
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,779
Yes, Adam, stop disturbing us.
We're busy.

470
00:49:29,957 --> 00:49:34,917
- Five tigers die every day.
- Six! Six tigers a day, Adam.

471
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,683
They can really
jump high, those tigers.

472
00:50:05,098 --> 00:50:08,098
I'll come right out and say it.
You better come with me.

473
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,244
What now?

474
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:13,798
There's a new apple problem.
Meet me in five minutes by the tree?

475
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:25,516
I don't understand.
I see nothing but worms.

476
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:30,279
Yeah, I found them,
but I don't deserve any credit.

477
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:32,732
For fuck's sake,
they're in all the fruit.

478
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:34,881
That's just plain rude.

479
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:40,951
Yes, Adam,
it never stops.

480
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:48,715
Let's do something about it. Take
down the sick fruit and spray the rest.

481
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:53,410
Gunnar, come with me. We have
to arrange Poul's return to God.

482
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,900
BOOK OF JOB

483
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:25,367
Poul Baegel Hermann, known to
friend and foe as Poul Nordkap -

484
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,491
- lived a long and full life.

485
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:33,848
In his life Poul learned that to know
God you must dance with the Devil.

486
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:37,287
If anything, Poul Nordkap surely did that.

487
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:41,482
Poul learned that it's futile
to fight Good because -

488
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:45,768
- despite all the pain and suffering
he caused in his youth -

489
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:51,610
- he realized in the end that
this was just a mere moment.

490
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:55,841
The ocean heaved
but it was a wasted effort.

491
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,980
The world continued
and Good prevailed as always.

492
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,674
That's why Poul can return
to God with peace of mind.

493
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:12,640
Adam and I were by his side
when he passed quietly away.

494
00:54:13,612 --> 00:54:17,997
His last words were:
"I'm not afraid. I'm ready. "

495
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:21,927
But this is not all about Poul -

496
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:28,205
- because today Christoffer turns nine.
Before we gorge ourselves on cake -

497
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,830
- let's honor Poul
with a hymn.

498
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:36,695
Kaj Munk's number 634.
"You Know My Heart."

499
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,240
There you are.
I thought you had gone to bed.

500
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:38,045
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Can't it wait?

501
00:55:38,152 --> 00:55:44,709
It has been a long day for
Christoffer with all this attention.

502
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,911
I'd like to talk to you now.

503
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,755
Okay.
Okay, then.

504
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:56,121
Go into dad's office
and cuddle up under a blanket.

505
00:55:57,972 --> 00:56:02,036
What's up with you?
Is the business with the birthday cake?

506
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,660
- What if the Devil isn't testing you?
- What do you mean?

507
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,920
What if it isn't him
who's been dogging you?

508
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:14,974
I see.
You're reaching again.

509
00:56:15,926 --> 00:56:19,029
If not the Devil then who?
A little elf?

510
00:56:19,784 --> 00:56:24,133
Maybe all the birds, the stove and
the worms are just a coincidence?

511
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:27,055
Is that what you're telling people, Adam?

512
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,134
God.

513
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:33,634
- Pardon?
- God.

514
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:40,610
- I don't understand.
- What if God is on your case?

515
00:56:42,347 --> 00:56:44,054
Why would he do that?

516
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:47,547
Because he hates you.
I've read this book. Book of Job.

517
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,624
- Yes.
- You've read it, right?

518
00:56:57,691 --> 00:57:00,691
No. It's about a crocodile.
That's what I've heard.

519
00:57:01,387 --> 00:57:06,107
Yes, it's about a crocodile,
but it's also about much more.

520
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:12,038
Remember God killed Job's cattle?
His seven camels and his ten kids?

521
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:16,741
He takes everything away from him
and makes him a leper.

522
00:57:18,356 --> 00:57:20,156
Does that
remind you of anything?

523
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:25,111
I never had a camel.

524
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:28,533
Look at me.
Look at me, Ivan!

525
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:32,692
You know that God
is behind this, right?

526
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,134
God is not on your side, Ivan.

527
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,430
Yes, he is.

528
00:57:40,153 --> 00:57:45,039
I don't believe any of this shit.
I just want you to know that it's God.

529
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,899
The Devil hasn't
wasted any time on you.

530
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,206
God wants to kill you.

531
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,084
You're just so dense
that you don't get it.

532
00:58:01,785 --> 00:58:03,308
Why are you doing this to me?

533
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:07,718
Because I'm evil.
You can't change that.

534
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:00,509
There's fire in the sky.

535
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,172
- Is Ivan gone?
- Yeah.

536
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,211
He forgot his retarded kid.

537
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:18,076
For fuck's sake,
it was new!

538
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:21,951
Now go to bed hungry
every night.

539
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:25,176
He's done for. You could use him
for a paperweight. Have you had coffee?

540
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:31,051
- No. Is he going to...
- Die? You bet your ass he is.

541
01:02:31,762 --> 01:02:36,166
Why do you think that the bloke began
bleeding from all orifices in his skull?

542
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:40,595
I give him four weeks, five tops.

543
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:46,704
From a medical point of view it doesn't
matter. He's come to his senses.

544
01:02:47,176 --> 01:02:49,576
Somehow you've managed
to take away his faith.

545
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:55,375
- That's why I want to buy you coffee.
- It doesn't matter.

546
01:02:56,418 --> 01:02:57,978
Well excuse me.

547
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:31,532
Are you ready?

548
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,934
Get up, Ivan,
we need the room.

549
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:39,321
Go with Adam.

550
01:03:43,122 --> 01:03:45,113
Are you coming?

551
01:03:53,598 --> 01:03:55,901
Call me
when he gets too weak.

552
01:03:55,934 --> 01:03:58,785
We'll give him a room
and a shot of morphine.

553
01:05:25,346 --> 01:05:27,146
God hates us, Christoffer.

554
01:05:29,598 --> 01:05:31,158
He's always hated us.

555
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:35,257
He doesn't look too good.

556
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:43,127
Gather the others.

557
01:06:08,004 --> 01:06:09,564
Well, the fact is...

558
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,828
Adam already knows but...

559
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:20,514
I'm dying.

560
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:25,756
- Die? What?
- Sleep with the worms.

561
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:30,857
- You can't stay?
- No, that would be difficult.

562
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:34,326
What are we to do?

563
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:38,723
Well, I hope that you...

564
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:45,419
I don't know.

565
01:06:47,095 --> 01:06:50,973
I don't know what you should do.
I don't know anything anymore.

566
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:58,145
If I said anything that you
can use then do that or don't.

567
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:00,201
I don't care.

568
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:07,131
That's all.

569
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,862
- Where you're going?
- I feel like a drink. I've earned that.

570
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,708
- Gunnar...
- Leave me alone.

571
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,804
- You idiot!
- Gunnar, that's stupid.

572
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:16,115
There was a hair.

573
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,762
Here's one more.
We have three.

574
01:08:22,493 --> 01:08:27,021
Ivan deserves a good pie.

575
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:29,168
What the fuck are you doing?

576
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,464
- I'm picking apples.
- With a Paki?

577
01:08:36,172 --> 01:08:40,018
- What happened?
- Lightning.

578
01:08:41,141 --> 01:08:44,148
What's wrong with you?
Are you fucking kidding us?

579
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,109
What did you say?

580
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:49,241
- You're climbing trees with a Nigger.
- Wait...

581
01:08:50,422 --> 01:08:57,013
- Esben, just go home.
- He said go and take that fat friend with you.

582
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:02,483
Jaegen, let's teach our little
black friend some manners.

583
01:09:05,055 --> 01:09:06,855
What the fuck are you doing?

584
01:09:07,633 --> 01:09:11,074
I feel stressed.
He came with that psycho knee.

585
01:09:11,111 --> 01:09:14,856
- He shot me.
- He's my witness. You were already shot.

586
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,684
- He shot me!
- I said sorry, fatso!

587
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:23,787
- Take him with you.
- You'll regret this.

588
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:26,138
And you, Nigger, you're dead.

589
01:09:27,907 --> 01:09:32,855
- Are you stupid? I have a gun.
- You can't just shoot people.

590
01:09:32,908 --> 01:09:38,008
He came with that shoulder.
Psycho shoulder. Oh, and there's his back.

591
01:09:39,072 --> 01:09:40,272
Stop it!

592
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:51,591
I'm a bit off balance.
I don' like seeing Ivan like he is.

593
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,578
It's been a shitty day.
I want to leave this faggot country.

594
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:35,337
Khalid...
You have to talk to him.

595
01:10:35,367 --> 01:10:37,071
He has problems.

596
01:10:38,095 --> 01:10:39,895
Gunnar is also behaving strangely.

597
01:10:42,728 --> 01:10:47,549
- Well, you know... They need you.
- Leave me alone.

598
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:52,018
Yes, but just have a talk with them.

599
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:55,953
They'll listen to you.

600
01:11:04,649 --> 01:11:06,051
I'll put the apples in the fridge.

601
01:11:07,852 --> 01:11:09,082
Do as you please.

602
01:11:23,103 --> 01:11:24,903
Gunnar, what are you doing?

603
01:11:30,258 --> 01:11:33,468
- Nothing.
- Where's Sarah?

604
01:11:35,673 --> 01:11:40,184
- She's gone home.
- What's with all those things?

605
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:44,340
- It's just an eggplant...
- And the racket?

606
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:52,723
It's okay.
Everyone said that it was okay.

607
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:02,110
- Go on in.
- Not while you are here.

608
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,965
Can I see your room?

609
01:12:07,962 --> 01:12:08,922
No.

610
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:22,925
- She got very drunk.
- What have you done?

611
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:27,339
Nothing yet.
She just got drunk.

612
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,803
- She wanted it.
- Put that stuff down.

613
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:38,283
It's her fault for getting that drunk.

614
01:12:48,313 --> 01:12:50,253
Let's go to bed.

615
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:54,752
You come with me.
Go on.

616
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:06,617
- Wow, so many guns.
- Khalid, where are you going?

617
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:09,383
Statoil must burn.

618
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:12,049
- Wouldn't you rather stay here?
- No.

619
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,617
- You won't shoot anyone, right?
- Drop it. I don' want to shoot you.

620
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:19,745
You meddle
and I shoot you in the face.

621
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:26,231
- Can we go with you?
- You want to rob a station with me?

622
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,957
- Yes.
- Nice. But no smoking in the car.

623
01:13:30,095 --> 01:13:33,962
Of course.
Get in.

624
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:02,214
I'll go in first.
I have to use the loo.

625
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:06,018
Okay, but no shooting anyone
before I come in.

626
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:09,967
Hat on, Gunnar.

627
01:14:14,906 --> 01:14:17,574
Is there a back door?
Run! Get out of here!

628
01:14:18,376 --> 01:14:19,576
Get out!
Run!

629
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:27,528
- Where are the clerks?
- They ran.

630
01:14:28,978 --> 01:14:30,538
For fuck's sake!

631
01:14:43,922 --> 01:14:47,454
- Are you done?
- Don't you want some cigarettes?

632
01:15:01,642 --> 01:15:03,529
Stop it!
Let's go!

633
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:24,248
Are you hurt?

634
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,240
That went well.

635
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:34,939
You have to talk to Ivan.
You need help, both of you.

636
01:15:36,688 --> 01:15:38,488
He also needs help.
Come on.

637
01:15:39,962 --> 01:15:41,762
- Take off that hat.
- Yes.

638
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:58,990
- Hi. Where did you go last night?
- We were at the gas station.

639
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:04,210
- Was I very drunk?
- No, you were nice.

640
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:07,772
What are you doing?
Where are the other apples?

641
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,202
- We ate them.
- You ate seven apples?

642
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:17,659
- He was hungry. You only had beer.
- For fuck's sake!

643
01:16:19,212 --> 01:16:21,073
You look good in that outfit.
Did we fool around yesterday?

644
01:16:29,172 --> 01:16:33,168
The girlie boys are here again.
There are more this time.

645
01:16:37,876 --> 01:16:41,619
- Go into the church.
- I won't hide from that bunch of faggots.

646
01:16:41,658 --> 01:16:44,423
Look how many there are.
Go into the church.

647
01:17:01,532 --> 01:17:03,332
You can go fuck yourself.

648
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:07,132
- We just want the Paki.
- Will you stop that with that noise!?

649
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:24,524
I really shouldn't have to come out here
and ask for some peace and quiet.

650
01:17:26,454 --> 01:17:29,298
I have six,
maybe seven, days left to live.

651
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:32,939
I deserve a little nap time.

652
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:37,517
You people are so rude.
Please leave.

653
01:17:37,564 --> 01:17:40,978
We just want the Paki and him.

654
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:46,744
Do what you want. You can take
them to the woods. I just want peace.

655
01:17:47,712 --> 01:17:50,112
- Fuck you!
- How rude...

656
01:17:50,476 --> 01:17:57,069
We'll do this another way.
Give me all your noisemakers.

657
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:15,229
What the fuck was he doing?

658
01:18:16,595 --> 01:18:17,471
Asshole!

659
01:18:21,423 --> 01:18:25,013
- I wasn't my fault.
- Let's get out of here.

660
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:12,251
In medical terms
this is called a Half-Kennedy.

661
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:16,761
He won't get over that.
I can assure you.

662
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:23,306
Well, you just say your goodbyes
and I'll stick the kettle on.

663
01:19:53,508 --> 01:19:57,722
It's not nice to take the church car.
It's for the dead.

664
01:19:57,774 --> 01:20:01,204
Shut up, Gunnar.
Goodbye to you all.

665
01:20:01,486 --> 01:20:06,962
- You could stay. Ivan may return.
- Ivan is done.

666
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:10,103
I have to go home.
What about you, Adam?

667
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,683
I don't know.
You decide.

668
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:19,105
I'm going. I'm sorry about Ivan.
I'm sorry that you can't make a pie.

669
01:20:19,938 --> 01:20:21,738
See you, Adam and Sarah.

670
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:24,107
Fuck you, Gunnar.

671
01:20:26,337 --> 01:20:27,119
Well, okay.

672
01:20:41,891 --> 01:20:45,986
- Go to your room.
- Don't get angry, but...

673
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:53,015
- Where is that from?
- Don't hurt me.

674
01:20:53,032 --> 01:20:58,249
I took it by mistake. I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.

675
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:22,093
- Enter.
- His bed is empty.

676
01:22:22,447 --> 01:22:24,789
- Yes.
- Where is he?

677
01:22:25,164 --> 01:22:29,812
It doesn't make sense. I'm a man
of science. I believe in figures.

678
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:33,047
He should have been
going to the afterlife,

679
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:39,515
and not to the garden to have a
cheeseburger after being shot.

680
01:22:41,032 --> 01:22:42,832
- Is he in the garden?
- Yes.

681
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:48,509
He just got up
and went for a walk.

682
01:22:48,985 --> 01:22:52,103
The bullet simply
shot the tumor away.

683
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:58,743
Now they're telling me that the bloke
is well again. I've bloody well had it.

684
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:30,373
Hi, Adam.

685
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:34,489
- I baked an apple pie.
- Yes.

686
01:23:40,969 --> 01:23:42,529
Shall we try it?

687
01:25:02,524 --> 01:25:07,455
- What's the name of the child?
- Ivan Lambert Andersen.

688
01:25:08,126 --> 01:25:11,033
Ivan Lambert Andersen...

689
01:25:12,157 --> 01:25:16,340
I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

690
01:25:17,882 --> 01:25:18,842
Amen.

691
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:24,633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

692
01:25:24,696 --> 01:25:28,313
- Will you come back.
- There's no time.

693
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:33,063
- We're going to Indonesia.
- Interesting. Because of the tigers?

694
01:25:33,102 --> 01:25:39,130
No, I plan to play tennis again.
They have the best courts.

695
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:41,341
It's because of junior.

696
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:45,197
With his Down's syndrome
he'll look just like the natives.

697
01:25:45,429 --> 01:25:48,429
Yes, tigers are really fascinating.
You're always welcome.

698
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:52,798
- We have to go.
- Don't you have to change?

699
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,460
I'll do it in the car.

700
01:25:59,384 --> 01:26:00,498
Come on, Gunnar.

701
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:11,789
Arne and Noller.
Ivan Fjeldsted. Call me Ivan.

702
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:17,856
Okay then. This is my assistant,
Adam Ole Pedersen.

703
01:26:18,446 --> 01:26:20,846
We've been looking forward
to meeting you.

704
01:26:22,407 --> 01:26:25,583
Well, let's go.
I'll take the bags.

705
01:26:25,624 --> 01:26:28,024
What the fuck
is wrong with your eye?

706
01:26:31,322 --> 01:26:34,257
- What do you mean?
- You look like a retard.

707
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:36,343
Really?

708
01:26:36,913 --> 01:26:39,313
I think that's an awfully
rude way to break the ice.

709
01:26:39,618 --> 01:26:43,890
We can go through town
and ask what they think of me.

710
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:49,672
This is not the place for that
discussion because you'll lose.

711
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:55,387
The eye is fine.
We'll discuss it in the car.

712
01:26:56,133 --> 01:27:00,371
Good idea there.
Come on.

713
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:07,012
