he hit his head

but the pulmonary vein

287
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,775

Let's get our nails done.

914
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:45,012
Okay.

915
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,984
STEENA:
Have a nice day, boys.

You said to wear this,

919
00:44:57,563 --> 00:45:00,555

BLAINE:
So, Mr. Devlin

924
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,008
how are you feeling today?

925
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,371
Not so good, I'm afraid.

926
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:15,073
Well, you've got a few hours

927
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:16,671
to pull yourself together.

928
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,739
What do you mean?

929
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,217
After the fiasco
of planting the bug

930
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:21,276
I'd say we have
only one choice:

931
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,811
Level One surveillance.

932
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:24,822
In other words...

933
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,050
Infiltration.

934
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,820
Banning's going to be at
the Lanford Hotel tonight

935
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,793
entertaining three
of his new partners.

936
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:32,991
Chalmers has agreed to...
get us at the next table.

937
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,931
Is this a black-tie event?

938
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:36,491
No. But I'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

939
00:45:36,535 --> 00:45:39,163
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.

940
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,762
Meet you there at 8:00.

Oh.

00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,793
Thank you.

963
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,662
Sorry, I don't have
anything for you.

964
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,395
It's a video camera.

00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:46,070

- Hello.

00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:56,830
Mr. Brown.

1001
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,103
Forgive us for bothering you.

1002

We came to see your show and...

1003
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,705
Yeah, she forgot
to make reservations.

1004
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:02,714
Don't worry about it.

There's one more thing
I'd like to say, um...

It's not the in thing today

Well, it's brilliant.

1652
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:44,247
They touch down

1653
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:46,249
Their little feet transfer
a deadly bacteria

without breaking
the surface of the water

1655
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:50,212
so no alarms sound,
and it looks like

1656
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:52,847
a nasty little trick of nature.

1657
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:53,856

01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:25,653
<i>The life cycle
of the Gerris maginatus</i>

1672
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,589
begins with mating...

1673
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:31,720
something Dr. Simms
is not personally familiar with.

1674
01:15:31,762 --> 01:15:33,662
Anyhoo, the insects swarm

1675
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:35,164
to freshwater

1676
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,564
where fertilized eggs are then
deposited on the underside

1677
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:40,900
of lotus leaves
and hatch into larvae.

1678
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:43,929
Spare me

1679
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:44,963

1681

Yes, tell us.

1682
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,141
Why it won't work?

1683
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,445
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

1684
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:55,974
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

1685
01:15:56,019 --> 01:16:00,479
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually...

1686
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:03,823
much like Simms here.

1687
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,986
Therefore...

1688
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:05,995
they won't mate.

1689
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:09,294
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

1690
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,027
Is this true?

1691
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:14,697
No, I knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

1692
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:16,205
Very well.

1693
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,104
And then you remember
cousin Doris?

1694
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,473
No, Simms, the bugs.

1695
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,807
The bugs.

1696
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:24,837
Oh, you're not going

1697
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:26,314

1698
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,338
Oh, yeah?

1699
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:30,376

"Excuse me, you want
to go get some coffee?"

2041
