You know what, Kirk?
l'm ready to do the scene!

185
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:20,073
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

186
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:21,774
-Now it's time to flip the script!
-Kirk...

00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,683
Sorry, man.

331
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,594
<i>This is your fault, you limey fuck!</i>

332
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,721
<i>You shit the money-bed, my friend.</i>

333
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:19,562
Hey, Les, l understand if you're angry,

334
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,659
but l am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas!

335
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,262
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

336
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,774
<i>You know how you handle an actor?</i>
<i>They whine about anything,</i>

337
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,175
<i>you pull down their pants</i>
<i>and you spank their ass.</i>

338
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,475
-You spank that ass, Les.
-What?

339
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:37,348
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

340
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,121
Fear makes him a man.

341
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:46,753
l know a place
where a man's worth is measured

342
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:50,662
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

343
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:53,496
The real deep shit.

344
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,196
You wanna make this movie right?

345
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:59,797
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

346
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:03,241
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

347
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,245
Les, that's Four Leaf.

348
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,646
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
l wrote the book.

349
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:14,914
<i>You're a great American.</i>
<i>This nation owes you a huge debt.</i>

350
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:17,992
<i>Now shut the fuck up</i>
<i>and let me do my job!</i>

351
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,328
<i>-Look, Cockburn.</i>
-Yes.

352
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,456
<i>From now on, my fist</i>
<i>is gonna be so far up your shithole</i>

353
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,931
<i>that every time you have a thought,</i>

354
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:29,060
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe</i>
<i>past my wedding ring.</i>

355
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:32,698
<i>Take control of your actors,</i>
<i>or l will shut you down.</i>

356
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:33,900
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

357
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:49,184
When the herd loses its way,

358
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,728
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

359
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,829
-Four Leaf?
-Come on over. lt's okay.

360
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:01,992
-Sit down.
-Yes.

361
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:08,502
-So, you don't like the hotel?
-Beds give me nightmares.

362
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:18,747
l'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

363
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:23,188
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

364
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,329
What?

365
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:35,369
l put my story in your limp Brit hands,

366
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,906
and you are not going to fail me.

367
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,602
You think l was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

368
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:46,545
You must put those boys in the shit.

369
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,206
What? l don't understand.

370
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:51,582
-You wanna make your movie or not?
-Yes, l do.

371
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:55,179
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

372
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,919
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

373
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,326
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

374
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:07,300
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

375
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,836
Then we take those boys up there,

376
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:13,032
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

377
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:16,076
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

378
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,169
and screaming for their mammies.

379
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,738
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

380
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,110
l could do it.

381
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,324
l could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

382
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,758
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

383
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:34,954
Put them in the real shit.

384
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,257
-Real shit.
-With real fear in their eyes!

385
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:39,425
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

386
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,627
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

387
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,500
Take them off the fucking grid!

388
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,720
You are no longer actors in a movie!

389
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,556
You are five men in a helicopter!

390
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,094
With three other men!

391
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,262
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

392
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:22,434
'Cause l left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

393
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:25,104
-Save your breath, maggots!
-That's right, maggots!

394
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,932
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

395
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,403
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

396
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,808
Get out, you wriggly worms!

397
00:23:57,913 --> 00:24:00,381
-lt's up too high!
-Move, move, move!

398
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,581
See you in hell!

399
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,297
This is bullshit!
l gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

400
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:25,301
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

401
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:29,005
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

402
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:32,547
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

403
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:37,143
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

404
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:39,015
Cell phones!

405
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,588
What the hell, Damien?

406
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,386
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
l'm head-to-toe legitimate.

407
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:47,894
Gentlemen, l've got good news
and bad news.

408
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:51,488
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

409
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,931
And the good news.

410
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,936
lf you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

411
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,804
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

412
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:02,399
and liberate the POW camp,

413
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:05,776
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

414
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,678
at which point you will rescue him,

415
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:11,149
at which point
we will chopper you home!

416
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,446
Damn.

417
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,352
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

418
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,857
there's the map, this is the scene list.

419
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,086
Think you can handle it?

420
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:24,393
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

421
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:29,496
And l will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

422
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:33,199
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

423
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:37,639
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

424
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,271
lf it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

425
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:41,974
You wanted to be actors.

426
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,677
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

427
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:47,778
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. lnfantry grunt,

428
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:51,655
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

429
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:57,393
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

430
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:02,095
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

431
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:06,607
The chopper is God,
and l am Jesus Christ, his son.

432
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:09,437
You are my chosen disciples.

433
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,570
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

434
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:15,707
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

435
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:20,516
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

436
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,954
-Yeah!
-All right!

437
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,768
Yeah!

438
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:49,274
Yeah!

439
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,730
Not bad, Cockburn!

440
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:06,761
Not bad.

441
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,062
Wherever you are!

442
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:15,133
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

443
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,845
Here we go.

444
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:20,972
Must be an old French mine.

445
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:24,540
lt's a remnant from colonial lndo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

446
00:27:26,621 --> 00:27:30,079
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

447
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,216
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

448
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,887
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

449
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:38,022
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

450
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,733
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

451
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:53,846
No offense, Kirk,
l know you're the big fancy actor here,

452
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:57,850
but l've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

453
00:27:57,952 --> 00:27:59,351
And l think l can spot

454
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:02,980
a prop head when l see one.

455
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,581
Oh, Jesus.

456
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:09,286
lt's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

457
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,628
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

458
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,863
Oh, God.

459
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:20,442
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

460
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:21,936
Oldest trick in the book.

461
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,242
He getting down now.

462
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:26,712
Oh, my God!

463
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:31,576
Whoa, look at me!

464
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:33,153
You're going to get the shots,

465
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:36,246
and l'm going to make sure
because l'm the director.

466
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,485
l'm from London. l direct plays.

467
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,619
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

468
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:53,201
Look, l'm Dave Beckham.

469
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,384
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

470
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,682
Blow some sense into these young men.

471
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:11,557
Hey, l don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

472
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:15,595
but l might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

473
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,457
<i>Tropic Thunder.</i>
Kind of like my <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

474
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,933
Yeah, l've never been in the military,
per se,

475
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,472
but l have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

Yeah.

478
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,645
lt's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

479
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,411
l don't know what it's called.

480
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:43,286
l just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

481
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:47,486
Okay.

482
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,290
Damien, we're go for explosion.

483
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:52,195
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

484

486
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:59,171

All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

488
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,639
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

489
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:08,541

-Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

497
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,903
-''l got a bad feeling on this one.''
-Dude, wait, like how?

498
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,840
''l got a bad feeling on this one.''

499
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,038
-Okay.
-Action. Go, come on.

500
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,923
l got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

501
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,661
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

502
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,594
first thing l'm doing
is paying my 2 bucks

503
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,326
so l can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

504
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:02,130
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

505
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:05,138
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

506
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,471
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

507
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,305
Zip it, Motown.

508
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,003
Man, l'm thirsty.

509
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:18,074
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat l got back in Danang.

510
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:22,445
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

511
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,354
Ain't no <i>Criss Angel Mindfreak,</i>

512
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,792
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

513
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:31,662
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

514
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:35,099
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

515
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,833
-You sure?
-Yeah.

516
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,736
-Yeah?
-For certain, man.

517
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:41,741
Then why are you still in character?

518
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:45,279
l know, but l don't have to tell you.

519
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:47,472
You don't know.

520
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:50,517
Man, l don't drop character
till l done a DVD commentary.

521
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,449
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

522
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:57,286
Get down, fool!

523
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:01,894
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

524
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:06,961
-This feels pretty real!
-Exactly! Let's use it.

525
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:18,739
Yeah!

526
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:21,379
Yeah!

527
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,247
Eat lead!

528
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,587
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

529
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,953
This is FUBAR. l say we juice them.

530
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:36,553
-What do you think?
-Juice them.

531
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,458
Fuck you, Charlie!

532
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:45,005
Big-ass titties!

533
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:52,606
Look at that, huh?

534
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,079
And cut!

535
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,187
That's the trailer right there.

536
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,588
Yeah!

537
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,956
-What do we do now?
-Yeah.

538
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:08,585
North. Man said to head north.

539
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:12,029
-Did you see me shooting?
-That's how we do. Good work, baby.

540
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,191
l believed it.

541
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,461
D'ang Kwook River.

542
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:16,502
l'm betting
he's got more of these battles

543
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,334
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

544
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,206
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

545
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,641
Real, baby, l'm real.

546
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,512
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

547
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:33,678
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

548
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:35,619
Don't dawdle now!

549
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:04,013
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

550
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:09,953
Something's up.
l think we better drag ass back there.

551
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:12,754
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

552
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:23,470
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

553
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:27,200
-What are you doing, Jeff?
-Fucking... Nothing, man!

554
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:30,641
-l'm eating jellybeans.
-Wow, l love jellybeans. Can l please...

555
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:33,475
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

556
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:34,673
They're mine.

557
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,942
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

558
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,745
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

559
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:39,251
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

560
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:01,869
Hey. l didn't mean to
show you up back there.

561
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:06,106
lt's just, l feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

562
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,114
lt's gonna be tough,

563
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:11,242
but l think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

564
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:14,516
Just wish l had
a director like this on <i>Jack.</i>

565
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:17,113
On <i>Jack.</i> What? <i>Jack?</i>
What you talking about?

566
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,294
<i>-Simple Jack.</i>
-Oh, yeah.

567
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:25,027
<i>Simple Jack,</i> yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

568
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,397
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

569
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,902
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

570
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,905
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

571
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,701
l just did the work.

572
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,610
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

573
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:43,076
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

574
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:44,947
Then again,
l always found mere observation

575
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:47,350
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

576
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:50,515
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

577
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:54,959
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

578
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:57,121
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

579
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:59,961
You know, there were times
when l was doing <i>Jack</i>

580
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,535
that l actually felt retarded,

581
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:03,905
-like really retarded.
-Damn.

582
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:04,530
-like really retarded.
-Damn.

583
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,870
ln a weird way,
l had to sort of just free myself up

584
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,944
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

585
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,603
-To be a moron.
-Yeah.

586
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,443
-To be moronical.
-Exactly, to be a moron.

587
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,915
-An imbecile.
-Yeah.

588
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:19,885
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

589
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:21,147
When l was playing the character.

590
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:23,849
-When you was the character.
-Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

591
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,188
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

592
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:28,023
By the end of the whole thing, l was like,

593
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:32,657
''Wait a minute, l flushed so much out,
how am l gonna jumpstart it up again?''

594
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,826
-lt's just like... Right?
-Yeah.

595
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:37,700
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

596
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:40,273
Yeah. l mean, it was really quite a...
lt was crazy.

597
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,866
lt's like working with mercury.
lt's high science, man. lt's an art form.

598
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,003
-Yeah.
-You an artist.

599
00:36:46,113 --> 00:36:47,910
-That's what we do, right? Yeah.
-Yeah.

600
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:49,277
Hats off for going there,

601
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:52,113
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

602
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:59,350
-About what?
-You're serious? You don't know?

603
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:03,587
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

604
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:07,225
-What do you mean?
-Check it out.

605
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:11,464
Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man,</i> looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

606
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:15,668
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

607
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:18,409
Then you got Tom Hanks,
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

608
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,810
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

609
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:23,816
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

610
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:25,112
That ain't retarded.

611
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,212
Peter Sellers, <i>Being There.</i>
lnfantile, yes. Retarded, no.

612
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,949
You went full retard, man.

613
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,660
Never go full retard.

614
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:40,225
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001 , <i>l Am Sam.</i>

615
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:43,633
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

616
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,678
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

617
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:00,047
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

618
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,416
No, that's impossible, man.

619
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:04,389
l rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

620
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,049
-He must have missed his mark.
-Missed his mark?

621
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,388
Yeah, this isn't me.

622
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,293
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

623
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:13,094
-You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
-We're in a world of hurt!

624
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,395
-You're in trouble.
-This isn't just on me!

625
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,733
-We're in a... We're together on this.
-Bullshit.

626
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,305
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

627
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:21,068
What happened to,
''No man left behind,'' okay?

628
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,439
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

629
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:26,274
-l don't wanna hear it.
-Let me just be real with you, all right?

630
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,679
l almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on <i>Freaky Friday,</i> okay?

631
00:38:29,784 --> 00:38:31,115
This shit will fucking ruin me!

632
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:33,118
-Just get off me! You're pathetic.
-No, l'm not.

633
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,688
-Get off me!
-You are not going back!

634
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,994
-What the fuck?
-Now wait a minute.

635
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:00,337
l fucking hate movies.

636
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:05,516
This is bullshit.
l don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

637
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:18,127
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

638
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,896
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

639
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:26,269
-Yo, man, l got a Bust-A-Nut.
-You go to hell! There he is.

640
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,645
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

641
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:35,912
You little piece of shit!
l'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

642
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,045
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

643
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:44,686
l don't really gotta piss.
l'm trying to talk at you, man.

644
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,419
Bait, l need bait.

645
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:51,258
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

646
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,593
Yeah, l think so.

647
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,396
l know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

648
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:59,303
making <i>Planet of the Apes</i> on YouTube
or some shit, but l don't buy it.

649
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:01,875
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

650
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,371
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

651
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:07,641
-Keep looking ahead, man.
-No, of course not.

652
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:11,309
lf l can put that map in your hands,
can l count you in?

653
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:14,946
-Well, yeah, l guess you can.
-Dynamite. l'm out.

654
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:21,060
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

655
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:23,687
ls anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

656
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:26,958
Why are they even out in the daytime?

657
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,607
l'm gonna level with you, bro.
l don't need to pee. l need to talk to you.

658
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:43,613
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

659
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,549
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

660
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,486
and l think he's getting cold feet.

661
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:54,383
-l need you on my side, Kyle.
-lt's Kevin.

662
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,656
Good. Can l count on you?

663
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:01,702
Yeah. lf you want
l could give the map a look-see.

664
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,930
-l'll handle the map.
-Okay.

665
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:07,269
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

666
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:11,071
l'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

667
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:15,376
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

668
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:19,112
-Yeah, that's wicked.
-Good.

669
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,118
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

670
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:29,523
You O.D.'d!

671
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:32,429
Hold up now, Jeff.

672
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,234
Fucking hell!

673
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,932
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

674
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,509
l don't have any more jellybeans.

675
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:51,914
You land there!

676
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:09,234
Wow. Look at these ruins.

677
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:15,842
-Where the hell are we?
-D'ang Kwook River.

678
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:18,309
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

679
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,607
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

680
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:25,811
Yeah. l'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

681
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,354
Enough from the peanut gallery!
lnto the water, ladies!

682
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:30,582
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

683
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,283
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

684
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:34,418
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

685
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:36,928
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

686
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:40,899
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

687
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:43,128
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

688
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,795
l don't believe you people.

689
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,235
What do you mean ''you people''?

690
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:53,505
What do you mean, ''you people''?

691
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,605
l think what Tugg means is...

692
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:57,081
No, look at his eyes, man.

693
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:59,880
-...you people, you actors. You people...
-Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

694
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:01,545
l gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

695
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:03,623
-Hell, no!
-Silence!

696
00:43:04,658 --> 00:43:07,320
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

697
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:12,026
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

698
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:14,424
-''Viet Cong''!
-What?

699
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:17,961
lt's ''Viet Cong.'' There's no ''S.''
lt's already plural.

700
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:19,664
You wouldn't say ''Chineses.''

701
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:23,475
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

702
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:26,375
lf the machine breaks down,
we break down.

703
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,005
Hey, man, you know how in <i>Rambo l,</i>
he was big but a little puffy

704
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:30,708
and then <i>Rambo ll,</i>
he got all shredded up?

705
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:33,685
-Yeah.
-That's kind of how you look right now.

706
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:35,345
-Yeah?
-Not <i>Rambo l</i> but <i>ll.</i>

707
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:37,185
-Really?
-Yeah, when he was cut up.

708
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,657
l'm not that... l mean,
that's what l'm going for, but you know...

709
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,456
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

710
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:44,053
-Thanks.
-What's the secret, dude?

711
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,529
-lt's a diet. l'm just dieting.
-Really?

712
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:48,625
'Cause l'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... lt's tough.

713
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:50,226
-You look good.
-Any tips?

714
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,032
-What?
-Any tips, you got?

715
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,265
There's, like, the pineapple...

716
00:43:53,374 --> 00:43:55,672
-Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
-Hey!

717
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:57,368
-Hey!
-All right, now!

718
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:59,912
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

719
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:02,005
That's fucking bullshit!
lt's a chump move.

720
00:44:02,116 --> 00:44:04,050
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

721
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:07,148
We're going the wrong way!

722
00:44:07,254 --> 00:44:08,346
-Damn!
-Son of a bitch.

723
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:12,915
God! l think we were
supposed to be doing this,

724
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,928
and instead we did this.

725
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,659
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

726
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,292
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

727
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:24,636
This is not cool!

728
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:28,467
Maybe.

729
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,400
This is insane!

730
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,012
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

731
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:38,011
We're supposed to be a unit!

732
00:44:38,118 --> 00:44:39,642
Suck my unit!

733
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:42,318
All right, fine.

734
00:44:42,423 --> 00:44:47,326
-l'll finish it by myself.
-You go be all you can be, man.

735
00:44:47,428 --> 00:44:49,419
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

736
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,327
Yes, l do!

737
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:55,960
l'm going to, ''Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

738
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,530
''Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle.''

739
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:02,575
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

740
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:19,148
Come on, men. Let's get home.

741
00:45:57,331 --> 00:46:01,995
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.

742
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:06,205
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

743
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,035
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

744
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:11,543
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

745
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,737
People thought it would come down to

746
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:15,110
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

747
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:19,015
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

748
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,848
Now, whichever format porno backs

749
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:24,788
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

750
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:27,884
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

751
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,724
You talking to me this whole time?

752
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:31,761
l was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

753
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,332
Jesus Christ, man!

754
00:46:51,752 --> 00:46:53,811
Booty Sweat.

755
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,259
Oh, God!

756
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:08,059
lt's cold! lt's freezing. l'm fucking cold.

757
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:09,703
You want my flak jacket?

758
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:10,362
You want my flak jacket?

759
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:14,339
What, are you insane? lt's boiling!
lt's like a sweat lodge out here!

760
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:17,274
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

761
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,277
l gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

762
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,347
-How we doing? We making good time?
-We're making good time,

763
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:24,576
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

764
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:27,176
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

765
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:29,585
-Oh, God.
-Y'all might be in for a treat.

766
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,089
You know,
back before the war broked out,

767
00:47:31,191 --> 00:47:33,921
l was a saucier in San Antone.

768
00:47:34,027 --> 00:47:36,655
l bet l could collar up
some of them greens.

769
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:41,063
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

770
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:45,195
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

771
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,802
Hell, yeah!

772
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:52,106
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

773
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:57,445
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

774
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:02,420
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

775
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,060
l get excited about my foods, man.

776
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,279
Die!

777
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,124
No!

778
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:03,973
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

779
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:06,477
l have no idea.

780
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,140
l've never been outside the States.

781
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:11,410
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

782
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:13,509
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

783
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,985
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

784
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:17,750
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

785
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:19,758
-Coast Guard.
-Sanitation Department.

786
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,556
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

787
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:26,394
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of A.

788
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,162
l wrote the book as a tribute!
l'm a patriot!

789
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,328
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

790
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:33,133
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

791
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,505
lt's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

792
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,043
God, and to think l believed in you!

793
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:40,511
-l don't wanna be next to you.
-Writers lie all the time.

794
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,741
Can l be tied to another post? Okay.

795
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:06,202
<i>-Rick?</i>
-Tugg.

796
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,365
l killed one, Rick.

797
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:11,909
The thing l love most in the world.

798
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:13,843
Vivica, get off the line now!

799
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:18,549
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

800
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,711
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

801
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:21,981
Get your hands on some bleach,

802
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:24,455
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

803
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:26,048
No, a panda.

804
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,922
<i>l killed a panda.</i>

805
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:29,825
Amanda? Come on, dude.

806
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,955
l mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

807
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:33,726
No, a panda!

808
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,199
A panda?

809
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,896
A sweet, cuddly,

810
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:39,938
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

811
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:43,008
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

812
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,270

All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

816
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,645
Screw TiVo.

817
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:54,220
l'm way beyond TiVo.

818
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,414
Last l checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

819
00:51:56,523 --> 00:51:59,822
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

820
00:51:59,926 --> 00:52:01,757
lt doesn't matter anymore.

821
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:06,065
l've moved on.

822
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,529

00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,305
Jacket's on, l'm out the door!

827
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:20,470
<i>Tugg?</i>

828
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,072
Please don't fire me.

829
00:52:28,184 --> 00:52:31,085
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

830
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,279
He doesn't look too good.

831
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:38,417
Must drink,
so l can throw something up!

832
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:40,655
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

833
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:41,855
No, don't!

834
00:52:41,964 --> 00:52:44,489
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

835
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,966
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

836
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:49,003
That'll bring him around. lt's a cure-all.

837
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:51,005
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

838
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:52,768
Did you need another revenue stream?

839
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:55,673
For your information,
my revenue stream

840
00:52:55,778 --> 00:52:58,110
currently generates $2 million a year

841
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:00,148
in charitable contributions
for my community.

842
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:02,581
-Hot damn.
-And why am l in this movie?

843
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,017
Maybe l just knew l had to represent,

844
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:06,918
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

845
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:09,082
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

846
00:53:10,693 --> 00:53:14,254
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

847
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:16,490
l just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

848
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:17,725
That shit ain't funny.

849
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:20,530
Hey, fellas! lt's hot!
We're tired! lt stinks!

850
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:22,194
l'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

851
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:24,034
l'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

852
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,608
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

853
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:29,371
-You about to cross some fucking lines.
-Guys, relax and stuff.

854
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:30,536
You know what? Fuck that, man!

855
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:33,308
l'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

856
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:39,612
For 400 years,

857
00:53:40,656 --> 00:53:43,557
that word has kept us down.

858
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:46,254
What the fuck?

859
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:50,128
lt took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

860
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:53,134
Now we up in the big leagues,

861
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:54,999
getting our turn at bat.

862
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:57,766
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

863
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:01,774
That's the theme song for
<i>The Jeffersons.</i> You really need help.

864
00:54:01,878 --> 00:54:05,006
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

865
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,048
You know what?
l'm gonna tell you what's true.

866
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:10,585
l'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

867
00:54:10,686 --> 00:54:13,280
Guys! Hey, guys!

868
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,358
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

869
00:54:18,728 --> 00:54:21,561
l'm gonna bite his hide. l need...

870
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:25,863
l need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

871
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:30,135
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

872
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,108
Now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

873
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:37,270
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

874
00:54:38,648 --> 00:54:39,945
We got ground to cover!

875
00:55:08,945 --> 00:55:12,210
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

876
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:14,844
Bring it on, Cockburn!

877
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:25,758
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

878
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:31,693
Wait, wait, wait,
let me do the line again.

879
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:32,893
Let me do the line again.

880
00:55:33,002 --> 00:55:37,098
My body may be shackled,
but my mind wanders free.

881
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:45,644
Good, again. Again.

882
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:54,014
Good, good.
Now let's do the torture scene.

883
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:55,920
l see moss on both sides of that tree.

884
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:59,153
Well, you know, maybe if l wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

885
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:01,161
My belly really hurts, you guys!

886
00:56:01,263 --> 00:56:03,458
l'm not joking around, l'm nauseous.

887
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:05,796
Let me off, l gotta puke!
l don't wanna die like Hendrix!

888
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:07,562
All right. All right.

889
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,132
Are you okay, Jeff?

890
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,608
l'm awesome.

891
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:19,481
Holy shit!

892
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,181
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

893
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:32,383
Man. Now l'm tripping.

894
00:56:32,495 --> 00:56:35,123
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

895
00:56:35,998 --> 00:56:37,693
Speedman was right?

896
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,165
l don't think so.

897
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:41,498
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

898
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:45,165
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

899
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:47,401
We were in that chopper for hours.

900
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,774
l don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

901
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:52,313
-Fuck.
-Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

902
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:55,179
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

903
00:56:55,284 --> 00:56:56,842
What the fuck is Laos?

904
00:56:56,952 --> 00:56:58,749
lt's the Golden Triangle.

905
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:00,412
The world's hard drug superhighway.

906
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:01,820
And how do you know about that?

907
00:57:01,924 --> 00:57:04,654
lt was a really long trip.
l read the in-flight magazine.

908
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:07,759
Cut!

909
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:09,330
Oh, Jesus!

910
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:11,923
What do you see, man? l'm blocked.

911
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:13,399
Damien, cut!

912
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,763
Hey, Damien, cut!

913
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:19,267
They got Speedman.

914
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:21,275
And it doesn't look good.

915
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:55,240
l am Tran.

916
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,373
You are a trespasser
in my poppy fields.

917
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:02,410
You are D.E.A. scum!

918
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:07,789
Were there some re-writes
that l missed?

919
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:15,586
Do you want to die?

920
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:17,832
-Do you?
-No!

921
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:22,063
Please, don't hurt me!

922
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:31,139
Say that again.

923
00:58:32,148 --> 00:58:33,945
Please, don't hurt me.

924
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:37,143
No! Like you did before! Say it!

925
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,109
Say it!

926
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:43,214
Please, don't hurt me!

927
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:01,435
-What?
-You are Simple Jack.

928
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:06,278
You saw <i>Simple Jack?</i>

929
00:59:06,382 --> 00:59:08,714
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

930
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:12,250
We do not have many luxury here.

931
00:59:12,354 --> 00:59:14,788
And <i>Simple Jack</i> is the only movie
we possess.

932
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,724
You got the VHS.

933
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:20,886
We've watched it many, many times.

934
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:23,464
You should've got Oscar.

935
00:59:26,502 --> 00:59:28,265
Well, you know. lt's...

936
00:59:29,538 --> 00:59:30,800
Just to be nominated...

937
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:32,134
You were nominated?

938
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,765
No, no, no. l wasn't nominated.

939
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:37,039
l'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

940
00:59:37,146 --> 00:59:39,512
lt's just... lt's very political.
You have to take out ads...

941
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:42,106
-Shut up now!
-Okay. Okay.

942
00:59:42,952 --> 00:59:44,681
So, are you going to

943
00:59:46,322 --> 00:59:47,949
let me go, or...

944
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:50,184
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

945
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,089
Much more money now!

946
01:00:03,672 --> 01:00:04,661
He's in a meeting.

947
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:07,537
Yeah, l know.
ln about two seconds with the Pecker.

948
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:10,442
l'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

949
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:13,208
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

950
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:14,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

951
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:18,685
What do you need, Peck?

952
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:21,415
No, more like what do you need, Les?

953
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:22,717
Glasses?

954
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:24,850
What?

955
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,451
So you can read
the <i>Tropic Thunder</i> contract

956
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:29,963
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

957
01:00:30,065 --> 01:00:33,796
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

958
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,697
-Huh?
-l can't believe you let him in.

959
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,173
Look, fuckstick, l'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

960
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:44,337
before l snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

961
01:00:44,446 --> 01:00:46,471
No, not you, Helen.

962
01:00:46,582 --> 01:00:50,279
But l will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

963
01:00:50,386 --> 01:00:51,910
Perfect.

964
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:54,455
Hey, Tuggernuts,
l've got you on speakerphone.

965
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:56,421
l'm standing here with Les Grossman,

966
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:59,688
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

967
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:02,093
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

968
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:05,290
We are Flaming Dragon.

969
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:07,767
Speedman is with us now.

970
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,431
<i>For 50 million, you will get him back.</i>

971
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,701
-Are you gonna get those...
-Who is this?

972
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,505
-And how did you get this phone?
-We are Flaming Dragon!

973
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:18,512
Simple Jack belong to us now.

974
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,275
He does, does he?

975
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:25,853
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

976
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:28,388
l've never even heard
of your little agency.

977
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,458
But if you think
you can poach my client...

978
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,087
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

979
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:36,687
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

980
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,097
This is Flaming Dragon!

981
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:41,965
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

982
01:01:42,071 --> 01:01:46,906
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

983
01:01:48,277 --> 01:01:51,007
Now, l don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

984
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:53,581
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

985
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:54,979
<i>So whatever you're thinking,</i>
<i>you better think again.</i>

986
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:56,449
<i>Otherwise, l'm gonna</i>
<i>have to head down there,</i>

987
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:59,919
and l will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

988
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:01,649
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

989
01:02:01,757 --> 01:02:05,784
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

990
01:02:05,894 --> 01:02:08,488
l am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

991
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:10,360
l will massacre you!

992
01:02:10,466 --> 01:02:12,400
l will fuck you up!

993
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:21,938
-Could you find out who that was? Go.
-Yeah. Yeah.

994
01:02:57,379 --> 01:03:00,371
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

995
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:02,211
Okay.

996
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:04,979
Hey. Look, l know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

997
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:09,683
Put teeth in!

998
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,664
Now do movie.

999
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:20,428
The whole movie?

1000
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:22,197
l can't. l don't know the whole...

1001
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:24,795
You perform! You perform or die!

1002
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:27,031
Monkey swine!

1003
01:03:29,945 --> 01:03:31,344
Pa.

1004
01:03:33,315 --> 01:03:34,680
More stupid!

1005
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:41,515
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1006
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:45,290
You saw what l saw.

1007
01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:47,988
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1008
01:03:48,096 --> 01:03:50,462
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1009
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:51,897
which is in the other direction!

1010
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,592
Ain't right.

1011
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:55,727
What would've happened
in <i>The Great Escape</i>

1012
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,672
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1013
01:03:59,775 --> 01:04:03,768
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1014
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:06,507
l'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1015
01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:07,809
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1016
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:11,818
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1017
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,720
l'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1018
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:21,752
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1019
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:24,924
l got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1020
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:27,001
Crazy's better than nothing.

1021
01:04:27,102 --> 01:04:31,061
Back in '98, l did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1022
01:04:31,173 --> 01:04:34,506
<i>-Sex Camp.</i> Remember it?
-Yeah.

1023
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:38,569
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1024
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,205
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1025
01:04:41,316 --> 01:04:43,011
So, what we did,

1026
01:04:43,118 --> 01:04:46,110
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1027
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:49,782
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1028
01:04:55,397 --> 01:04:56,762
Look,

1029
01:04:56,865 --> 01:05:00,164
-you guys, we already know the plan.
-Fine.

1030
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:04,638
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1031
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,140
The book of <i>Tropic Thunder.</i>

1032
01:05:07,242 --> 01:05:09,472
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1033
01:05:10,779 --> 01:05:13,407
The flap, l read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1034
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:17,310
Well, it's okay.
lt's exactly the same as in the script.

1035
01:05:17,419 --> 01:05:18,477
Cool.

1036
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:23,015
You guys all read the script, right?

1037
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:25,218
l don't read the script, script reads me.

1038
01:05:26,395 --> 01:05:27,862
What the hell does that even mean?

1039
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:31,330
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1040
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,501
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1041
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:40,440
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1042
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,874
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1043
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:45,378
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1044
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:48,307
Yeah!

1045
01:05:49,384 --> 01:05:52,376
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1046
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:56,821
Time to man up.
And l ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1047
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:59,689
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1048
01:05:59,795 --> 01:06:02,889
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1049
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:08,365
Alpa and l's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1050
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:10,301
-Cool it, Benson.
-Sorry.

1051
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:15,901
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1052
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:19,277
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1053
01:06:23,018 --> 01:06:24,212
Okay.

1054
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,614
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1055
01:06:28,724 --> 01:06:31,818
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1056
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:35,158
-Huge profit margin.
-Guys!

1057
01:06:35,263 --> 01:06:38,198
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1058
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,029
Peck! We have it handled.

1059
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:42,626
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1060
01:06:42,738 --> 01:06:44,729
l got it. Got it.

1061
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:59,082
-Les Grossman.
<i>-We not get money yet.</i>

1062
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:01,748
Price now 100 million!

1063
01:07:01,857 --> 01:07:04,690
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1064
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:07,853
Great. Let me get this down.

1065
01:07:07,963 --> 01:07:09,396
100 million.

1066
01:07:09,498 --> 01:07:11,966
Wait! l got a better idea.

1067
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:14,599
lnstead of 100 million,

1068
01:07:14,703 --> 01:07:17,439
how about l send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1069
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:19,971
<i>Then you kill him! Do your thing!</i>
<i>Skin the fucking bastard!</i>

1070
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:22,270
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1071
01:07:22,377 --> 01:07:24,538
-No...
-ln the meantime, and as usual,

1072
01:07:24,646 --> 01:07:26,307
go fuck yourself!

1073
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,976
-No.
-We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1074
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:34,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1075
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:36,754
-l think l could've done that better.
-l thought it was good.

1076
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:38,155
They're gonna kill him!

1077
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:47,229
And we'll weep for him, in the press.

1078
01:07:48,136 --> 01:07:50,798
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1079
01:07:50,906 --> 01:07:54,842
Eventually, and l'm talking way,
way down the road,

1080
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:56,433
we file an insurance claim.

1081
01:07:56,545 --> 01:07:59,343
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1082
01:07:59,448 --> 01:08:03,179
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1083
01:08:05,287 --> 01:08:07,050
You can't be serious.

1084
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,685
Let's face it.

1085
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:14,819
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1086
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:19,223
Speedman is a dying star,

1087
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:22,565
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1088
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:25,401
That's physics. lt's inevitable.

1089
01:08:25,507 --> 01:08:28,840
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1090
01:08:28,944 --> 01:08:32,778
The universe is talking to us right now.

1091
01:08:32,881 --> 01:08:34,439
You just gotta listen.

1092
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:51,157
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1093
01:08:51,266 --> 01:08:52,358
Yeah.

1094
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:55,630
Ask and you shall receive.

1095
01:08:56,671 --> 01:09:00,801
-All right.
-You play ball, we play ball.

1096
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:04,276
l know you want the goodies.

1097
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,370
Welcome to the goody room.

1098
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:11,111
You paying attention?
'Cause l'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1099
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:12,481
That's how you're gonna roll.

1100
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:16,546
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1101
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:17,955
Yeah!

1102
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,722
Playa.

1103
01:09:20,595 --> 01:09:21,926
Playa!

1104
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,261
Big dick playa.

1105
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:26,357
Swinging past your knees!

1106
01:09:26,468 --> 01:09:27,492
Big dick, baby.

1107
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:28,796
Yep.

1108
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,734
Or you can grow a conscience

1109
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:37,209
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1110
01:09:42,184 --> 01:09:44,277
Let me get this straight.

1111
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:48,015
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1112
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:49,488
one of my best friends,

1113
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:54,221
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1114
01:09:55,363 --> 01:09:56,489
Yes.

1115
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,834
A G5 airplane?

1116
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:06,999
Yes.

1117
01:10:08,076 --> 01:10:10,772
And lots of money.

1118
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:14,308
Playa.

1119
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:18,413
Yeah!

1120
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:22,248
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1121
01:10:24,826 --> 01:10:27,488
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1122
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,061
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1123
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:33,691
Sorry, Jack.

1124
01:10:33,802 --> 01:10:36,066
She in heaven now.

1125
01:10:36,838 --> 01:10:40,103
Damn! l thought the movie was bad.

1126
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:43,336
She sleep forever.

1127
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:46,573
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1128
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:50,276
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1129
01:10:50,385 --> 01:10:54,185
l mean, this is Theater 101 ,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1130
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:55,415
He'll become a naturalist.

1131
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:57,218
-Yeah.
-Break down the aesthetic distance,

1132
01:10:57,325 --> 01:10:59,054
then the...

1133
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,357
Told you l'd tag you back.

1134
01:11:06,034 --> 01:11:08,298
Can l tell you that l'm sorry

1135
01:11:08,403 --> 01:11:10,701
for any offense l might've caused, man?

1136
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:13,171
-l just got caught up in...
-ln being a dumbass?

1137
01:11:13,275 --> 01:11:14,674
l guess so.

1138
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:17,472
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, l have no idea.

1139
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,876
-Neither do l.
-lt's beyond me.

1140
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,175
-lt's beyond me.
-You confused.

1141
01:11:21,283 --> 01:11:23,217
-l am a little confused.
-l know.

1142
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,616
But are we cool?

1143
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:28,052
Not really.

1144
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,452
Hey, man.

1145
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:35,256
-How's it going?
-Good. Yourself?

1146
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:37,388
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1147
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:40,366
l think l'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1148
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:42,095
Watch the stuff.

1149
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:44,228
-ls that cool?
-What? No!

1150
01:11:44,339 --> 01:11:46,239
We need you, Jeff.

1151
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:47,933
What are you talking about?

1152
01:11:48,043 --> 01:11:49,601
Okay, look, man.

1153
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:53,143
-l got something to tell you.
-Okay.

1154
01:11:55,383 --> 01:11:58,113
You know those jellybeans
l was eating?

1155
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:01,313
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1156
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:05,021
-They were drugs.
-Really?

1157
01:12:05,126 --> 01:12:09,495
l get down there near the mother lode,
l am done. l'm jonesing bad, man.

1158
01:12:09,597 --> 01:12:12,532
l'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1159
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:20,001
lf you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1160
01:12:21,376 --> 01:12:25,142
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, l'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1161
01:12:25,246 --> 01:12:28,113
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1162
01:12:28,216 --> 01:12:29,774
until it is out of my system.

1163
01:12:29,884 --> 01:12:31,511
l'm gonna say,
''Hey, man, l'm cool. lt's cool.

1164
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,177
''l'm finally better. l'm finally better.
Untie me.''

1165
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:36,485
Don't listen to me!
Anything l fucking say is a lie!

1166
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:37,922
You got it!

1167
01:12:38,593 --> 01:12:40,652
Goodbye, Mama!

1168
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:43,890
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1169
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:48,959
l'll see you tonight, when l go to bed,
in my head movies.

1170
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:54,500
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1171
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:06,782
Dang. Gilligan catching a kidney shot.

1172
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:11,454
-They got him on the move!
-That's torture, man.

1173
01:13:11,593 --> 01:13:14,460
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1174
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:16,757
l gotta get cracking on my costume.

1175
01:13:16,865 --> 01:13:18,264
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1176
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:19,390
Hell, yeah.

1177
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:22,834
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1178
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:25,633
-l sewed them patterns myself, baby.
-Let's roll out.

1179
01:13:57,639 --> 01:13:59,869
lt's a little twig man Oscar.

1180
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,881
l'm going to call you Half Squat.

1181
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:12,553
And you can call me

1182
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,918
Papa.

1183
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:40,142
Wow, look at all those stars.

1184
01:14:42,117 --> 01:14:44,085
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1185
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,022
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1186
01:14:49,157 --> 01:14:50,624
Man, that's beauty.

1187
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,620
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1188
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,028
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1189
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:00,994
Don't ignore me!

1190
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:03,969
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1191
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:07,165
-Hey, Kirk?
-Yeah?

1192
01:15:07,275 --> 01:15:10,108
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1193
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:11,610
'Cause l think she's hot.

1194
01:15:11,713 --> 01:15:15,080
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1195
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:19,176
Hey, guys, l'm good. l made it through.
You can untie me now.

1196
01:15:20,255 --> 01:15:21,586
Funny, huh?

1197
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:24,590
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1198
01:15:25,827 --> 01:15:28,728
lt's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1199
01:15:30,532 --> 01:15:32,591
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1200
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,998
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1201
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:36,161
No, it's Kevin.

1202
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:38,000
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1203
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:40,336
l didn't tell you, but <i>Fatties: Fart Three</i>
is coming down the pike,

1204
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:43,933
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1205
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:46,605
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1206
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,682
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1207
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,114
Jesus, man.

1208
01:15:51,152 --> 01:15:52,619
Hey, man.

1209
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,621
Remember way back when l said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1210
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:59,124
l'm sorry, man.
l did not mean that. She's not.

1211
01:15:59,227 --> 01:16:00,922
How about you, man?

1212
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:03,496
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1213
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:05,065
Me?

1214
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:07,930
l've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

1215
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:12,433
l was really hoping l'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1216
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,940
but that's not gonna happen.

1217
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,277
What about you, Masterblaster?

1218
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:20,006
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1219
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:24,847
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1220
01:16:24,953 --> 01:16:26,181
No. You missing me, man.

1221
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:28,084
l'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1222
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,383
How about it?

1223
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:31,284
Yeah.

1224
01:16:32,694 --> 01:16:34,662
Yeah, there is.

1225
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:38,095
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1226
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:40,099
No. l mean...

1227
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:45,036
l always wanted to, but l guess
l just never had the courage to ask.

1228
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:46,834
lt's... lt's complicated.

1229
01:16:46,941 --> 01:16:49,375
No! lt's simple as pie, man.

1230
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:52,071
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1231
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,809
''Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date.'' That's the end of story.

1232
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:58,613
-What's her name?
-Lance.

1233
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,483
''Listen here, Lance...''

1234
01:17:01,356 --> 01:17:05,156
Lance? What the fuck did l just hear?
Lance?

1235
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,989
-Did you say ''Lance''?
-No!

1236
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:09,029
-That sounded like ''Lance.''
-No, l said ''Nance.''

1237
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,291
-That's what l said, ''Nance.''
-lt sounded like ''Lance.''

1238
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:12,923
Look, l'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1239
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:14,695
l love the pussy! All right?

1240
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,702
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1241
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:18,169
When you wrote <i>l Love Tha Pussy</i>

1242
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:21,640
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1243
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:24,109
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1244
01:17:24,212 --> 01:17:27,147
-Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
-l'm not gay!

1245
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:28,272
This Hollywood.

1246
01:17:28,383 --> 01:17:29,441
How about we all get back to work?

1247
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:31,211
-Okay. Cool.
-This is ridiculous!

1248
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:34,220
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1249
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:41,626
Alpa, if you untie me,
l will literally suck your dick right now.

1250
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:44,960
l told you, for the last time,
l love the pussy!

1251
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:49,167
l'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1252
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,364
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1253
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:54,532
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1254
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:02,173
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1255
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:03,682
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1256
01:18:03,785 --> 01:18:05,548
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1257
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:07,348
Which, from what l can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1258
01:18:07,455 --> 01:18:09,013
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1259
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:12,581
<i>Land of Silk and Money</i> with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1260
01:18:12,694 --> 01:18:16,653
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1261
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:18,698
That might be our ride.

1262
01:18:28,509 --> 01:18:29,737
The straps are too tight!

1263
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:32,210
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1264
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:26,260
Okay.

1265
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:30,027
All right.

1266
01:19:30,138 --> 01:19:32,538
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1267
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,699
l'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1268
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:55,787
Get over here!

1269
01:19:57,165 --> 01:19:58,723
-What are you guys doing here?
-He has hands.

1270
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:01,233
-He killed Damien.
-Bullshit!

1271
01:20:01,335 --> 01:20:03,826
-He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
-Almost!

1272
01:20:03,938 --> 01:20:07,135
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1273
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:08,799
Sweet. Thank God.

1274
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:11,105
-We busting Speedman out.
-Speedman's here?

1275
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:22,112
They got my boom boom up here.

1276
01:20:22,223 --> 01:20:24,817
l take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1277
01:20:24,926 --> 01:20:26,188
l can give y'all a diversion.

1278
01:20:26,294 --> 01:20:30,230
l got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1279
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:14,174
Yes, your farm.

1280
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,946
Where is your farm,

1281
01:21:22,517 --> 01:21:23,984
American?

1282
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:28,083
My farm?

1283
01:21:30,024 --> 01:21:31,286
Oh, shit.

1284
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:35,256
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1285
01:21:35,363 --> 01:21:36,853
Yeah!

1286
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,794
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1287
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:47,000
Kwan-Lo!

1288
01:21:48,509 --> 01:21:50,409
l'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1289
01:21:50,912 --> 01:21:52,072
Yeah!

1290
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:56,845
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1291
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:59,215
Keep your head down on the ground!

1292
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,481
Nobody move or l do the little big guy!

1293
01:22:01,589 --> 01:22:05,025
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1294
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:07,754
Now show me where the drugs are.

1295
01:22:07,862 --> 01:22:09,659
What the fuck?

1296
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:11,459
That ain't the plan!

1297
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:13,261
Don't judge me!

1298
01:22:16,938 --> 01:22:18,701
He's got a real serious problem.

1299
01:22:19,507 --> 01:22:21,771
Hey! Hey, you!

1300
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:24,071
Take off your clothes!

1301
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:25,839
Take off your clothes!

1302
01:22:25,947 --> 01:22:27,244
What do we do now?

1303
01:22:27,348 --> 01:22:29,179
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1304
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,683
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1305
01:22:31,786 --> 01:22:35,153
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1306
01:22:35,256 --> 01:22:37,156
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1307
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:39,749
-Door!
-One, two, three!

1308
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,871
l go high, you go low.

1309
01:22:59,246 --> 01:23:03,114
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1310
01:23:03,217 --> 01:23:06,516
lf l see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1311
01:23:08,089 --> 01:23:09,522
Come on, come on!

1312
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:11,615
-Smoke grenade.
-Don't drop it now.

1313
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:13,851
Here.

1314
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:16,361
-What's this?
-l don't know what it's called.

1315
01:23:16,464 --> 01:23:19,058
l just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1316
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,693
Don't move, Matchbox,
or l will shoot you.

1317
01:23:22,803 --> 01:23:25,670
l'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1318
01:23:25,773 --> 01:23:27,502
l can still see you.

1319
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,740
Tugg!

1320
01:23:37,284 --> 01:23:38,444
Tugg?

1321
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:41,715
Gotcha.

1322
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:45,791
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1323
01:23:45,893 --> 01:23:47,019
Home?

1324
01:23:49,163 --> 01:23:52,997
But l'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1325
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,660
Don't you get it? l already am home.

1326
01:23:57,972 --> 01:24:01,100
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

1327
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,403
My son gave this to me.

1328
01:24:03,511 --> 01:24:07,003
-That's your stick buddy?
-His name is Twigman.

1329
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:08,945
Does he wanna come with us?

1330
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:30,966
Get the hell down!

1331
01:24:31,072 --> 01:24:34,132
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1332
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,640
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1333
01:24:35,743 --> 01:24:38,041
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

1334
01:24:42,683 --> 01:24:45,083
-Oh, shit, it's on!
-Over here!

1335
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:18,476
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1336
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:19,814
Smoke!

1337
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:27,354
Oh, shit!

1338
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:33,723
Jeff, don't!

1339
01:25:34,568 --> 01:25:36,559
lt doesn't matter what l do.

1340
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,639
l'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1341
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:43,733
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1342
01:25:43,844 --> 01:25:46,074
They only laugh at my farts.

1343
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,171
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1344
01:25:48,282 --> 01:25:49,874
This is all l deserve!

1345
01:26:10,037 --> 01:26:12,267
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1346
01:26:12,373 --> 01:26:15,774
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1347
01:26:17,311 --> 01:26:20,144
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1348
01:26:27,755 --> 01:26:29,347
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1349
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:32,391
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1350
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:38,196
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1351
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:42,295
Come on, let's go.

1352
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:44,337
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1353
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:46,099
He's on tilt status.

1354
01:26:46,207 --> 01:26:50,166
Same thing happened to me when
l played Neil Armstrong in <i>Moonshot.</i>

1355
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:52,370
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1356
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:55,710
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1357
01:27:01,222 --> 01:27:03,452
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1358
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:06,993
-No, fuck that! Just give me this.
-No time! l'll take care of this!

1359
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:10,129
All right. Give me your hooks.

1360
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:11,858
Don't worry,
l'm not gonna put them on again.

1361
01:27:11,966 --> 01:27:14,799
-Just give me your goddamn hooks.
-All right. Here.

1362
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:17,063
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1363
01:27:22,009 --> 01:27:24,170
Shit! Enough!

1364
01:27:24,278 --> 01:27:26,178
Fake shit!

1365
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:30,409
Fuck!

1366
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:41,288
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1367
01:27:41,395 --> 01:27:43,488
l'll take care of these yahoos!

1368
01:27:45,532 --> 01:27:47,796
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1369
01:27:47,902 --> 01:27:50,029
-''lt's me, Tugg!''
-lt's me, Tugg.

1370
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:51,604
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1371
01:27:51,705 --> 01:27:54,503
-Tugg who? l don't know. Who are you?
-Me?

1372
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:56,303
l know who l am!

1373
01:27:56,410 --> 01:28:00,141
l'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1374
01:28:00,247 --> 01:28:01,305
What?

1375
01:28:01,415 --> 01:28:03,508
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1376
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:06,313
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1377
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,682
and claims to know what dude he is...

1378
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:09,523
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1379
01:28:09,657 --> 01:28:10,749
...by playing other dudes?

1380
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,052
l know what dude l am!

1381
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,957
-You're scared.
-l ain't scared. Scared of what?

1382
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:16,324
Or scared of who?

1383
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:19,024
-Scared of who?
-Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1384
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:20,395
Scared of you.

1385
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:27,638
-Jesus.
-What's going on?

1386
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,265
The dudes are emerging.

1387
01:28:29,376 --> 01:28:30,707
He's right, you know.

1388
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:33,878
l am not

1389
01:28:35,449 --> 01:28:37,144
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1390
01:28:41,555 --> 01:28:43,022
We gotta roll out.

1391
01:28:43,123 --> 01:28:46,354
Nor am l Father O'Malley.

1392
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:51,530
Or Neil Armstrong.

1393
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:01,267
l think l might be nobody.

1394
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:03,836
Wow!

1395
01:29:03,944 --> 01:29:06,606
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1396
01:29:07,881 --> 01:29:10,850
-Everybody's got issues!
-Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1397
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:13,511
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1398
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,781
You're the whole reason
l got into acting.

1399
01:29:15,889 --> 01:29:17,720
l memorized every single monologue

1400
01:29:17,825 --> 01:29:20,419
you ever did
when l was in theater school.

1401
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,552
-Really?
-Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1402
01:29:22,663 --> 01:29:25,097
l saw <i>Scorcher l</i>
24 times when l was in eighth grade.

1403
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,168
That shit blew me away!
l got high to that shit! You the man!

1404
01:29:28,268 --> 01:29:31,396
Yeah, man, <i>Scorcher l</i> was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1405
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:35,635
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1406
01:29:35,743 --> 01:29:38,735
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1407
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:45,074
l'm a rooster illusion.

1408
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:46,379
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1409
01:29:46,487 --> 01:29:49,650
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1410
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:53,989
Come on, come on, come on.

1411
01:29:57,765 --> 01:29:59,699
Bingo! Move out.

1412
01:30:01,635 --> 01:30:03,000
Oh, God.

1413
01:30:04,972 --> 01:30:07,839
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1414
01:30:12,413 --> 01:30:13,880
Gotta hold on!

1415
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:21,419
Four Leaf!

1416
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,491
You grew hands?

1417
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:38,261
RPG, gentlemen!

1418
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,565
Where are you going?

1419
01:30:48,082 --> 01:30:50,607
Oh, my God.
l am moving to catering after this.

1420
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:13,970
My ass!

1421
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:18,542
My ass!

1422
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:23,412
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1423
01:31:23,517 --> 01:31:25,747
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1424
01:31:25,853 --> 01:31:30,153
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1425
01:31:30,257 --> 01:31:31,724
lt's Sandusky.

1426
01:31:33,594 --> 01:31:36,893
-Kevin Sandusky.
-That's my name.

1427
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:38,589
You remembered my name.

1428
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:40,724
Alpa, go help Cody.

1429
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:42,825
Portnoy, get Sandusky

-Let's go!

01:31:46,206 --> 01:31:47,730
Let's get out of here!

1432
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,110
Hey, Leaf!

1433
01:32:01,221 --> 01:32:02,449
-Leaf!
-Yeah.

1434
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:03,545
Hit the plunger

1435
01:32:03,657 --> 01:32:04,851
-as soon as they clear the bridge!
-Got it!

1436
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:08,961
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1437
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:12,594
-Come on! Move!
-Kirk! Wait!

1438
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:18,396
-What the hell is he doing?
-Laz, l'm gonna blow the bridge!

1439
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:19,699
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1440
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:22,400
You don't have to! You don't have to!

1441
01:32:22,509 --> 01:32:23,999
No, l can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1442
01:32:24,111 --> 01:32:26,636
No, l'm telling you, l'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1443
01:32:26,747 --> 01:32:29,580
l know it sounds weird,
but l have a connection with them.

1444
01:32:29,683 --> 01:32:33,517
-Get over here!
-l have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1445
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,178
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1446
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:37,519
He's my son. He's my boy!

1447
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:40,058
He needs me. l have to go back to him.

1448
01:32:43,197 --> 01:32:44,858
You tell the world what happened here.

1449

What happened here?

1450
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,130

You take care of the boys!

Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1455
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:06,612
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1456
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,914
-You've got hands.

1466
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,026
Look.

1467
01:34:49,656 --> 01:34:50,987
Think he's done.

1468
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:52,319
Cover me!

1469
01:34:53,393 --> 01:34:56,328
-Come on!
-Wait, come back!

1470
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:58,159
How do we cover him?

1471
01:35:02,402 --> 01:35:05,739
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1472
01:35:05,906 --> 01:35:08,500
-You all right, man?
-l'm cold.

1473
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:10,599
l can't feel my legs.

1474
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:13,646
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1475
01:35:13,747 --> 01:35:14,941
-No worries.
-Good.

1476
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:16,345
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1477
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,748
-You guys came back for me.
-Course.

1478
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:21,184
Hey! l want you to know something.

1479
01:35:21,288 --> 01:35:22,482

1480
01:35:23,657 --> 01:35:25,454
l know who you are.

1481
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,324
You're my friend.

1482
01:35:31,598 --> 01:35:33,225
You're my brother.

1483
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:36,934
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1484
01:35:37,037 --> 01:35:38,402
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

1485
01:35:38,505 --> 01:35:41,338
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

1486
01:35:41,441 --> 01:35:42,430
Really?

1487
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:44,032
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

1488
01:35:44,144 --> 01:35:45,611
Jesus, let's go, man!

1489
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:47,179
All right?

1490
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:50,182
