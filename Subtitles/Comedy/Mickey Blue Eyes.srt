Very risky.

00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,144
Right. Well, thanks.

89
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,280

a lot better.

get this straight.

That's it, is it?

97
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,355
That's your response
to this?

98
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,724
All right, guys,
load it up.

but, uh...

119
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,585
Having said that,
i think every auction house

120
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,653

delivery hiccups sometimes.

00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:01,400
This way?

366
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,969
Hey, good luck
with them trucks.

367
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,003
Thanks.

368
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,137
Look, mr. Vitale,

369
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,338
It's really nice
to meet you at last,

370
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,605
But i actually
just dropped by

371
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:09,939
To ask you
a question.

372
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,974
Is that right?
A question?

373
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:15,177
I think i have an idea
what that question might be.

374
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,712
But if we're gonna
do this right,

375
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:18,879
Don't you think

376
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,080
We should get to
know each other first?

377
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:24,083
Uh, yeah.
I suppose so.

378
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,686
You know something,
michael?

379
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,955
I think
i'm gonna like you.

380
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,458
I believe very deeply
in first impressions.

381
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,059
I fell in love with
my wife at first sight.

382
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,094
And the minute
they showed

383
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,062
That charles manson
on the news,

384
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:43,131
I said, "i know this
guy's up to no good."

385
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,235
Now i see you for
the first time, and...

386
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,103
I know
you love my daughter.

387
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:51,505
Look, mr. Vitale--

388
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:52,572
Uh!

389
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:54,140
Frank.
Frank.

390
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,541
Come on. I want
to show you something.

391
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:59,110
For chrissakes, ritchie,
i can't hear myself think!

392
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,112
What's wrong with you?

393
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:03,147
I don't know!

394
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,382
¶ we are family ¶

395
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:07,183
¶ hey-hey-hey-hey-ee-ya ¶

396
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:09,818
Kid's got a 174 iq,
and what do you get?

397
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,153
An idiot.
He's my son,

398
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,054
And i love him.

399
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,556
And i wish there was
another word. There isn't.

400
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,659
Mr. Vitale,
do you have a bathroom?

401
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:22,128
Yeah, down the hall there.
You can't miss it.

402
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,263
Come upstairs
when you're through.

403
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,664
[man shivers]

404
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,040
Take a look at this.

405
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,008
Um, mr. Vitale.

406
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,344
There's a man in the freezer.

407
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:17,546
I know.
Maintenance.

408
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:20,748
Come here, come here.
Come here.

409
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:25,252
You recognize this person?

410
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:26,920
The best student they ever had.

411
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,255
Here she is with her mother.

412
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,125
Gina has her eyes,
you'll notice.

413
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:35,226
About a week after this,

414
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,194
Her mother passed away.

415
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:40,697
And a week after that,
gina was back at school

416
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,432
Studying harder than before

417
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,434
And coming home every night

418
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:47,603
Trying to take care
of me and ritchie.

419
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:50,472
She's still doing it.

420
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,373
I apologize.

421
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,174
[sniffles]

422
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:59,112
But as you may have
guessed, i am...

423
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,314
Crazy about my gina.

424
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,983
Oh, my god.
I am so thrilled

425
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,351
That she met someone

426
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,820
Who knows exactly how
she deserves to be treated.

427
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:09,121
Right.

428
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:10,388
Like a fuckin' princess.

429
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,891
Right.
You know, mr. Vitale,

430
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,826
I think i should
really tell you

431
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:17,060
About what happened
tonight.

432
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:22,064
Whoa, michael.
I got a confession to make.

433
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,432
I already know.

434
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:24,366
Oh, you do?

435
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:25,867
Her doorman called me.

436
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,201
Oh, no, no.

437
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:28,936
When he called
with the good news,

438
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,337
I knew.

439
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,739
This michael,
he's a gentleman.

440
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,074
He's coming to ask
for my daughter's hand.

441
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:38,577
So, go ahead.

442
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,051
May i...

443
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,755
Please have your daughter's
hand in marriage...

444
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,489
Mr. Vitale?

445
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,459
Frank?

446
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,696
Dad.

447
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,631
Yes.

448
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,466
Ah, what a kid.

449
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,401
Yeah!

450
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,546
[knock on door]

451
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:24,982
I'm sleeping, daddy.

452
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,650
Gina.

453
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:28,785
It's me.

454
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:39,160
I love you so much.

455
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:41,462
I love you.

456
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,164
Then why did you
have to do this?

457
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:46,499
Everything
was perfect.

458
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,933
Why did you have
to go and ruin it?

459
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:49,668
I didn't mean to.

460
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,903
I just thought, you know--

461
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,005
No, i know,
and i do.

462
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,841
I do so much.

463
00:20:56,843 --> 00:21:02,146
Well, then, that's great.
That's fantastic.

464
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:04,581
But i can't. I...

465
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,882
I just can't!

466
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,916
Gina, i'm not following.

467
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,218
What's happening?

468
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,652
I can't talk about this
in the house.

469
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:13,919
No.

470
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,054
So where are we going?

471
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,389
Out.

472
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,691
Right. Nowhere
too dressy, i hope.

473
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,165
Uh, gina.

474
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,833
Ohh!

475
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:36,269
I can't marry you
because of my father.

476
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:38,504
Your father?

477
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,972
Gina...

478
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:42,807
I just met
your father.

479
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,509
I loved him.

480
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,444
Well, i needed
this address,

481
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:50,280
So i went to
the the<i> trattoria.</i>

482
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,115
I met some
of your relations.

483
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:53,816
Ok.

484
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:55,784
Keep walking.

485
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,819
So, who'd you meet?

486
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,520
Nice uncle vito?

487
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:01,621
Yeah.

488
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:04,690
Full name--vito graziosi.
That ring any bells?

489
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,358
Was it boxing?

490
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,593
Vito "the butcher" graziosi.

491
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,195
He's the head of
the graziosi crime family.

492
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,864
Did you meet johnny?
Johnny graziosi.

493
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,334
He just finished 8 years
in sing sing for loansharking.

494
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,438
Vinnie?
Vinnie "the shrimp" d'agostino?

495
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,040
20 years for double murder!

496
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,474
Do you get the picture now?

497
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,310
I don't understand.
Are you saying

498
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,079
Your dad's some kind
of mob caterer?

499
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:35,551
My father was in prison
till i was 8, michael.

500
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,553
He's one of them.

501
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,060
Wow.

502
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,497
Just keep walking.

503
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,568
I should have told you
months ago,

504
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,637
Or just walked away.
Normally i would have,

505
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,905
But i couldn't
because i was so happy.

506
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,474
Listen. I don't want
to marry your father.

507
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:06,043
But you will, michael,
whether you like it or not.

508
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,611
Him and his friends.

509
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,913
And i can't let that happen
to you because i love you,

510
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,849
And everything they touch
ends up spoiled and corrupted.

511
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,617
Wait a minute.
This is ridiculous.

512
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:18,454
For a start, i might
not be corruptible.

513
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,457
It's a little favor,
a tiny lie, and you're theirs.

514
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,026
Believe me,
i've seen it.

515
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,061
I'm sorry, it's just...

516
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:28,830
It's just over, michael.

517
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,968
Well, no.

518
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,436
I'm sorry,

519
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,837
But i've waited all
my life to find someone

520
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,306
I love as much
as i love you.

521
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:42,474
I'm just not
gonna let this

522
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:45,276
Or anyone
come between us.

523
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,713
Not vito the butcher
or vinnie the baker

524
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,248
Or anyone involved in any
kind of food preparation.

525
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,682
That's it.
End of story.

526
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,717
But you don't know
how clever they are.

527
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,652
No, but you do,
presumably,

528
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:00,888
And you can tell me.
We can do this together.

529
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,858
Completely together?

530
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,159
Completely.

531
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,593
I swear.

532
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,363
Now just give in.

533
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,764
Marry me.

534
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,501
Yeah.

535
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:25,473
Smile.
You're engaged.

536
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,476
Great. Now just
gina and michael.

537
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:29,877
Over here, i think.

538
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,112
Man: Happy engagement,
you guys!

539
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,180
Ok, ok.

540
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,347
Say "cheese."

541
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,716
You're right.
He does talk funny.

542
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:40,251
You're really
getting into this.

543
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,685
I know, i know.

544
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,653
My therapist suggested it

545
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,222
As a way to get over
my little blip.

546
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:47,256
I know.

547
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,523
I think
it's really working.

548
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:51,292
I feel terrific.
Especially tonight.

549
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:54,861
I am so happy for you guys.

550
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,128
Excuse me.

551
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,731
Bad breakup.
Long story.

552
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,932
Hey!

553
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,167
Let's go say hello
to uncle vito.

554
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,535
Come on.

555
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,270
Here we go.

556
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,138
Hey!

557
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,544
<i>Molto grazie.</i>

558
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:19,946
Hey, uncle vito.

559
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:21,113
Hey, kid.

560
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,415
Don't you look beautiful.

561
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,849
Ah.

562
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:29,152
Always so beautiful.

563
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,720
You're like a flower.

564
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:32,555
Well, you, too,
uncle vito.

565
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,623
This is so nice of you.
We were really planning

566
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,624
Something much smaller.

567
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,825
Oh, yes, thank you.

568
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,259
<i>Niente.</i>

569
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:40,361
Your school.

570
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:42,096
How is everything?

571
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,564
It's pretty good.

572
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,300
Only 2 shootings
last week.

573
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,934
It's got me sick
with worry.

574
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:50,436
Why do you want
to worry your father?

575
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:51,904
You wanna transfer?

576
00:25:51,906 --> 00:25:54,740
I have a friend of a friend
in the supervisor's office.

577
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:57,042
Thank you.
I'll let you know.

578
00:25:57,044 --> 00:26:00,011
Oh. So...

579
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,712
Michael.

580
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:05,982
Are your family coming
over for the wedding?

581
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:06,816
No. I, uh--

582
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,083
Michael's
an orphan.

583
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,284
He was.

584
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:12,386
I'm sorry to hear that.

585
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:13,587
Mmm.

586
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,455
Tell me, michael.

587
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,490
I'm interested to know.

588
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,725
Coming from
a foreign culture,

589
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,127
You must have
a different perspective

590
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,595
On all these killings.

591
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,132
Well, um...

592
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:32,801
Yeah, to speak honestly,

593
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:35,837
I can't say
i really approve,

594
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,372
But my understanding
is that it's all

595
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,606
Part of your business,

596
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:41,808
And that people
only get killed

597
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,243
Who bring it
on themselves.

598
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:46,812
Um...

599
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,215
The killings
at gina's high school.

600
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,553
I'm against them.

601
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,021
Ah!

602
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,957
Vito, what do you say
we show him around the house?

603
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,798
Vito: 250,000.

604
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,299
You think
it's worth that?

605
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,566
Well, like i say,

606
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:15,434
That's the great thing
about an auction.

607
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,735
An object is worth

608
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,571
Whatever anyone
is willing to pay for it.

609
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:22,073
That's an interesting
perspective.

610
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,507
Now...

611
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,343
Tell me what you think
of this one.

612
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,613
You like it?

613
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:38,451
Michael:
Wow. It's very...

614
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:40,719
Intriguing, isn't it?

615
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:44,522
Tell me, why does jesus
have a machine gun there?

616
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,156
Vito: It's symbolic.

617
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:47,390
You have to ask johnny.

618
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,459
He does them
as part of his therapy.

619
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,428
You have a very
gifted son, vito.

620
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,629
No two ways
about it.

621
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,697
I must say,
i like the way...

622
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,498
The blood sort of
oozes out of his--

623
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,399
I like that.

624
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,833
[laughs]

625
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:03,734
Yeah. He's a very
talented kid,

626
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:05,135
Wouldn't you say,
michael?

627
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:08,171
Yes, yes, i think
he certainly has something.

628
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,006
<i>Grazie.</i>

629
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,708
I'm flattered
that you like it.

630
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,243
Uh, listen, michael.

631
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:17,111
We should talk.

632
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,447
I have friends
in various fields

633
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,614
That would
be delighted

634
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,049
To help
a friend of mine.

635
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,950
Well, um...

636
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:28,718
That's extremely kind of you,

637
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,254
But i've always had
this silly thing

638
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:35,656
About standing on my own
two feet in business.

639
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:37,723
I hope...

640
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,258
You understand.

641
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,064
Of course.

642
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,967
I respect
your feeling.

643
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,246
¶ you're nobody ¶

644
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:10,282
¶ till somebody loves you ¶

645
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:15,019
I'm so proud of you.

646
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,755
No. You see,
i am so proud of you.

647
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,223
No, you.
No, you.

648
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:20,224
Oh, shut up.

649
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,291
All right.

650
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,327
[camera clicks]
perfect.

651
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,330
I am so happy for you.

652
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,598
One more.

653
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,999
¶ go find yourself ¶

654
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:35,468
¶ somebody to love ¶

655
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:38,003
[applause]

656
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,881
[humming]

657
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:54,284
Talk to helen
about tonight's catalog.

658
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:58,988
Rent<i> goodfellas, casino,</i>
<i>godfather i, ii, iii.</i>

659
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:02,891
Excuse me.
Can i help you?

660
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,761
How much
is this one?

661
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,964
On this, the reserve
is 30,000, i think.

662
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:13,899
That being, of course,

663
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:16,368
The opening bid
on tonight's auction.

664
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,602
Oh.

665
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:18,703
Do you have
much experience

666
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,304
When it comes
to buying art?

667
00:30:20,306 --> 00:30:25,375
No, but i hear it can be
a good investment.

668
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:27,377
Yes.

669
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,878
My father

670
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,814
Recently died...

671
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,716
And left me some money.

672
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,084
Your father.

673
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,453
That must have been
a terrible shock.

674
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:41,456
You know, if, um...
If you're just looking

675
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,057
For something beautiful
to put on your wall,

676
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,525
You might like to think
about a mirror.

677
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,326
[laughing loudly]

678
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:49,729
Oh...

679
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,864
You.

680
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,266
I really want a painting.

681
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:55,267
Yeah.

682
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,268
Michael.

683
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,068
Can i have a word?

684
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,936
One moment.
I tell you what.

685
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:01,204
Tonight if there's
a nice painting

686
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,072
Going for less than
it's really worth,

687
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,740
Perhaps we could
work out a way

688
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,441
In which i could let
you know about it.

689
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,709
You mean like a signal?

690
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,843
Exactly.

691
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:11,344
Listen.
I have an important

692
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,512
Potential client
i have to talk to,

693
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:14,746
So i'm gonna
leave helen here

694
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,180
To work out
the exact details

695
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,347
Of this with you.
Where is he?

696
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:21,050
Not here yet,
but the trucks are.

697
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,451
That means
they're early.

698
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:25,287
Yeah. Incredible, huh?

699
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,055
Fantastic. Ok.

700
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,289
Bye.

701
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,124
Hello.

702
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,258
What?

703
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,930
So that's everything.

704
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,398
Yes, sir, all 44 pieces.

705
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,001
I just want you to know
if i've said anything

706
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,469
Or done anything
in the past

707
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,504
That in any way offended
you, i'm, uh...

708
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,673
Very deeply sorry.

709
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,675
Ah.

710
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,510
Well, uh, thanks.

711
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,285
Michael.

712
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,353
Michael.

713
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,821
Are you ok?

714
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,222
Sorry. Yes,
yes, i'm fine.

715
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:13,525
Just, this
morning's delivery

716
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:14,726
Was complete
and on time.

717
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,294
It was
a bit of a shock.

718
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:17,094
I can imagine.

719
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,096
Morganson's here.

720
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:21,932
I thought that you could
soften him up a bit,

721
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:22,999
And then i'll move in
for the kill.

722
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,867
Absolutely.

723
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,168
Lovely.

724
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,203
We do like to think
that we can

725
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:30,371
Match sotheby's
in the 2 qualities

726
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,306
Most important
to any auction house.

727
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,207
One being, obviously,
a tradition

728
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,942
Of unquestioned
respectability.

729
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,110
And the other being,
um...

730
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:39,377
For want
of a better word,

731
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,312
Shall we say class?

732
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:51,788
Well, i know mr. Cromwell
is anxious to talk to you.

733
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,356
[breathing heavily]

734
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,594
I'm sorry, michael.
I'm confused.

735
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,028
What's the problem?

736
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,531
Well, mr. Graziosi wants me
to auction it for $50,000.

737
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,267
No one--i mean,
people would pay $50,000

738
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:08,502
Just to avoid being in
the same room as this thing.

739
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:09,302
Michael, please.

740
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,304
Your trucks show up on time

741
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,572
For the first time
in god knows how long.

742
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,740
And you--you get to give
a little happiness

743
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:16,974
To an important friend.

744
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,742
So, i mean,
what's the matter with you?

745
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:19,743
I thought you'd be happy.

746
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:20,944
No. Mr. Vitale--

747
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:22,045
No. Dad.

748
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,312
No,
you don't understand.

749
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:24,546
This is exactly what
gina said would happen.

750
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:26,581
This is her--i mean,
if she even found out

751
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,783
That this thing had been
sent over here--

752
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:30,918
Gina. You're early.

753
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,985
Hi.

754
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,419
Just on the phone
with your dad.

755
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,686
Oh, let me talk.

756
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:35,853
Yeah.

757
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,554
Hey, you. Ah.
Oh, oh.

758
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,788
Mmm.
[chuckles]

759
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,089
Daddy,
you got my message?

760
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:42,424
Great. And everything's
ok for tomorrow?

761
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:43,458
[snaps]

762
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,727
And tomorrow at noon's
ok for the fittings?

763
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:47,828
Ok, well,
here's the deal.

764
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,763
Now, i'm gonna be there,

765
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:51,998
And carol is gonna
come along, too,

766
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,299
To take photos.

767
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,634
No. She's doing
the whole wedding,

768
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,335
So be nice.

769
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,537
We have to talk about
the wedding reception.

770
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,538
Gina!

771
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,505
Whoo.

772
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:04,774
Now, i know you and mom
used louie's,

773
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,776
But...

774
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,443
Hold on.

775
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,713
[laughing]
no.

776
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:15,782
We do have 2 key attributes

777
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:18,618
For which, in this business,
there is no substitute.

778
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,685
The first being, obviously,

779
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,421
A tradition of unparalleled
respectability.

780
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:24,423
And the other being,
shall we say,

781
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,124
For want of
a better word--

782
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:31,594
We'll come back later.

783
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,062
[chuckles]

784
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:35,264
Michael: Right.

785
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,198
Fine.

786
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,933
You know what, daddy?
We have to go.

787
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,467
Ok, i love you, too.

788
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,335
He wants to say bye.

789
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:45,337
Yeah?

790
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,272
Frank: Look,
it's gonna be ok.

791
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,040
Uh, you put the thing
up for auction.

792
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,342
It don't sell.
Gina will never know.

793
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:54,445
Oh, i don't think
i can do that. Ha ha.

794
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:56,013
Um, listen.

795
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:58,815
This favor...
If you don't do it,

796
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:00,183
It's really
not that great.

797
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,350
I mean, not for you,

798
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:03,018
And to be honest
with you, not for me.

799
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,153
So, we'll just
do it this once,

800
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:07,088
And i'll talk to vito
and explain, uh...

801
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,289
How in the future

802
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,424
You two would prefer
to go it alone, ok?

803
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,160
Heh heh.
Is that a promise, dad?

804
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,693
Yes, that's a promise.

805
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,029
Fabulous.

806
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,663
Noon tomorrow, then,
it is.

807
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:20,664
Ok, bye.

808
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,399
What is wrong with you?

809
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,601
Yeah. Yeah.

810
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:25,868
You...Come here.

811
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,436
Mmm!

812
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,404
[laughs]

813
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:30,705
Yeah.

814
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:34,875
I swear to god, frankie,
i ain't got the money!

815
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:35,909
[pants]

816
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,076
All right.

817
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:38,743
Now i gotta put you
on mountain climb.

818
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:42,245
[beeping]

819
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:54,422
We worked out
the signals.

820
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:55,222
What?

821
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,090
With the old lady.

822
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:59,592
If you want her to start
bidding, you cough.

823
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:00,859
Ok, easy enough.

824
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,627
If you want her
to stop bidding,

825
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,528
You just say "ha."

826
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,662
Fine.

827
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,597
What? Say what?

828
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,898
"ha."

829
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,166
"ha"?

830
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,403
Ok. Good evening,

And so to our final piece

835

00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,701
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

You snuck that last one
in on me, didn't you?

859
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:51,113
Yes, i'm afraid so.
I'm sorry. I--

860
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:53,081
Do that more often.

861

Congratulations.

862
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,984

I'm sorry.

865
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,121
Met somewhere?

866
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,388
I don't believe so.

867
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,589
But may i ask,

868
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:07,058
Do either of you gentlemen
enjoy steak?

869
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,526
Very much so.

Honey, really.

Hey, johnny,

880
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:28,007
Nothing's
going on.

884
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:40,717
Listen, it sold.

885
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,186
D-did you know that
the painting actually sold?

886
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,555
I heard. That's great.

887
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,290
Did you talk to, um...

888
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,457
Your friend?

889
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,791
I mean,

Nah, i don't know.
Some art place.

00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:58,648
There are some men here
to see you from the fbi.

909
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,218
Good.

910
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,619
Good, good.

911
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:10,524
Michael: We often sell works
by first-time artists.

912
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,893
I, uh, don't see how
this time is any different.

913
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:14,060
The difference is

914
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,594
That this painting
was bought

915
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,861
By a restaurant owner

916
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:20,130
Who owed the artist's
father $50,000.

917
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:21,331
It's a setup.
You get it?

918
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,965
They bought it
from themselves.

919
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:23,999
I don't understand.

920
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,768
If someone buys
your painting for 50,000,

921
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,769
You make 50,000,

922
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,070
But if they already
owed you the money,

923
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,104
You make nothing.

924
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:31,672
It's called
money laundering.

925
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:33,473
Ah.

926
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,107
Lewis: You mind?

927
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:36,641
Not at all, no.

928
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,877
They do it through
car washes,

929
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,245
Restaurants, bars,

930
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,313
And last night,
through you.

931
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,214
Have you at any time

932
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:46,782
Come into contact
with anyone

933
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:48,216
Who you thought
might be connected

934
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:51,586
With organized crime
of any kind?

935
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:53,354
[lewis strikes match]

936
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:54,822
Absolutely not.

937
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,757
Connell:
You sure about that?

938
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,626
I am positive.

939
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:19,043
Ha.

940
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,812
Are we ok
to see michael?

941
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,115
Oh, he's in
with the fbi.

942
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,183
Ah. Lovely.

943
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,652
Hmm.
Perhaps later, then.

944
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,387
Have you had lunch?

945
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,654
Ah.

946
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:39,593
Well, thank you very much
indeed for the warning.

947
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:41,494
And, uh, if anything
like this crops up again,

948
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,195
I'll certainly be in touch.

949
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:44,996
We'd appreciate that.

950
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:48,265
We're dealing with something
pretty ugly here.

951
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:49,299
Here's my card.

952
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:50,400
Thank you.

953
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:51,601
And, uh...
Thank you.

954
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:52,969
Oh, those.
Thanks.

955
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:57,406

00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,007

957
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,742
Good. Thank you.

958
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,376
Michael.

959
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:03,510
I know what
you're thinkin'.

960
00:42:03,512 --> 00:42:06,279
It's ok. Relax.

961

962
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:09,749
Where did you want this?

963
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,053
In my office.
Thank you.

964
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,721

It turns out
that vito and johnny

968
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,564
Are taking more
of a liking to the idea

969
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:30,898
Than any of us

970
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,933
Had perhaps originally
anticipated. That's all.

971
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:34,634
God almighty!
It's out of control.

972
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,968
You can't control it,
can you?

973
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,802
No. Listen, now.

974
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,637
It is not
out of control.

Well, i have to tell gina.
I have to tell her.

976
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,173
Look, tonight...

977
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:44,308
Tonight is your last auction
of the season, right?

all you have to do

979
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:46,743
Is keep gina
away from there.

you come back,

will be taken care of.

I'm not doing it.

I have to tell her.

Michael, please.

You know gina's happiness
means more to me

00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,085
Than anything
in the world.

988
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:00,719
You know that, right?

989
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:05,456
If you tell her now
that you already lied,

990
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,857
It's all over.

we should talk about that.

I know it sounds silly.

I'm just thinking
i might not--

1017
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:15,573
Just might not
be able to see the bids,

you know...

Certainly,
to let this go for 110

the greatest magnitude.

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,472
A friend of ours.

1315
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:52,540
I thought big mickey

1316
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:55,175
The father. This is
little big mickey.

1317
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,210
Wasn't there

1318
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:58,477

1320
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,046

1321
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:04,848
Oh, so you work

1322
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,283
[grunts]

1323
00:56:07,285 --> 00:56:08,651
Who you got over there?

1324
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,152

1325

Al: Yeah.

1326
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:12,287
Frank: I thought he was
in witness protection.

1327
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,388
Al: Took us 7 years.

1328
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,023
Tracked him
and whacked him. Yeah.

1329
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:18,125
"tracked him
and whacked him."

1330
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:20,127
So, uh,
who's your guy?

1331
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:22,395
He's a nobody.

1332
00:56:22,397 --> 00:56:24,530
Frankie, come on.
We showed you ours.

1333
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,499
What? We in the
second grade over here?

1334
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:30,435
He's a witness. I really
can't talk about it.

1335
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,170
Well, then,
i guess we should

1336
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:33,304
Get these guys
in the ground, huh?

1337
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,338
Frank:
Good, good.

1338
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,772
Good to see you.
You, too, huh?

1339
00:56:35,774 --> 00:56:37,173
Mickey blue.

1340
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:38,574
God bless.
Take care.

1341
00:56:38,576 --> 00:56:39,541
Mickey.

1342
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:42,043
Come on, let's go.
We got to move him.

1343
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:43,344
Come on, come on.

1344
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:44,845
Oh, my god.

1345
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:46,680
I got to dig?

1346
00:56:46,682 --> 00:56:48,048
Yeah, you dig.
It's your turn.

1347
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,149
You shot him
in the head.

1348
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,383
Yeah, so?
I whacked him. You dig.

1349
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:52,184
[both grunting]

1350
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:53,518
You know what?
What?

1351
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,852
I wish i was him.

1352
00:56:54,854 --> 00:56:55,853
No, you don't.

1353
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:58,855
No, you're right.
I wish you were him.

1354
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,058
Here, here,
here, here.

1355
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,592
Wipe yourself.

1356
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:09,296
Oh. You got
a hundred-dollar bill?

1357
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:10,463
Why?

1358
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,798
Get in the car.
Don't worry about it.

1359
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,133
Look, one thing.

1360
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:17,735
If any of this
gets out,

1361
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:20,404
I'm the one that
shot johnny, ok?

1362
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:23,873
Can we at least
agree on that?

1363
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,009
You got it.

1364
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,352
You all right?

1365
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:39,053
You got my messages?

1366
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,454
[sighs]

1367
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:43,790
You buried him,
and then you dug him up,

1368
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:46,526
And now you don't know
where he is.

1369
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:49,128
No, not exactly.

1370
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,631
Yeah,
i got your messages.

1371
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:56,667
So, how you feeling?

1372
00:57:58,337 --> 00:58:00,136
Well, obviously,
it's my first murder.

1373
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:03,372
On top of which, i feel
like i'm going crazy,

1374
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:05,006
And i'm scared, and...

1375
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:07,041
And the one person
i want to turn to

1376
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:09,443
Turns out to be
a liar and a fraud,

1377
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:11,878
But other than that...

1378
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,212
I'm not a liar.

1379
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:15,447
I mean, yes.
I am a liar.

1380
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,215
Just let me--
[bell rings]

1381
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:19,450
Oh. Well,
i don't think i can.

1382
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:21,185
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1383
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:22,586
Wait. Wait.

1384
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,221
Hold out your hand.

1385
00:58:26,524 --> 00:58:29,124
Here. Just...

1386
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:30,625
Hang on to it

1387
00:58:30,627 --> 00:58:33,160
Till i've had
a chance to explain.

1388
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:37,496
Come over
for lunch tomorrow,

1389
00:58:37,498 --> 00:58:40,232
And i'll listen to
what you have to say.

1390
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,403
This is patrick richards,

1391
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:47,505
Reporting from central park,

1392
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,773
Where police this morning
found the body

1393
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:52,041
Of 31-year-old
jonathan graziosi,

1394
00:58:52,043 --> 00:58:54,910
Son of reputed mob boss
vito graziosi.

1395
00:58:54,912 --> 00:58:57,078
Sources tell us
the body was found

1396
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,181
With a rolled-up $100 bill
in one of the nostrils,

1397
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:03,851
Calling card of the notorious
risolli crime family.

1398
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:05,552
Johnny graziosi
was at the beginning

1399
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:07,253
Of a flourishing art career.

1400
00:59:33,414 --> 00:59:35,547
Tony risolli called.

1401
00:59:35,549 --> 00:59:37,215
They want to talk.

1402
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:40,951
Ok. Set it up.

1403
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,989
Soon as they pull up,
we should blow them away.

1404
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:53,227
Let's listen to what
they got to say, huh?

1405
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:15,448
[unintelligible
squeaky, hoarse voice]

1406
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,917
Man: Mr. Risolli
says he swears

1407
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:19,952
On the soul
of his mother

1408
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,620
He had nothing
to do with this.

1409
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,855
Then who?

1410
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:30,595
[unintelligible
squeaky, hoarse voice]

1411
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:33,297
A cop in the 20th
precinct tipped us.

1412
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:36,333
They towed johnny's car
from in front of a building

1413
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:37,434
On the upper west side.

1414
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:39,902
That's the address.

1415
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,038
Go.

1416
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,640
No, wait.

1417
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,510
You don't want everyone
stomping around up there

1418
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:53,778
Like a bunch of goddamn
elephants, scaring people away.

1419
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,914
How about i go in there
with a detective's badge,

1420
01:00:56,916 --> 01:01:00,317
You know, ask around,
keep it quiet?

1421
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,787
We find the right zebra,
we tear him to pieces.

1422
01:01:18,636 --> 01:01:21,737
¶ i look up
and see your picture ¶

1423
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:23,538
Toy:
Tickle my tummy.

1424
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,674
Ha ha ha ha.

1425
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:30,310
¶ i have you smile just for me ¶

1426
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:34,747
¶ it brings back

1427
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:38,549
¶ of a love that used to be ¶

1428
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:40,117
[knocking on door]

1429
01:01:41,787 --> 01:01:43,052
Which apartment

1430
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:45,054
Was the old lady in
that saw us with johnny?

1431
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:47,055
Why?

1432
01:01:48,825 --> 01:01:51,025
They know he was here.

1433
01:01:51,027 --> 01:01:51,892
Oh, god.

1434
01:01:51,894 --> 01:01:54,694
We need to talk
to her about it.

1435
01:02:02,736 --> 01:02:03,801
What's that?

1436
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,002
What are you
gonna do?

1437
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:07,170
Michael, please.
I am not gonna hurt her.

1438
01:02:07,172 --> 01:02:08,371
No, listen--

1439
01:02:08,373 --> 01:02:10,473
Michael, if we don't do this,
we're both gonna die.

1440
01:02:10,475 --> 01:02:11,540
Mrs. Horton: Who is it?

1441
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:13,542
It's michael felgate

1442
01:02:13,544 --> 01:02:14,709
And his harmless
friend frank.

1443
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:16,977
No, mrs. Horton,
do not open--

1444
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:18,144
What?

1445
01:02:18,146 --> 01:02:18,944
Mrs. Horton, we said

1446
01:02:18,946 --> 01:02:19,978
Please open the door.

1447
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,779
You're michael's friend?

1451
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,593
Oh. What are you guys
doing here?

1452
01:02:38,595 --> 01:02:40,161
Hey, frankie,

1453
01:02:40,163 --> 01:02:42,863
Mr. Risolli thought
we should check it out.

1454
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:44,364
Hey, mickey blue.

1455
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,599

Whoo, me.

01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:57,040
But most of the people
are at work.

1462
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:59,342
How about
we grab some steak

1463
01:02:59,344 --> 01:03:01,277
And we all come back
later this afternoon?

1464
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:04,380
Do we look like we ever
said no to a steak?

1465
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,714
And i got
the perfect place.

1466
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,482
You'll love it, frank.

And save you going back
with your rope.

1494
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,825
You thought that was
for strangling her?

1495

Well, what else
was it for?

1496
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:09,995
To tie her up so i can
take her up to my cabin.

I think you're
the kind of person

for carrying a dead body.

What are they doing?
They're talking to kansas city.

1593
01:08:10,145 --> 01:08:12,145
But they still
can't connect us to johnny

1594
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:13,746
If i get to the old lady
before they do.

1595
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:15,013
But she won't be there.

1596
01:08:15,015 --> 01:08:17,180
She's playing cards,
gets home about 3:00.

01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,749
Oh, no.

1598
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:20,750

01:08:20,752 --> 01:08:22,151
Oh, no!

I missed meeting
gina for lunch.

1601
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:26,621
So give her a call.
Explain what happened.

1602
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:27,888
Trust me, it'll be ok.

1603

No, you--
just wake up, frank!

1604
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:30,723
It will not be ok!

1605
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:33,192
I just assaulted my boss,
i've lost my fiancáe,

1606
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:37,328
And now your pals are gonna
hunt me down and kill me.

1607
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,330
So "it's not gonna be ok"
pretty much tops the list.

1608
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,065
Michael, you have
to stay focused.

1609
01:08:41,067 --> 01:08:42,466
Well, you focus on this:

1610
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:44,568
Gina's probably
not going to forgive me,

1611
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,636
Because i lied to her.

1612
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:49,205
And her father's been
lying to her all her life,

1613
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,940
And it hurts.

1614
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:52,508
She tell you that?

1615
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,809
Yeah.

1616
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:55,477
And now it looks like
i've lost

1617
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:57,479
The only girl
i've ever really loved,

1618
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,347
So as far
as i'm concerned,

1619
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:01,381
It's not bloody ok
at all!

1620
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:05,484
Michael.

1621
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,453
You can't go home.

1622
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:12,089
I'm going to gina.

1623
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,362
I should never have
lied to you.

1624
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,964
I should have told you
everything from the start,

1625
01:09:22,966 --> 01:09:24,966
But the whole thing just
snowballed,

1626
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:26,968
And before
i knew where i was,

1627
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,970
I was just buried
in the whole thing.

1628
01:09:28,972 --> 01:09:31,138
But everything i did,
i did out of...

1629
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,572
Fear of losing you.

1630
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:33,606
Can't you see that?

1631
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:36,241
Gina, listen, please,
just let me come up.

1632
01:09:36,243 --> 01:09:37,542
This is--
this is ridiculous.

1633
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:40,745
Why didn't you show up
for lunch today?

1634
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:42,713
The truth, please.

1635
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:44,381
Ok, i was with your father.

1636
01:09:44,383 --> 01:09:46,649
We had to have lunch
with these people.

1637
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:48,050
It was a nightmare--

1638
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:50,185
Yeah, it seems like
you and dad

1639
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:52,620
Are getting pretty
close.

1640
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,988
What does that mean?

1641
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,123
It means we're over,
michael.

1642
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,258
I just don't know
who you are.

1643
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,733
You're toast.

1644
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,839
Michael.

1645
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:18,141
Come here.

1646
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,408
What?

1647
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,809
Don't worry about it.

1648
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:21,910
It'll be ok.

1649
01:10:21,912 --> 01:10:22,911
Yeah.

1650
01:10:22,913 --> 01:10:24,679
Heyy!           Ooh.

1651
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:26,614
Come on!

1652
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:28,015
Right. Thanks.

1653
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:29,483
Thanks.

1654
01:10:29,485 --> 01:10:30,817
[groans]

1655
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:47,165
Tv: And now here's our host
pat bullard!

1656
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,566
[audience applause]

1657
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:54,437
Host: Oh, thank you so much.

1658
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:56,038
What a great crowd.
Thank you.

1659
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,040
Let's get started
by meeting our first--

1660
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,708
[tv turns off]

1661
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:05,179
Vito: She went out, frankie.

1662
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:13,719
Michael, uh...

1663
01:11:14,722 --> 01:11:18,589
Fired a warning shot
in the ceiling.

1664
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:21,324
It was an accident.

1665
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:24,193
Sit down, frank.

1666
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:30,064
...And just havin'
the best time.

1667
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:31,465
It's a wonderful city,

1668
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,667
And everyone's been
so friendly and courteous.

1669
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:34,868
I don't know why

1670
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,469
They talk the way they do
about new yorkers--

1671
01:11:36,471 --> 01:11:38,337
Get the hell outta here.
Go on.

1672
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,340
[ring]

1673
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:45,908
Hello.

1674
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,343
Listen. I want you to get out
of the apartment right now.

1675
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:49,544
You hear me. Just go!

1676
01:11:49,546 --> 01:11:52,480
Uh, what's going on?
What's happening?

1677
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:54,882
Vito thinks the risollis
killed johnny.

1678
01:11:54,884 --> 01:11:57,718
Things are a little dicey
right now. That's all.

1679
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,087
Oh, uh, i'm fine.

1680
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,354
Vito was worried, too,

1681
01:12:01,356 --> 01:12:02,822
So he sent uncle vinnie
to watch out for me.

1682
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:05,224
Isn't that sweet of him?

1683
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,059
Daddy?

1684
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:08,760
You there?

1685
01:12:09,696 --> 01:12:11,696
Ok, listen to me.

1686
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:12,897
Listen to me.

1687
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,199
Whatever you do--
i can't explain this now--

1688
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:16,700
But whatever you do,

1689
01:12:16,702 --> 01:12:18,668
Don't tell anyone there's
trouble between you and michael.

1690
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:21,937
It's very, very important,
you understand?

1691
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:23,371
Ok.

1692
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:24,972
Let me talk to vinnie.

1693
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:26,808
Sure. One sec.

1694
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,342
It's daddy.

1695
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,778
Mmyeah? Frankie.

1696
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,612
You listen to me.

1697
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,180
You touch one hair
on her head,

1698
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,215
I swear on my mother
that you'll beg me to kill you.

1699
01:12:36,217 --> 01:12:37,816
Hey, listen,
i'm just doing my job,

1700
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:39,217
All right, frank?

1701
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:41,219
I mean, you do
what you gotta do,

1702
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:43,721
And everything
will be ok, all right?

1703
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,355
You j--

1704
01:13:11,115 --> 01:13:12,781
[car door slams]

1705
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:22,089
So?

1706
01:13:22,091 --> 01:13:23,156
[sighs]

1707
01:13:25,393 --> 01:13:26,992
Uh...

1708
01:13:26,994 --> 01:13:28,559
They know
what happened.

1709
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:33,096
They know about gina?

1710
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:36,131
Uh, they, uh...

1711
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:37,732
They think it was you.

1712
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:38,933
So, um...

1713
01:13:40,269 --> 01:13:41,901
W-what's gonna happen?

1714
01:13:41,903 --> 01:13:43,269
They, um...

1715
01:13:43,271 --> 01:13:45,037
They gotta take care
of you, michael.

1716
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:47,539
W-what does that mean?

1717
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,240
It means, uh...

1718
01:13:49,242 --> 01:13:52,075
They ordered someone
to, um...

1719
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,976
Whack me?

1720
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:59,146
Ok. Um...

1721
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:01,014
Uh, do we know who?

1722
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:04,083
Me.

1723
01:14:04,085 --> 01:14:05,617
You.

1724
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:08,952
You're going
to whack me?

1725
01:14:08,954 --> 01:14:11,820
Stop sayin' that.
You sound like an idiot.

1726
01:14:13,757 --> 01:14:16,557
Yeah, vito wants me
to do it at the wedding

1727
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,759
During your speech.

1728
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:20,694
I mean,
that way he figures,

1729
01:14:20,696 --> 01:14:22,562
You know,
he gets us both.

1730
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:24,030
You die and...

1731
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:26,932
I lose gina by killing
the man she loves.

1732
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:29,100
But there isn't
gonna be a wedding.

1733
01:14:29,102 --> 01:14:30,101
No...

1734
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:32,436
So i can't do it then.

1735
01:14:32,438 --> 01:14:35,572
You mean
you can't do it then,

1736
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:38,807
Or you can't do it,
then?

1737
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:41,675
Uh, the first one.

1738
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:44,743
Right.

1739
01:14:46,179 --> 01:14:47,845
They got gina, michael.

1740
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:50,314
If i don't do it,
vinnie's gonna kill her.

1741
01:14:50,316 --> 01:14:51,581
My god.

1742
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,182
It's one of
these honor things.

1743
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:54,583
You know,
a life for a life,

1744
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:56,451
Bottom line...

1745
01:14:58,188 --> 01:14:59,854
Bottom line...

1746
01:15:00,857 --> 01:15:04,158
Vito's not gonna rest
until he sees a body.

1747
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:06,793
A body.

1748
01:15:06,795 --> 01:15:07,794
Yep.

1749
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:08,795
Right.

1750
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,463
Right.

1751
01:15:27,748 --> 01:15:31,216
This is probably
a stupid question, but...

1752
01:15:31,218 --> 01:15:32,617
To your knowledge...

1753
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:34,118
Does this hurt?

1754
01:15:35,821 --> 01:15:37,620
No, uh...

1755
01:15:37,622 --> 01:15:39,722
You won't feel a thing.

1756
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:41,090
Ready?

1757
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:43,792
Ok.

1758
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:53,634
That is surprisingly
painful, actually.

1759
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:55,235
Is it meant to hurt
that much?

1760
01:15:55,237 --> 01:15:56,769
Let me check that
for you.

1761
01:15:57,772 --> 01:16:01,573
Frank, when michael gets up
to give his bridegroom speech,

1762
01:16:01,575 --> 01:16:02,974
You shoot him twice.

1763
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:05,042
Then our guys come in
and shoot you.

1764
01:16:05,044 --> 01:16:07,611
We're gonna stitch
the squib controls

1765
01:16:07,613 --> 01:16:09,079
Inside your tuxedos,

1766
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:11,381
So you're gonna have to learn
to set them off yourselves

1767
01:16:11,383 --> 01:16:12,615
In sync
with the gunshots!

1768
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:14,249
You think
you can handle it?

1769
01:16:14,251 --> 01:16:16,651
Uh, any problems,
speak now.

1770
01:16:16,653 --> 01:16:20,921
This thing is potentially
huge for us. Massive.

1771
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:24,457
Questions? Worries?
Something you need?

1772
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,525
Well, there's one thing.

1773
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:27,726
The bride.

1774
01:16:27,728 --> 01:16:29,861
No, sir,
we don't take bribes!

1775
01:16:29,863 --> 01:16:30,862
Bride!

1776
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:31,829
Pardon?

1777
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:33,397
Take them goddamn things
off your head!

1778
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:34,931
Yes, sir!

1779
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:37,633
Tv: And the handy bundler
is virtually indestructible.

1780
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,267
Even the law can use
handy bundler

1781
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:40,635
To detain criminals.

1782
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,070
You'll find hundreds of uses
for the handy bundler

1783
01:16:43,072 --> 01:16:45,672
Around the shop,
at home, in the office,

1784
01:16:45,674 --> 01:16:47,273
And on the job.

1785
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:48,674
[telephone rings]

1786
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:50,075
Tv: A perfect fit
every time.

1787
01:16:50,077 --> 01:16:51,876
It's lightweight
and secures anything.

1788
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:52,676
Hello?

1789
01:16:52,678 --> 01:16:54,678
Tv: And easy as 1, 2, 3!

1790
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,080
So these are the guys doing
the flowers for the wedding?

1791
01:16:57,082 --> 01:16:59,682
Yeah. They're supposed
to be great.

1792
01:16:59,684 --> 01:17:01,083
Thanks, uncle vinnie.

1793
01:17:01,085 --> 01:17:03,551
I think i'll be safe
with michael inside.

1794
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,687
Ok.

1795
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,669
So?

1796
01:17:24,671 --> 01:17:26,070
What's going on?

1797
01:17:26,072 --> 01:17:28,572
They don't know anything
at all about you.

1798
01:17:28,574 --> 01:17:31,708
But, um, they think
that i shot johnny.

1799
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,842
But you didn't.

1800
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:34,410
Act like
you're in love.

1801
01:17:34,412 --> 01:17:36,278
Who are you?

1802
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,445
Fbi.

1803
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,146
How are you today?

1804
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:41,114
Vito doesn't know
that i know this,

1805
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:42,715
But your father's been
ordered to kill me

1806
01:17:42,717 --> 01:17:44,316
At our
wedding reception.

1807
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:47,052
Michael will be
wearing a wire.

1808
01:17:47,054 --> 01:17:48,253
What?

1809
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:50,455
The idea is that vito won't
be afraid to talk to me

1810
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,856
Because he thinks
i'm about to die.

1811
01:17:51,858 --> 01:17:54,725
And then when i get him
to incriminate himself--

1812
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:56,460
Our guys come in.
Bingo. Got him.

1813
01:17:56,462 --> 01:17:58,462
And, uh...

1814
01:17:58,464 --> 01:18:00,730
That's the end of it.

1815
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:05,300
You think i'd help trap
my own father?

1816
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:06,567
Your father is with us.

1817
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:09,870
You're more important
to him than they are.

1818
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,839
It's our only way
out of this alive.

1819
01:18:15,877 --> 01:18:18,477
Then i guess
i don't have a choice.

1820
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,079
Is everything ok?

1821
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:21,879
Everything's fine.

1822
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:24,181
Decisions,
you know?

1823
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:26,149
I think
we're through.

1824
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,884
Uh, excuse me.

1825
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:30,886
Um, any panics,
any questions,

1826
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:32,754
You just
give us a call.

1827
01:18:32,756 --> 01:18:35,857
Tony and guy.
Don't be shy.

1828
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:37,325
Well, bye, then,
darling.

1829
01:18:37,327 --> 01:18:38,359
See you later.

1830
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,626
Ok.

1831
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:47,866
Michael: I can't do this.

1832
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:49,901
We have to tell her frank's
gonna pretend to shoot me.

1833
01:18:49,903 --> 01:18:52,103
No way, her reaction
is everything.

1834
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:53,504
It has to be real.

1835
01:18:53,506 --> 01:18:54,505
[sniffs]

1836
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:55,973
[squeezes

Kitchen team moving.

1838
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:25,668
Bridal limo en route.

1839
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:26,835
Good.

1840
01:19:26,837 --> 01:19:28,937
Ok, gentlemen,
the limo is on its way.

1841
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:31,072
These are the squibs,
all right?

1842
01:19:31,074 --> 01:19:33,674
2 controllers.
One in each pocket.

1843
01:19:33,676 --> 01:19:36,276
Now, a squeeze
or a sharp tap...

1844
01:19:36,278 --> 01:19:37,543
Sets them off.

1845
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:38,944
You understand?

1846
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,146
[british accent]
how do you do?

1847
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:42,547
I'm the best man.

1848
01:19:42,549 --> 01:19:45,149
Hello. My name's peter.

1849
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,416
I'm the best man,

1850
01:19:46,418 --> 01:19:47,950
And i work
at marks and spencers.

1851
01:19:47,952 --> 01:19:49,551
I love chocolate biscuits.

1852
01:19:49,553 --> 01:19:52,220
Oh, mumsy,
i want some ginger beer.

1853
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:54,688
There she is!

1854
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:58,125
This is so exciting!

1855
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,659
Here she is!

1856
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,260
It's the bride!

1857
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:02,661
Hi, pretty!

1858
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,796
Oh, my god.

1859
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:11,468
Not much of a job,
though, is it, vinnie?

1860
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:22,211
Thank you so much.

1861
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,279
Oh!

1862
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:25,280
Oh!

1863
01:20:25,282 --> 01:20:26,281
Hey!

1864
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:27,915
Ow! My leg!

1865
01:20:32,354 --> 01:20:35,888
Radio: Testing 1, 2, 3.
Do you read? Do you read?

1866
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:38,690
Testing 1, 2, 3.
Do you read?

1867
01:20:38,692 --> 01:20:40,291
Do you read?

1868
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,358
Remember,

1869
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,826
We're going to need
graziosi loud and clear.

1870
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:43,960
You got plenty of time.

1871
01:20:43,962 --> 01:20:45,161
He only has
until the speeches.

1872
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:46,962
Right. After the dancing
and dessert.

1873
01:20:46,964 --> 01:20:48,196
You gotta be kidding.

1874
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:49,764
This is
an italian wedding.

1875
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,098
The speeches
are before the dinner.

1876
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,466
You knew that, right?

1877
01:20:53,702 --> 01:20:55,968
Mm-hmm. Still got
plenty of time.

1878
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:57,102
Plenty of time?

1879
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,503
You have 10 minutes
if you're lucky.

1880
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:02,439
This is not a problem.

1881
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:03,973
Gonna be ok.

1882
01:21:04,842 --> 01:21:06,575
We have a problem.

1883
01:21:06,577 --> 01:21:09,844
Why the fuck didn't
you tell me this earlier?

1884
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,846
And michael andrew felgate,

1885
01:21:11,848 --> 01:21:14,849
Do you take
gina maria vitale

1886
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:16,717
For your lawful wife...

1887
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:18,919
To have and to hold

1888
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:21,054
From this day forward

1889
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:23,122
For better, for worse,

1890
01:21:23,124 --> 01:21:24,723
For richer, for poorer,

1891
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,791
In sickness and in health

1892
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:28,726
Until death do you part?

1893
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:30,127
Michael: I do.

1894
01:21:30,129 --> 01:21:33,130
You have declared your consent
before the church.

1895
01:21:33,132 --> 01:21:35,465
May the lord in his goodness

1896
01:21:35,467 --> 01:21:36,866
Strengthen your consent

1897
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:39,468
And fill you both
with his blessings.

1898
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,769
Amen.

1899
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:45,139
In the name of the father
and the son and the holy spirit,

1900
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:48,275
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

1901
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,477
You may kiss the bride.

1902
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,349
[applause and cheering]

1903
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,620
[italian folk music playing]

1904
01:22:06,557 --> 01:22:07,956
[man singing in italian]

1905
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:11,559
Hey! Wedding! Smile!

1906
01:22:11,561 --> 01:22:13,160
Weddings!

1907
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,327
Yay!

1908
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:17,029
Kitchen team,
we've got one shot at this.

1909
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:19,965
And less than 5 minutes
before the speeches.

1910
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:21,399
We got it.

1911
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:23,567
Ah, philip,
about the other day...

1912
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:24,968
I don't want to hear.

1913
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,369
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

1914
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,571
No names, no pack drill.
That's my motto.

1915
01:22:28,573 --> 01:22:29,972
Ha ha ha.

1916
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:31,573
That's incredibly
nice of you.

1917
01:22:31,575 --> 01:22:33,174
Goodness,
are you drinking?

1918
01:22:33,176 --> 01:22:33,974
Ooh.

1919
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:35,575
Come on,
darling.

1920
01:22:35,577 --> 01:22:36,976
But i've only had
one glass.

1921
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:38,077
Let me take that
for you.

1922
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,278
She thinks i'm drunk.

1923
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,646
Mrs. Cromwell:
You're very embarrassing.

1924
01:22:45,986 --> 01:22:47,652
I think you're on.

1925
01:22:54,726 --> 01:22:55,725
In position.

1926
01:22:55,727 --> 01:22:57,159
Uncle vito...

1927
01:22:57,161 --> 01:22:58,393
I just wanted to say

1928
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:02,329
How sorry
i am about your son.

1929
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:03,663
Vito: Thank you.

1930
01:23:05,867 --> 01:23:08,000
Vito: This is a happy day.

1931
01:23:08,002 --> 01:23:10,035
I wish you much joy.

1932
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:15,206
I especially look forward
to the speeches.

1933
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:17,007
Well...

1934
01:23:17,009 --> 01:23:18,408
You're very kind.

1935
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,743
And i'm very appreciative
of the way you've...

1936
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,579
Opened my eyes
to new possibilities.

1937
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,148
As a matter of fact,
um...

1938
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,616
I recently thought
of a new idea

1939
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:29,284
That i think could be

1940
01:23:29,286 --> 01:23:31,552
Extremely profitable
to us both.

1941
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:35,522
Uh, absurdly profitable,
really.

1942
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:36,923
I mean, uh...

1943
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:39,258
I think
we're talking millions.

1944
01:23:40,027 --> 01:23:42,027
But, um, this certainly
isn't the occasion

1945
01:23:42,029 --> 01:23:43,528
To be talking business,
is it?

1946
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,062
Another time perhaps.

1947
01:23:45,064 --> 01:23:47,464
Thank you so much again
for being here.

1948
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,899
He's lost his mind.

1949
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:52,634
And speeches in 4:05.

1950
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:55,770
Are you outta
your mind?

1951
01:23:55,772 --> 01:23:57,371
He wasn't ready.
Relax.

1952
01:23:57,373 --> 01:23:58,171
Relax?

1953
01:23:58,173 --> 01:23:59,372
Congratulations, huh?

1954
01:23:59,374 --> 01:24:00,639
Hey.

1955
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:02,040
In 5 minutes,
we're dead.

1956
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,641
You, me,
and gina.

1957
01:24:03,643 --> 01:24:04,642
Woman: Hi, frankie!

1958
01:24:04,644 --> 01:24:05,743
Never chase the bid.

1959
01:24:05,745 --> 01:24:07,077
Hello! What?

1960
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:09,045
Let the bid come to you.
That's rule number one.

1961
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:11,047
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

1962
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:14,383
Oh, mr. Graziosi wants
to see you over there.

1963
01:24:14,385 --> 01:24:15,650
Of course.

1964
01:24:15,652 --> 01:24:17,050
Pleasure.

1965
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,521
I think
we're in business.

1966
01:24:22,523 --> 01:24:23,988
Speech is in 3.

1967
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:28,525
We have to go say hi
to maria.

1968
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:29,726
Here.               Oh.

1969
01:24:32,797 --> 01:24:34,263
So basically...

1970
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:37,399
You continue to sell and buy
interesting work through us,

1971
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:40,068
And i do
the insurance valuation

01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,502
On the collection
you assemble.

1973
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:45,672
Like insurance against
a fire, for example.

1974
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:48,074
Fires can happen.

1975
01:24:48,076 --> 01:24:50,042
Look at sotheby's.

1976
01:24:51,812 --> 01:24:54,078
But fortunately,
of course,

1977
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,213
You would be
handsomely covered.

1978
01:24:57,082 --> 01:24:58,714
So what do you think?

1979
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:01,749
Are we, uh...

1980
01:25:03,085 --> 01:25:04,483
We in business then?

1981
01:25:06,887 --> 01:25:07,886
Say it.

1982
01:25:07,888 --> 01:25:09,354
In 2.

1983
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:12,890

You two look serious.
Cheer up.

1986
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:18,695
Good heavens.
Those are something.

1987
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:19,696
You mind if i...

1988
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,697
Take it easy.

1989
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,832

Philip, this is, um,

1993
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:30,237
Delighted to meet you.

1994
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,838
You--you from
the old country?

My wife and i spent
a wonderful week there

We called him al capone.
You remember, darling?

2006
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:55,254
My god, these things

I forgot to tell you
the good news.

2013
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:07,596

Well, that's,
uh--

2017
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:14,200
Yes, that's
marvelous news.

2018
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,935
We must meet up

2019
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,436

the details.

2020
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,571

What a horrible thing
to happen.

2024

Are you all right?

2025
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,049
I'm sure he meant it
as a joke.

2026
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:36,650
Could i borrow him
for a second?

2027
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:37,717
Thanks.

2028
01:26:39,454 --> 01:26:42,455

we have to hurry.

01:27:19,186 --> 01:27:20,852
Cromwell: I'm going
as fast as i can.

2047
01:27:20,854 --> 01:27:22,486
It's rather a mess.

2048
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,754
Come. Turn around.
Turn around.

2049
01:27:24,756 --> 01:27:26,655

Figured as much.

2052
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:33,693
Now, just shove it
in there.

2053
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:35,895
Look, stuff it in.

2054
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:38,897

Give me your gun.

2055
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:40,498

to use this one.

a live gun.

I suggest abort.
I repeat. Abort.

This is making me
a bit nervous.

The last time
i had to speak at a wedding,

2114
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:09,846
I was only supposed to propose
a toast to the bridesmaids.

2115
01:30:09,848 --> 01:30:12,381
I ended up proposing
an opening bid.

2116
01:30:12,383 --> 01:30:14,316
What's worse
is they both sold.

So, um...

2122
01:30:22,457 --> 01:30:24,023
I'll keep it simple...

And just tell you
why i think today, for once,

01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,329
I'm the one acquiring

2127
01:30:33,733 --> 01:30:35,599
Firstly,
it goes without saying

2128
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:37,867
I've always been a huge fan
of the italian school.

speak to me, vito.

Secondly...

2132
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,105
It's not working.

2133
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,506
And most importantly,

2134
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:48,474
They say that the, uh...

2135
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:51,343
Real test
of a masterpiece...

2136
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,877
Is whether
you instinctively know

2137
01:30:52,879 --> 01:30:56,947
It's something
you're gonna keep forever,

2138

Something you sense
you've always...

2141
01:31:01,885 --> 01:31:05,086
Don't think of it
as gaining a son.

2142
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,387
If you don't do it,

2143
01:31:06,389 --> 01:31:08,021
You're losing

In some cases...

2147
01:31:14,194 --> 01:31:16,260
In some cases...

2148
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,495
In some cases,
it's even something

2149
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:21,798
You'd be prepared to die
to protect.

2150
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,834
That's certainly
the case here.

2151
01:31:24,836 --> 01:31:27,703
I'd rather die
than see any harm come to gina.

2152
01:31:27,705 --> 01:31:30,905
I love her
more than my own life.

2153
01:31:32,174 --> 01:31:36,509
And i hope i'm making myself
crystal clear on that point.

2154
01:31:38,713 --> 01:31:40,245
Death...

2155
01:31:40,247 --> 01:31:42,847
Is ok by me.

2156
01:31:45,518 --> 01:31:47,384
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

2157
01:31:47,386 --> 01:31:49,119

2159
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:55,858
Man: Frankie!

2160
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,694
For christ's sakes,
bob. This is it.

2161
01:31:58,696 --> 01:31:59,528
Damn it.

2162
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,929
Kitchen team, go!

2163
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:03,030

It's bullshit!

2170
01:32:39,462 --> 01:32:40,461
Do it!

2171
01:32:40,463 --> 01:32:42,062
Vinnie!

2172
01:32:42,064 --> 01:32:43,096
Frank: No!

2173
01:32:43,098 --> 01:32:45,298
Vinnie, do it!

2174
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,465
No!          Do it!

2175
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:47,466
No!

2176
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:49,167
Vinnie, do it!

2177
01:32:49,169 --> 01:32:50,301
Frank: Vinnie!

2178
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:51,902
I'm ordering you!
Kill her!

2179
01:32:51,904 --> 01:32:53,904
Yes! Got him.

2180
01:32:53,906 --> 01:32:54,905
Frank: Vinnie, no!

2181
01:32:54,907 --> 01:32:57,240
Fbi! Freeze!

2182
01:32:59,043 --> 01:33:00,208
No!

2183

[screaming]

2184
01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:13,019
Ambulance! Now!

2185
01:33:13,021 --> 01:33:14,620
It's too late.

2186
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:46,817
Let's go. Get over there!
Party's over!

2187
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,291
On 3?

2188
01:33:55,293 --> 01:33:56,358
I'm ready. 3!

2189
01:33:57,294 --> 01:33:59,727

2191
01:34:17,478 --> 01:34:18,743
I'm sorry.

2192
01:34:18,745 --> 01:34:20,344
I'm so sorry.

2193
01:34:20,346 --> 01:34:22,979
No, i'm sorry.

2194
01:34:22,981 --> 01:34:25,414
Gina: You should both
be sorry.

2195
01:34:26,517 --> 01:34:28,116
Gina: Ugh!

2196
01:34:29,018 --> 01:34:31,351
These things
are surprisingly painful.

2197
01:34:31,353 --> 01:34:33,353
Oh, my god.

2198
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:34,754
It's a new rule of mine.

2199
01:34:34,756 --> 01:34:36,989
Always assume
you guys are hiding something.

2200
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:37,789
[chuckles]

2201
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:40,124
But how? Why di--

2202
01:34:40,126 --> 01:34:42,759
Because when i thought
of you with a gun, michael,

2203
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,160
Suddenly i wanted a backup.

2204
01:34:44,162 --> 01:34:45,561
You did good.

2205
01:34:45,563 --> 01:34:46,595
Oh, my god.

2206
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,930
Ha ha ha.

2207
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:49,730
Oh, god.

2208
01:34:49,732 --> 01:34:50,931
Oh, my god.

2209
01:34:50,933 --> 01:34:51,731
Daddy.

2210
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:53,232
I tell you, frank...

2211
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:55,167
Her father might act
like a moron sometimes...

2212
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:56,334
Vinnie?

2213
01:34:57,437 --> 01:34:58,736
So i retired.

2214
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:00,437
I'm telling ya,
frankie,

2215
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:01,671
The kid's a genius.

2216
01:35:01,673 --> 01:35:03,539
I mean,
think about it.

2217
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:04,907
You got vito,

2218
01:35:04,909 --> 01:35:06,608
Vito thinks
he got his revenge,

2219
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,009
And that's it.

2220
01:35:08,011 --> 01:35:10,211
Badda-bing.
You're even, huh?

2221
01:35:10,213 --> 01:35:12,079
You're in the clear.

2222
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,013
All of youse.

2223
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:14,981
How the hell could
you do this to me?

2224
01:35:14,983 --> 01:35:16,115
You were gonna
do it to me.

2225
01:35:16,117 --> 01:35:17,549
No, we did it
'cause we love you.

2226
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:18,783
Same here.

2227
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:21,585
What, you love...

2228
01:35:21,587 --> 01:35:23,853
Both of us?

2229
01:35:26,591 --> 01:35:28,690
I don't think so, michael.

2230
01:35:31,494 --> 01:35:32,893
Oh, my god.

2231
01:35:32,895 --> 01:35:34,327
Wasn't that the--

2232
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:35,394
My god! Gina!

2233
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:38,630
Gina!

2234
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:40,331
P.A.: Welcome
to the halfway point...

2235
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,432
Excuse me! Gina!

2236
01:35:41,434 --> 01:35:43,367
...In the annual
central park senior marathon!

2237
01:35:43,369 --> 01:35:44,634
Gina: No!

2238
01:35:44,636 --> 01:35:45,635
Gina.

2239
01:35:45,637 --> 01:35:46,636
Wait!       No!

2240
01:35:46,638 --> 01:35:47,737
Leave me alone!

2241
01:35:47,739 --> 01:35:48,738
Listen! Listen!

2242
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,139
Leave me alone!

2243
01:35:50,141 --> 01:35:51,440
This picture!
It isn't me! It isn't!

2244
01:35:51,442 --> 01:35:54,209
It's kansas city little
big mickey blue eyes.

2245
01:35:54,211 --> 01:35:55,610
What?

2246
01:35:55,612 --> 01:35:57,011
I was pretending
to be a mobster,

2247
01:35:57,013 --> 01:35:58,612
And i couldn't say
my rs,

2248
01:35:58,614 --> 01:36:00,013
And i had to kiss
the waitress

2249
01:36:00,015 --> 01:36:01,614
Or they would've
killed us.

2250
01:36:01,616 --> 01:36:03,282
Look! Look who's sitting
next to me.

2251
01:36:03,284 --> 01:36:05,784
Recognize that suit?

2252
01:36:05,786 --> 01:36:07,185
Is that dad?

2253
01:36:07,187 --> 01:36:10,020
Gina, this photo
means nothing.

2254
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:12,021
So...

2255
01:36:12,023 --> 01:36:13,622
So who's
mickey blue eyes?

2256
01:36:13,624 --> 01:36:14,623
I am.

2257
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,491
I mean, i was.

2258
01:36:16,493 --> 01:36:17,892
We just made him up.

2259
01:36:17,894 --> 01:36:19,026
Please come back,

2260
01:36:19,028 --> 01:36:21,028
And i'll explain
everything.

2261
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:23,630
So when you said you were
with my dad that day...

2262
01:36:23,632 --> 01:36:24,764
You were...

2263
01:36:24,766 --> 01:36:26,432
I was telling
the truth.

2264
01:36:28,636 --> 01:36:30,636
You told me a lot
of other lies, michael.

2265
01:36:30,638 --> 01:36:31,770
I know.

2266
01:36:31,772 --> 01:36:33,505
I know. I...

2267
01:36:33,507 --> 01:36:34,772
I thought

2268
01:36:34,774 --> 01:36:36,440
It was the only way
to keep you.

2269
01:36:36,442 --> 01:36:38,642
But you were right.
It was...

2270
01:36:38,644 --> 01:36:41,411
The only sure way
to lose you.

2271
01:36:44,648 --> 01:36:46,381
So...

2272
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:48,383
I was right.

2273
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,650
You were.

2274
01:36:49,652 --> 01:36:51,184
And smarter than you
all along.

2275
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,185
Yes.

2276
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,186
And braver.

2277
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:54,787
Much.

2278
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:57,122
And more convincing
at being shot.

2279
01:36:57,124 --> 01:36:58,923
Infinitely.

2280
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,926
Marry me, gina.

2281
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:07,797
Would i have to be
mrs. Blue eyes?

2282
01:37:09,534 --> 01:37:10,766

2283
01:37:10,768 --> 01:37:13,135
