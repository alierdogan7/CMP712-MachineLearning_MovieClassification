there's nothing homosexual
about what we want you to do.

further from the truth.

- Can l just jump in here f or a second?
- No. No.

is kind of going all around the world.

- But it's the journey that's worth it.
- Yeah, well, l see that.

please the court.

- The court is yours, Leo.

Thank you very much,

01:23:03,268 --> 01:23:08,001
- Ted, you ever seen any of them
old Alfred Hitchcock episodes?
- Yes, sir.

1196

You ever see the one called The Man From
Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen?

1197

- Uh--
- Ah, if you saw it, you'd remember it.

lt's called The Man From Rio
with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen.

1199
01:23:16,748 --> 01:23:19,979
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes
a bet with Steve McQueen...

1200
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:23,384
that Steve McQueen can't light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row.

1201
01:23:23,455 --> 01:23:26,219
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1202
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,225
he wins Peter Lorre's
new car.

1203
01:23:28,293 --> 01:23:32,229
But if he does not light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1204
01:23:32,297 --> 01:23:36,893
Peter Lorre gets to chop off
Steve McQueen's little pinky.

1205
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:41,132
Norman and Chester here
just made that same bet.

1206

Norman has bet
his pinky...

1207
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:48,503
that he can light his cigarette lighter
ten times in a row.

1208

lf he does,

1209
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:54,916

- Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

- Oh, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes,!

1314
01:29:42,267 --> 01:29:44,201
Ted, good answer.
Sit right down.

1315
01:29:44,269 --> 01:29:48,205
All right. Leo,
you be the timekeeper.

1316
01:29:48,273 --> 01:29:51,242
Norman, give me
your watch.

1317
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:56,076
Let me know when a minute ends
and when it begins.

1318
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:58,172
- You got it.
- Ah.

1319
01:29:58,249 --> 01:30:00,717
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

1320
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,593
- Begin.
- Okay, Ted, pay attention here.

1321
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:13,426
l'm gonna make two piles here
on the bar. One pile which is yours.

1322
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:15,932
And another pile
which could be yours.

1323
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,594
And what you have to realize
is we're gonna do this thing...

1324
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:22,731
one way or the other.

1325
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:26,868
Whether it's you who holds
the axe or a Mexican maid...

1326
01:30:26,945 --> 01:30:29,743
or some bum
we yank off the street.

1327
01:30:29,814 --> 01:30:32,715
- You can buy a whole lot
of soup with that pile.
- Shh! l'm the closer here.

1328
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:35,082
All right. l'm a little me--
Um, l've lost count.

1329
01:30:35,153 --> 01:30:37,383
- How much is on the bar here?
- [ Group ] Six hundred.

1330
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:42,552
Okay. Ted, do you know how long it takes
the average American to count to 600?

1331
01:30:42,627 --> 01:30:46,757
- [ Angela ]
lt's a rhetorical question, Ted.
- No, sir.

1332
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:50,096
About one minute less than
it takes to count to 700.

1333
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:53,626
Now, Ted, a person's lif e is filled
with a zillion little experiences.

1334
01:30:53,705 --> 01:30:57,232
Some which are insignificant, have no
meaning, and, you know, you f orget them.

1335
01:30:57,308 --> 01:31:01,642
Others which you remember f or
the rest of your natural lif e.

1336
01:31:01,713 --> 01:31:06,412
Now, since what we're proposing
here is so unusual,

1337
01:31:06,484 --> 01:31:09,578
so outside the norm,

1338
01:31:09,654 --> 01:31:13,920
that this is a good bet
that this is going to be one
of those incidents that sticks.

1339
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:17,928
So, since you're gonna be
stuck remembering this
f or the rest of your lif e,

1340
01:31:17,996 --> 01:31:21,295
you have to decide
what that memory will be.

1341
01:31:21,366 --> 01:31:24,824
So, Ted, are you going to
remember f or the next 40 years,

1342
01:31:24,902 --> 01:31:26,893
give or take a decade,

1343
01:31:26,971 --> 01:31:31,305
that you refused $1,000
f or one second's worth of work?

1344
01:31:31,376 --> 01:31:36,905
Or that you made $1,000
f or one second's worth of work?

1345
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:38,915
[ Leo ]
Time!

1346
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:42,350
So, Ted, what's it gonna be?

1347
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,116
- Okay.
- [ Group ] Yes!

Could l talk to Don Levine, please?

He was supposed to be there.
