to bed now, Mary.

179
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,786
You'll soon
be better, Henry.

180
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,746
I feel almost myself again.

181
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,623
As soon as you're strong enough,
we'll go away

182
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,917
and forget all this
horrible experience.

183
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,210
Forget?

184
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,715
If only I could forget,
but it's never out of my mind.

185
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,469
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life.

186
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,556
Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,726
For what a wonderful
vision it was!

188
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,354
I dreamed of being the first to give to the world

189
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,691
the secret that God
is so jealous of.

190
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,235
The formula for life.

191
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,615
Think of the power
to create a man.

192
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,577
And I did. I did it!
I created a man. And who knows?

193
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,121
In time I could have trained him to do my will.

194
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,123
I could have bred a race.

195
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,626
I might even have found
the secret of eternal life.

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,795
Henry, don't say those things.
Don't think them.

197
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,547
It's blasphemous
and wicked.

198
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,257
We are not meant
to know those things.

199
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,969
It may be that I'm intended to know the secret of life.

200
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,181
It may be part
of the divine plan.

201
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,809
No. No! It's the Devil
that prompts you.

202
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,063
It's death, not life,
that is in it all and at the end of it all.

203
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,773
Listen, Henry.

204
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,359
While you have been lying here,
tossing in your delirium,

205
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,944
I couldn't sleep.

of your insane desire

207
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,325
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

208
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,079
a strange apparition has seemed to appear in the room.

209
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,373
It comes,
a figure like death,

210
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,292
and each time it comes
more clearly, nearer.

211
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,211
It seems to be
reaching out for you

212
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,046
as if it would
take you away from me!

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,717
There it is!
Look! There!

214
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,053
I see nothing, Elizabeth.
Where?

215
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,222
There's nothing there.

216

Won't you come in, Doctor?

a communication to make,

which I suspect may be of the
utmost importance to yourself.

260
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,956
This is Professor Pretorius.

261
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,710
He used to be Doctor of
Philosophy at the university, but...

262
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,753
But was booted out.

is the word for knowing too much.

He shouldn't be disturbed.

a doctor, Baroness.

come here tonight?

he won't upset Henry.

What do you want?

00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,661
We must work together.

272
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,123
Never. This is outrageous.

to reconsider.

You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

277
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,557
who are responsible
for all those murders?

278

There are penalties to pay
for killing people,

that you and I together,

no longer as master and pupil,
but as fellow scientists,

284
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,662
might probe the mysteries
of life and death...

285
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,414
Never. No further.

286
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,417
...and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

287
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,379
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.

00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,299
That is sad, very sad.

have gone too far to stop.

stopped so easily.

with my experiments.

I am here tonight.

If you, Herr Baron,
will do me the honor of visiting my humble abode,

in what I have to show you.

research and countless failures,

298

I also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

299
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,339
I must know.
When can I see it?

change your mind.

It is not very late.

00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,267
No, but you will
need a coat.

had better wait here.

You take number two, Ludwig.

898
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,607

(MOANING SOFTLY)

920
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,588
She's alive! Alive!

921
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,849
The bride of Frankenstein.

She hate me.

931
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,586
Like others.

But I can't leave them!
I can't!

Yes. Go.

942

You stay.

945
