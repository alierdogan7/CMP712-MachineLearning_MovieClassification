Now, Mac, one thing we
have working in our favor

124
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,898
is that Cunth needs passcodes
to make the X-5 operational.

125
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,564
It is imperative that Cunth
does not get those codes.

Oh, thanks.
Because before you said something,

127

if he got them.

Get that tip back.

I have to...

529
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:37,664
I'm sorry.

530

I'm not sorry.

532
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:45,182
(WHISPERING) I mean, I'm sorry.
As me, I'm sorry.

so worried about you.

Well, I was really worried
about you, too, Vick.

Really?
Yeah.

571
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,288
I mean, I only have,
like, two of these vests,

572
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:11,657
so if either of them
got shot up,

573
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,526
it would be a real
bummer for me.

not expensive.

are you planning on doing

581
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:30,614
with all this money?

582
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,443
I think it's
fairly obvious.

583
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,052
He was going to use it
to buy the pass...

584
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,282
Buy the passcodes! Yup.

and all it says is "STD."

Been there.

591
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:54,570
STD is also code for the
old Stansfield rail yard,

592
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:55,730

10 miles from here.

up, they'll abort the drop.

gonna show up?

00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,324
Okay, now, before we do
this, any questions?

600
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,794
Why do I have
to be Hoss?

601
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,330
Because you're good
at what you do.

602
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:21,831
And why do I
have to be you?

603

First of all, you will never be me.
And second of all...

00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,465

605
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:28,698
Okay.

606
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:31,239

with three guards here.

it's three on three.

out the guards,

gonna wing it?

difference between winging it

and seeing
what happens.

Okay, now,
piece of advice.

641
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,105
When you use
the old celery trick,

642
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,576
you're gonna wanna go
with the thick end.

643

but if you go
thin end first,

645

out and you're...

phone's all we got.

697
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:49,893
Then we better make
the most of it.

698
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:52,401
'Cause at this point, this is
our only connection to the X-5.

699
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:53,470
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

700
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:56,631
Holy shit! It's ringing!
Vicki, call tracer.

701
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,935
Call tracer.

702
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:01,167
Set to jet,
MacGruber.

703
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,337
Now remember, MacGruber,

704
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:04,347
you gotta keep him on the line
long enough to get a location.

705
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,245
Don't worry.
I've done this before.

706
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:09,717
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
Hoss and Zeke are dead,

707
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,083
and if you don't tell
me who this is...

708
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,451
He hung up.
Did you get it?

709
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:13,751
No.
Wow.

710
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:14,950
Damn it. Is that
thing working?

711
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,357
Yeah. But you gotta keep them on
the phone for at least 20 seconds.

712
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,453
That was 20.
That was maybe three.

713
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,429
Shit! You're right.
Shit, shit, shit!

714
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,499
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

715
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,431
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Second chance!
In your face!

716
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:27,231
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
Hoss and Zeke are...

717
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,666
That's my phone.
Talk to me.

718
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,104
MacGruber, it's Faith.

719
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,267
Colonel!
How's it going?

720
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,434
What's the mission status?

721
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:35,841
Positively banging,
Colonel. Right, guys?

722
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,038
Oh, they're jazzed.
How's everything at the P-Gon?

723
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,275
Well, we do
have one lead.

724
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,112
You probably already
know about it.

725
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,447
Cunth's having a fundraising
event at his mansion tonight.

726
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,648
We do know
about Cunth's party,

727
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,419
and we will be there
with bells on.

728
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:49,957
Absolutely not,
MacGruber.

729
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,391
Sir, I'm not
gonna wear bells.

730
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:54,260
No, Mac.
You are not to enter that party.

731
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:56,026
Right now, Cunth has no
idea you're even alive

732
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,434
and that is a huge
advantage to us.

733
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:58,524
Yes.

734
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,664
This is surveillance only.

735
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,103
I want to know exactly who
comes through that door.

736
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,334
Is that clear?

737
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,411
Loud and.

738
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:10,875
So, Cunth is
having a party?

739
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,415
Yeah, he is.

740
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,613
And guess who just
made the guest list.

741
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:20,950
Guess who just made
the guest list.

742
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,423
Us?
Yes.

743
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:30,891
For the record, I think this
is a really stupid move.

744
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:33,937
MACGRUBER ON RADIO: Don't worry,
I'm gonna keep a real low profile.

745
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,458
May I take your coat?
No.

746
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:01,587
Your car stereo?

747
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:02,757
Nice try.

748
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,403
Okay, I think our
definitions of low profile

749
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:11,736
might be a little
different.

750
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,968
You think?
Where's Vicki?

751
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,339
She arrived 10 minutes ago.
She's out back.

752
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:18,278
I'll find her
in a sec.

753
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,316
First, I got a little
business to attend to.

754
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,486
MacGruber, come in.

755
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,881
Jesus Christ.

756
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:35,514
Where have you been?

757
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:38,356
Sorry, I just took an upper
decker in the master bathroom.

758
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:39,429
Upper decker?

759
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,930
Yeah, it's where you take a dump in
the water tank and not in the bowl.

760
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,762
You look great.

761
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:45,969
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

762
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:48,699
Look, Vick,

763
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,032
I'm going to need you to poke
around, see what you can dig up.

764
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,401
I'm way ahead of you.

765
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,636
You see that guy
over there?

766
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:55,435
I saw him coming out
of Cunth's office.

767
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:56,877
I think he's one
of his goons.

768
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,141
Which guy?

769
00:43:58,249 --> 00:43:59,375
That handsome guy.

770
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:02,947
That guy?
You think he's handsome?

771
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,783
Yeah, he's very handsome.

772
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,281
Really? Well, if you
think he's so handsome,

773
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:08,517
then why don't you
marry him?

774
00:44:09,193 --> 00:44:10,182
No, seriously.

775
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:13,089
If you think he's so
handsome, go marry him.

776
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:15,222
Leave the case.
Piper and I will do it. Okay?

777
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,925
Is he that
handsome to you?

778
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:18,092
Are you willing to
quit your job for him?

779
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,230
No.
Good.

780
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:24,038
Now that's the guy
I want you to check out.

781
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,740
He's teeming with intel.

782
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,002
What?

783
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,307
Follow that guy,
and that is an order.

784
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:31,711
And stay away
from that guy,

785
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:33,340
who I actually would
describe as ugly.

786
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:34,506
And that is
another order.

787
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:35,812
So, two orders.

788
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,217
Piper, you got
a location on Cunth?

789
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,754
He appears to be
in the south wing.

790
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:40,245
On my way.

791
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:42,455
That guy.

792
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,598
I will see your 25,000
and raise you 50.

793
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:55,872
MACGRUBER: He's bluffing.

794
00:44:57,074 --> 00:45:00,202
I can tell by the look
in his beady little eyes.

795
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:02,736
MacGruber.
We've been expecting you.

796
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:05,108
Bet's to you,
Senator Garver.

797
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:10,579
I'm all in.

798
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:14,715
The Senator's
all in for $750,000.

799
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:18,953
CUNTH: Call.

800
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:21,931
Straight flush.
Damn it!

801
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,759
My associate will assist you with
your debt, Senator. Good night.

802
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:31,942
Sorry about that.
Really.

803
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:33,803
I thought he was
bluffing there, so...

804
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:34,900
Thank you, MacGruber.

805
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:38,038
You just made me a teeny-weeny
bit wealthier than I already am.

806
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:40,049
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something useful to do with it.

807
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,944
Your companion's a very
beautiful young woman.

808
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,044
Thank you.

809
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:46,919
Hope you enjoy being
date raped, ma'am.

810
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,013
This is my daughter.

811
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,114
Hello.

812
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:51,595
MACGRUBER: Sorry.

813
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:53,591
He killed my wife.

814
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,864
Will you excuse us
for a minute, please?

815
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:02,303
Where's the X-5?

816
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,267
I don't know what
you're talking about.

817
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,933
Where's the fucking
warhead?

818
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,840
What would I want
with a nuclear warhead?

819
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,146
(LAUGHS) I never
said it was nuclear.

820
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:14,183
That's right, because most
warheads are filled with air.

821
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,481
You know, I ran
into Zeke Pleshette

822
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,112
and Hoss Bender
the other day.

823
00:46:19,256 --> 00:46:20,280
Really?
How were they?

824
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,983
A lot less dead
than they are now.

825
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:23,287
Oh, really.
That's too bad.

826
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:25,055
Yeah, it's too bad for you.
'Cause they were a part

827
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,187
of your little dream team
of thugs, weren't they?

828
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:30,563
Oh, that's right. You got me.
Past tense. They were...

829
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,465
Yeah, it's really quite
a sad story, actually.

830
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:33,625
What do you mean?

831
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:35,762
I had assembled the greatest
dream team of thugs

832
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:37,397
in the history
of the world.

833
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,032
I had them all
in one room,

834
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:41,236
and I also had
some homemade C-4.

835
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:43,973
And wouldn't you know
it, it exploded.

836
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,241
And I lost them all.

837
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:47,010
You're shitting me.
You're shitting me!

838
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:48,783
Well, we have
a lot in common

839
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:50,148
because I basically did
the same thing...

840
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:51,380
Oh, no, wait.
That didn't happen to me

841
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:54,981
because I'm not a fucking retard
who blows up his own dudes.

842
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:56,150
Fuck you, Cunth.

843
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:58,761
And by the way,
I have a new team now.

844
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:00,626
Not only do I have
Vicki St. Elmo...

845
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,221
Maybe you've heard of her?

846
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,530
But I also have one of the greatest
young military minds around.

847
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,694
I mean, this guy's
the real deal.

848
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:09,170
And we're gonna stop you.

849
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:12,169
Well, you certainly have a
healthy imagination, MacGruber.

850
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:16,042
But I don't know anything about a
warhead, nuclear or otherwise.

851
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,249
You're lying.
And you're a piece of shit.

852
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,578
We're all done here.

853
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,584
Would you show
Mr. MacGruber the door?

854
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:25,822
Let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

855
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,818
First I'm gonna
kick you in the chin,

856
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,790
breaking your jaw
in four places.

857
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,191
I'm gonna take you and karate
flip you over my back,

858
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:34,696
and then knee your nose into your
brain, killing you instantly.

859
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:36,659
I do wanna get
a throat rip in here.

860
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,826
I think that's gonna
be you, small fry.

861
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:41,696
One thing I do know, at the
end of the day, Cunth,

862
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:42,863
I'm gonna rip your dick off
and shove it in your mouth.

863
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:47,906
And that is non-negotiable.
Who's first?

864
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:51,748
Shit!

865
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,743
My fucking back.

866
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:00,021
You did not just do that.
That is a Blaupunkt!

867
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:02,222
You owe me
a Blaupunkt!

868
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:04,416
Where's Vicki?

869
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,197
I'm not sure
I can do this.

870
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:15,702
MACGRUBER ON RADIO:
Vicki, where are you?

871
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,036
Don't do it for yourself.
Do it for your family.

872
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:19,234
Vicki!

873
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:20,310
GARVER: My family?

874
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,939
Good night, Senator.

875
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:23,271
Vicki, I just got
thrown out of the party.

876
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,847
I got thrown through a window.
Shh.

877
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,313
Threw my Blaupunkt out, too.

878
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,384
And it's broken, and I'm really
fucking bummed about it.

879
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:31,888
MacGruber, I'm watching Senator
Garver talk to Constantine Bach.

880
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,889
Oh, well, I'm glad that
you're having so much fun

881
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,186
checking out all the cute
guys at the party, Vicki,

882
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,852
but there's a nuclear
threat going on

883
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,794
and we could use all
the help we can get.

884
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:42,388
So can you please
get out here?

885
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:43,557
(SIGHS) Fine.

886
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:48,235
First of all,
great party.

887
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:49,601
Let's get that
out of the way.

888
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:51,538
I loved the music,
I loved the dancing,

889
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:52,768
the sushi, excellent.

890
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,741
I particularly enjoyed
being humiliated

891
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:57,405
by MacGruber in front of my
daughter and all my guests.

892
00:48:57,514 --> 00:48:59,607
By the way, does anyone
know how he got in?

893
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:02,014
He walked in
the front door, sir.

894
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:03,750
He walked in
the front door.

895
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:07,312
I imagined there'd be a more
complicated explanation than that.

896
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:08,391
Sorry, sir.

897
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,687
Jeff, there's no need
to apologize.

898
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:11,818
I appreciate
your honesty.

899
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:13,760
Would you move a bit
to your left, please?

900
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:15,098
Sir.

901
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:16,700
Great.

902
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,261
Anyone else feel
like being honest?

903
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:25,965
Great, hang that in the foyer
and go kill MacGruber.

904
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:30,211
Damn it, MacGruber!

905
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:31,980
I specifically told you
not to go in there.

906
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:34,944
I got him exactly
where I want him.

907
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,885
Do you? 'Cause I think
it's the other way around.

908
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:39,512
Agree to disagree, Jim.

909
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,590
Look, I'm really
sorry, okay?

910
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:47,022
"Sorry" is not going to keep us
safe from this goddamn warhead!

911
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,135
Mac, you've turned
into a liability.

912
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:57,801
And I have no choice but to
take you off this mission.

913
00:49:57,908 --> 00:49:59,739
And this time,
it's for real.

914
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,934
But he has
the passcodes now!

915
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,344
Because you couldn't
stop him.

916
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,177
Jim, you can't do this.

917
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,408
Oh, I can and I just did.

918
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:26,830
I will suck
your fucking dick.

919
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,170
I will let you fuck me.

920
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:31,541
(SCOFFS)
I'm sorry, Mac.

921
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:34,774
It's over.

922
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:43,410
I can't stop thinking about that
envelope that Senator Garver got.

923
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,420
I bet there was some
kind of a clue in there.

924
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:48,457
It's cute that you're still
thinking about that, Vicki.

925
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,187
But, trust me, there's
nothing to Garver.

926
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:52,489
I have a feeling
in my gut.

927
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,128
Yeah. Sorry.

928
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:56,664
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

929
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,497
Both of you guys have
just done a great job.

930
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:01,400
If there's anyone
to blame here, it's me.

931
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:04,071
If it's any consolation,

932
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:05,698
being with you
the last few days,

933
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:06,867
I've learned a lot.

934
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:10,138
All of it was
what not to do,

935
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,010
but that's an important part
of the learning process.

936
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,883
I'm gonna go use
the ladies' room.

937
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,179
Number one
or number two?

938
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:17,684
Number none-of-your-business.

939
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:19,312
That means number two.

940
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,390
Shut up!

941
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:25,621
So when are you
gonna make your move?

942
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:27,227
What are you
talking about?

943
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,491
Come on, man.
You can see it from a mile away.

944
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,100
(LAUGHS)
Shut your butt!

945
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:34,102
No, seriously.
You two are perfect for each other.

946

at what she does,

But I can very
confidently tell you

952
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:54,180
that Vicki and I will
never ever be like that.

953
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,322
Never ever say,
"Never ever."

954
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,187
No, this time I can.

955
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,964
After Casey, I made
a promise to myself

956
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,626
that I would never be
with another woman.

957
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:07,863
Must have been
really hard.

958
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:12,198
Why did he do it?
Why did Cunth kill your wife?

959
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,469
To this day,
I have no idea.

960
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,180
We actually all went
to college together.

961
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:22,542
Believe it or not,
we were very close friends.

962
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:27,481
Then after graduation,
he got engaged to her.

963
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,087
He asked me
to be his best man

964
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:32,560
and right about
that time,

965
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:35,325
I started banging her
and mowing her box.

966
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,262
She was actually
the first person

967
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:41,201
I felt comfortable
enough around

968
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:42,897
to let eat
out my butt.

969
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:48,040
Anyway,
shortly thereafter,

970
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:50,908
she left him
for me.

971
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,179
She was actually carrying
his child at the time.

972
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:57,080
I asked her to terminate
it, obviously,

973
00:52:57,187 --> 00:52:58,711
so we could
start fresh.

974
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,646
And she agreed.

975
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:04,821
We were so in love.

976
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:08,021
And he took
that from me.

977
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,198
That's really fucked up.

978
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:11,827
Thanks.

979
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,797
You know,
you're a good guy.

980
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,934
And I need to apologize
for something.

981
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:20,665
No, you don't.
No, I do.

982
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:24,077
I treated you so badly.

983
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:29,411
I guess I just felt threatened
by you, believe it or not.

984
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:33,014
And I'm not used
to feeling that way.

01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:15,970

01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:17,306
And, look,

1222
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:18,880
sorry about
last night.

It was a real

something straight.

I'm not doing
this for you.

are at stake.

just as at stake.

for that.

Just stop.

Well, then, I guess you'll see.

Will I? Yeah, you will.
And so will they.

01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:02,991
CUNTH: Bravo, MacGruber!

1556
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:05,191
I expected no less
from a washout like you.

1557
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,564
Once again,
I win. You lose.

1558
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:10,069
I didn't finish
my sentence, Dieter.

1559
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:14,370
No, I cannot defuse your missile.
But I can do this.

1560
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,740
Launch commencing
in one minute.

No!
A nuclear warhead's

1564
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:23,577
not quite the same without
its thermonuclear core.

1565
01:22:23,685 --> 01:22:25,209
CUNTH: Damn it!
(LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY)

1566
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,015
It doesn't matter.

1567
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:29,249
There's still enough ammonium
nitrate left in that warhead

1568
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:31,724
to blow up the White House
and Congress, combined.

1569
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:32,919
Right again, Cunth.

1570
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:36,657
Of course, it's going to be
awfully hard to fly it without

Weak!

1574
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,263
So I guess
you do win.

1575
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:47,171
And your prize will be
getting blown to smithereens

1576
01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:48,868
in about how long,
Mrs. MacGruber?

1577
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:50,274
Thirty-two seconds!

1578
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:53,405
Well, we better scoot.
We do have a wedding to plan.

1579

two, one, zero.

I love you both.

1588
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:04,309
PRIEST: Theirs is a love
that knows no bounds.

1589
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,512
A love that heals
in times of sickness.

1590

A love that forgives
in times of anger.

1591

A love that loves
in times of love.

PIPER: Hmm.

1593

It's beautiful, honey.

1594
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:19,829
Thank you.

1595
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:24,065
Now, is there anyone here with
just cause why these two souls

1596
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:25,969
should not be joined
in holy matrimony?

1597
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,637
(MOUTHING)
You scared me!

1598
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,879

1601
