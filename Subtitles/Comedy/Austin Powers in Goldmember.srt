00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,587
Welcome back Doctor,

31
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,117
How was space?

32
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,917
Space was cool, wasn't it Mini me?

33
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,827
Doctor Evil, while you were in space.

34
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,261
I created a way for us to make
hugh sums of legitimate money

35
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,259
and still maintain the ethics
in the business practices

36
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,828
of an evil organization...

37
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:59,142
I have turned us into a talent agency.
The Hollywood talent agency. -Really?

38
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,543
By charging clients 9% rather
than the traditional 10%

39
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,852
We've been able to signed such star ...

40
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,114
such as George Clooney

41
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,452
Julia Roberts.

42
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,020
And Leo Dicapro.

43
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,615
And the best part of the
whole scheme is...

44
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,485
We all get our own assistance.

45
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,053

00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:24,231

48
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,372

49
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,469

Powerful enought to put
a meteor to earth

56
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,973
The meteor is called "Minus 22"

57

Is made of solid gold.
Is he sleeping?

58
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,307

67
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,177
For example, Mini me loves chocolate.

Scotty don't!

69
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,407

finsih your plan.

Oh come on, you're such a lame ass!

79
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,548
This is causing me psychological harm.

80
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,358
I don't know who am I.

81
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,557
Y'know what?
I would love some chocolate.

82
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,828
Thank you.

83
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,468

Are you okay, Mini me?

85
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,081
Did I pull you too hard?
I don't want to hurt you.

86
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,317
Dr. Evil.

87
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,111
Yo?

88
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,979

89
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,647
has to do with us?
-Our earlier attempt of the tractor

90
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:37,430
beams went through serveral preparation.
Preparation A were a compelete failure.

91
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,500
But now ladies and gentlemens, we
finally have a working tractor beam

92
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,129
Which we shall called "Preparation H"

93

94
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,673
Why don't you called it operation
Ass-cream Ass.

95
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,343
I'm sorry would you like some ice-cream.

96
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,211
Yes, I'd like some chocolate ice-cream.

97
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,182
Perhaps later.

98
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,246
Doctor Evil, I love your plan.

99
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,985
Really?

100
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,319
Yeah doctor, is a really good plan.

101
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,126
Yes, on the whole
I think preparation H is good.

102
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,261
What is it now?

103
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,468
No, nothing. Y'know what? I agree...

104
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,694
Preparation H does feel good.

105
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,595
On the whole,

106
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,508
Well, I'm glad we expected you
to stay linkerity

107
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,738
Well, ladies and gentlemens,
I shall travel back to 1975

108
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,881
Pick up goldmembers and bring it
back to the future.

109
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,616
And the best part of the plan is...

110
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,446
No one can stop me.

111
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,652
Even Austin Powers.

112
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,564
Not so fast.

113
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,868
You're surrounded Dr. Evil.

114
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,540

118
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,118
No, but I think Mini Me does.

119
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,666
Look like 2 eggs and a hankie.

120
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,273

164
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,305
He's been kiddnapped.

165
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,779
So that's why my father wasn't
at the knighting cermony

166
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,882
No actually.

167
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,253
He was kiddnapped after you
were knighted.

168
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,024

God Blimey. Your private is painted
gold. How bizarre.

psychology of a mad man

00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,818
My father is missing.

182
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,694
Yes, I've heard. How ironic.

183
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,591
You've finally caught me, but yet
now you need me more then ever

184
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,139
You always needed me
haven't you Mr Powers?

185
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,101
Remember when I told you
we are no different you and I

186
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:12,949
We are not so different you and I.
-Very clever.

187
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,917
But now, who has my father?

188
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,056
Nothing could be my father
from the truth.

189
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,728
You said my father.

190
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,053
No, I didn't.

191
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,963
Didn't Didn't

192
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,594
For me is a dad issue.

193
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,303
Daddy loves me.

194
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,440
It seems like the knighting cermony
wasn't the only time your...

195
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,973
daddy let you down.

196
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,155
Remember that day at the academy? Think!

197
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,617
It was graduation.

198
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,191
"British Intelligence Academy-1958"

199
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,410
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?

200
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,308
We were just getting started.

201
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,280
Don't forget you have
a brief oral exam.

202
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,004
Looks like Master Evil is the
top international man of mystery

203
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,034
He's number of the class.

204
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,713
Hi, everybody I'm number 1.

205
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,242
Hello, I'm number 2.

206
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,517
Nice to meet you number 2

207
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:02,050
I'm going to be name
international man of mystery

208
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,473
Who threw the cup cake? Honestly?

209
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:27,712
And now is time to award the honour
this year international man of mystery.

210
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,855
Austin Power
-Well done Austin

211
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,705
Is like in my dream to win this award
just like my dad.

212
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,568
Stand up dad, take a bow.

213
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,980
Dad?

214
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,606
I had the best score in the class
and I didn't get diddy squat

215
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,898
Tell me Austin Powers,

216
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:30,845
What did you find on the sailors?
A golden surprise? Perhaps?

217
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,952
All the sailors have their meat
painted gold.

218
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,055
Yes, is the criminal master mind.

219
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:47,159
Name: Goldmembers

220
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,801
How can I find this gold members?

221
00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:01,507
Could quote Mr Powers.
I give you Goldmembers

222
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,538
You give me a transfer
to a regular prison

223
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,651
So I could be with my beloved Mini me.

224
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,486
I can get you a tansfer to a regular
prison, now where's goldmember?

225
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,423
Not where Mr Powers,

226
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,525
But when

227
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:22,690
1975 Studio.
New York city. Corner 68

228
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:50,091
Instead of hiding your father in some
location. Goldmembers hiding in 1975.

229
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,990
So our engineerers craved this vehicle

230
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,029
to time travel to the Seventy

231
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:02,295
Smashing. A pimp moblie
-I know is particular your fancy

232
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,407
What can I say?

233
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,438
Here we go, 1975.

234
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,071
Good luck, Austin.

235
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,911
1975, yeah baby, yeah.

236
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,633
New York City 1975, Studio 69

237
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,733
Good evening everybody.
And welcome to studio 69.

238
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,341
Ladies and gentlemens,
Goldmembers.

239
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,955
Everybody, I'm feeling horny.

240
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,739
Isn't that Austin Powers?

241
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,070
I'm sorry?

242
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,941
You got a lots of nerves checking
your job wide ass in here.

243
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,982
I don't believe we even met?

244
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,280
Is me Foxy.

245
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,014
Long time no see.

246
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,853
Stop.

247
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,459
We can't be seen talking to each others

248
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,331
Because is kind of distraction.

249
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,663
I get it, very clever.

250
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,693
First thing first.

251
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,439
No body stands up with Foxy Clepabra.

252
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,278
I never intended to hurt you baby.

253
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,882
I got got a taste of honey.

254
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,227
Oh behave.
You always make me laugh.

255
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,262
Well, y'know is a gift baby.

256
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,504
Foxy, what are you doing in
Goldmembers club?

257
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,969
I'm under cover.

258
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,378
About a year ago my mate was killed.

259
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,574
The gold members is prime top suspect.

260
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,151
Your father is in the back room,

261
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,579
under heavy guard.

262
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,585
Thanks Foxy.

263
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,155
Austin, good luck.

264
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,400
Dad!

265
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,443
Hello son.

266
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,512
I'm here to rescue you.

267
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,580
Come quickly

268
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,553
Why don't you rescue me
in about 7, 8 minutes.

269
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,378
Knock it off.

270
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,660
I don't want to see my dad on the job.
come on let's go.

271
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,420
I'm sorry.

272
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,663
What's wrong with your neck?

273
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,499
What a stiff neck I have.

274
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,844
Listen dad, if you are gonna
talk naughty things

275
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,272
in front of these American girls.

276
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,912
At least speak english, english.

277
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,617
Alrightmy son.

278
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,580
I was about to make love
to this pretty girl

279
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,622
Is this true?

280
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,192
If you were aroused,
why didn't you pleasure yourself?

281
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,561
What alone?

282
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,562
Indeed.

283
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,198
Remember Christmas dinner
with the Scottish girl.

284
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,400
The insane one?

285
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,004
She was the wife of the dancer
who lived upstairs.

286
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,107
A lawyer who became a
policeman in a truck...

287
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:14,943
????????????...Tea kettle!

288
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,742
Shat on a turtle!

289
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:20,614
That was a good time.

290
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,929
Welcome to 1975, Austin Powers.

291
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,603
Excuse me I have to change,
the bogey sweater made me sweaty

292
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,673
You see Mr Powers.

293
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,970
I love golds.

294
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:54,141
The looks of it,
the smell of it, the texture...

295
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,116
I love gold so much...

296
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,423
I lost my virginity in

297
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,015
an accident.

298
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,662
Hence the name, gold members

299
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,198
We're both swingers you see.

300
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,736
You have a tight body.

301
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,372
You bod like a tiger.

302
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,644
Would you like a smoke in the pancake?

303
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,347
A what?

304
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,020
A smoke in the pancake

305
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,690
There is no pleasing you..

306
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,391
That's not right.

307
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,704
Hello, my hair...

308
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,971
That's a keeper,
put it in the skiner please.

309
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,836
Don't be disgusting.

310
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,807
Quickly, quickly thank you.

311
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,116
You're insane Goldmember!

312
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,349
That's the way, I like it.

313
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,956
Is the KC and Sunshine band.

314
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,491
Alright gold members,
don't play the laughing boys.

315
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,259
There's only 2 things I can't stand
in this world

316
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,833
People who are intolerant,
of other's people culture.

317
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,535
And the Dutch.

318
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,671
What?

319
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,035
Take him away.

320
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,911
And now it is time to say good bye.

321
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,482
The Dr. Evils ordered

322
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,214
Which for you is bad news.

323
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,927
Up your ass!

324
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,038
He's taking my father to the
time machine.

325
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,373
Come on now.

326
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,453
That was close Foxy,
I owe you one.

327
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,818
Austin, I found this in Goldmember's office.

328
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,323
Is a micro film might be a clue.
-Smashing.

329
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,664
We can catch goldmember together.
I want to go to the future with you.

330
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,068
I should warn you Foxy,

331
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,626
2002 is very different.

332
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,437
Well, the future better gets
ready for me.

333
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,736
Because I'm Foxy Clepatra.

334
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,399
I'm a whole loud woman!

335
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,911
2002, here we come.

336
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,617
"Georgia State Prison"

337
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,661
I have some news.

338
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,696
Is your son.

339
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,734
he wants to take over the
family business.

340
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,864
Scotty Does?

341
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,937
He got so evil he'd starts
to losing his hair.

342
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,043
He just wants to make
you proud doctor.

343
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,845
After all is hard for the boy
not having a father,

344
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,786
Now you're in space,
now you're in jail

345
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,851
Don't tell me he feels nelgected.

346
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,091
I was adopted by freaking Begiums.

347
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,591
You were adopted?

348
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,694
I never met my birth parent.

349
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
There was a car accident.

350
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,703
I was told it was a beautiful
Begium day.

351
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,804
The smell of waffles and brussel
sprout filled the summer air until...

352
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,878
My birth mother was incinerated

353
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,546
I only survived because of
smoky conkies

354
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,878
formed a human influents.

355
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,622
They raised me to be evil.

356
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,537
Nothing compared to this.

357
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,133
being inside the belly of the beast
night after night all alone...

358
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,773
Let's freak.

359
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:32,918
Time's up.

360
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,188
Visiting time is over.

361
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,730
Move it.

362
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,618
Gentlemens, listen up.

363
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,853
Here is the new plan.

364
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,289
You're going to start a riot.

365
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,951
And we're going to walk out
the front door.

366
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:13,067
Hey man, other mens make
more sense then you.

367
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,336
Really?

368
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,037
Let me put it to you this way.

369
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,086
Tonight 8 p.m...

370
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,456
You're going to start a riot.

371
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,726
There you are, good morning sunshine.

372
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,187
Morning

373
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,627
Did you get some sleep?
Great.

374
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,730
Me too.

375
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,805
You have the mail.

376
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,506
What does this thing do?

377
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,009
Well, is called the internet.

378
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,678
It compeletely revolutionise
the way we live and

379
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,288
access to vital information

380
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,821
For example, have a look at this.

381
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,166
And now that's vital information?

382
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,534
I know is amazing.

383
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,367
What's happening baby?

384
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,133
A lot has happening Foxy.

385
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,035
Dr. Evil has escaped.

386
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,846
The good news is one of my agent

387
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,679
has able to manage to infiltrate
Dr. Evil's organisation.

388
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,154
Excellent, we have tried for years
to get a mole in to Dr. Evil's lair.

389
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,224
Yes.

390
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,916
Here he is.

391
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:34,338
The most...

392
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,636
The most excellent agent
we've ever seen?

393
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,102
Yes, the most excellent agent
we've ever seen.

394
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,836
Thank you.

395
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,741
Well, I don't know the exact location.

396
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,784
But I have learnt that Dr'Evil Lair has moved

397
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,479
to an area outside Toyko,Japan.

398
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,656
But the way I do realise I have
a large mole on my face.

399
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,985
What? Where's that mole?

400
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,191
I didn't see one.

401
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,099
I also realise the ironic, I am myself.

402
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,830
No one will make that connection.

403
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,303
Any way...well done.

404
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,512
Is nice to mole you.
Don't say mole.

405
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:22,614
Stop.

406
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,385
Bye.
-Mole.

407
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,238
Shut up!

408
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,411
"Tokyo Bay"

409
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,115
A periscope

410
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,262
Ladies and gentlemens,
welcome to my submarines lair.

411
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,406
Is long and hard for the seamons

412
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,678
Nothing? Not some?

413
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,851
Dr Evil! You looked very torn

414
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,849
Really you look like a man.

415
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,822
Goldmember, what did one dude
say to another dude?

416
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:47,832
Yeah, a little creepy.
Yes this is a keeper.

417
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,071
You're not gonna put that skin
in your mouth are you?

418
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,679
You did. Okay, that's just gross.

419
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,015
That was good.

420
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:08,192
Ladies and gentlenmens,
As you know,

421
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,683
We have been designing
a tractor beam.

422
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,924
Code name "Preparation H."

423
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:18,664
Is powerful enough to pull the
meteor or Midas 22

424
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,361
Collison cause with the earth

425
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,666
upon entering the atmosphere
the bottom magma

426
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:33,405
Causing a gobal flood.
Allow me to demonstrate

427
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,254
Go down the gobal.

428
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,355
Congratulation

429
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,464
You have succeeded to turn me
a jack in the box.

430
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,136
I'm okay, I'm okay.

431
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,709
Release the meteor

432
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,480
God damn it!

433
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,584
Way to go.

434
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,864
Let's try to find my balls
for god sake.

435
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,033
I'm ok,

436
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,668

utimate shire police

437
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,573

His father doctor Evil.

441
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,484
His father?

442
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,791
Don't don't speak freaky dutch.

443
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,392
His dad.

444
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,468
Dad the father.

445
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:06,940
Nigel Powers.

446
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,310
Hello, hello.

447
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,274
Bring him to me.

448
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,649
Easy peasy, lemon squeaky.

449
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:17,952
Put the gun down.

450
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,990
Is this the first day on the job
or something?

451
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,627
Look, this is how dutch, you attack me one at a time.

452
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,763
I knock you out at a single punch.

453
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:26,821
Okay go.

454
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,221
He's good.

455
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,364
Do you know who I am?

456
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,462
Have you realise how many
people I've killed over the years?

457
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,708
Look at you.
You don't even have a name tag.

458
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,168
You got no chance.

459
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,311
Why don't you just roll down

460
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,014
Alright, Dr.Evil give yourself up
while you still have a chance

461
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,186
Okay, okay. You got me.

462
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,823
Nigel Powers meet mini me.

463
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,230
I thought it was a small cabbage.

464
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,159
Take him away!

465
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,099
Can I paint his youoo gold?

466
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:19,073
How about no you crazy Dutch bastard!

467
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,154
You know, I think is a shame the
way they treat you.

468
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,797
Just because you're one 8th their size.

469
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,429
Doesn't mean you deserve one
8th of their respect?

470
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,364
I'm curious.

471
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,505
Is everything in proportion?

472
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:00,755
Don't be shy, let's have a look.

473
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,096
My word, you're a tripod.

474
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,397
What do you feed that thing huh?
Is like a baby holding an apple?

475
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:21,270
The good new is if you get tired,
you can use it as a kick stand

476
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,776
I think we both know who the main
man is behide this operation.

477
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,826
Tokyo International Airport, Japan.

478
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,131
Tokyo is a gogo baby yeah.

479
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,933
What's kicking?

480
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,909
A lot is kicking Foxy.

481
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,375
Austin?

482
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,738
One of Dr Evil's hutchman

483
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,578
has been spotted at the
Asahi Sumo Arena.

484
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,375
See there immediately.

485
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,707
Thanks Basso

00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:08,489
"Asahi Sumo Arena"

487
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:14,129
Jesus christ! This is making
my nuts fall together.

488
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,129
Is good as star fire!

489
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,394
That's not right.
-Are we done here?

490
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,677
That's not right.
I think is fat bastard.

491
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,692
Are you okay, Austin?

492
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,028
Sound as a pound love.

493
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,026
Hey diaper lady! Here's my diaper.

494
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,945
You really are a fat bastard.

495
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,514
You're hurting my feeling.

496
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:15,613
I'm going on a date.

497
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,293
Who's your friend?

498
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,893
Do you find me sexy?

499
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,697
Shut up mouth.

500
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,074
That's enough.

501
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,874
Okay you got me, put it down.

502
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,055
My tit'it.

503
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:05,796
I got you now.

504
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,209
For the utimate manoeuvre.

505
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,052
I hope all my friends get ready!

506
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,137
Oh crinky.

507
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,040
What if my wire broke?

508
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,017
You're under arrest sugar.

509
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,853
Okay, fat bastard, who the Japanese
you made an exchange with?

510
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,095
His name is Roberto.

511
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,766
He owns the Roberto industry.

512
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,334
The tractor beam.

513
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,570
You honestly think that crime can pay?

514
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,014
I really take my sumo westling
seriously y'know.

515
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:37,227
I'm an over weight child in a
society that demands perfection.

516
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,960
Hey pa!

517
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,957
Hey Scotty.

518
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,727
I got you a present.

519
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,798
Really?

520
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,765
Open the tank.

521
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,644
Are those sharks got laser beams
attached to their head?

522
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,477
Cool.

523
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,617
I have sharks got laser beam

524
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:13,983
attached to their freaking head.

525
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:18,020
We're the evil dad and evil
son you can ever ask for.

526
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,155
I love you, dad

527
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:26,894
I love you son

528
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,003
This is the moment.

529
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,170
Scotty, come here

530
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,807
Come to squat next to daddy.

531
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,642
Mini me, move down the bench.

532
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,393
Scotty is on fire.

533
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,795
Alright, is getting crowded in here.

534
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,863
Everyone out, everyone out!

535
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,434
Not you Scotty.

536
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:02,360
Not you number 2.

537
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:06,872
Not you guys back there.

538
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,822
This is uncomfortable.

539
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,600
You mustn't understand his small.

540
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:57,090
Austin, we are confirmed what fat
bastard told you was accurate.

541
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,391
He was hired by Dr Evil to
constructed preparation H

542
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,231
So Roberto has the technology
to built Tractor beam.

543
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,265
Which mean Roberto will lead
us to gold members?

544
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,366
which mean goldmembers
will lead us to my father.

545
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,599
"Roboto Industries
Tokyo Headquarters"

546
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,678
I am president of Roboto Industries.

547
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,919
My name is Mr. Roboto.

548
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:26,389
Thank you Mr. Roboto.

549
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:31,053
Thank you for seeing us on
such short notice.

550
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,088
You speak Japanese?

551
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,671
I'm looking for my father.

552
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,501
He was kiddnapped.

553
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,903
Please eat some shit.

554
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,267
Please eat what?

555
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:55,550
Please eat some shitake mushrooms.

556
00:55:56,252 --> 00:56:04,819
Tell me what do you know about
my father whereabout?

557
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,769
Your ass is happy.

558
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,498
No,

559
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:22,267
Your assignment is an unhappy one.

560
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,881
I have a hugh rode

561
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,052
I have a rodent problem.

562
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,719
A little off the topic,
but unfortunate nonetheless.

563
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,683
Quite off topic, thank you very much.

564
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,584
Why don't I just speak in English?

565
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,263
That would be a good idea, wouldn't it?

566
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,257
That way I wouldn't mis read
the subtitles

567
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,026
making like you're saying things
which are dirty.

568
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,729
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

569
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:54,975
please excuse me.

570
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,469
I have another appointment.

571
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,587
But the way I do have a hugh rod.

572
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,317
But the way I do have a hugh rod...
I wish.

573
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,019
Roboto was lying to us.

574
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,419
Tell me something I don't know.

575
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,158
What?

576
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,235
My interest tells me my father
is still in this building.

577
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,829
You keep a look out.
I'll try to sneak in.

578
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,775
Austin Powers is on the premises.

579
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:28,841
Yes, sir.

580
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,377
Keep a look out for Austin Powers.

581
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,353
Come here and look at this.

582
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,229
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

583
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:42,776
There's gold members

584
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,915
You need this to work the tractor beam.

585
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,586
Is a gold key.

586
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,395
Hand up Gold member!

587
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,366
Is pay back time!

588
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,298
I'm sure you can kill me.

589
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,408
But what happens to
Austin Powers's father?

590
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:24,750
Dad!

591
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,012
He's going to have an
unfortunate accident.

592
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,234
Don't worry dad,
I'm here to rescue you.

593
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,242
Now you're trying to save me.

594
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,436
Instead of stopping Goldmembers?

595
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,170
He won't get away.

596
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,112
Austin, goldmember is getting away.

597
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,117
Hello, hello, are you gonna
introduce us Austin?

598
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,494
She is...

599
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,756
Nigel Powers.

600
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,159
Is that Odin Flora you're wearing?

601
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,320
Yes, it is.

602
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,299
That should how woman should smell.

603
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,465
My life, even if you live up
to the reputation.

604
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:27,548
I got an idea

605
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:33,855
Your car is mini.

606
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,381
Is not the size mate.

607
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:36,984
Is how you use it.

608
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,219
What? I saved your life.

609
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,118
Should have done your job!

610
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,512
Shut up and turn around!

611
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,215
Run! Is Godzilla!

612
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,490
Is Godzilla.

613
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,736
This is goldmember

614
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,272
Oh great, goldmember got away.

615
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,374
Now what?

616
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,475
I think is obvious, we should take Dr. Evil layout.

617
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,011
You can be my back up son.
-Back up?

618
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,157
Well, I don't like to use gadgets.

619
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,400
You know, I think being frozen
damage your brain

620
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,869
And how would you know?

621
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,109
What are you saying son?

622
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,888
What about your Swissish nanny?

623
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,529
Let said I didn't hired her
for the cooking.

624
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,533
When you were 24.

625
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,565
We were mates you and I.

626
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,776
I need a father.

627
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,078
I've risked my life trying
to save you.

628
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,944
If you got an issue, here's your tissue.

629
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,390
That is not funny.

630
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,224
Well, I supposed we should
go our separate way then

631
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:08,596
Fine.

632
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:12,899
Fine.

633
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,283
"Austin's Tokyo Hotel"

634
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,617
So I've been signed to welcome
you to the minister of defense

635
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,265
I can't wait to tell Austin
your affection.

636
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,375
Austin should be here any second.

637
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:09,695
Are you trying to kill me?

638
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,633
You want to be friends huh

639
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:17,767
Wait a tit.

640
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,636
I wwon't fall for that again.

641
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,428
I think people treated him badly

642
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,720
That's why he decided to help us.

643
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,873
I'm sure Austin and him...

644
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,648
I guarantee mini me will be alright.

645
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,970
Austin, there you are.

646
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:35,476
Mini me has switched side.

647
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,850
Sorry.

648
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,121
Welcome aboard.

649
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,732
Mole!

650
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,212
Better?

651
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,195
So you decided to join us huh,
Mini me?

652
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,365
And thank you for the map
of Dr.Evil's son.

653
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,946
You are so beautiful.

654

You're and angel.

655
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,019
You're so sweet.

656
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,765
Are you sure you don't have
a little clone in you?

657
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,044
That is so not funny.

658
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,612
Okay, prepare to dive.

659
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,786
This car will turn into submarine.

660
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,502
Get me the world organisation!

661
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,366
What it is Dr. Evil?

662
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,269
In a few hours the meteor will crash
into the world

663
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,570
to make a global flood.

664
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:52,517
Unless you pay me 1 billion,
1 zillion....

665
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,594
I think you're bluffing.

666
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,290
Do you want me to demonstrate?

667
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:04,590
No.2 the key please.

668
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,623
Sir, Dr Evil is not bluffing.

669
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,359
Which one?

670
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:33,857
Is that one that looks like...

671
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,058
Juicy melons

672
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,793
What do you think?

673
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,331
Any sign of that satellitle?

674
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,733
No, is gone.

675
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,410
Cool baby, you are very switch on.

676
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:01,374
Thank you Austin.

677
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,250
Dr Evil, is been success

Bonus.

679
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:34,748
You're not joking.

680
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,179
In fact, if you don't give me
the bonus...

681
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,090
Let me take you out of this.

682
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,575
That's the evil laugh.

683
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,040
Scotty.

684
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,659
Let's go.

685
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,694
We need to disgust.

686
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:28,664
There's only one uniform.

687
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,515
Hello, buddy, how it going?

688
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,357
Sorry about that.

01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,425
Good hat.

01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:02,995
Come on Mini me, let's go.

691
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,571
Hold it right there mister.

692
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,470
Did you really think you could
get away with this?

693
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,347
I did actually yes.

694
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,310
Every new recruit must
have a physical

695
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,618
Now get in here sailor

696
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,804

Okay, let's go to that screen.

699
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,518
Is over there.

700
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,964
Come on, hurry the map.

701
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,301
I'm going to need a urine sample,

01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,111
Mini me there's shadows,

You should check that out.

01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,392
What the hell is going on in here?

705
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,533
Hands up.

706
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,808
You heard me I said hands up.

707
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,182
Come with me.

708
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:10,947

Mr Powers.

712
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:57,729
Before I kill you, I think you'd like
to see the genius of my plan

713
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,670
Key please.

714
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,983

It has finally come down to this.

Dad?

724
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,082
What are you doing here.

725
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,625
I got to finish this up once
and for all.

726
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,522
You can't do that.

727
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,463
I have to protect my son.

728
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:00,058
Dad, I'm fine.

729
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,534
I'm not talking about you.

730
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:06,733
I'm talking about him...

731
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,202
What?

732
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,409
Dr. Evil is not your son.

733
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:15,915
I am your son.

734
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,278
You both are.

735
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,819
What?

736
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,955
It was our first...

737
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,920
family holiday together.

738
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,294
I've just finish a case.

739
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,189
Your mother brought the two
of you to Begium.

740
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,431
I stopped to have a tinker

741
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,285
But my parent...

742
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,150
died in a car accident.

743
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:54,178
It was no accident.

744
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,814
It was an assassination attempt.

745
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,293
I thought only Austin survived

746
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,989
I should have told you
the truth earlier.

747
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:06,260
But those Begium,
they made you so evil.

748
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:15,269
Very interesting Mr Powers.

749
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,405
I have to see all the facts.

750
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,975
Dad!

751
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,811
Daddy is here.

752
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,123
Dad, what's going on?

753
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,624
What are you going to do Austin?

754
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,337
Austin?

755
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,011
Are you sure you can trust Dr. Evil?

756
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:00,877
He ain't heavy,
he's my brother baby.

757
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,589
I should have told you
so long ago son.

758
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,153
I'm very proud of you.

759
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,557
Can you forgive me?

760
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,842
Oh come on, first I'm not evil
enough for you.

761
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,075
And now you're going to turn good?

762
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,083
Listen Scott.

763
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,820
You can try your whole life

764
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,685
wins your parent accepted.

765
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,188
Believe me, at the end of the day,
you have to do it for yourself.

766
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,423
Austin.

767
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,233
What?

768
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:20,866
I hate you.

769
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,900
I hate you.

770
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,275
I don't even know you,
but I hate you.

771
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,235
I especially hate you.

772
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:34,646
You'll pay.

773
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:36,912
You'll all pay!

774
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,220
I'd like to point out

775
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,357
no body in my genes runs like a girl.

776
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:49,889
Dr.Evil.

777
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,466
You might not want to destroy the world.

778
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,298
I got to flood the earth!

779
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,008
Think again Gold member.

780
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:06,307
Huh, Foxy Celpatra.

781
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,839
Is a shame I have to killed
your partner.

782
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:12,809
Too bad for you.
-Too bad for me?

783
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,456
How about too bad for you?

784
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:17,055
Oh no.

785
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,389
Luckly I keep a spare.

786
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,376
Look everyone, I have a key.

787
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,503
Oh yeah, bloodly Dutchmens.

788
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:47,449
Foxy, I'm coming!

789
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,420
Don't do anythying stupid,
or the shooting begins.

790
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:55,660
Austin, I'll stay here and
be your back up

791
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,292
Evil, what do we do?

792
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:00,696
I'm not an evil genius.

793
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,965
I could rewire the capacity
of the tractor beam

794
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:11,704
Come on let's go.

795
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:19,547
The shooting begins..

796
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,791
You know Dr. Evil. I used to think
you were crazy.

797
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,869
I know.
Now I can see you're not.

798
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,097
I rang you?

799
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,809
Well done Austin.

800
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,845
You saved the world again.

801
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:26,477
Thank you.

802
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,291
Austin, you did it.

803
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:31,757
We did it.

804
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,059
Yeah baby.

805
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,330
No, just trying it on.

806
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,536
Goldmember,
you are under arrest.

807
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:52,541
Yeah, asshole, I have time for
a smoke and a pan cake.

808
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,848
Isn't that weird.

809
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,493
Fat bastard?

810
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,593
But you're not fat anymore.

811
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:44,731
I'm on a subway diet.

812
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,392
I've lost a 180 pounds.

813
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,627
Congratulation baby.

814
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:51,836
Thank you.

815
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,270
But I do have a little access
skin you know.

816
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,278
But unfortunately my neck
does look like a virgina

817
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:18,625
Austin, thank you for everything.

818
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,281
I'm going to get you
Austin Powers

819
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:03,071
-The end-
