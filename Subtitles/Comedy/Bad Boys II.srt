01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,908
Guys, look, I need this, okay?
And I am this close.

1177
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,160
What's "this close"?

1178
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:01,163
I'm now in charge of money laundering
for his entire operation.

1179
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,749
In a month or two we'll have enough for
a conviction. This whole thing'll be over.

1180
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,543
What about a day or two?
That sound better?

1181
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:10,046
Marcus and I think we found
the key to Tapia's whole operation.

1182
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,965
You have nothing to say now, huh?

1183
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:16,136
- Just stuck, right?
- Okay, time-out, y'all. Damn.

1184
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,221
We got this peckerwood
that's gonna put us down...

1185
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,391
with the transport end of Tapia's
operation. Do you want in?

1186
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,226
- Mike, why would you...?
- When?

1187
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:24,728
- MIKE: Tonight.
- Page me.

1188
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,855
Should I bring my thong?

1189
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,943
Get your bitch hands off.
I'll knock you the fuck out.

1190
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,239
Mike, we're trying to keep
her out of trouble, man...

1191
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,158
not invite her in.

1192
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,911
Man, I just figured,
you know, if she with us...

1193
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,997
that's just less trouble
she could get into.

1194
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:48,627
I'm gonna keep it real with you too, man.
I think she can handle herself.

1195
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,172
I'm gonna keep it real with you. Don't
nobody know my sister the way I do.

1196
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,425
Okay? She doesn't make
good choices, Mike.

1197
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:58,470
- She's not street-smart.
- Doesn't make good...?

1198
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,889
- Like, what kind of choices?
- Men, for one.

1199
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,808
She's attracted to these dumb...

1200
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,355
flashy, just musclebound
dickheads, Mike. You know?

1201
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:14,361
Cock diesel motherfuckers that can't
even fucking turn to wipe their ass, Mike.

1202
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,071
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

1203
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,699
You know? Just dumb
as a bucket of shrimp.

1204
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,662
Yeah. Yeah. That shit's crazy.

you don't think maybe you...

1206
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,292
Maybe you didn't, like,
get a chance to know any of them?

1207
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,461
I'm gonna give the next one a chance.

1208
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,589
A chance to whup his ass.

1209
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,258
Whup the shit out of him, Mike.

01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,218
Oh, you gonna...
Oh, you gonna fight him.

What I'm gonna do
ain't even gonna be legal.

- Just a little insurance.

- Know what I'm gonna do?

01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:23,555
I'm gonna send a special 8 x 10

You know what, it's a digital photo too.

I'm worried. There's too much heat

We need to put my money

Oh, and I told Mama

Maybe Mike's been flirting with me.
Did you ever think about that?

to come home? But I didn't.

I'll be very proud for you
to date my sister.

2166

- Thanks, man.
- All right.

2167

You know, me and Syd thought about it...

2168
02:19:46,295 --> 02:19:48,296
and your behaviour was so crazy that...

2169

whatever magic we could've captured...

2170
02:19:50,716 --> 02:19:53,134

You know.

of my little sister, huh, Mike?

- What, she not good enough for you?

Syd, Mike says you ain't shit!

2175

Now, why would you scream out
some crazy nonsense like that?

2176

you coming over here...

I bought your new pool.

2179

You know what? Why don't you
hook this pool up to your Ferrari...

2180

and drag this motherfucker out of here?

2181

- But then we won't be partners.
