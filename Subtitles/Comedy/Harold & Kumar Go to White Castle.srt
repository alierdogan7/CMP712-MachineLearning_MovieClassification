00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:35,684
<i>Harold and Kumar</i>

2
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:37,814
<i>Harold and Kume</i>

3
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,449
Billy Boy!
Get your ass ready.

4
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:44,394
It's almost 5:00, and this bad boy
needs to get his drink on.

5
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:46,557
- No, no, no. Give me that.
- Don't.

6
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,862
- I'm gonna burn it once and for all.
- Stop that.

7
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,563
Dude, it's been six months.
It's time to move on, okay?

8
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,798
Whatever. Even if
I wanted to meet other women,

9
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:55,170
I wouldn't even know what to do.

10
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,141
I've been out of the game
for so long.

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,202
Dude, you come out with me tonight,
I promise you will get laid.

12
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,338
Yeah, it sounds very tempting,

13
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:04,212
but Berenson needs me to update
these financial models

14
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:05,944
for the meeting
with the foreign investors.

15
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:07,485
So what?
It's Friday night.

16
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,282
The Germans are taking
an early flight back.

17
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:10,947
The meeting got changed
to tomorrow.

18
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:12,854
So? Why don't you
just get somebody else

19
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,483
to do your work for you?

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,788
Who?

21
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:19,889
Harold, I need you to update
those models for me.

22
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:22,594
- Billy, aren't you supposed to...
- I know. Something just came up.

23
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,761
I have this meeting
with these new clients tonight,

24
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:27,635
and I'm never gonna have time
to get to those.

25
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:30,267
So that's your
responsibility now, big boy.

26
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:33,107
Make sure those are in
by 9:00 sharp tomorrow.

27
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,477
With all the downsizing
that's been going on around here,

28
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:38,676
we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson
you've been slacking, now would we?

29
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:47,082
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,060
Okay, no problem.

31
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:50,493
Hey.

32
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,895
You have a great weekend,
okay, buddy?

33
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:55,593
I owe you one.
Just one.

34
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,091
Thank you.

35
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:09,005
Wow! That was amazing.
I cannot believe how easy that was.

36
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,242
Dude, how do you think
I get all my shit done?

37
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:13,478
I'm telling you, those Asian guys
love crunching numbers.

38
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:15,544
You probably
just made his weekend.

39
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:18,855
<i>Chick magnet</i>

40
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,587
<i>Chick magnet. Chick magnet</i>

41
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,993
<i>Chick magnet. Yeah</i>

42
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:25,360
Fuck.

43
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:27,961
An excellent point, Mr. Patel.

44
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,559
You are one of the finest applicants
I have ever interviewed.

45
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:31,830
Thank you.

46
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:35,931
It comes as no surprise. Your father
is highly respected in his field.

47
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,669
As you probably heard
from your old man,

48
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,871
he and I had some pretty wild times
back in med school.

49
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:42,107
Really?

50
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,207
Yeah. We started
our own basketball team...

51
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,218
the Hemoglobin Trotters.

52
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,313
Hemo-globin Trotters...
get it?

53
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,759
A play on the name of the famous
colored, Negro basketball squad...

54
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:58,058
black, African-American.

55
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,860
You know, people of colors.

56
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,528
Let's end up with one final question,
just as a formality.

57
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:08,540
What are some potential
symptoms of pancreatitis?

58
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,600
Well, you would have
epigastric tenderness,

59
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,508
diffuse abdominal tenderness...

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,544
I'm sorry.
Can you hold on one second?

61
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,076
Kumar's phone.
Kumar speaking.

62
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,915
Hey, what's up? It's me.
What are you doing?

63
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:24,081
Nothing important. I can talk.
What's going on?

64
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:28,422
Listen, I can't party tonight, okay?
I gotta stay late at the office.

65
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,428
Dude, fuck that shit.
We had plans.

66
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,521
I know, but I got
a lot of work to do.

67
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:35,999
When has getting high ever
prevented you from doing your work?

68
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,057
Jesus!

69
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,735
<i>Believe me.
I would love to come home. Okay?</i>

70
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,569
<i>- I got a lot of work to do.
- Thank you. I'll do that.</i>

71
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,735
I got a quarter of the
finest herb in New York City.

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,505
I'm not smoking
that shit alone, okay?

73
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,309
So you need to just chill the fuck out
and prepare to get blazed

74
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,974
because in the next couple of hours,

75
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,177
I expect both of us to be
blitzed out of our skulls, got it?

76
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,446
All right, I got it.

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,954
I'll talk to you later.
Where was I?

78
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:00,390
We've got the severe anal discharge,
sometimes violent... a.k.a. Diarrhea.

79
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,292
Mr. Patel, I am more than familiar
with diarrhea.

80
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:06,229
Do you actually believe
after the way you've just behaved

81
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,029
that I would ever even consider
recommending you for admission?

82
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,966
No. I'm gonna
be honest with you.

83
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,026
The only reason I'm applying

84
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:13,401
is so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment.

85
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:15,133
I really don't have a desire
to go to med school.

86
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,767
But you have perfect MCAT scores.

87
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,811
Yeah. Just 'cause you're
hung like a moose

88
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,574
doesn't mean you gotta do porn.

89
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:24,139
Get out! Bernadette,
show this young man to the door!

90
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:27,777
And please bring in
some fresh diarrhe... dry towels!

91
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:04,684
Yes!

92
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,987
Right in front of the door.

93
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,196
This is America, dude!
Learn how to drive!

94
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,629
Better "ruck" tomorrow!

95
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,701
- Extreme!
- Fucking assholes.

96
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:21,434
Fuck.

97
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:01,879
Okay.

98
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:06,474
Be yourself.
Don't be nervous.

99
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,833
So, Maria, what's been goin' on?

100
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:31,866
I actually had a very long week
at work. How about you?

101
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:34,276
Work was good.
I caught up on some sleep.

102
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,974
Plus, the guy who works next to me
decided to bathe for a change.

103
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,346
Really?

104
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,282
So what are you up to tonight?

105
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,616
Actually, I'm just gonna
be sitting on my ass,

106
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,349
probably eat a whole pint
of Haagen-Dazs

107
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:45,617
<i>while I watch Blind Date.</i>

108
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:48,319
Well, that sounds awful.

109
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,863
If you want some company,

110
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,764
maybe you can come over
and sit on your ass at my place.

111
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:57,435
That sounds nice.

112
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,514
Bye.

113
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,478
Bye. Bye.

114
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,331
Kumar.

115
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,702
Yo.

116
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,503
Yo, Kumar.

117
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,641
Yo, I'm in here, dude.

118
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,019
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

119
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,357
I'm trimming my pubes.

120
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,727
Why aren't you
doing this in your room, man?

121
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,289
The mirror's in here.
Hey, check it out. It's like a bonsai tree.

122
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,356
Hey!

123
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,733
Besides, man, it makes
your johnson look totally bigger.

124
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:40,533
Please!

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,103
Are those my scissors?
Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!

126
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:48,271
Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair
with them for the past six months.

127
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:54,211
Get out!
Get out of my room.

128
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,124
<i>Kumar. It's Daddy.</i>

129
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:07,256
<i>I hope your interview
today was good.</i>

130
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,767
<i>I'm calling to remind you
that you have another one tomorrow</i>

131
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:13,293
<i>with Dr. Wein from Cornell
at 10 a.m. Do not be late.</i>

132
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,567
- Hook it up, bi-yatch.
- Let's do it.

133
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:25,749
Fuck!

134
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:32,481
<i>In tonight's top story.
A cheetah escaped earlier today</i>

135
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,321
<i>from the Morristown Zoo.</i>

136
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:38,295
<i>Oh, nice.
Sixteen Candles is on, man.</i>

137
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:40,764
And the award for the least
heterosexual statement

138
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,234
ever made in this apartment
goes to... Harold Lee.

139
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:46,771
Come on down, man.
Take a bow.

140
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,807
Shut up, man.
It's a classic.

141
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:50,899
It's a very beautiful story
about someone

142
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:54,241
who feels unnoticed,
unappreciated, unloved, you know?

143
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:56,178
- Turn it.
- It's a good one, though.

144
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,272
Homo.

145
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,613
<i>Come on. Dude.
Just take one hit.</i>

146
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,685
<i>Don't you wanna be cool?</i>

147
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:10,288
<i>Hey. Man.
What are you doin'?</i>

148
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:12,421
<i>I'm so high!</i>

149
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,998
<i>Nothing can hurt me.</i>

150
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,199
<i>No!</i>

151
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,296
<i>- Marijuana kills.
- I love that shit.</i>

152
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,699
We're so high right now.

153
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,141
We're not low.

154
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,611
Dude, I don't know about you,
but I'm fuckin' hungry as balls.

155
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,239
No shit, dude.
Let's eat.

156
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,806
No, I don't feel
like delivery tonight.

157
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,013
- What about KFC?
- We've been there too many times.

158
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,784
I want something
we haven't had in a while.

159
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,759
Something different,
something that'll really hit the spot.

160
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,821
I want the perfect food.

161
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:48,662
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

162
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,295
<i>Then come to White Castle
and try our Slyder Special...</i>

163
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:57,938
<i>Six burgers. Fries.
And a soft drink for only $2.99.</i>

164
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>Imagine all those burgers
in your stomach right now.</i>

165
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:10,317
<i>Don't you like food
that's tasty and delicious?</i>

166
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:11,447
I do.

167
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,491
<i>Then what are you waiting for?</i>

168
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,653
<i>Head over to White Castle.
It's what you crave.</i>

169
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:20,390
You sure you know
how to get there?

170
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,491
I haven't been
to White Castle in ages.

171
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,128
Dude, I'm telling you, there's one right by
that multiplex in New Brunswick.

172
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:26,193
Nice.

173
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:27,761
- Rosenberg!
- Goldstein!

174
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:32,468
Yo, Manny and Shevitz, get up.
We're going to White Castle.

175
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:35,342
<i>No, we're watching
The Gift on HBO.</i>

176
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:37,177
No, no, no.
No watching. We're starving.

177
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,478
Hey, put that back.

178
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,815
No eating until we get
to White Castle. Let's roll.

179
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,616
Sorry, kids,
we ain't going nowhere.

180
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,919
Supposedly Katie Holmes
shows her titties in this movie.

181
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,186
Is that all you Jews
ever think about... tits?

182
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,661
Katie Holmes is a nice,
respectable, wholesome girl.

183
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,563
And I'm gonna see her boobs.

184
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,602
The things I would eat
out of her ass... you have no idea!

185
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,200
That is
a completely vulgar statement.

186
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,207
So is "I want to bang Britney Spears
on the bathroom floor."

187
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,038
But it's true.

188
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,099
Touche.

189
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,406
Hey, listen, if...

190
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,513
<i>I think Kumar's a faygele.</i>

191
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,711
They're totally gay for each other.

192
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:17,153
- Hey, you wanna suck on this?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,049
What the hell are you
bringing your bag for?

194
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,184
Try to get some work done
in the car.

195
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,661
- Here, you're driving.
- Shit, I forgot my cell phone.

196
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,857
You wanna run back and get it?

197
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,564
No, we've gone too far.

198
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,408
Hey, there's your girlfriend.

199
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:38,966
You gonna talk to her this time,

200
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,239
or are you gonna be
a Vagina McGinastein about it?

201
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,143
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,581
You could've asked her if she wanted
to come to White Castle with us.

203
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:47,983
- Hold the elevator. Wait!
- Hey, how are...

204
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,313
You're worthless.

205
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,616
I'm not worthwhile.

206
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:56,217
Just fucking talk to her once.
It won't be weird anymore.

207
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:57,694
Look, it doesn't matter.

208
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,561
The only girls who are interested in me
are girls I have no interest in.

209
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:01,826
Like Cindy Kim.

210
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,492
Speaking of Cindy,
she called earlier.

211
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,231
One of those Asian clubs she's in
is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

212
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:08,364
God, she invites me to everything.

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,603
So what? She's kind of fuckin' cute.
Let her touch your penis.

214
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,609
Oh, look.

215
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,738
It's the Brothers McFag.

216
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:18,442
Let me guess... the one
with the purse is the catcher.

217
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:22,413
Come on, guys, let's get ourselves
some fucking Mountain Dew.

218
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:23,476
Extreme!

219
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,648
Yeah, extreme assholes.

220
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,316
Why do I
have to be the catcher?

221
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,860
Dude, forget about those pricks.
Let's just get some food.

222
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:37,660
I am so hungry. I'm gonna eat,
like, 20 of those burgers, man.

223
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:42,366
Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers
and raise you 5 orders of fries.

224
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,838
Dude, give me 35 cents.

225
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,546
What's going on?
It didn't register.

226
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,850
- What?
- Give me 35 more cents.

227
00:13:56,922 --> 00:14:00,153
- I don't have any more change.
- Should I just go through?

228
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,716
No, no, I don't like
breaking the law.

229
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,318
Yeah, I can see that.

230
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,998
Hey, move your ass!

231
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,193
- I'm sorry. Hold on.
- I'm going through.

232
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:11,964
No, don't.
No. No. Hold on.

233
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:14,904
Let me walk to a manned tollbooth
and I'll tell them what happened.

234
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:17,908
- Sorry!
- Move, you fuckin' twat!

235
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:19,944
- What's the fuckin' holdup here?
- Shit.

236
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,910
Move, you retarded cocksucker!
Move!

237
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:27,947
- Are you crazy?
- What?

238
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,786
What are you doing?
Why you throwing the weed out?!

239
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:33,086
- The cops are gonna catch us.
- No, they're not. Not for that.

240
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,216
- Take this exit.
- What?

241
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,453
- Take this exit!
- No!

242
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,892
Dude!

243
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:38,725
You know,
that was the last of our weed.

244
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,288
Sorry. I get a little
paranoid sometimes.

245
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,095
Now we're in Newark,
of all places.

246
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,033
You know we're
gonna get shot.

247
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:48,698
Maybe it's not as bad as they say.
Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.

248
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:51,572
Check it out. Those guys
look like a lame version of us.

249
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,276
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

250
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,813
Let's get the fuck outta here.

251
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:10,118
- Go! Go! Drive! Drive!
- Yeah, that was your fault.

252
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,719
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

253
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,098
Yo, check it out.
We're almost there.

254
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,692
Thank God. I'm starving.

255
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,762
- Hello, New Brunswick!
- Prepare to gorge yourself.

256
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,172
You know...
We need some tunage for this.

257
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,800
Presets. Use the presets.

258
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:27,742
Oh, come on, dude,
your whole life is preset.

259
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,178
Try something new.

260
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,813
Where is this place? Isn't it
supposed to be right around here?

261
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:36,410
- Chill. We'll find it.
- Wait a second... is that the multiplex?

262
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,046
- Yes.
- Sweet!

263
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,717
That means the White Castle
should be right around the corner.

264
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:43,826
What the hell
is going on, Kumar?

265
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,658
That does not look
like a White Castle to me.

266
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:48,256
Uh-uh.
Dude, we gotta check this out.

267
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:56,405
Hey, look here, fellas. You guys gonna
have to order from the drive-thru menu.

268
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,500
What happened to the White Castle?

269
00:15:58,577 --> 00:15:59,566
What?

270
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:01,544
There used to be a White Castle
right here in this location.

271
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:02,602
Where is it?

272
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,615
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, guys,

273
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,083
but Burger Shack, they bought
this location about four years ago.

274
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,141
God!

275
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,983
Please tell me there's
another White Castle in town.

276
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,613
- No.
- Are you sure?

277
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,714
Do I look like the kind of brother

278
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,349
that would be unsure
about something like that?

279
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,792
Shit!
What are we gonna do?

280
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:19,422
I don't know, man.
Should we just eat here?

281
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:20,487
Hey. Psst.

282
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,658
There's a White Castle that's
open 24 hours up in Cherry Hill.

283
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,136
It's about
45 minutes from here.

284
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:28,968
I can make the trip
if you're willing to.

285
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,770
Kumar, I got a shitload
of work to finish.

286
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:32,332
You got that
med school interview.

287
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,709
Forget about the med school
interview. It's a non-issue.

288
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,270
What do you mean
it's a non-issue?

289
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:39,511
Ding-dong!
May I interject for a second?

290
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:42,678
As a Burger Shack employee
for the past three years,

291
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:45,746
if there's one thing I've learned,
it's that if you're craving White Castle,

292
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,485
the burgers here
just don't cut it.

293
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,194
In fact, just thinking about those
tender little White Castle burgers

294
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,234
with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions

295
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,531
that just explode
in your mouth like flavor crystals

296
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,093
every time you bite into one...

297
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,335
...just makes me want
to burn this motherfucker down.

298
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:09,573
Come on, Pookie,
let's burn this motherfucker down!

299
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,048
Come on, Pookie!
Let's burn it, Pookie!

300
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,085
Let's burn this
motherfucker down!

301
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,746
Let's burn it down!
Let's burn it!

302
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:23,521
So you guys maybe should just
suck it up and go to White Castle.

303
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:28,195
You can always get
your work done in the car.

304
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,530
- Let's do it.
- All right. Awesome.

305
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:33,765
Then listen, listen... no matter what,
we are not ending this night

306
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,306
without White Castle
in our stomachs.

307
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:36,567
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

308
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:38,270
Wise choice.

309
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,402
You guys might have
wanted to stay away

310
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,845
from our special sauce tonight.

311
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:45,542
Me and Pookie,
we added a secret ingredient.

312
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,810
I'll give you a hint.

313
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:52,949
It's semen.

314
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:57,720
Semen.

315
00:17:57,796 --> 00:17:59,127
Animal semen.

316
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:11,405
Dude, remember when Goldstein
used to work at that burger place?

317
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:16,980
This is the most fucking confusing
movie I've ever seen...

318
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,640
she's possessed,
she's not possessed.

319
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:20,480
Dude, that rack better be stacked.

320
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,816
- Tits! Tits!
- Boobies, boobies, boobies.

321
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:25,083
Holy shit! Whoa!

322
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,454
Those aren't real.
Yes, they are.

323
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,282
You know, I'm almost
completely sober right now.

324
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,386
I wish we had some more weed.

325
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,055
Sorry.

326
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:35,429
Princeton.

327
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,400
- We're getting off here.
- Why?

328
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:40,165
Because we're gonna sweet-talk
Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.

329
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:41,227
- No.
- Why not?

330
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,864
You talk to her on the phone
all the time.

331
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:44,499
She calls me.
Then she rambles on

332
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,374
about her East Asian
Students Club or whatever.

333
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,776
Then I have to actually pretend
that I give a shit

334
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,178
or else she calls me a Twinkie.

335
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,442
A what?

336
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:54,178
Twinkie... yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

337
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,015
Look, you Twinkie bitch,

338
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,248
you were the one that threw
our weed out the window, okay?

339
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,347
So we're going to Princeton,

340
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,982
and it's your responsibility
to make sure we're high as shit

341
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,822
by the time
we're eating those burgers.

342
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:05,692
Forget it.
End of discussion.

343
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,358
I am not seeing Cindy Kim.

344
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,196
Harold, I'm so glad
you showed up.

345
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:12,532
Yeah, me too.

346
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:15,767
Did you like the hibiscus petals
I glued to the envelope I sent you?

347
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,468
Yeah, they were nice.

348
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,172
Hey, dude, you know
where I can get some green?

349
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:27,678
Dude, you know where
I can get some chronic?

350
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:30,186
Jesus, what the hell kind of
lvy League school is this?

351
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:31,586
Man.

352
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:32,918
Over here, man.

353
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,390
You lookin' to toke up?

354
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,825
- Yes.
- Yes?

355
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:39,591
Thank Christ. Just give me
a dime of your finest sticky.

356
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:43,065
You wanna see
sticky-icky, my friend?

357
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,828
Oh, my God!

358
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:47,496
Whoa, man!

359
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:49,506
Don't touch, man.
That's not cool.

360
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:51,235
You can't...

361
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:53,368
Jeez! This is my baby!

362
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:01,074
Yes?

363
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:03,143
Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

364
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,210
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:06,814
Is it true you're an analyst
for Brewster Keegan?

366
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:09,692
Yes, I'm a junior analyst.

367
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:11,228
Awesome!

368
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,755
I told you, he's good.

369
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,667
- Yes.
- This is actually a two-part question.

370
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,072
I'm applying for a summer
internship at Brewster Keegan.

371
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,441
I was wondering, a) what's it like
being an investment banker,

372
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:30,140
and b) would you write me
a recommendation?

373
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,581
Here. That's sixt... 80 bucks.

374
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,052
- 80 bucks?
- Yeah, 80 bucks.

375
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:38,589
Yo, this is worth 40 tops, bro.

376
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:40,557
"Bro"?
I'm not your bro, bro.

377
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,092
Okay, and that's 80 bucks.

378
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,718
You don't feel like
getting high tonight?

379
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,593
If you don't feel like getting high,
that's cool with me,

380
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,724
because there's lots of people
around here. See this guy?

381
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,789
Hey, loser.

382
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,393
Hey, what's up, George?
I smoke buds with George all the time.

383
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,438
What kind of hippie are you?

384
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,134
What kind of hippie am I?
Man, I'm a business hippie.

385
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,472
I understand the concept
of supply and demand.

386
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:02,274
"What's it like
being an investment banker?"

387
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:06,010
To be honest with you,
it's actually pretty aw...

388
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,149
...awesome.

389
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:12,211
Excellent!

390
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,919
As for the recommendation,
I guess I can make a couple calls.

391
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:18,428
Actually, Harold, we should
be getting to the party.

392
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:19,963
We can discuss all this stuff
on the way there.

393
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:21,589
- It's just down the hall.
- Okay.

394
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,625
I'm sorry. I can't go.
I have to wait for Kumar.

395
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:27,194
You'll see him when we're done.

396
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:29,433
Trust me,
you're gonna love this.

397
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:32,203
Kenny's mom dropped off
a big pot of kimchi jigae.

398
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:34,768
It's really good.
It's delicious.

399
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:35,904
Yeah?

400
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,607
That's nice.

401
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:40,107
- 80 bucks, okay?
- Okay.

402
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,245
- Hello.
- Are you guys about to smoke?

403
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:46,256
Yes, we're gonna smoke. Do you
wanna come back to my place?

404
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:49,225
Please, like they want to go listen
to a bunch of Phish records

405
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,489
while you read
your lame-ass poetry.

406
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:53,121
Girls, you guys wanna hang out,

407
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:55,291
maybe smoke a little weed
and have some fun?

408
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,335
- All right.
- All right.

409
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:59,267
My poetry's not lame.
It's really good.

410
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:01,237
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- It's great.

411
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,933
We're gonna eat before this gets cold.

412
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:06,101
What you say we meet back
in our room in about 20 minutes?

413
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:07,610
We're in room 109.

414
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,115
109. Got it.
I'll see you ladies later, huh?

415
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:12,479
Yes!

416
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,714
109. We'll see
you ladies later. Yes!

417
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:18,586
We're getting laid, bro.

418
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,027
All right, I'll see you there, man.

419
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:28,493
20... 20... 208?

420
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,898
208. Yes! 208!

421
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,027
Roldy, dude,
you gotta come quick.

422
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:37,905
There's these two filthy pussies
just aching to get boned by us.

423
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:42,242
I mean, there are these two
very lovely young pussies

424
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:44,247
who would like to have
a chat with you and I.

425
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,806
Sorry. Harold's coming with us.

426
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:49,012
That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
Isn't that right, Roldy?

427
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,850
- Let's go to the party.
- No, no, no. Fuck that.

428
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:55,086
Here. This is Harold's understudy.
You can do whatever you want.

429
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,422
Roldy, let's go.

430
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:58,657
Sorry.

431
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,561
I can't believe you were gonna
ditch me for the Joy Luck Club.

432
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,065
You know what their parties are like.

433
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,431
What do you want me to say?
I was under pressure.

434
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,527
Just say no.
That's all it takes. Here.

435
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,866
All right, take a hit of that.

436
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,236
What's going on up there?

437
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:11,707
Barracuda to Sparrow,
Barracuda to Sparrow.

438
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:14,267
We got two high-fliers
on level three.

439
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,907
I just wanna talk!

440
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,121
Dude, in here, in here.

441
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,680
Women!

442
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:28,589
What if someone
finds us in here?

443
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,151
Chill the fuck out. He's not gonna
look for us in the girls' bathroom.

444
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,096
Shit! Come here.

445
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,497
It worked on me. There's no reason
it shouldn't work on you.

446
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,095
But your breasts look beautiful.

447
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:44,073
I just want those
cute little ping-pong breasts.

448
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:46,076
You know, that kind of go...

449
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,710
Hurry up because I want
to go smoke weed

450
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,578
with that dishy Indian guy.

451
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,514
It's gonna be a few minutes.

452
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:57,077
I'm about to have
the worst case of taco shits.

453
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:58,588
Oh, God.

454
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:07,021
Great, I think I've got
to go, too.

455
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,182
Hey, Clarissa, do you want
to play battle shits?

456
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:30,619
- Oh, my God!
- Battle shits?

457
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:33,680
We haven't played that
since back at camp.

458
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,726
I know, I know.
Wait for it.

459
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:42,796
Hit.

460
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:48,202
Scag! You sank my destroyer!

461
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,204
Fuck!

462
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:02,215
I can't take it anymore!

463
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:06,990
Christy, are you still there?

464
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,060
Damn! You sank my battle shit!

465
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:14,621
Shit.

466
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:19,126
Dude!

467
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,007
She said in 20-10?

468
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,304
Have you seen
a Korean guy around here?

469
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:28,243
Yeah, only when
I open my eyes, though.

470
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:30,508
'Tard.

471
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,276
20-11.

472
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,894
Yo, this party's bumpin'!

473
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:47,727
- Who wants some Buda?
- Yeah!

474
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,360
Holy shit! Kenneth Park,
class of 2004.

475
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:54,667
Dude, I'm thinking you really screwed up
by not coming to this party.

476
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:56,400
<i>I screwed up?</i>

477
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,374
Can we have some pot brownies?

478
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,536
I don't know.
I'm running a little low.

479
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:01,977
A titty flash might persuade me.

480
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:04,139
- Should we?
- I think you should.

481
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,375
Okay.

482
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:09,044
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

483
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,280
Hey, you!

484
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,147
Shit!

485
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:14,088
Hey!

486
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,257
- Hey!
- Let's get 'em! Halt!

487
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:19,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,825
- Harold! Harold!
- No, no, no.

489
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,300
- Hey, dude!
- Come here!

490
00:26:26,804 --> 00:26:28,294
Well, well, well.

491
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,170
- What do we have here?
- Oh, no! That's my baby!

492
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:32,573
Hold his throat and groin.
Come on, rookie.

493
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,236
Should we go back
for the weed?

494
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:35,711
Are you crazy?
Run! Run!

495
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:40,974
I can't believe it, man.
We were this close to getting laid.

496
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:42,485
Oh, dude,
you always exaggerate.

497
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:45,021
The diarrhea twins definitely
would have had sex with us.

498
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,489
What about Cindy? She was
looking kinda cute tonight, man.

499
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,788
Cindy's fine.
It's just...

500
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:50,850
- Just what?
- We...

501
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,555
Oh, you'd rather have Maria.

502
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,619
Look, it doesn't matter.

503
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:55,962
I'm gonna end up with Cindy Kim
whether I like it or not.

504
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:59,128
Can we just drop this and get
our asses to White Castle, man?

505
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,330
Fine.
Maria.

506
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:05,636
What are you doing?

507
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,769
Daddy needs to urinate.

508
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,805
Hurry up!

509
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:13,343
I'm serious.
Don't take all night.

510
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:14,851
All right.

511
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:58,695
- Excuse me, I have to...
- Huh?

512
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:02,756
I have to ask you.
Why are you peeing right here?

513
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,028
What?

514
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,764
I mean, why'd you pee
right next to me

515
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:09,102
when you could choose
that bush or...

516
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:11,141
This is a good bush to pee on.

517
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,668
Why are you peeing on it?

518
00:28:14,746 --> 00:28:16,873
Well, no one was here
when I chose this bush.

519
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,074
Oh.

520
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:21,016
So you get to pee on it
and no one else does? Huh?

521
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:23,417
- No, I just...
- This your bush?

522
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,956
You have a special bond
with this bush?

523
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:28,958
- No, I just thought that...
- You the king of the forest?

524
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:30,254
- I'm sorry?
- What?

525
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:34,025
Are you a fuckin' tree-hugger?
Is this your special bush?!

526
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:36,623
Never mind. Forget it. I really
don't feel like getting stabbed tonight.

527
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:43,401
Nice pubes.

528
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:48,134
Thanks.

529
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:13,460
Do you even know
where you're going?

530
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:15,631
I'm gonna be honest,
I'm a little lost, but, you know,

531
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:17,799
once we get back on the highway,
we'll be there soon, don't worry.

532
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,206
We'd better.

533
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:22,506
Shit. Now it's raining.

534
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,644
Put on your wipers.

535
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:26,273
What are you talking about?
It's just a little mist.

536
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,614
Yeah, mist,
hence the mist setting.

537
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:31,314
It's a safety issue, okay?
There we go.

538
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:34,654
Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
What crawled up your ass?

539
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:37,125
I'm completely on edge
right now, man.

540
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,787
After all the shit that
we've been through tonight,

541
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,854
I don't know
how much more I can take.

542
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,864
Oh, shit! How the fuck
did that get in here?

543
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:45,027
Oh, shit!

544
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:51,469
He bit me!
I've got rabies!

545
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:54,066
Oh, my God!

546
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:56,306
Dude, get that fuckin'
cancer raccoon away from me!

547
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,847
Open my window!

548
00:29:57,915 --> 00:30:00,509
Fuck you, raccoon!

549
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:04,546
What the Christ?

550
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,315
- Shit!
- Shit!

551
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,694
Jesus! You all right?

552
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:15,925
I don't know.

553
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,100
Shit.

554
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,194
Shit, dude,
he's coming over here.

555
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,068
Probably some old blind bitch!

556
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,042
- What the fuck are you doing?
- We're sorry. We're very sorry!

557
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:29,841
- Holy shit!
- Goldstein?

558
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,882
Dude, it's Rold and Kumar.

559
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:34,509
Shit. What's going on, man?

560
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:37,179
- What's up, dude? What's up?
- All right.

561
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:38,654
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

562
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:41,749
We got the munchies, so we
decided we'd go to Hot Dog Heaven.

563
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:43,726
How about you?
How was White Castle?

564
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:46,422
We haven't gotten there yet.
I think I may have rabies.

565
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:48,431
Yo, dude, how were
Katie Holmes' tits?

566
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:50,490
- You know the Holocaust?
- Yeah.

567
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:52,502
Picture the exact
opposite of that.

568
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,231
Nice.

569
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:56,469
Boy, do you need a girl.

570
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,201
If you guys
got the yellow fever,

571
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,141
there's a rockin' Asian party
down at Princeton.

572
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:01,576
Dude, I got the yellow plague.

573
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:04,513
There's nothing sexier
than a hot Asian chick!

574
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:06,243
Asian tits...
I wanna squeeze 'em!

575
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,751
Stop. Don't do that.
Please, do not touch me.

576
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:09,945
I'm very woozy.

577
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,012
I think I have to go
to the hospital.

578
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:14,080
You should go
to Beth Israel.

579
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:16,490
- We gotta hit up this Asian joint.
- No, we don't.

580
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,893
We got to go to Hot Dog Heaven.
No more detours along the way.

581
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,761
- This is what I'm dealing with.
- Come on!

582
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:23,129
I'm telling you,
hit up the Asian party.

583
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,031
Did you leave the key in the car
with the engine running?

584
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:26,194
Good luck.

585
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,467
You don't have rabies. We're not
going to a hospital. You're fine.

586
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:43,120
Uh... Yeah, I don't have rabies.

587
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:45,815
Great. Let's just
get out of here.

588
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:50,318
Hey, aren't those the guys
that got the shit kicked...

589
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:53,158
I know. I know.
Let's just go.

590
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:56,423
Just go.

591
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:58,363
Kumar.

592
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:02,432
- Hey, it's your dad and brother.
- Shit.

593
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,303
No wonder you didn't want
to go to the hospital.

594
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:07,901
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Dr. Patel.

595
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,947
- What's up?
- Saikat. What's going on?

596
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:13,279
I hope you are here to apologize for
what you did in your interview today.

597
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,943
What the hell's
wrong with you, Kumar?

598
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,351
God! You're 22 years old.
When are you gonna grow up

599
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:20,413
and stop this
post-college rebel bullshit?

600
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:23,324
- Like your life is so hard.
- Eat my balls, Saikat.

601
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:26,158
I will not tolerate this
business from you any longer.

602
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,960
You have one more
interview tomorrow morning,

603
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:33,697
and if I hear from Dr. Wein that you
were anything short of spectacular,

604
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:35,568
I'll completely cut you off.

605
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,698
- Dad, come on.
- Daddy is not coming on anything.

606
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,505
You will be there,
and you will behave.

607
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,981
I have put too much time
and energy into you

608
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,814
to let you go
and fuck it all up!

609
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:59,090
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry, guys.

610
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:00,494
Wow, I'm sorry.

611
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,665
Sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?

612
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,760
Good.

613
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:09,533
I will speak with you tomorrow.

614
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,973
- Bye, Harold.
- Bye.

615
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,305
See ya.

616
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:14,674
Wow, man.

617
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,906
I guess you're going
to med school after all, eh?

618
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:20,041
Fuck that, dude.
Like I care what my dad thinks.

619
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,379
I can't wait to see
the look on his face

620
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:22,885
when he finds out I didn't go
to my interview tomorrow.

621
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:25,353
If he wants to cut me off, fine.
I don't need his money.

622
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:28,187
I don't understand.
You just hugged him.

623
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,660
Yeah, I just needed to get
my hands on this.

624
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:32,889
Access card.

625
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:36,023
Two words for you, bro...
medical marijuana.

626
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,125
No.

627
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,634
Oh, this is stolen.

628
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:45,065
If we get caught,
you are taking the blame.

629
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:46,541
This is not my idea.

630
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,805
We're not gonna get caught, okay?
We're gonna go get baked

631
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:51,439
and then go eat just like we planned.
Now, just calm down.

632
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,779
- We gotta find the pharmacy.
- Dr. Patel!

633
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:55,716
Thank God I found you.
We have an emergency.

634
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,380
Nurses, I need these two doctors
scrubbed, gloved,

635
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:00,515
and ready for the O.R. Stat!

636
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:03,159
- What the hell is going on?
- He probably thinks I'm my brother.

637
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,559
Just don't worry about it.
Leave the talking to me.

638
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,927
It's a godforsaken bloodbath.

639
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:10,626
The patient was brought in
by EMS five minutes ago.

640
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,999
As you can see, we have
three horrific gunshot wounds.

641
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,059
It's a good thing
I found you two.

642
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:15,799
All the other surgeons
are working on other patients.

643
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,465
No, there's been a mistake.

644
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,533
What Dr. Lee is trying to say
is that we need to sedate the patient...

645
00:34:20,611 --> 00:34:23,136
...or he could go into cardiac arrest.
- All right, I'll get the anesthesiologist.

646
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:25,546
Hang on a second, nurse. What we
should probably use is marijuana.

647
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,743
That'll sufficiently
sedate the patient for surgery.

648
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,418
Marijuana?

649
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,282
But why?

650
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:38,851
We don't have time for questions.

651
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,659
We need marijuana now,
as much of it as possible!

652
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:43,165
Like a big bag of it.

653
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:47,000
But, Doctor, we don't have
marijuana in this hospital.

654
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:48,834
Shit.

655
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,932
Oh, shit!
This guy's gonna die!

656
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,477
Doctor, you've got to do something
or we're gonna lose him!

657
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:56,012
I'm gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

658
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,310
Start the nitrous.
Give me two large-bore I.V. S

659
00:34:58,382 --> 00:35:00,247
and start a Ringers lactate push.

660
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:01,341
Dr. Roldy, hold this.

661
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,652
More gauze, please.

662
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:12,093
- Doctor, the patient is desatting.
- Dude, he's desatting! He's desatting!

663
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:14,961
The patient has a collapsed lung.
I need a 14-gauge angiocath stat.

664
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,272
- That was genius.
- Thank you.

665
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,138
- Great job!
- You guys did it.

666
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,268
No, it's you.

667
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:31,077
- Sexy.
- What'd you say?

668
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:32,308
Nothing.

669
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:33,475
Sweet-pea.

670
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:37,545
The patient appears
to be stabilized.

671
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:40,317
- Good work, doctors, all around.
- Great. One of you clean this up, please.

672
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:42,655
- Put the chest tube in.
- Meow. You're moist.

673
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:45,024
- I'm not sweating anymore.
- You're glistening.

674
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:47,893
Soft and chocolate lips...

675
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:51,731
- Could I get a little dab here?
- Hush now, hush now.

676
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,236
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to know

677
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,364
how to get to the White Castle
in Cherry Hill from here?

678
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,241
Yeah. Take the 33 west
and take the Turnpike south,

679
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:02,609
and there you are.

680
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:04,847
I'm telling you, man,
that was amazing!

681
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,610
Even your dad would
have been impressed, man.

682
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,311
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

683
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:12,754
This is perfect. We're back on the road,
we got directions, it stopped raining.

684
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:14,017
And guess what, man.

685
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,822
- I'm officially done with my work.
- Oh, yeah? Nice!

686
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:20,557
I'm telling you, dude,
things are finally starting to go our way.

687
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,196
<i>Hey, dude, check it out...
Sixteen Candles.</i>

688
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,826
Isn't that your favorite movie?

689
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,029
Wow, man, that's awesome!

690
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,430
Yo, look who decided
to go see it.

691
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:32,702
Holy shit.

692
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,210
See! You said you two
had nothing in common,

693
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,372
but you both have the same
lame taste in movies!

694
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:38,847
Shut up.

695
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,713
Hey, we should ask her if she
wants to come to White Castle.

696
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,412
No. No, no.
Forget about it. Just drive.

697
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:45,250
Dude, come on.
It's 1:00 in the morning.

698
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:46,983
We're an hour away from home,

699
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:50,117
and who do we see but your dream girl
standing across the street?

700
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:53,061
Just pretend you're a nerdy
Asian version of Tom Hanks

701
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,826
and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan
with bigger tits.

702
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,801
The cars are going.
Can we go? How about that?

703
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:01,099
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, Maria!

704
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,969
- What are you doing?
- Maria! Excuse me for a second!

705
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,565
Come here!

706
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,637
No! What the hell
are you doing?

707
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:09,702
Get your hand off the gas!
Shit!

708
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,714
- I'm stuck!
- Stop turning the wheel!

709
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,875
- I am stuck!
- What do you mean you're stuck?

710
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,009
Get unstuck!

711
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:28,822
- You asshole!
- Wha... wha...?

712
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:31,493
We could have seriously
injured ourselves, man!

713
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,035
Yo, don't blame me, genius.

714
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,594
I'm not the one who decided
to run us off the frickin' road, all right?

715
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,436
Let's just get
back on the highway, okay?

716
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:38,839
Fine with me.

717
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:47,941
It's not funny.

718
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,429
- Where's my spare tire?
- I don't know.

719
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:03,700
Where the hell
is my spare tire?

720
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,462
Oh, yeah!

721
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,063
Dude, remember that time
we got really stoned

722
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:12,836
and started throwing shit off
that bridge to see if it would float?

723
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:16,610
What bridge? I don't remem...
What are you talking about?

724
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,978
Oh, shit, that's right.
That was with Goldstein.

725
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:22,809
We borrowed your car
that night. My bad.

726
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,219
Your bad? What the hell
are we gonna do now?

727
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,861
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me!

728
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:34,363
- Hello! Over here!
- Excuse me!

729
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:46,871
You boys need some help?

730
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:56,184
Thanks for helping us out.

731
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:00,889
No problem at all.

732
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:05,054
I seen you two stranded
out there alone in the dark,

733
00:39:05,129 --> 00:39:08,360
and I said to myself...

734
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,093
"What would Jesus do?"

735
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,828
Goin' down to Georgia

736
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:15,394
Gonna get myself baptized,
gonna get myself baptized

737
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:18,270
In the bosom of the Lord

738
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,571
Have you boys accepted Jesus
as your Lord and Savior?

739
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,776
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's great. Cool guy.

740
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:30,445
Praise the Lord
and pass the ammunition!

741
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:34,252
Name's Randy,
but everybody calls me Freakshow.

742
00:39:34,324 --> 00:39:35,916
My name's Kumar.

743
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,927
How are you, Kunie?

744
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,655
- This is Harold.
- Hi, Jerald. How are you?

745
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,099
So where exactly
are we going?

746
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:48,263
Don't you worry about that none.
We ain't too far from my place.

747
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:52,035
Once we get there, I'll have
your ride fixed up in a jiffy.

748
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,781
Check out those boils
on his neck.

749
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,911
You gotta look.
One of them's actually pulsating.

750
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:08,782
Shut up. He's right next to me.
He can hear you.

751
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,588
Now there's some sort of puss.

752
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:11,958
- It's disgusting!
- Shut up.

753
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,793
Just one little boil.
Just look at it.

754
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,802
See, isn't that the most disgusting
thing you've ever seen?

755
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:28,037
Do you think just
because you're whispering,

756
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:31,103
he can't hear
what you're saying?

757
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,082
He's two feet away from us.
He can hear this entire conversation.

758
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,346
He can hear me
talking right now.

759
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,081
Don't worry about it.
He can't hear anything...

760
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:40,180
not with all that crust in his ear.

761
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:51,025
I heard everything you said.

762
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,236
It's gonna take me a while
to fix up your car there,

763
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:06,510
so if you boys like,
you can go on inside,

764
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,881
get yourselves something
to drink, wash up,

765
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:11,477
fuck my wife, watch TV...
anything you want.

766
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:15,082
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

767
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:18,594
Just don't do anything
the Good Lord wouldn't do.

768
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:20,685
Thank you.

769
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,461
We're gonna die.
He's going to kill us.

770
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:25,900
We're gonna die.

771
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,132
Dude, am I deaf, or did he just say
we get to fuck his wife?

772
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:30,969
He couldn't have said that.

773
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:35,211
Who cares?
You've seen Freakshow.

774
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,179
What do you think his wife
is gonna look like?

775
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,524
Oh, hi, boys.

776
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,121
I'm Freakshow's wife Liane.

777
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:57,823
Can I get you some pink lemonade?

778
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,995
Why don't you just go
have a seat in the living room?

779
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,595
I'll be back in a jiffy.

780
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:04,038
Thanks.

781
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:10,547
- Hot. Hot!
- Uh-huh.

782
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,684
Jesus Christ.

783
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:29,356
Okay, it's official.
We've entered the Twilight Zone.

784
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:32,459
- Dude, Liane is fucking hot.
- She's not ugly.

785
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,871
Here you go, boys.

786
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:37,133
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

787
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:40,233
Liane, how are things between you
and Freakshow presently?

788
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,609
Oh! They've never been better.
We love each other so much.

789
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,583
I was just wondering,
how does a guy like Freakshow...

790
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,921
...end up with a girl like you?

791
00:42:55,993 --> 00:43:00,089
Well, we met at choir practice
about four years ago.

792
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,131
Freakshow was really shy
back then, you know,

793
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,258
'cause of all his hideous boils
on his face and neck.

794
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,596
Sure, sure.

795
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,229
But he had
the most amazing voice,

796
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:10,102
like a baby canary.

797
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,267
The devil is everywhere

798
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,210
Hey, Randy, what,
the devil, huh

799
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,076
The devil is everywhere

800
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:20,013
Hey, Randy, what

801
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:23,280
After Easter service one day,
I told him how much I loved his solo

802
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:25,287
and he finally mustered up
the courage to ask me out.

803
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,448
We've been in love ever since.

804
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:30,322
So, are you boys gonna
fuck me now or what?

805
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:34,958
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who goes first. Ready?

806
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,863
- Rock, paper...
- Wait a second.

807
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:38,662
What about Freakshow?

808
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:42,330
What? You assume we don't
know how to have a good time?

809
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:43,998
I just...

810
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,847
Never mind.
Rock, paper, scissors.

811
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:58,945
Sorry, but if you boys want me,
you have to do me at the same time.

812
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:02,014
- Huh?
- Come on, give me the double stuff.

813
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:03,992
I'm not sure
we quite understand, Liane.

814
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,462
I want you both
inside me simultaneously.

815
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,522
- One hole or two?
- Whatever you want.

816
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,159
Sorry. No, thank you.
No, thank you.

817
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:14,203
Dude, if it's two holes,
it might not be that bad.

818
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:16,000
- Shotgun anus.
- Forget it!

819
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,973
I don't want our balls
rubbing against each other.

820
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,906
- What, are you kidding?
- No way! Forget it.

821
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:21,705
How about blow jobs?
Can we have blow jobs?

822
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,677
Well, okay.

823
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:32,747
Come here.

824
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:35,519
Okay. I'm going up there.

825
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,889
I wanna come, too.

826
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,521
- Think you could help me with this?
- You need help?

827
00:44:41,832 --> 00:44:44,733
Okay, yeah.
It's a little sticky there.

828
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:46,894
- You can do it.
- Okay.

829
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,767
I can do it.
I can do it.

830
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,853
Do you wanna play with them?

831
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:05,910
Play with them.

832
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:10,051
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

833
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,992
Let's do that.

834
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,056
Well, boys, I fixed your tire.

835
00:45:20,203 --> 00:45:21,568
Hi, honey.

836
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:25,074
What in the hell
are you doing with my wife?

837
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,136
You said outside that
we could have sex with her.

838
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:30,474
Shit! Shit!

839
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:33,448
- I most certainly did not.
- Yeah, you did.

840
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:34,916
- I did not!
- You did.

841
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:37,010
- Oh, no, I didn't!
- You did, you did.

842
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:41,156
- You sure?
- You said it.

843
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,651
My mistake!

844
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,254
Freakshow.

845
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,425
Well, since we're all here...

846
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:54,260
...how about a foursome?

847
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:56,271
Who wants the first reach-around?

848
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:07,283
Okay, let's agree to never talk
about what just happened.

849
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,442
Agreed.

850
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:11,453
That's a very good idea.

851
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,284
Dude, I have no idea
where we are.

852
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:14,653
What?

853
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:17,659
- Is that a hitchhiker?
- What the hell?

854
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:20,127
- Should we pick him up?
- And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?

855
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,529
You know what? We're lost. He may
know how to get back on the highway.

856
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,090
Get back on the road.
This is my car.

857
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:26,829
We are not picking up
a hitchhiker, man.

858
00:46:26,903 --> 00:46:29,633
Hey, guys, thanks
for picking me up.

859
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:36,205
Excuse me,
are you Neil Patrick Harris?

860
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:37,268
Yep.

861
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,372
- Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
- Holy shit.

862
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:41,383
<i>Dude, Doogie Howser M. D. Was,
like, my favorite show growing up.</i>

863
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:42,440
You were my idol.

864
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,749
That's great. Could we get going?
I'm bored as shit back here.

865
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:48,050
- Go, go.
- Let's go. This is a frickin' boring spot.

866
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:58,194
So I gotta ask you, Neil,

867
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,463
did you ever get it on
with Wanda off the set?

868
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:03,131
Dude, I humped every piece
of ass ever on that show.

869
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:04,901
Even the chick
who played the hot nurse?

870
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:09,878
No. I didn't go
all the way with her.

871
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,410
Neil, you wouldn't happen to know

872
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:15,815
how to get on the highway
from here, would you?

873
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:18,013
Dude, I don't even know
where the fuck I am right now.

874
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,350
I was at this party earlier tonight

875
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:22,152
and some guy hooked me up
with this incredible X.

876
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:24,819
The next thing I know, I'm being
thrown out of a moving car.

877
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:28,262
- I've been tripping balls ever since.
- That's crazy, dude.

878
00:47:28,331 --> 00:47:29,764
We've been having
a pretty crazy night, too.

879
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:31,596
We've just been driving around
looking for White Castle,

880
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:33,033
but we keep getting sidetracked.

881
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:34,161
Yeah, dude, you fascinate me.

882
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:36,205
Forget White Castle.
Let's go get some pussy.

883
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,571
- Huh?
- It's a fuckin' sausage-fest in here.

884
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:41,042
Let's get us some poontang.
Then we'll go to White Castle.

885
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,169
No, Neil, you don't understand.

886
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:44,179
We've been craving
these burgers all night.

887
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:46,579
Yeah, I've been craving
burgers, too... fur burgers.

888
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,710
Come on, dudes, let's pick up
some trim at a strip club.

889
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:52,220
The Doogie line
always works on strippers.

890
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:55,053
Lap dance.

891
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:58,726
There's a gas station.
I'm gonna see if we can get directions.

892
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,763
We don't need...

893
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:06,395
Hurry up, dudes, hurry up.
I'm losing wood.

894
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:13,039
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

895
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:15,077
- Chill.
- We'll be right back, Neil.

896
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:16,442
We'll be back.

897
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:25,680
What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
Why is he so horny?

898
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,883
I don't know, but we can't
let him interfere with our quest.

899
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:33,624
- Oh, God.
- Shit, these punks again.

900
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:35,324
Late-night Math League
meeting, homos?

901
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:37,093
Extreme!

902
00:48:40,303 --> 00:48:41,565
Let's go.

903
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,373
No, no.
Pies, pies... no.

904
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:01,988
Dude, what is that?
Is that a pterodactyl?

905
00:49:02,058 --> 00:49:03,457
I do not know what that is.

906
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:05,460
That was extreme, dude!

907
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:08,691
Excuse me, can you tell us how
to get to the highway from here?

908
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:09,891
Dude, I got this.

909
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:24,202
Dude, who knew learning Hindi
would actually pay off?

910
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,339
Guy says the highway is, like,
a couple traffic lights from here.

911
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,350
We should be in Cherry Hill
in ten minutes.

912
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:30,545
- Ready? One, two, three!
- No. No.

913
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,713
- No.
- Extreme kayaking!

914
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:34,256
No!

915
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,157
Extreme!

916
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:45,665
- No!
- Man, that was so fuckin' extreme!

917
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,030
On a scale of 1 to 10,

918
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:51,073
one being not so extreme
and ten being extremely extreme,

919
00:49:51,141 --> 00:49:53,109
I give this a 9.5!

920
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:56,838
- Check it out!
- Extreme cheddar!

921
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:05,176
- Hey.
- Extreme cashier!

922
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:07,681
Somebody should do something.

923
00:50:09,392 --> 00:50:10,791
Yeah, you're right.

924
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,488
Hey, asshole!
Why don't you leave that guy alone

925
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,827
and go jerk off to some
snowboarding videos or something?

926
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:21,067
<i>I didn't mean you
should do something about it.</i>

927
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:34,713
What? You're gonna take that?

928
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:37,651
What's up with that? Huh?

929
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,449
You're gonna take that?

930
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,914
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

931
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,424
- Shit!
- That's right, bitch!

932
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,927
You just try fuckin' with me
one more time!

933
00:50:45,995 --> 00:50:48,555
Just try it!
Thank you, come again.

934
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:52,592
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

935
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,128
Kumar, you okay?

936
00:50:56,206 --> 00:50:58,231
Yeah, dude,
I just hate those assholes.

937
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,242
You know what? Fuck it, I'm hungry.
Let's just get outta here.

938
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:17,693
Did Doogie Howser
just steal my fucking car?

939
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:24,098
Yes. I think he did.

940
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:42,713
You! You had to pick up
a hitchhiker! Why?!

941
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:43,774
Calm down.

942
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:45,286
Why did you leave
the keys in the car?

943
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,913
Why? Because
it would get stolen.

944
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,891
I figured that Neil Patrick Harris
was a trustworthy guy.

945
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,722
Come on. How was I supposed
to know he'd fuck us over?

946
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:54,627
This whole freaking night,
this whole night, is your fault!

947
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:59,299
- Where are you going?
- I'm going inside to call the police.

948
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,428
I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

949
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,335
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

950
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:08,206
There's a pay phone
across the street

951
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:10,371
if you don't wanna
deal with those assholes.

952
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,791
After we talk to the cops, we're
still going to White Castle, right?

953
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:30,264
I'm not speaking to you.

954
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:33,393
When are they fucking going
to develop button technology

955
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:34,959
that will understand urgency?!

956
00:52:35,038 --> 00:52:38,371
- Dude, this is ridiculous. Just walk across.
- It'll change in a second.

957
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,102
There's not a car in sight.
Just go ahead.

958
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:43,373
Fine. You want me to cross?
I will cross.

959
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:45,846
If it makes you happy,
I will cross.

960
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:47,975
I'll do it.

961
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,485
Shit!

962
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:57,183
- What...
- Sorry.

963
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:02,954
Is there a problem,
Officer Palumbo?

964
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,225
Is there a problem?
You ever heard of jaywalking?

965
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:07,062
Yes, I have. I'm really sorry.
Won't happen again.

966
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:09,159
That's great.
I'm writing you up a ticket.

967
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:10,636
A ticket?
Are you serious?

968
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:12,673
Who the fuck are you, shitwad?

969
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,334
Let me apologize
for my friend here. I'm very sorry.

970
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,309
I'm really glad you're here.
We've had a rough night.

971
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:19,141
<i>You know the show
Doogie Howser M. D.?</i>

972
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:22,512
Great show.
God, I love that show. "Doogie."

973
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:25,051
Neil Patrick Harris
stole my car tonight.

974
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,280
Hey, NPH wouldn't do that,
all right?

975
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:28,686
Give me some I.D.

976
00:53:28,756 --> 00:53:31,088
Excuse me, how can you
give him a ticket for jaywalking?

977
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:34,650
It's 2:30 in the morning.
There's not a car around here.

978
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:35,855
Kumar, shut up.

979
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,192
That's not the kind of tone
you want to use

980
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:38,755
on a cop who can bust your ass.

981
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:41,427
- Bust my ass?
- Yeah, Koo-mar.

982
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:44,027
Bust your ass.

983
00:53:44,105 --> 00:53:46,767
What kind of name
is that anyhow? Koo-mar.

984
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:49,435
What is that,
like, five O's or two U's?

985
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,137
No, it's actually one U.

986
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:52,702
Yeah, bullshit.

987
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,216
Whatever happened to good old
American names like Dave or Jim?

988
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:57,911
- Harold.
- Harold.

989
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,646
- Are you kidd...
- Now that's a great name.

990
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,278
- Let me take care of this.
- You should be proud of that name, son.

991
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,050
As you were, ladies.

992
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,253
- $220?! Are you crazy?!
- Kumar, if you don't stop...

993
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:09,660
No, I understand exactly
what's going on here.

994
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,528
Excuse me, officer, let me
take a couple of guesses.

995
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,568
- I'm really sorry...
- Get your hands down!

996
00:54:14,635 --> 00:54:16,865
- Okay, alright.
- No sudden moves. Back it up!

997
00:54:16,938 --> 00:54:19,236
You were probably the big asshole
in your high school, right?

998
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:20,467
Absolutely right.

999
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:22,099
Used to pick on guys like us
every day, right?

1000
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,234
With pleasure.

1001
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:25,541
Then graduation day came,
and we went to college,

1002
00:54:25,613 --> 00:54:27,274
and you went nowhere,
and you thought,

1003
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,077
"Hey, how can I
still give them shit?

1004
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,777
I know, I'll become a cop."

1005
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,752
Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations.
Your dream has come true.

1006
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:35,948
Now, why don't you just take
this quiet little Asian guy

1007
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,150
with the Anglicized name
that treats you so well

1008
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:39,624
and give him a couple
of other tickets?

1009
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,457
- Better yet, just take him to jail.
- Better idea.

1010
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,497
Why don't you just arrest him?
Does that work out for you okay, Harold?

1011
00:54:43,564 --> 00:54:44,792
- "Great American name, Harold."
- Let's go, Harold.

1012
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,799
Thanks to your buddy,
we're going downtow...

1013
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:53,570
Oh, shit.

1014
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:59,272
Well, thank you so much for
being understanding about Bradley.

1015
00:54:59,347 --> 00:55:01,941
I promise you
he won't ever do it again.

1016
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:03,677
I'm sure he won't.

1017
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:06,147
Right, Brad?

1018
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,120
Yes, sir,
Officer Palumbo, sir.

1019
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:12,250
- Mommy, can we go home?
- Get in the car, Bradley Thomas.

1020
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:13,350
Bye, Brad.

1021
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:15,452
Are you gonna do
something about my car?

1022
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,495
<i>First our top story.</i>

1023
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,591
<i>The search for the escaped cheetah
continues tonight.</i>

1024
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:23,660
<i>It was last spotted
in Randolph County. South of...</i>

1025
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:28,036
- So what are you in here for?
- For being black.

1026
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:29,732
Seriously.

1027
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:32,903
I am serious.
You wanna know what happened?

1028
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,739
I was walking
out of a Barnes & Noble,

1029
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:38,216
and a cop stops me.

1030
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:41,652
Evidently a black guy
robbed a store in Newark.

1031
00:55:41,722 --> 00:55:45,317
I told him, "I haven't even been
to Newark in months."

1032
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:47,088
So, he starts beating me
with his gun...

1033
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:49,459
...telling me to stop resisting arrest.
- Holy shit! What'd you do?

1034
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,794
I kept saying,
"I understand I'm under arrest.

1035
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:53,959
Now please stop beating me."

1036
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:56,401
I don't understand how
you can be so calm about all this.

1037
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:00,497
Look at me.
I'm fat, black, can't dance,

1038
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:02,201
and I have two gay fathers.

1039
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,943
People have been
messing with me my whole life.

1040
00:56:06,013 --> 00:56:09,779
I learned a long time ago that
there's no sense getting all riled up

1041
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,250
every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.

1042
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:17,185
In the end, the universe tends
to unfold as it should.

1043
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:21,059
Plus I have a really large penis.
That keeps me happy.

1044
00:56:22,263 --> 00:56:23,355
Hey, hey, listen up, guys!

1045
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:24,898
Multiple gunshots
fired in Millbrook Park.

1046
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,160
Finally, some action.
I'm goin'!

1047
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:29,293
- No, I'm goin'!
- Lock and load!

1048
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:38,434
That was strange.

1049
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,943
What the hell was that?

1050
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:46,213
Rold. Is that you?

1051
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:48,414
- Kumar?
- Are the cops still here?

1052
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,820
What the hell are you doing?

1053
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,415
I just called and made up some story
about a shooting in Millbrook Park.

1054
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,586
- Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
- I'm fucking starving.

1055
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:57,358
I figured I'd bust you out
and we'd go get some burgers.

1056
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,797
Forget it. I'm not getting
into any more trouble.

1057
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:01,528
I'm already in here because of you.

1058
00:57:01,602 --> 00:57:02,591
Hey, fuck you!

1059
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,968
What did you want me to do,
stand there and take the hit?

1060
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:06,563
You know I've never
taken a swing at you, ever.

1061
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,902
Well, I never got your car stolen.

1062
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:09,272
- Fine. I'm leaving.
- Fine.

1063
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:16,915
- Harold, how do I get out of here?
- How the hell should I know?

1064
00:57:16,984 --> 00:57:19,077
Shit! Oh, God, this isn't good.

1065
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,721
My ass!

1066
00:57:31,265 --> 00:57:33,631
Sure you don't want
to get out of here?

1067
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,635
And become a fugitive?
Are you nuts?

1068
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:38,035
- The guy has all my information.
- So what?

1069
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:40,005
We'll just take what he
wrote down about you and leave.

1070
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:41,507
Unless you want to
stay here all night

1071
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:43,566
and not be able to
turn in your work tomorrow.

1072
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,242
Fine, hurry up.

1073
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:52,217
Yes! All right,
we gotta find keys.

1074
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:54,584
Oh, yes!

1075
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:56,816
Sweet! I was hoping it would
be one of these big ring of keys.

1076
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,325
- Kumar, hurry the fuck up.
- All right, yeah.

1077
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,130
- Yes!
- Dude!

1078
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,998
- Hey, what's that smell?
- What smell?

1079
00:58:12,973 --> 00:58:14,304
Kumar.

1080
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:32,183
<i>If we still have time.
We might still get by</i>

1081
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,956
<i>Every time I think about it
I wanna cry</i>

1082
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,727
<i>With bombs and the devil.
And the kids keep comin'</i>

1083
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,533
<i>No way to breathe easy.
No time to be young</i>

1084
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,672
<i>But I tell myself
that I'm doin' all right</i>

1085
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:53,804
<i>There's nothin' left
to do at night</i>

1086
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:56,816
<i>But go crazy on you</i>

1087
00:58:58,152 --> 00:59:01,087
<i>Crazy on you</i>

1088
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:05,353
<i>Let me go crazy.
Crazy on you</i>

1089
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:09,853
<i>Crazy on you</i>

1090
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,866
Bitch! Learn how to fuckin'
make coffee, you fuckin' whore!

1091
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:16,198
<i>Let me go crazy.
Crazy on you</i>

1092
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,828
I love you.

1093
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:20,067
No, no, no.

1094
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,809
No, baby, come on.

1095
00:59:24,044 --> 00:59:27,036
Hey, Kumar. Kumar!
Where are you...

1096
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:29,241
Kumar!
Still in jail, asshole!

1097
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,613
Come here!

1098
00:59:34,388 --> 00:59:35,412
Kumar! The cops...

1099
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,423
You thought you'd
get away with it, huh?

1100
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,221
I was in bed.
I didn't fire any gun. I swear.

1101
00:59:41,462 --> 00:59:43,760
Hey, Jackson's trying to escape!

1102
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,890
What are you talking about?
I'm just sitting here.

1103
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:47,092
He's trying to break free!
Get him!

1104
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,601
- Aw, shit.
- Don't move!

1105
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,769
Stop resisting!
We need backup now!

1106
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,706
- He's got a gun.
- That's not a gun, that's a book.

1107
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:57,710
- Secure the book!
- Book is secure.

1108
00:59:57,778 --> 01:00:01,509
You bring this filth in here?
What is this shit?

1109
01:00:01,582 --> 01:00:04,107
Wait, wait. We gotta
do something about this.

1110
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,584
We're gonna teach you
how to read now, brother.

1111
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:09,621
If I were you, I'd leave
as soon as possible.

1112
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,248
- Whose hand is that?
- Thanks, man.

1113
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,569
Jesus Christ.
Thanks for getting me out, man.

1114
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:28,734
No problem. The burgers wouldn't
taste as good if you weren't there.

1115
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:30,174
Hey, look at this.

1116
01:00:30,244 --> 01:00:34,010
It's like we went from being
completely poor to being millionaires.

1117
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:38,114
- What was that?
- Probably just a coyote.

1118
01:00:38,185 --> 01:00:40,085
Aren't people supposed to
be scared of coyotes?

1119
01:00:40,154 --> 01:00:41,644
That's just
'cause they sound scary, man.

1120
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,850
In one-on-one combat, either of us
could take down a coyote, no problem.

1121
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:46,085
What?

1122
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:51,192
Now, cheetahs are another story.

1123
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,869
- We're gonna die.
- No, now hold on.

1124
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:57,403
Cheetahs are used to
eating gazelles and shit.

1125
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,665
They're not known
for eating humans.

1126
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:02,640
That is a corpse.
We're gonna die.

1127
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,041
Shit!
That's not a good sign.

1128
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:07,205
Maybe if we just stay really,
really still, he'll just go away.

1129
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,441
Okay.

1130
01:01:09,383 --> 01:01:11,214
Just stay really still.
Don't move, okay?

1131
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:13,378
Just stay right there.
Very good. Good job.

1132
01:01:13,454 --> 01:01:15,149
This isn't working.

1133
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:22,219
He's mauling me!
He's mauling me!

1134
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:29,066
Dude, I told you not
to bring the beef jerky.

1135
01:01:39,546 --> 01:01:41,138
He likes me.

1136
01:01:43,751 --> 01:01:45,981
Hey, Rold, I have an idea.

1137
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:51,291
- You gotta be kidding me, man.
- Uh-uh.

1138
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,423
This is either a really smart move

1139
01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:01,195
or by far the stupidest thing
that we have ever tried.

1140
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:03,498
Well, we're about to find out.

1141
01:02:04,605 --> 01:02:05,594
Mush!

1142
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:08,968
I told you this was...

1143
01:02:18,285 --> 01:02:19,274
<i>Oy vey!</i>

1144
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:26,089
Dude, am I really high,
or is this actually working?

1145
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,651
- Both!
- This is awesome!

1146
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:30,822
We're gonna be
at White Castle in no time!

1147
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:32,931
That was close, huh, Roldy?

1148
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:41,372
Harold.
I need you, Harold.

1149
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,811
I need you, Harold.

1150
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,944
Come here.

1151
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:56,387
- Come here, Harold.
- Maria.

1152
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:58,925
- Come, Harold.
- I'm coming, baby!

1153
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:02,352
<i>I want you to hold me.
Papi. I need you.</i>

1154
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:05,262
Baby, I'm a-comin'!

1155
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:06,755
Not so fast.

1156
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:08,495
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

1157
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,569
Come on!

1158
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:19,643
Bullets... my only weakness.
How did you know?

1159
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,702
<i>Maria</i>

1160
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:22,271
Harold.

1161
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:23,680
Maria.

1162
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,514
<i>Maria</i>

1163
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:34,256
<i>Maria. Maria</i>

1164
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,297
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

1165
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,805
<i>Watch out, watch out</i>

1166
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:52,011
What the hell
are you doing? God!

1167
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,944
You've been out cold
for the past half-hour.

1168
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:56,209
I figured maybe if I did
some gay shit you'd wake up.

1169
01:03:56,283 --> 01:03:58,547
If we did some gay shit?
Where are we?

1170
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:01,520
Didn't we come here on a cheetah?
Where's the cheetah?

1171
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,818
It ran away. Listen, forget
about the cheetah, okay?

1172
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:06,121
I have some bad news
and some worse news.

1173
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:08,024
Give me the worse news first.

1174
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,528
I looked at some
of the road signs up there,

1175
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,826
and it looks like the cheetah
took us in the wrong direction.

1176
01:04:11,899 --> 01:04:14,026
- Shit!
- Yeah.

1177
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:15,725
- Shit!
- Yeah.

1178
01:04:16,803 --> 01:04:18,395
All right, what's the bad news?

1179
01:04:18,472 --> 01:04:20,372
Your laptop's completely destroyed.

1180
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,839
What?

1181
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:25,242
Why didn't...
Why didn't you tell me...

1182
01:04:25,312 --> 01:04:28,042
How is that not
the worse news?

1183
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:30,083
The laptop situation
really only affects you,

1184
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,086
whereas the White Castle
situation affects both of us equally.

1185
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:38,848
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1186
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:41,724
All my work was saved
on this computer.

1187
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,763
Now I gotta go back
to the office and redo it.

1188
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:44,854
Exactly.
First we'll go to White Castle...

1189
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:46,957
Forget about White Castle.
There is no time.

1190
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,161
Car.

1191
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:57,309
Hello. Over here!

1192
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:01,537
Shit.

1193
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,937
Whoa.

1194
01:05:26,573 --> 01:05:27,665
Yeah. Um...

1195
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,173
All right,
we'll get a pay phone,

1196
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:33,543
get a cab back
to your office, all right?

1197
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,408
Come on. You all right?

1198
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:48,251
- Hey, check this out!
- Yeah, nice!

1199
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:52,397
Hey, Apu!

1200
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,934
Jesus. These guys
are frickin' everywhere.

1201
01:05:55,002 --> 01:05:57,869
Who's looking after
the Kwik-E-Mart while you're gone?

1202
01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:00,236
You two going
to share a curry Slurpee?

1203
01:06:00,307 --> 01:06:01,797
Fucking assholes.

1204
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:04,740
Dude, check it out.
It's Rosenberg and Goldstein.

1205
01:06:09,783 --> 01:06:11,011
I want that.

1206
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,949
What, a Hot Dog Heaven
super chili cheese dog?

1207
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,784
No. I want that feeling.

1208
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:18,222
The feeling that comes over a man

1209
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:20,385
when he gets
exactly what he desires.

1210
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,394
I need that feeling.

1211
01:06:22,462 --> 01:06:24,020
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

1212
01:06:24,097 --> 01:06:26,361
- We gotta go to White Castle.
- Yes, yes!

1213
01:06:26,433 --> 01:06:28,060
I knew you had it in you, dude.

1214
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,601
Yo, is that Cindy Kim?

1215
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:37,707
Oh, dude, you should've boned her
when you had the chance, man.

1216
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:39,609
Check it out.

1217
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:45,144
Why don't you guys
just leave us alone?

1218
01:06:45,218 --> 01:06:47,049
What are you gonna
do about it, Mr. Miyagi?

1219
01:06:50,324 --> 01:06:51,757
That's extreme, man!

1220
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,685
<i>There's no sense
getting all riled up</i>

1221
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,525
<i>every time a bunch of idiots
give you a hard time.</i>

1222
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:01,397
<i>The universe tends
to unfold as it should.</i>

1223
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:03,958
Nothing.

1224
01:07:05,872 --> 01:07:08,067
- Fucking extreme!
- I'm so sick of their bullshit.

1225
01:07:09,676 --> 01:07:13,237
Don't worry. The universe
tends to unfold as it should.

1226
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:16,009
What is that,
some fortune cookie?

1227
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:21,281
Hey, I got a plan.
Follow my lead, okay?

1228
01:07:21,355 --> 01:07:23,084
- Your lead?
- Yeah.

1229
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:24,589
Okay.

1230
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:27,786
Whoa, what are you doing?
Oh, shit!

1231
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,188
Those pricks!

1232
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:35,461
- This is your plan?
- It's working, isn't it?

1233
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:39,832
Come on, come on!
Get 'em, guys!

1234
01:07:39,906 --> 01:07:41,737
- Jerk-offs!
- My truck!

1235
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:46,470
Thank you, come again.

1236
01:07:51,752 --> 01:07:54,721
Dude, that was so not extreme.

1237
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:57,222
I know, Extreme Sport Punk
Number One.

1238
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:02,324
I know.

1239
01:08:02,396 --> 01:08:03,954
Let's find us some tunes, baby.

1240
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,431
"Cole's Extreme Mix, Volume 5"?
What is this shit?

1241
01:08:08,702 --> 01:08:11,933
<i>And I need you now tonight</i>

1242
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,599
Those guys are fuckin' posers.

1243
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:19,740
<i>And if you'll only hold me tight</i>

1244
01:08:19,813 --> 01:08:24,876
<i>Baby. Baby. The stars
are shining foryou</i>

1245
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:29,445
<i>And just like me.
I'm sure that they adore you</i>

1246
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:30,751
<i>Baby. Baby</i>

1247
01:08:30,824 --> 01:08:33,793
<i>Go walking through the forest</i>

1248
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,420
<i>Things'll go your way</i>

1249
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:38,726
<i>Hold on for one more day</i>

1250
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,926
<i>I know that there is pain</i>

1251
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:43,162
<i>But you hold on for one more day</i>

1252
01:08:43,236 --> 01:08:47,639
<i>And you break free
from the chains</i>

1253
01:08:48,508 --> 01:08:50,476
<i>Yeah. I know that there is pain</i>

1254
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:53,104
<i>But you hold on
for one more day</i>

1255
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,308
<i>And you break free
right from the chains</i>

1256
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:01,314
Someday somebody's gonna
make you wanna turn around

1257
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,481
- And say good-bye
- Say good-bye

1258
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,922
Until then, baby

1259
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:07,391
Are you gonna let 'em
hold you down and make you cry?

1260
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:10,487
Don't you know
things can change

1261
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:11,997
Things'll go your way

1262
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:16,559
If you hold on for one more day

1263
01:09:16,636 --> 01:09:19,605
Hold on

1264
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:24,837
Bingo.

1265
01:09:25,178 --> 01:09:28,341
Yeah, dude! Cherry Hill, man.
We're almost there.

1266
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,780
I told you, man!

1267
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,182
I found 'em,
and I'm gonna need backup.

1268
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,447
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

1269
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:37,183
Fudge, dude.
Are you kidding me?

1270
01:09:37,858 --> 01:09:41,055
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not going back to jail, man.

1271
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:43,994
We've come too far.
Now buckle up. Buckle up!

1272
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,927
We got a chase on our hands.

1273
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,666
- Ready?
- Yeah. For what?

1274
01:09:51,738 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh, shit!

1275
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:58,305
- Where the fuck you takin' us?
- Just hold on.

1276
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:04,914
What the...

1277
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:11,687
It's a good thing I have an empty
stomach or else I'd puke right now.

1278
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:17,727
We're gonna make it.

1279
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:20,599
Everything's gonna be all ri...

1280
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:24,567
Oh, my God!

1281
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:27,404
Oh, shit. Holy shit.

1282
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,999
- Put her in reverse. Hurry!
- Shit!

1283
01:10:30,076 --> 01:10:31,941
Let's go out the back.
I'll go first.

1284
01:10:32,012 --> 01:10:34,845
- Don't shake the car!
- Well, hurry up!

1285
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:43,979
Hey, Roldy, check it out.

1286
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,731
Shit, shit!
We're trapped, man!

1287
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:05,071
Whoa. Not necessarily.

1288
01:11:06,046 --> 01:11:07,638
No.

1289
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:10,080
No, not a chance.
I'd rather turn myself in than die.

1290
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,515
No, dude, I know
exactly how to do that.

1291
01:11:11,585 --> 01:11:13,610
I used to do it with my dad
all the time when I was a kid.

1292
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:16,554
Forget it! I'm not risking my life
over a bunch of hamburgers, man.

1293
01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:18,887
So you think this is
just about the burgers, huh?

1294
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:23,285
Let me tell you,
it's about far more than that.

1295
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:27,099
Our parents came to this country,

1296
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:31,194
escaping persecution,
poverty, and hunger.

1297
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,903
Hunger, Harold.

1298
01:11:33,974 --> 01:11:36,875
They were very, very hungry.

1299
01:11:37,978 --> 01:11:40,674
They wanted to live in a land
that treated them as equals,

1300
01:11:40,747 --> 01:11:42,806
a land filled with hamburger stands.

1301
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,907
And not just
one type of hamburger, okay?

1302
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:48,580
Hundreds of types with different
sizes, toppings, and condiments.

1303
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,525
That land was America.

1304
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:56,458
America, Harold! America!

1305
01:11:57,631 --> 01:12:01,294
Now, this is about achieving
what our parents set out for.

1306
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:04,531
This is about the pursuit
of happiness.

1307
01:12:04,604 --> 01:12:08,540
This night...
is about the American dream.

1308
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:18,042
Dude, we can stay here,
get arrested,

1309
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:21,087
and end our hopes of ever
going to White Castle.

1310
01:12:21,154 --> 01:12:24,988
Or we can take that hang glider
and make our leap towards freedom.

1311
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:27,390
I leave the decision up to you.

1312
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:31,993
I hate you, Kumar.

1313
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,195
Tilt forward.

1314
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,257
- Roldy.
- What?

1315
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:38,099
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
- All right.

1316
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:43,468
- Good job, Rold. Keep running.
- Thank you.

1317
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:46,671
Hey, Roldy, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

1318
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:48,805
- I've never hang-glided before.
- What?!

1319
01:12:48,882 --> 01:12:50,110
Jump!

1320
01:12:58,558 --> 01:12:59,547
Oh, my God!

1321
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:01,491
- Dude, it's working!
- Oh, my God!

1322
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:03,529
Yeah!

1323
01:13:04,164 --> 01:13:05,222
Good news.

1324
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,630
I just found enough dope in the car

1325
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:11,102
to put these skateboard punks
in jail for the next couple of years.

1326
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,876
- Dude, we're so high right now.
- We're not low.

1327
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,009
All right, I'm bringing her in.
Right, left, left.

1328
01:13:28,088 --> 01:13:29,521
Perfect!

1329
01:13:29,589 --> 01:13:31,784
- Shit!
- Shit!

1330
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:45,128
God!

1331
01:13:45,205 --> 01:13:46,570
I'm gonna kill you!

1332
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:49,507
Look!

1333
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:01,386
We made it, dude.

1334
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,306
Looks like you guys
had some night, huh?

1335
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,639
I want 30 Slyders, 5 French fries,
and 4 large Cherry Cokes.

1336
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:28,647
I want the same, except
make mine Diet Cokes, Chuck.

1337
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:32,617
Wow. Well, that comes
to $46.75.

1338
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:37,846
- Dude, where's my money?
- You don't have money?

1339
01:14:37,924 --> 01:14:39,221
- Dude, are you kidding me?
- No.

1340
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:41,317
I gave mine
to that asshole at Princeton.

1341
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:44,522
Fuck! Fuck that hippie fuck!
No! Dude, this isn't happening!

1342
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:46,258
We didn't make it here,
and now we're broke!

1343
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:47,594
No, no, no, no!

1344
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:50,898
Guys, let me pay for it.
It's the least I can do.

1345
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,335
The hell are you doing here?

1346
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,635
You guys kept talking about
White Castle last night so much,

1347
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,004
it made me start to crave it, too.

1348
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,441
- Dude, where's my car?
- Where's his car, dude?

1349
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:02,003
Yeah, sorry about that.
I told you last night I was tripping balls.

1350
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,605
I don't know what came over me.

1351
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:06,083
Your car's in the parking lot.
Here are your keys.

1352
01:15:06,152 --> 01:15:08,620
Do you realize what the hell we had to
go through after you took the car?

1353
01:15:08,688 --> 01:15:11,486
Yeah. It was a dick move
on my part.

1354
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:15,119
That's why I'm paying
for your meal. Prick.

1355
01:15:15,195 --> 01:15:16,594
Thanks, I guess.

1356
01:15:16,663 --> 01:15:21,726
Here's 50 bucks for the burgers
and 200 for the car.

1357
01:15:22,902 --> 01:15:24,199
What happened to my car?

1358
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,467
I made some love stains
in the back seat.

1359
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,269
You'll see.

1360
01:15:31,978 --> 01:15:34,105
Anyway, nice meeting you guys.
I'll catch you later.

1361
01:15:34,647 --> 01:15:35,909
Where are you going?

1362
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,079
Wherever God takes me.

1363
01:15:56,703 --> 01:15:58,568
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1364
01:15:58,638 --> 01:15:59,662
Let's do this together.

1365
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,502
Damn, that hit the spot.

1366
01:16:38,578 --> 01:16:41,547
- That was the best meal of my life.
- Mine, too.

1367
01:16:41,614 --> 01:16:43,172
You know what, dude?

1368
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:45,547
I think I may actually go
to my interview today.

1369
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:46,710
Are you serious?

1370
01:16:46,786 --> 01:16:48,276
You know, my whole life
I've just been scared

1371
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,481
of being one of those nerdy
Indian guys turned doctor,

1372
01:16:50,556 --> 01:16:52,114
but tonight got me thinking.

1373
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,421
There are far worse things
in this world than being tapped

1374
01:16:54,494 --> 01:16:56,655
for having a natural
ability in medicine.

1375
01:16:56,729 --> 01:16:59,357
<i>Chick magnet. Chick magnet</i>

1376
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:02,458
Plus, how cool was that,
saving that dude's life last night?

1377
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:06,437
It was somewhere between that,
getting yelled at by my dad,

1378
01:17:06,506 --> 01:17:07,495
and seeing Neil Patrick Harris

1379
01:17:07,573 --> 01:17:09,040
that I realized that I've
always wanted to be a doctor

1380
01:17:09,108 --> 01:17:11,133
but I've just been too scared
to admit it to myself.

1381
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,508
- Billy, you paying for this?
- Yeah, I'll be there...

1382
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:15,137
Good, 'cause if he wasn't,
you would.

1383
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,047
Are you listening to me, Roldy?
I'm having a major epiphany here.

1384
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:19,778
I'll be right back.

1385
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,581
You're unlike any other woman
I've ever met.

1386
01:17:21,654 --> 01:17:24,145
What the fuck is going on here?

1387
01:17:25,024 --> 01:17:27,993
Harold?
What happened to you, man?

1388
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:30,222
<i>Never mind me.
What the fuck are you doing here?</i>

1389
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:32,457
I thought you and J.D.
Were busy all night with clients.

1390
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:33,897
Isn't that why
I had to do your work?

1391
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:36,197
- Henry, what the hell's going on?
- Back off, cock boy.

1392
01:17:36,269 --> 01:17:38,066
What I said to him
goes double for you.

1393
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:40,037
- Did you just call me cock boy?
- Yeah, you know I did.

1394
01:17:40,106 --> 01:17:41,095
You're just stalling

1395
01:17:41,174 --> 01:17:43,108
because you're not quick
enough to think of a comeback.

1396
01:17:43,176 --> 01:17:45,110
You think I'm not quick enough.
Guy thinks I'm not quick enough.

1397
01:17:45,178 --> 01:17:47,942
<i>Well, I've got news for you.
I am quick enough...</i>

1398
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:52,716
...cock boy!

1399
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:56,679
Listen, Harold, I'm really sorry.

1400
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:59,122
Don't bother with him. We'll take it up
with Berenson tomorrow.

1401
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,955
What are you
gonna tell Berenson?

1402
01:18:01,027 --> 01:18:03,086
That I'm your workhorse?

1403
01:18:03,162 --> 01:18:05,892
That you guys think
you can party all weekend,

1404
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:08,024
leave the work to
the quiet Asian guy in the office?

1405
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:11,332
<i>- No, you don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.</i>

1406
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:14,737
I'm not doing
your work for you anymore.

1407
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:17,002
And if either one
of you douche bags

1408
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:19,101
ever tries to pull
this shit again,

1409
01:18:19,178 --> 01:18:20,611
I'll go to Berenson myself.

1410
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,648
I'll tell him what's really going on.

1411
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:24,376
And I'll tell the whole office

1412
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,908
how you both caught gonorrhea
from that prostitute in Atlantic City.

1413
01:18:29,188 --> 01:18:31,850
If you'll excuse me, boys,
I gotta get going. Kumar.

1414
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:35,623
See you boys
at the office on Monday.

1415
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:37,026
Excuse me.

1416
01:18:43,903 --> 01:18:46,872
Dude, that was awesome!
Where the hell did that come from?

1417
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:47,928
I don't know.

1418
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:51,033
Eating those delicious burgers
made me feel like a new man.

1419
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:52,134
You know what?

1420
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:54,008
Now I'm actually looking forward
to going to work this week.

1421
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,538
No shit. You know,
you might be worthwhile after all.

1422
01:18:57,617 --> 01:18:59,084
I'm not worthless.

1423
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:02,519
Hey, so those dudes
really have gonorrhea?

1424
01:19:02,588 --> 01:19:03,850
Beats me.

1425
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:07,189
Hey.

1426
01:19:08,094 --> 01:19:10,153
- Let's get going.
- What's the rush, dude?

1427
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:11,890
I don't have my interview
for a couple of hours.

1428
01:19:11,964 --> 01:19:14,228
I got some unfinished business
to take care of.

1429
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,097
I thought those guys
were gonna do the work.

1430
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,603
No, unfinished business.

1431
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:20,866
- Maria.
- Still not following you.

1432
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:21,929
Get in!

1433
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,014
So you don't even have a plan.

1434
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:33,211
Dude, I got love
on my side, man.

1435
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:34,446
Trust me.

1436
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,479
When I see Maria, I'm gonna
know exactly what to say.

1437
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,962
- Hey.
- Hey.

1438
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:47,898
It looks like you guys
have had some night.

1439
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:55,500
Shit. You know what?
I left my lighter in your car.

1440
01:19:55,575 --> 01:19:57,440
Do me a favor and run down
and get it for me, please?

1441
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,171
I gotta urinate.

1442
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,132
You sure got a lot of baggage.

1443
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,313
Maria, wait.

1444
01:20:35,381 --> 01:20:37,508
I know this is gonna seem
completely out of the blue,

1445
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,643
and I know you don't know me
very well... or, um, at all.

1446
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,585
But let me tell you
the best part of my day is.

1447
01:20:42,655 --> 01:20:45,146
I come home from work
and I walk through this lobby,

1448
01:20:45,224 --> 01:20:47,283
and on days that I'm lucky enough,

1449
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,625
I spend ten seconds
in this elevator with you.

1450
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:52,789
I had the craziest night
of my life tonight,

1451
01:20:52,865 --> 01:20:56,028
and I guess I learned that
if you want something or someone,

1452
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:57,330
you have to go for it.

1453
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:01,905
And if Liane can
marry a guy like Freakshow

1454
01:21:01,974 --> 01:21:04,704
and I can hang-glide
and I can ride a cheetah,

1455
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,335
then I guess...

1456
01:21:07,346 --> 01:21:08,335
Oh, fuck it.

1457
01:21:08,414 --> 01:21:12,407
Girl, I'm spendin' my dimes

1458
01:21:12,485 --> 01:21:14,817
Give me a minute.
This is crazy.

1459
01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:16,946
- That was... l'm sorry.
- I don't even know you.

1460
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:19,514
I had White Castle,
so I'm a little dizzy.

1461
01:21:19,592 --> 01:21:22,220
- We don't ever speak.
- We don't talk, so that was inappropriate.

1462
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:23,557
Oh, fuck it.

1463
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,427
<i>I wanna get next to you</i>

1464
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:34,203
<i>I wanna get next to you</i>

1465
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:38,199
Okay.

1466
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:41,914
Now you just have to work
on your timing.

1467
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,915
- Where are you going?
- Amsterdam.

1468
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:47,146
I'll be back in ten days.
But I'll see you when I get back?

1469
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,415
Yeah, let's do that.

1470
01:21:56,062 --> 01:21:57,552
Bye, Harold.

1471
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:01,964
Bye. Bye.
I'll see you later.

1472
01:22:03,302 --> 01:22:05,236
- She touch your penis?
- What?

1473
01:22:05,304 --> 01:22:06,931
What happened?

1474
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:11,443
Nothing much, really.
Just a little kiss action.

1475
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,137
Nice. Nice!

1476
01:22:13,212 --> 01:22:15,772
Yeah. She's going to Amsterdam.
She'll be back in ten days.

1477
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,679
We gotta go.

1478
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,308
- Where?
- Amsterdam, man.

1479
01:22:19,385 --> 01:22:20,784
- We gotta get our bags packed...
- Amsterdam?

1480
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,878
...and frickin' take the next flight out.

1481
01:22:22,955 --> 01:22:25,048
Are you freaking out of your mind?
What about your interview?

1482
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:27,115
Dude, whatever.
I'll tell my dad to reschedule it.

1483
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:30,026
He won't have a problem as long as
I take it seriously for a change.

1484
01:22:30,096 --> 01:22:32,963
We gotta freakin' go to Europe
and find Maria.

1485
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,091
Dude, she's coming back
in ten days.

1486
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:36,828
It's not like I'm never
gonna see her again.

1487
01:22:36,902 --> 01:22:38,130
Listen, for a hot chick,

1488
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,172
ten days in Europe
can be the kiss of death, okay?

1489
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,333
She's gonna have all these suave,
sophisticated guys all over her.

1490
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:45,377
When she gets back,
she may not be available.

1491
01:22:45,444 --> 01:22:47,912
Forget it. I'll see her
when she comes back.

1492
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,174
Hey, Roldy.

1493
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,776
You do realize what's legal
in Amsterdam, don't you?

1494
01:22:56,355 --> 01:22:57,549
Oh, yeah.

1495
01:23:04,697 --> 01:23:07,461
In today's headlines,
Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson

1496
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:10,366
and attorney Nathaniel Banks are
suing the state of New Jersey

1497
01:23:10,436 --> 01:23:12,961
for racial discrimination
and police brutality.

1498
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:15,473
My family and I are outraged

1499
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,975
and will settle for
nothing less than justice.

1500
01:23:18,044 --> 01:23:21,980
I still trust and love
all white people, all of them.

1501
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:24,807
And Asians.
And Asians.

1502
01:23:24,884 --> 01:23:26,613
And a few Mexicans as well.

1503
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:29,154
Several of the officers
suspected of brutality

1504
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:31,519
were taken into custody
earlier this morning.

1505
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,683
Run away, you mother...

1506
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:37,593
No black mother... gonna get away
