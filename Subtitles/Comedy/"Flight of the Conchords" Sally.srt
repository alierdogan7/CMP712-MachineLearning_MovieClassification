1
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,535
Man, back in New Zealand,
I was getting it on with lots of chicks.

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,944
- Who?
- Well, uh...

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,005
Sarah Fitzpatrick,

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,914
uh, Michelle Fitzpatrick,

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,613
Claire Fitzpatrick...
the list goes on.

6
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,281
- That was all of them?
- Well, triple figures.

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,655
No that's not triple figures,
that's three.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,557
Here though, I...

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,461
I don't seem to get with any women,
I just talk about getting with women.

10
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,488
Yeah, but the ones
you talk about are hot.

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,330
They're a lot hotter than the ones
you got with in New Zealand.

12
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,995
That's true.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,062
I do talk about getting
with some pretty hot women.

14
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,903
You don't just talk about it, man,
you talk about it a lot.

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,738
Yeah, I suppose
I do talk a lot

16
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,371
about getting with
some very hot women.

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,973
- This should be it.
- Yeah, this is it.

18
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,279
This is Dave's place.

19
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,649
- Yeah it's Dave's party.
- Oh, right.

20
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,779
We didn't need a map.
We just live down there.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,722
Hey, Dave. This is
an awesome party, man.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,059
- Yeah. Great decorations.
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,129
How's it going?

24
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,724
Yeah, it's good,
but look, guys,

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,133
I don't want
to be a dick

26
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,000
but could you guys,
like, move away?

27
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,938
I'm trying
to look Ionely.

28
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,503
Lonely? What for?

29
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,209
Chicks are attracted
to Ionely guys.

30
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,874
It's a psychological
analogy.

31
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,576
And what about
Eugene?

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,679
He knows
what he's doing.

33
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,691
Well, you just look like
you're waiting.

34
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,821
You look good, but you look like
you're waiting.

35
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,093
Guys, go have a samosa.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,362
Have you tried the gulab jamuns?
They're off the hook.

37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,038
What I was trying
to say before is that

38
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,099
after six or seven weeks
girls find me boring.

39
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,236
- Mmm.
- But I'm not sure what happens,

40
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,577
because I mean that's about how long
it takes to get to know someone.

41
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,105
Mmm.

42
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,818
Can you move
away, please?

43
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,516
Sure. How long for?

44
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,752
30 minutes.

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,418
Okay.

46
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,040
# Yeah-ah-ha #

47
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,746
# Looking 'round the room #

48
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,345
# I can tell that you #

49
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,324
# Are the most
beautiful girl in the... #

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,258
# Room #

51
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,559
# In the whole wide room #

52
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,258
# Ooh #

53
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,891
# And when you're
on the street #

54
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,595
# Depending on the street #

55
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,660
# I bet you are definitely #

56
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,638
# In the top three #

57
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,102
# Good-Iooking girls
on the street #

58
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,046
# Depending
on the street #

59
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,605
# And when I saw you #

60
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,241
# At my mate's place #

61
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,617
# I thought,
"What is she doing... #

62
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,950
# At my mate's place? #

63
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,791
# How did Dave get
a hottie like that #

64
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,421
# To a party like his?" #

65
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,227
# Good one, Dave #

66
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,597
# Ooh, you're
a legend, Dave #

67
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,096
# I ask Dave if he's
gonna make a move on you #

68
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,608
# He's not sure, I said #

69
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,669
# "Dave do you
mind if I do?" #

70
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,374
# He says
he doesn't mind #

71
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,006
# But I can tell
he kind of minds #

72
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,983
# But I'm gonna
do it anyway #

73
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,883
# I see you
standing all alone #

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,581
# By the stereo #

75
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,921
# I dim the lights down
to very low, here we go #

76
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,655
- # You're so beautiful #
- # Beautiful #

77
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,562
# You could be a waitress #

78
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,227
- # You're so beautiful #
- # Beautiful #

79
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,466
# You could be
an air hostess in the '60s #

80
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,598
# You're so beautiful #

81
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,308
# You could be
a part-time model #

82
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,008
# And then I seal
the deal #

83
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,415
# I do my moves,
I do my dance moves #

84
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,183
# It's 12:02 #

85
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,785
# Just me and you #

86
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,659
# And seven other dudes #

87
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,665
# Around you
on the dance floor #

88
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,065
# I draw you near,
let's get out of here #

89
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,069
# Let's get in a cab #

90
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,866
# I'll buy you a kebab #

91
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,998
# And I can't believe #

92
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,238
# That I'm sharing a kebab
with the most beautiful girl #

93
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,043
# I have ever seen
with a kebab #

94
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,276
# Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #

95
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,310
# Why don't we leave? #

96
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,185
# Let's go to my house #

97
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,713
# We could feel each other up
on my couch #

98
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,692
# Oh no, I don't mind #

99
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,456
# Taking it slo-o-ow #

100
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,521
# No-oh-oh, yeah #

101
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,465
# 'Cause you're
so beautiful #

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,900
# Like a tree #

103
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,371
- # Or a high-class prostitute #
- # You're so beautiful #

104
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,941
# Mmm, you could be
a part-time model #

105
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,873
# But you probably still
have to keep your normal job #

106
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,112
# A part-time model #

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,614
# Spending part
of your time modeling #

108
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,989
# And part of your time #

109
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,424
# Next to meeee... #

110
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,957
# Hee-hee hee-hee hee-hee #

111
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,104
# My place is usually
a little tidier than this. #

112
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,619
- Hey guys.
- Hi.

113
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,177
- Hey.
- Hey, Bret.

114
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,281
That's just Bret.
Turn the light off, Bret.

115
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,019
No no no. It's okay.
Leave it on.

116
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,892
Um, I should
probably go.

117
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,452
Are you sure?

118
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,022
So on or off
with the light then?

119
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,125
Yeah, um...

120
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,534
I'll call you. Okay.

121
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,470
Okay.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
What happened there?
Did I do something wrong?

123
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,003
- I don't know, I couldn't really see.
- I did all my moves.

124
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,412
I walked on the outside of her.
I bought her a kebab.

125
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,280
I paid for half the taxi.

126
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,342
Should I have paid
for the whole taxi?

127
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,115
Should I have paid for
the whole taxi?

128
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,918
- Hmm?
- Bret?

129
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,480
- Bret?
- Did you...

130
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,049
did you walk on the outside of her?

131
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,721
- Yes.
- I don't know then.

132
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm going to sleep.

133
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,264
Hey, Bret, I think I know
where I went wrong.

134
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,734
Hmm?

135
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,037
I think I know where
I went wrong last night.

136
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,270
Yeah?

137
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,769
Yeah, Sally wanted to leave
when you turned the light on.

138
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,680
I think she
found it weird...

139
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,707
the whole thing
with you there with the...

140
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,276
with the light... on.

141
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,515
Yeah, I think it
might also be

142
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,456
because she and I
used to go out.

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
Yeah. It's 'cause you and her
used to go out,

144
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,728
but also because
of the thing with the light.

145
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,895
She's thinking, "Oh...

146
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,699
this is a nice situation."

147
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,137
But then, "Ugh, who...
who turned on the light?"

148
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,971
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

149
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,274
But I think it's mainly
because her and I used to go out...

150
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,905
for, like, six months.

151
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,349
Yeah, well... yeah, it's mainly because
you used to go out,

152
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,751
but also mainly because of the whole
situation with the light.

153
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,221
Yeah, but the last thing
you want to see

154
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,692
when you're hooking up
is your ex in the same room.

155
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,356
Yeah, and you also don't want to be
startled by a light, do you?

156
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,092
Hmm.

157
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,828
May I interject?

158
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,700
- Hmm?
- What do you think of this?

159
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,400
It's good.

160
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,204
I'm getting them
for the building.

161
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,575
- Right.
- I just think she found it off-putting.

162
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,136
Do you want
to give it a shot?

163
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,273
- All right.
- Just a...

164
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,806
It doesn't work.

165
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,580
Okay, guys, band meeting.

166
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,588
Bret?

167
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,988
- Yep?
- Jemaine?

168
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,452
- Jemaine?
- Well, yeah, obviously.

169
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,018
Here?
Well, you're here?

170
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,053
I'm here, so why do I have to
say that I'm here?

171
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,157
It's just so I've got it
all written down, you know.

172
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,361
Yeah, but I'm here,
so if you can see me here...

173
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,336
Murray, present.
See? Even if I do it.

174
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,896
It's just how we do it.

175
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,239
So how was, uh,
Dave's party?

176
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,404
- Oh it was good.
- Mmm, it wasn't that good.

177
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,675
You're both aware
I wasn't invited?

178
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,113
No.

179
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,583
Jemaine, did you know?
You did know?

180
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,846
- Yeah.
- You know, eh?

181
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,650
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

182
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,953
"Jemaine knew."

183
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,419
Item one: Fan base;

184
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,159
Ways to increase
the American fan base.

185
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,634
What fan base?

186
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,035
- The fan base of the band.
- You mean Mel?

187
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,733
That's not a fan base,
that's just a woman.

188
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,901
Yeah, but I'm calling it
a fan base from now on.

189
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,638
It's just easier
when I call,

190
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,238
because if you say,
"Oh, the fan will be there,"

191
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,647
they can tell there's only one person.
I'm trying to make it look bigger.

192
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,346
It's a base... put "base"
on the end of it, okay?

193
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,150
- That sounds good.
- It sounds better.

194
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,384
- I came up with that.
- Do we have any gigs, Murray?

195
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,723
Yeah, I'm getting to that.

196
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,694
I've got a lot
on my plate, Jemaine.

197
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,924
I'm not just a band manager.

198
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,557
- Murray?
- Yeah.

199
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,763
Uh, I wanted you to okay
the new subway poster.

200
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,703
Oh wow, Greg.

201
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,569
What about another
exclamation mark?

202
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,632
I don't think
that's necessary.

203
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,076
Not necessary, no.

204
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,739
That's... good.

205
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,112
What happened with the gig
at the Aquarium?

206
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,984
It was kind of
a misunderstanding.

207
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,855
Um, there was
a typo in the ad.

208
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,223
It was sand they wanted.

209
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,160
Sand, you know,
that wavy font?

210
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,993
It looks like a "B,"
but it was an "S."

211
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,555
But I sent the demo.

212
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,066
So the good news
is that, uh...

213
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,329
they liked it.

214
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,200
They might play it
in the lobby.

215
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,762
- Okay, that's positive.
- Item two...

216
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,398
that's it.

217
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,569
Have you guys got any ideas?

218
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,011
- Uh, music video.
- Oh, a nice one, Bret.

219
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,878
I was just going to say
the same one.

220
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,678
Okay, nice one,
Jemaine and Bret.

221
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,742
I can take Friday
afternoon off, no worries.

222
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,346
- Don't we need more money for...
- Helen?

223
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,822
Hey it's, uh,
it's Murray...

224
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,189
Hewitt. Yeah.

225
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,252
Good. Can I get
Friday afternoon off?

226
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,557
Right.
All right, thanks.

227
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,260
Yep.

228
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,237
How does Saturday
morning sound?

229
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,032
Oh, hey guys.

230
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,544
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, Mel.

231
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,206
Hey, whoa.
Crazy meeting you here, huh?

232
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,876
What, outside our house?

233
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,714
Yeah! Bret!

234
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,550
You're so funny.
I love your sense of humor.

235
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,453
What are you doing down
Mr. Lee's stairwell?

236
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,654
Jogging. Hey, where were
you guys on Tuesday?

237
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,424
I went to your gig.

238
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,988
I was at the Aquarium
for hours just waiting.

239
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,728
They wouldn't let me stay
after 1:00 a.m., but, um...

240
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,430
- what time did you guys play?
- It was canceled.

241
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,803
Oh, that sucks!

242
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,740
That's bullshit!

243
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,800
Well, the fish
were beautiful.

244
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,210
They were breeding...
it's mating season

245
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,237
and I... I saw
fish make love.

246
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,046
- I don't think we want to hear that.
- No, it's really interesting.

247
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,076
Actually, you know
quite a few species of fish

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,850
require two or more
sexual partners...

249
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,857
We have to go now, Mel.

250
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,415
Where?

251
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,087
- Um...
- Home.

252
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,493
That's right.
Yeah yeah.

253
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,759
You... you just
came from home.

254
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,732
Yeah, we're just
popping out for a second

255
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,257
and then, um,

256
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,634
that's all we were going to do...
just get some air.

257
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,706
- Mmm.
- Oh.

258
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,606
We always have
such a fun time

259
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,702
when we're hanging out together.
Awesome.

260
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,772
It's a good cake, man.

261
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,908
It doesn't make any difference...
Isabella.

262
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,782
- I don't want cake...
- It's top quality.

263
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,980
- Get out. I don't want your cake!
- 20 bucks. Give me the TV.

264
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,888
What an idiot, trying to
sell me a cake.

265
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,552
- It was a beautiful cake.
- Yeah, it was.

266
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,459
So did you guys
have fun at the party?

267
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,555
- Oh, amazing fun.
- It was okay.

268
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,395
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it, Dave.

269
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,401
But I, uh,
wasn't invited.

270
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,062
Oh, that's okay.

271
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,866
Hey, Jemaine,
how'd it go with Sally?

272
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,372
Yeah, pretty good.

273
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,306
- I, uh...
- Yeah?

274
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,604
Not that well.

275
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,076
You and her used to go out
before, didn't you?

276
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,908
No, that was me.
She went out with me.

277
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,574
Oh. Oh!

278
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,414
Hey, Jemaine, I don't know how they do
things back in England...

279
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,942
New Zealand.

280
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,545
Yeah, whatever.
I don't really give a shit.

281
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,716
But the point is, going out with your
best friend's ex-girlfriend

282
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,783
while you still live
with your best friend,

283
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,058
that kind of thing would be considered
a little weird here in the U.S.

284
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,032
Actually it'd be quite weird
in New Zealand as well.

285
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,091
Jemaine, you should
think about that.

286
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,069
I've told you...
when you're in a band,

287
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,971
you don't get with your bandmate's
girlfriend, past or present.

288
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,237
- Yes, thanks for that.
- You get a love triangle.

289
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,177
You know?
Fleetwood Mac situation.

290
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,680
Well, there was four of them
so more of a love square,

291
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,477
but, you know,
no one gets on.

292
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,949
Okay, I see.

293
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,975
Mind you, they did make some of their
best music back then.

294
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,147
- "Rumors."
- No, that's all true.

295
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,316
Well, the thing is
Bret's cool with it.

296
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,121
- I'm not that cool with it.
- If Bret's cool with it, that's fine.

297
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,991
Have you got
any video cameras, David?

298
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,657
- Sure, what's your budget?
- Budget?

299
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,859
You mean you need
to bring in a budget?

300
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,629
Like, how much
do you want to spend?

301
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,193
Do you want
a printed-out budget?

302
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,364
No, I want to know how much
money you want to spend...

303
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,874
I haven't worked it all out.
We haven't got much money.

304
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,933
And... action!

305
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,912
I don't think that's
a proper camera, Murray.

306
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,814
- Yeah, a mobile-phone camera.
- I think it's mostly a phone.

307
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,114
It's not what they'd use on a music
video though.

308
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,713
It's what's we're using, isn't it? It's
all I've got. It's taking good footage.

309
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,154
- You look good.
- Is it?

310
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,248
- Yeah.
- Okay.

311
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,849
What are these
supposed to be?

312
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,088
Those are your function buttons
for the robot.

313
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,187
- They look like nipples.
- Don't touch them!

314
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,563
I spent ages making these, guys.
It looks good.

315
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,591
Now let's just start again.
That's all I had.

316
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,262
It doesn't look like
Daft Punk.

317
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,964
We wanted ones
like Daft Punk.

318
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,870
I don't know
who he is.

319
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,671
You're just robots from the future,
all right?

320
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,610
Try not to walk
so funky, Bret,

321
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,875
because you're...
try and make it less cool.

322
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,279
More like...

323
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,283
you know, electronic...
hide your neck.

324
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,581
Put your...
that's right. Okay.

325
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,521
# The distant future,
the distant future #

326
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,754
# It is the distant future,
the year 2000 #

327
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,590
# We are robots #

328
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,358
# The world
is very different #

329
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,262
# Ever since
the robotic uprising #

330
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,891
# of the mid-'90s #

331
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,492
# There is
no more unhappiness #

332
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,059
# Affirmative #

333
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,265
# We no longer say "yes" #

334
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,070
# Instead we say
"affirmative" #

335
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,736
# Yes, affirmative #

336
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,803
# Unless it's a more
colloquial situation #

337
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,839
# With a few
robo-friends #

338
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,511
# There is only one
kind of dance... #

339
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,780
# The robot #

340
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,549
# And the robo-boogie #

341
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,382
# Oh yes #

342
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,188
# Two kinds of dances #

343
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,253
# Finally, robotic beings
rule the world #

344
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,322
# The humans are dead #

345
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,424
# The humans are dead #

346
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,261
# We used poisonous gases #

347
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,467
# And we poisoned
their asses #

348
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,011
- # The humans are dead #
- # He's right they are dead #

349
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,642
- # The humans are dead #
- # They look like they're dead #

350
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,051
- # It had to be done #
- # I'll just confirm they're dead #

351
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,486
# So that we could have fun #

352
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,491
# Affirmative, I poked one,
it was dead. #

353
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,323
It's just that I think
she might be the one.

354
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,329
- Sally?
- Yeah.

355
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,887
What makes you
think that?

356
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,456
You just know. When it happens to you,
you'll know.

357
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,060
- You said Michelle was the one.
- Yeah, she's the one.

358
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,765
- You said Claire was the one.
- Yeah, she's another one.

359
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,569
So you get more
than one "one"?

360
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,734
Some people are lucky.
I've had a few ones.

361
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,574
So how many ones
can you have?

362
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,204
Five.

363
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,010
- How many have you had?
- Three.

364
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,210
How many have you had?

365
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,743
Just one.
Just one.

366
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,750
Yep, okay.

367
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,222
Okay, well, I'll see you
later then.

368
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,849
Okay, bye.

369
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,221
Hey, um, Bret?

370
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,358
Do you think it would
be okay if Sally and I

371
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,767
had the apartment
to ourselves tonight?

372
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,431
- What for?
- Some time alone.

373
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,305
Mmm, I was going to be working on
my secret project.

374
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,038
Your helmet that
looks like your hair?

375
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,309
- Yes.
- How's that going?

376
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,681
It's going pretty good. I still need
to get more body in the hair.

377
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,152
- It pretty much looks like a helmet.
- Right.

378
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,417
Well, could you do that
tomorrow night?

379
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,651
It's helmet-hair night,
man, not really.

380
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,750
I mean, I've been
thinking about it for ages.

381
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,489
It's on the board.
You know about it.

382
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,429
You said you were
going to help actually.

383
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,898
Because I can't really see what
I'm doing when I've got it on.

384
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,924
There's nothing booked
on any other night.

385
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,367
- Why don't you...
- It's just...

386
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,371
Could you swap it
for Tuesday night or...

387
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,632
- the other nights?
- Well...

388
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,543
how about you just maybe
don't go out with Sally

389
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,570
so I can hang out
with you guys?

390
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,775
That'd be good.

391
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,409
What are you
talking about?

392
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,750
I can't hang out with you guys, can I?
It's a bit weird now.

393
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,311
Of course you can
hang out with us.

394
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,289
Come to dinner
with us tonight.

395
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,122
I don't want to go on a date
with you and my ex-girlfriend.

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,185
It's going to be...
that's going to be weird.

397
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,925
- It won't be weird.
- That is going to be weird, man.

398
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,762
It won't be weird,
we're all friends.

399
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,064
I like Sally.
You like Sally.

400
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,571
She used to like you.
She really likes me.

401
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,470
- You like me.
- I suppose I do.

402
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,274
It won't be weird.

403
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,472
- No, it's going to be weird.
- It won't be weird.

404
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,538
- That is going to be weird.
- It won't be weird.

405
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,209
- It will be weird.
- It won't be weird.

406
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,740
- It will be weird.
- It won't be weird.

407
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,352
You know, it is actually a bit weird
with you here, Bret.

408
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,254
Yeah, I should go.
I'll go.

409
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,885
It's fine,
it's fine.

410
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,363
Bret... Bret was saying that it was
going to be weird with him here

411
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,093
and I... I said it wouldn't be weird,
but it is a bit weird.

412
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,601
Oh.

413
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,330
- Eh?
- Yeah, it is a bit.

414
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,801
Um, it was nice
to see you, Sally.

415
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,571
- You look beautiful.
- Bret, this is my date.

416
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,944
It's just feelings.

417
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,041
You do look beautiful,
I was just about to say that.

418
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,780
- I think I'll probably go.
- No, stay.

419
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,254
Actually it's just like
when Bret and I went out

420
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,452
- and you were always around.
- I've ordered my main, I'll stay.

421
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,757
- I think you should go.
- Yeah, I should go. It's a bit weird.

422
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,525
Um... I wouldn't have
ordered the duck.

423
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,227
I spent all my money
on the duck.

424
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,964
Would you be able
to bring the duck home?

425
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,336
- Yeah, yep.
- Okay.

426
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,773
Yeah, I'll go
and nice to see you.

427
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,298
- Bye, Bret.
- See you.

428
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,368
- Yeah, bye, Bret.
- You'll bring the duck?

429
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,039
Yeah, I'll bring the duck.

430
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,571
- That was weird, wasn't it?
- Yeah, a little.

431
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,493
- Hi, Bret. Are you okay?
- Oh, hey, Mel.

432
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,326
- Jemaine's on a date with Sally, right?
- Yeah.

433
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,093
How does that make you feel?

434
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,998
Not good.

435
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,969
Bret, don't worry
about Sally.

436
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,563
I never thought she was
right for you anyway.

437
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,471
What didn't you
like about Sally?

438
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,874
Well, I haven't
actually met Sally.

439
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,141
I just... sometimes I think the thing
you're looking for

440
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,671
is often standing right
in front of your eyes.

441
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,113
What are you going
to do tonight?

442
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,848
Uh, I'm not sure.

443
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,254
Mel, can we go now?
We've been here for 21/2 hours.

444
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,724
- Is that Doug?
- That's Doug. Don't worry about him.

445
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,785
Just 'cause I'm married to Doug
doesn't mean I can't be here for you.

446
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,356
- Thanks, Mel.
- You can tell me anything.

447
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,391
Anything. I promise
I won't think you're a pervert.

448
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,433
Okay. Thanks.

449
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,168
Have I shown you my picture
of Jemaine's lips?

450
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,142
- No.
- I have it here in my wallet. Look.

451
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,635
Those are my cousins, and there...
that's... that's Jemaine's lips.

452
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,012
- Oh yeah, that's them.
- Mel, we really have to go now.

453
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,210
We said we'd call your mom
and she'll go to bed soon.

454
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,710
You should go. I'm fine.
I'll be fine.

455
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,814
- Good seeing you, Bret.
- See you, Doug.

456
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,424
- See you... see you, Mel.
- Yeah.

457
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,260
Bret, don't worry
about Sally, all right?

458
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,163
Whenever I was watching
the two of you

459
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,964
it was obvious that you were more into
her than she was into you.

460
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,767
- Really?
- Yeah, you could really tell.

461
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,568
She always looked
kind of bored.

462
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,541
Oh.

463
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,043
Thanks, Mel.

464
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,170
Hey.

465
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,882
- Take care.
- See you.

466
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,815
I was thinking maybe we could go
somewhere special this weekend.

467
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,794
What was that place
you went to with Bret

468
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,422
that sounded romantic
and... and cheap?

469
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,159
I'm not sure.

470
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,894
I'm... I'm quite busy
at the moment.

471
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,863
You know what? I've left duck juice
all down your top.

472
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,397
- I don't think we should go out again.
- It's really oily.

473
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,910
You're probably going
to need to get that dry-cleaned.

474
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,378
- Bret should pay for it really.
- Don't worry about my top.

475
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,041
Okay, that's good.

476
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,277
I don't think we should
see each other again.

477
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,652
I think it's best if we just
pretend this never happened.

478
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,920
- Maybe we could have a break?
- A break?

479
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,358
No, there's...
there's no relationship.

480
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,453
Yet. We could
start with a break.

481
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,589
It's not...
it's not going to work.

482
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,759
I'm usually more
charismatic than this.

483
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,463
No, um, it's not that.
It's just that...

484
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,597
I don't know, I was just looking for
a bit of fun this summer, you know?

485
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,938
And when I met you
at that party, I was drunk.

486
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,069
- I was really drunk.
- So, you're leaving, aren't you?

487
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,080
You looked kind of cute
when I was drunk.

488
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,174
I knew it. When you said
just then when you told me

489
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,515
you were leaving,
that's when I definitely knew.

490
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,420
Maybe what I really want
is an Australian.

491
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,356
But if you're trying
to break my heart...

492
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,222
Maybe you guys
know some...

493
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,193
...your plan is flawed
from the start.

494
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,129
I already broke up with Bret,
so I already broke up with you...

495
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,928
You can't break my heart, it's liquid.
It melted when I met you.

496
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,333
If you think about it, we're not really
breaking up now...

497
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,497
- Mmm, hmmm.
...because we never really went out.

498
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,099
- And as you turn around to leave...
- Jemaine?

499
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,770
...don't turn back to me.

500
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,640
Don't turn around and see

501
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,479
if I'm crying...
I'm not crying.

502
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,318
# I'm not crying #

503
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,118
# It's just been raining #

504
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,792
# On my face #

505
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,401
# And if you think you see some
tear tracks down my cheeks #

506
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,097
# Please #

507
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,333
# Please #

508
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,773
# Don't tell my mates #

509
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,712
# I'm not crying #

510
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,944
# No, I'm not crying #

511
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,625
# And if I am crying #

512
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,320
# It's not because of you #

513
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,330
# It's because I'm thinking
about friend of mine #

514
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,594
# That you don't know
who is dying #

515
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,158
# That's right, dying #

516
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,432
# These aren't
tears of sadness #

517
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,200
# Because
you're leaving me #

518
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,833
# I've just been
cutting onions #

519
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,504
# I'm making a lasagna #

520
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,072
# For one #

521
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,085
# Oh, I'm not crying #

522
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,746
# No #

523
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,652
# There's just a little bit
of dust in my eye #

524
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,486
# Dust from the path
that you made #

525
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,389
# When you said
your goodbye #

526
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,395
# I'm not weeping because you
won't be here to hold my hand #

527
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,896
# For your information #

528
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,422
# There's an inflammation
in my tear gland #

529
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,595
# I'm not upset because
you left me this way #

530
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,797
# My eyes are just
a little sweaty today #

531
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,830
# They've been
looking around a lot #

532
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,341
# Searching for you #

533
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,104
# They've been
looking for you #

534
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,578
# Even though
I told them not to #

535
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,672
# These aren't
tears of sadness #

536
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,239
# They're tears of joy #

537
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,978
# I'm just laughing #

538
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,747
- # Ha #
- # Ha #

539
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,084
- # Ha #
- # Ha #

540
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,816
# Ha #

541
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,422
# I'm sitting
at this table called love #

542
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,161
# Staring down
at the irony of life #

543
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,432
# How come we've reached
this fork in the road #

544
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,133
# And yet it cuts
like a knife? #

545
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,414
# I'm not crying #

546
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:32,355
# I'm not
cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-ing #

547
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,065
- # Yeah #
- # No. #

548
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,572
Me and Sally
had to break up.

549
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

550
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,556
It wasn't working.

551
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,957
I can see why you broke with her.
She was hard work.

552
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,460
Oh no, she broke up with me.

553
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,087
Yeah.

554
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,155
She broke up with me too.

555
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,758
That's what I mean... it was hard work
staying together with her

556
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,032
- wanting to break up all the time.
- Oh, okay.

557
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,199
Didn't you break up and then get back
together for a while?

558
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,904
Mm, yeah. Well, for like,
six or seven weeks.

559
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,970
And then, you know...
boring.

560
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,345
How did you do that?

561
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,849
- Do what?
- Get back together.

562
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,681
Oh, it just happened.

563
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,482
Mmm, where?

564
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,853
Um, at her place.

565
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,017
I cooked dinner,
you know.

566
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,890
Mmm.

567
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,296
What did you cook?

568
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,026
Are you trying to get
back together with Sally?

569
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,125
No. Just making chitchat.

570
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,227
Oh, okay.
Macaroni.

571
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,795
Yeah.

572
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,371
# Can't we just
talk to the humans? #

573
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,936
# A little understanding
could make things better #

574
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,917
# Can't we talk to the humans
and work together now? #

575
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,114
- # No, because they are dead #
- # Binary solo #

576
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,179
# 0000001 #

577
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,123
# 00000011 #

578
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,716
# 000000111 #

579
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,751
- # 0000001111 #
- # Oh #

580
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,660
- # 0000001 #
- # Oh oh #

581
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,164
- # 00000011 #
- # Oh oh #

582
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,429
- # 000000111 #
- # Come on, sucker #

583
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,732
- # Lick my battery #
- # Boogie #

584
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,101
- # Boogie #
- # Robo-boogie #

585
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,301
# Boogie, robo-boogie #

586
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,808
# The humans are dead #

587
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,367
# Once again without emotion #

588
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,708
# The humans are #

589
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,613
# Dead-dead-dead-dead-dead... #
