That is the best porn name
I've ever heard' man.

649
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,564
I can have a porn name?

650
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:11,965

- Okay.

651

- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

- I'll get them.
- Whoa.

655

MIRl: We never made a Star Sex 1.

656
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:24,686
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.

- Cocunt.
- What's that?

658
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,325

So Delaney tells us
you have a special talent of some sort.

661
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,526
I don't know if I'd call it a special talent,

662
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:40,048
but it's a little something I picked up
doing bachelor parties.

663
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,167
It would probably be easier
if I just showed you.

664
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,488
- Great.
- The floor is yours.

665
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:03,490
So a movie, huh? That could be fun.

Holy fuck.

669
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:29,333
WelI' fuck you' okay? You try to think
of a good sci-fi porno title. It's hard.

670
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:32,372

thought of that would say it all'

See' we figured this opens us up
to an even bigger sales market

676
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:49,015
beyond the people we went
to school with.

677
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,855
People who like comics and sci-fi.

678
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,695
Comics? Like "Ziggy"?

679
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:55,895
"Ziggy"? Is that even in fucking papers
anymore? No, man.

680
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:58,897
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic'
right next to "Family Circus. "

681
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:01,535
No, like Spider-Man and shit,
you know?

682
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:04,937
There's always a shitload of Star Wars
nerds at those comic-book shows.

So we sell them a Princess Leia
they can really fucking jerk off to.

- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?

00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,743
I thought you said
this was boys on girls.

688
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,499
If I have to fuck a guy' okay,
but I'd rather fuck a girl.

What's wrong with you, boy?

00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,699
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.

My wife will kill me.

Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.

695
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:41,340
On the other hand, fuck my wife.

696
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:44,661
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over
does not have any sex in the movie

697
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:49,421
but the droids do,
I- CUP and R2-T-Bag.

And Stacey over here
is gonna play Darth Vibrator.

700
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:59,022
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.

701
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,382
I know that
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

702
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:04,942
In our movie,
Darth Vibrator is a bad girl

703
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:06,543
who wants to fuck the galaxy,

704
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:10,903
literally' and it's up to Lubed and Hung
to stop her with their cocks.

705
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:13,023
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.

706
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,705
- Cool.
- I know. Isn't that awesome?

707
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:19,383
Hold up, hold up. So who's all having
sex with who in this movie?

708
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,544
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

709
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:26,546
What? Han Solo ain't never had no sex
with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.

710
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:29,065
ZACK: Guys' this isn't
a literal adaptation here.

711
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,225
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.

712
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,826
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.

713
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,867
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

714
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:43,267
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

715
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,066
Uh, no, because
they're brother and sister,

716
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,787
and according to Miri'
brothers and sisters can't fuck.

717
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:52,268
But you said,
that this wasn't a literal translation,

718
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:56,189
so that means Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

719
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,309
Because I would love to fucking eat
her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

720
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,789
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

721
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,669
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine- Wait, what?

722
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,790
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having
sex with more than one person

723
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,629
in this movie all of a sudden,

724
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:16,191
so I think it's' you know'
not fair if I'm only fucking you.

725
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,712
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

726
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,751
Look, Miri,

727
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:25,191
we got plenty of sex going on in this
thing, you don't have to do that.

728
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:28,791
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with
way worse-looking guys than Lester.

729
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:31,512
I just wanna do my part for the movie
like everyone else.

730
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:34,672
You're having sex in the movie,
you don't need to fuck someone else.

731
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:37,773
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.

732
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:40,873
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

733
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,234
Fair for-? I don't- What?
Fair for who?

734
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:45,674
What are these,
blood diamonds we're talking about?

735
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:49,114
Fair for everyone else
who is fucking more than one person,

736
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,114
a. k. a. you' in the movie.

737
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:54,315
- I mean, fine-
- All right. I mean, if you don't care-

738
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:57,275
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.

739
00:41:57,276 --> 00:42:00,315
Like you said, you know,
you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.

740
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:04,715
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in outer space?

741
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:06,635
Maybe not bigger idiots.

- Nothing.

764
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:25,091

how insane and amazing this is

765

- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know. It's just a porno.

You've really come into your own.

what it'd be like to sleep with me
for a while now.

I started hanging out with you?

I knew it. Here, help.

Let's just promise that it's not gonna
change anything between us, okay?

- Like what?
- I don't know.

Some guys
can't keep sex in perspective.

777
00:45:04,095 --> 00:45:06,855
If anyone's gotta keep this
in perspective, it's you, okay?

778
00:45:06,856 --> 00:45:09,854
I don't want you getting all mushy
and gooey on me

you've ever had.

Oh' like you know what you're doing
down there at all.

I actually don't. Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?

782
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:20,576
Just, you know,

- Wait.
- Stop. Stop.

- No, no, no.

01:18:47,352 --> 01:18:48,511
What do you mean?

1288
01:18:48,512 --> 01:18:52,592
I mean, what does paintbalI
got to do with hockey?

1289
01:18:52,872 --> 01:18:54,631
Nothing, I guess.

1290
01:18:54,632 --> 01:18:57,312
- So ain't no prizes or-?
- No, no.

1291
01:18:57,313 --> 01:18:59,352
So, what are they paying $5 for?

1292
01:18:59,353 --> 01:19:02,833
To shoot a Broad Street Bully
in the balls.

1293
01:19:03,832 --> 01:19:06,153
White people are fucked up.

1294
01:19:06,473 --> 01:19:07,913
Yup' they sure are.

1295
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:10,873
It's a living. You've been getting
the checks I've been sending?

1296
01:19:10,874 --> 01:19:13,434
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1297
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:17,675
Probably didn't save you from a
brutaI tongue-lashing, though, huh?

1298
01:19:17,676 --> 01:19:21,116
You know, the wife
never found out about the camera,

1299
01:19:21,117 --> 01:19:22,954
because I paid off the bills.

1300
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:24,915
How did you manage that?

1301
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:28,675
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.

1302
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:31,836
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large' son.

1303
01:19:31,837 --> 01:19:35,796
- Nice, man. Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.

1304
01:19:35,797 --> 01:19:37,676
I thought
you made that whole thing up.

1305
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:39,037
No, no. It was very real.

1306
01:19:39,038 --> 01:19:41,277
You can believe it.

1307
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:43,998
Even though she's spending all of it.

1308
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:51,598
WelI' since you ain't gonna ask me,
I'll just go ahead and tell you.

1309
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:55,318
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

1310
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:58,397
Oh' I suppose you weren't gonna ask
about your movie, neither?

1311
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:01,759
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.

1312
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,519
- I'm not interested. Sorry.
- You'd better get interested

1313
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,600
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?

1314
01:20:07,601 --> 01:20:10,519
The story doesn't make sense.

1315
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,161
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.

1316
01:20:13,162 --> 01:20:15,841
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?

1317
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:19,040
It's a movie, dog,
and a movie's gotta have an ending,

1318
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:20,762
which we don't have at the moment.

1319
01:20:20,763 --> 01:20:23,681
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.

1320
01:20:23,682 --> 01:20:25,481
Do me this favor, okay?

1321
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:28,201
When you're done
getting your nuts blown off'

1322
01:20:28,202 --> 01:20:32,922
come back to humble Monroeville
to my crib for a couple hours'

1323
01:20:32,923 --> 01:20:36,724
check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

1324
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:38,484
No.

1325
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:41,923
I'll tell you what, you do that,
you don't owe me shit no more.

1326
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:44,164
- Really?
- Really.

1327
01:20:44,165 --> 01:20:46,804
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

1328
01:20:47,365 --> 01:20:51,844
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?

1329
01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:04,565
Hey, honey.

1330
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:07,527
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?

1331
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,286
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.

1332
01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:11,807
You already left one white boy
down in my basement

1333
01:21:11,808 --> 01:21:14,726
while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker

1334
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:18,087
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.

1335
01:21:18,088 --> 01:21:20,967
Oh' what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1336
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:24,087
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE: White boys love me.

1337
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,569
White boy.

1338
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:28,649
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

1339
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,490
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

1340
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,328
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

1341
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:34,408
Yeah.

1342
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,209
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.

1343
01:21:40,244 --> 01:21:41,810
It's just through this hallway.

1344
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:44,249
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1345
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,851
What the fuck you looking at?

1346
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:50,410
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

1347
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:51,851
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

1348
01:21:51,852 --> 01:21:53,931
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

1349
01:21:53,932 --> 01:21:57,851
WelI' why don't he direct my ass to a
new husband? How about that shit?

1350
01:21:57,852 --> 01:22:00,333
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY: Keep talking, maybe he will.

1351
01:22:00,334 --> 01:22:02,451
Oh' don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls!

1352
01:22:02,452 --> 01:22:05,573
Saggy balls? Look at these
sagging-ass titties you got around here.

1353
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:08,572
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.

1354
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:13,414
Oh' shit.

1355
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,134
Where's my paintball gun at?

1356
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:18,894
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.

1357
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:23,294
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered"
to me again.

1358
01:22:24,175 --> 01:22:27,974
Roll the film for the man, please,
so we can see what he thinks.

1359
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:31,496
Just jump through it. I ain't
got all night. The bitch is on me.

1360
01:22:32,335 --> 01:22:35,176
"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.

1361
01:22:35,177 --> 01:22:37,696
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

1362
01:22:37,697 --> 01:22:40,416
Plus' it sounds like an underground
gay fuck club.

1363
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:42,216
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.

1364
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:46,577
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

1365
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,777
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

1366
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:52,257
And then this boring bullshit.

1367
01:22:56,658 --> 01:23:00,377
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene,
would you?

1368
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,377
Uh...

1369
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:05,579
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

1370
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,899
We never shot it.

1371
01:23:08,019 --> 01:23:10,578
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,

1372
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:13,539
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

1373
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,860
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

1374
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:21,780
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.

1375
01:23:21,781 --> 01:23:23,300
Just you.

1376
01:23:24,342 --> 01:23:28,020
Now, I wonder why she did that.

1377
01:23:28,021 --> 01:23:30,701
- Hm.
- Hm.

1378
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,782
You see, there was a time when I was
just a bitter old fuck making coffees,

1379
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:37,822
and Stacey was just a lap dancer

1380
01:23:37,823 --> 01:23:39,903
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other

1381
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,222
and this fooI here,
hell, I don't even know what he was.

1382
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:46,343
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.

1383
01:23:46,344 --> 01:23:48,263
Then two people come along

1384
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:51,504
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

1385
01:23:51,505 --> 01:23:56,464
A world of possibilities
where plain old people just like us

1386
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:58,750
could do something speciaI.

1387
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:02,865
Even if it's something as simple
as filming people fucking.

1388
01:24:12,787 --> 01:24:16,106
Sometimes we just need someone

1389
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:20,427
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves

1390
01:24:22,468 --> 01:24:25,266
and then we're changed forever.

1391
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:39,149
So as you can see'
our movie ain't got no ending.

1392
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:42,630
Every movie needs an ending'
don't it?

1393
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,151
Peace.

1394
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:54,111
Delaney,
you're a slick cupid motherfucker.

1395
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:56,070
Ain't love grand?

1396
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:59,151
WIFE: Why the fuck is this white boy
running through my goddamn house?

1397
01:24:59,152 --> 01:25:00,311
[DOOR SLAMS]

1398
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:02,431
Sometimes.

1399
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:16,434
Miri.

1400
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:19,433
- Miri.
MIRl: Zack?

1401
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,633
ZACK: Miri. I'm sorry.
MIRl: Get out.

1402
01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:23,233
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

1403
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:26,474
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.

1404
01:25:26,475 --> 01:25:31,114
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

1405
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:33,314
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

1406
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:37,875
We talked about you, and us
and how things were different

1407
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:40,916
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy

1408
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:43,876
to just tell you how I felt about you.

1409
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:48,436
And I know- I know that that's only
because of all the stupid shit we said

1410
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:53,998
about how we wouldn't let sex
change us, but it did. It changed me.

1411
01:25:54,277 --> 01:25:56,917
That has to be love, right?

1412
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:59,565
It has to be love

1413
01:25:59,598 --> 01:26:04,038
and just so you know, I can't go back
to being just friends anymore,

1414
01:26:04,839 --> 01:26:06,758
- because I just can't.
- Good.

1415
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:09,118
And I think-

1416
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,960
I think that you feel the same way.

1417
01:26:12,278 --> 01:26:17,480
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester.

1418
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:22,600
What's up, Zack?

1419
01:26:32,081 --> 01:26:33,241
You know what?

1420
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:36,000
I don't care that you're fucking
Lester, okay? How's that?

1421
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:38,761
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.

1422
01:26:38,762 --> 01:26:43,521
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life

1423
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:47,163
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

1424
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:50,563
And I would rather die
than be without you, Miriam Linky.

1425
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:52,603
Miri's last name is Linky?

1426
01:26:52,924 --> 01:26:55,562
You're gonna fuck a guy
who doesn't know your last name?

1427
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:58,443
Or that you beat up Carl Roth
in the sixth grade? I know that.

1428
01:26:58,444 --> 01:27:01,404
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like had we gone

1429
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:04,364
but we decided not to,
and we got drunk alone instead.

1430
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:06,444
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

1431
01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:07,724
We're not fucking' Zack.

1432
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:09,724
Or that you're not fucking Zack-
What?

1433
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,884
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

1434
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:14,925
I even tried to talk her into giving me
the fucking Dutch rudder.

1435
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:17,047
Shot me down on that too.

1436
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:20,686
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?

1437
01:27:20,687 --> 01:27:22,286
All right, you grab your dick,

1438
01:27:22,287 --> 01:27:24,406
then you have someone else
work your arm.

1439
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:25,807
Here, let me show you.

1440
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:29,007
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing
my dick, you're grabbing my arm.

1441
01:27:29,008 --> 01:27:32,207
Now work it. Work my arm.
See that shit? Work it up and down.

1442
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:34,328
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

1443
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:35,452
Okay.

1444
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:37,208
There's the double Dutch rudder,

1445
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:39,567
which' I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

1446
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:42,207
you work my arm, I work your arm'
same time.

1447
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:44,648
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

1448
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:47,209
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

1449
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:50,168
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.

1450
01:27:50,169 --> 01:27:53,130
It feels good, sir. Try me, come on.

1451
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:55,769
Sorry to change the subject on you,
Lester,

1452
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:01,370
but if you're not fucking Miri,
why is your dick out right now?

1453
01:28:01,371 --> 01:28:04,772
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

1454
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,450
- What?
- When you moved out,

1455
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:10,092
she couldn't afford to pay her rent
by herself, so I moved in to help.

1456
01:28:10,093 --> 01:28:12,051
But you just came out of her room.

1457
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,292
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

1458
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:17,011
Wait, wait, wait. She changed rooms?

1459
01:28:17,012 --> 01:28:20,692
Yeah, she said she did it because she
missed the smell of you or some shit.

1460
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:22,134
[SNIFFS]

1461
01:28:22,773 --> 01:28:24,612
I don't smell anything.

1462
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:27,894
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.

1463
01:28:29,174 --> 01:28:32,574
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

1464
01:28:36,214 --> 01:28:37,775
Do you?

1465
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:41,735
Then why are you crying?

1466
01:28:42,054 --> 01:28:44,896
Because I missed you so much.

1467
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:47,255
ZACK:
Me too.

1468
01:28:47,976 --> 01:28:50,416
I love you.

1469
01:28:53,857 --> 01:28:55,736
- I love you, I love you.
ZACK: I love you.

1470
01:28:55,737 --> 01:28:57,336
I don't mean to alarm you

1471
01:28:57,337 --> 01:29:00,216
but I think I just jerked off Lester
a little bit.

1472
01:29:00,777 --> 01:29:03,177
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

1473
01:29:03,178 --> 01:29:06,577
If you ask me nicely, I will
Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.

1474
01:29:06,578 --> 01:29:09,978
Good. I'm getting tired
of fucking the Fleshlight.

1475
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:11,457
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

1476
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:14,378
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.

1477
01:29:14,459 --> 01:29:18,739
LESTER: Wrong room.
- Oh, God. That's gross.

1478
01:29:19,419 --> 01:29:22,459
Let us fuck.
