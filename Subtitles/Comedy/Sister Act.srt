1
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,895
Who can name all the apostles?

2
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,814
Yes, Deloris?

3
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,525
John, Paul, George,

4
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,653
and Ringo.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:35,286
Deloris Wilson, you are the most unruly,
disobedient girl in this school.

6
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,372
Now, I want you to march right up
to that blackboard

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,461
and write the names
of all the apostles alphabetically.

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,896
This is enough!

9
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:06,442
You are hopeless
and I wash my hands of you.

10
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,235
Mark my words, Deloris.

11
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,656
If you continue on this disruptive track,
it will lead straight to the devil.

12
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:17,078
Have you any idea
what girls like you become?

13
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,038
All right, wrap this up, okay?
Wrap it up.

14
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,912
Go!

15
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,640
Goodnight, ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,851
You don't give a shit!
Let's get the hell out of here.

17
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,410
So I guess eating
is out of the question, huh?

18
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,870
Your next show is in 20 minutes.

19
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,081
You still haven't told me what she said.

20
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,959
What who said?

21
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,796
"What who said." The one with
the moustache. The one you're married to.

22
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:01,677
- You are so damn hot.
- And you are so full of it.

23
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:06,390
You didn't tell her, did you? I knew it.
I knew you weren't gonna tell her. I knew it.

24
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,521
I want us to be together, babe.

25
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,442
I want us to be an honest
and decent couple.

26
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,985
I do.

27
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,070
I went to confession today.

28
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,866
You went to confession?
Like "confession" confession?

29
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,037
You know, where you kneel in the box,
you tell the priest your deepest secrets.

30
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,164
I did that today for us, babe.

31
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:34,585
I told Father Antonelli I was in love
and that it was a special love.

32
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,713
A love for all the ages
and that I want to be with her.

33
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,007
And what did he say?

34
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,510
He said that f I got divorced,
I'd burn in hell for all eternity.

35
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,931
- Hand me my loafers, darling.
- No, you can get your own damn shoes.

36
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,935
So, what does this mean?
Is this no? Does this mean no?

37
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,522
- What does it mean?
- No, not no. Just not now!

38
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,984
Just get out, okay? Just go.

39
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,322
You want me to go against a priest?

40
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,493
Get excommunicated?

41
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,998
Okay.

42
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,252
I'll eat the thing you made.

43
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,923
- Is that what this is about?
- No, that's not what it's about.

44
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,676
It's about you leaving.
Good night. Good night.

45
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,890
I'll call.

46
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,946
You're quitting just because
he won't leave his wife?

47
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,115
No, not just because
he won't leave his wife.

48
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,159
I'm quitting for a lot of reasons.
It's something I have to do.

49
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,620
- What's gonna happen to the act?
- What do you mean?

50
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,081
You're gonna get somebody else.
It's not a big loss.

51
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,499
You put everything together.

52
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,252
You pick all the music,
you tell us where to stand and everything.

53
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,131
Yeah, yeah, I'm a real genius.
That's why we're packing them in.

54
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,842
And don't you pack any more
of my makeup in that bag.

55
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,261
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

56
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,887
What do you want'?

57
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,265
And don't you ever knock?

58
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,977
Hey, girl, you ain't got nothing
that I haven't seen before, all right?

59
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,312
Yeah, well, stop trying to memorise it.

60
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,398
- Hey, Michelle.
- Oh, please.

61
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,692
Hey, Deloris, here, This is from Vince.

62
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,194
Hope it's his dead body.

63
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,488
- With love.
- Oh, really?

64
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,699
- Yeah.
- Then why didn't he bring it to me himself?

65
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,993
Oh, he wanted to,
but he's got a big meeting upstairs.

66
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,412
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi.

67
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,414
Could you say goodnight
to these clowns, please?

68
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,125
I'm getting a headache.
I don't want them in here. Get out.

69
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,919
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm going.

70
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,672
Take it easy.

71
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,927
Well, at least you got something
out of all this.

72
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,096
- Come on, Deloris, open this up.
- Yes.

73
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,475
Why should I open this? I don't give
a damn what's in that box. I don't care.

74
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,018
- See what he bought.
- I wanna see.

75
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,437
- Why? Why?
- I wanna see.

76
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,523
Fine, okay?
Let's look and see what it is, then.

77
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,277
- Oh, look at this. It's mink.
- Oh, check it out.

78
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,821
It's purple mink, Deloris.

79
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,075
Oh, that's beautiful. Look. Feel.

80
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,543
Well, obviously,
Mr. LaRocca feels he can win me back

81
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,258
by sending me this absolutely
fabulous coat.

82
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,677
- Put it on!
- It's beautiful.

83
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,473
See, some girls would fall for that,
but not me.

84
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,352
I think I'm gonna make him wait a little
while before I just let him know that I...

85
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,479
What?

86
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,861
Connie LaRocca.

87
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,198
It's his wife's coat.

88
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,701
The man gave me his wife's coat.

89
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,162
Oh, I don't believe this.

90
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,041
Put it back on.
It's yours now. You deserve it.

91
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,586
No, I don't deserve it.
I haven't earned it.

92
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:09,508
You don't earn other people's
wives' fur coats, okay?

93
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,053
I think it's time to just go upstairs
and give it back to him

94
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,764
and get the hell out of this dump.

95
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,270
How long you been with me, Ernie?

96
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,898
Three years, Mr. LaRocca.

97
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,651
Two as a croupier,
one as your personal limo driver.

98
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,947
Ernie, you know what's important to me?
What counts?

99
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,618
Loyalty, my man.
Loyalty is what counts to me.

100
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:41,540
- I've been very loyal, Mr. LaRocca.
- Gee, Ernie, that's not what I hear.

101
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,750
I hear you went down
to the police station last night

102
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,877
and talked with Lieutenant Souther.

103
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,548
I hear you were there
for over three hours.

104
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,051
I went.

105
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,387
I went, but I didn't tell him anything.

106
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,472
Again not what I heard.

107
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,854
Goodbye, Vince.
I'm leaving and don't try to stop me.

108
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,023
I'm going to L.A.
where it's nice and warm.

109
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:10,527
People don't need fur coats
from their boyfriends' wives' closet.

110
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:15,240
Goodbye, Vince. I'm going to Miami
where the sun shines.

111
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,994
I know they're trying
to get something on me, Ernie,

112
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,455
but so far
they've come up with bubkas.

113
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,794
They called Willy and Joey in there,
but they were out in 20 minutes.

114
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,297
What were you doing there
for three hours, Ernie?

115
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,510
I know you don't think I have any talent,
Vince, but I do.

116
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,347
And I'm gonna leave you
and I'm going to Chicago.

117
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,308
Tell me what you told Souther.

118
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,312
I won't be able to sleep tonight
if I don't know.

119
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,314
I've always wanted to go to New York.

120
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,233
I know if I went to New York,
I could get some things together, Vince.

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,028
I could. I could.

122
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,322
I could.

123
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,203
That's all I told them, I swear it.

124
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,998
Thanks, Ernie. Now I can sleep.

125
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,958
Say goodnight, Ernie.

126
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,503
No, no, no, that's--

127
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,470
Babe.

128
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:24,142
Deloris. Deloris. ls there a problem?

129
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,144
With the coat?

130
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,565
With the--? No, not with the coat.
The coat's fine.

131
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,029
It's fine. It's fine, thank you.

132
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,532
Is that why you came here tonight?
To thank me?

133
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,951
Yeah. Thank you.

134
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,872
And to say you're sorry.

135
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,875
About tonight and the things you said.

136
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,587
Forgotten. Completely.
You understand me?

137
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,381
Forgotten.

138
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,300
Of course. Of course, it's forgotten.

139
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,804
That's my girl. My girl in mink.

140
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,765
- Will you be home soon?
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,269
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

142
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,482
Hey, Vince, is she okay?

143
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:16,528
I don't know, Vince.
She seemed kind of upset.

144
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,988
- She did?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,159
Bring her back now for a talk.

146
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,618
And if she runs, then what?

147
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,788
Take care of it.

148
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,377
Deloris!

149
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,182
Deloris, Vinny wants to talk!

150
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,650
- Which way?
- That way.

151
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,991
Hey, hey, taxi!

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,247
Hey, hey, hey.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Go, go, go!

153
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,558
And then Vince looks at Ernie
and says, "Say good night."

154
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,727
And then Vince looks at Joey
and Joey shot him.

155
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,231
I mean, he just shot him in the chair
Just boom! He blew this guy away.

156
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,776
Sorry I'm late. I'm Lieutenant Souther.
Eddie Souther.

157
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,486
How do you do?
I'm Deloris Van Cartier.

158
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,823
Listen, this guy was a simple limo driver.
Right? He was a limo driver.

159
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,159
So maybe he made a couple wrong turns
in his life. That's no reason to kill him.

160
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,828
I've never seen anybody killed before.

161
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,706
Sometimes you pass on the freeway,
you see a couple of people dead--

162
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,251
Ms. Van Cartier,
you're Vince LaRocca's girlfriend, right?

163
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,171
Well, you could sort of--
Maybe. It depends how you look at it.

164
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,466
The guy just tried to kill me, so
I don't think that cements our relationship.

165
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,344
Well, you realise
he's a major underworld figure, don't you?

166
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,930
He's into drug-dealing,
money-laundering.

167
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,017
We've been investigating Mr. LaRocca
for the last 18 months.

168
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,353
We've got video tapes,
we've got surveillance photos.

169
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,064
Am I in any of those videos?

170
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:03,236
No, no, no. Criminal activity.
The tapes aren't enough to convict him.

171
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,864
Apparently there's a lot
you don't know about Vince.

172
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,326
I mean, the last two people that saw him
in action kind of disappeared.

173
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,536
What do you mean,
"kind of disappeared"?

174
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,039
Well, we found a piece here
and a piece there.

175
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,334
But don't you worry.
Here, have a cup of coffee.

176
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,963
You're safe now and we're gonna see
that you stay that way. That's our job.

177
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,257
If you help us, we can help you.

178
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,426
If you testify against Vince
about what you saw,

179
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,470
we can put him away
for the rest of his life.

180
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,349
Are you crazy? You're telling me this guy's
a mad criminal and you want me to testify?

181
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,767
Do you know what's gonna happen?

182
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,269
- He'll track me down and kill me.
- Can I call you Deloris?

183
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,229
Call me anything
as long as you keep me alive.

184
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,565
We wouldn't put you at risk
if we couldn't protect you.

185
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,609
- Right.
- It'll only take a couple of months

186
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,319
to get a court date.

187
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,072
Just a couple of months?
Only a couple--?

188
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,074
Why not a year?
How about a couple of decades?

189
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,576
Two months. We hide you out,
then you testify.

190
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,828
No, no, no.

191
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,247
It's just for a little while.
Then you can come back.

192
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,666
Really? What are you gonna do?

193
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,543
Are you gonna stick me in a bag
and bury me? Forget it!

194
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,671
If you testify,

195
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:08,218
I'm gonna put you in the last place on earth
that Vince would ever look for you.

196
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,905
- Nice church, huh?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

197
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,450
Look, what am I gonna be,
Quasimodo in the bat belfry? What is this?

198
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,079
- I want you to stay here for a while.
- Where?

199
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,332
In the convent.
It's the safest place in the world.

200
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,543
You think Vince is gonna look for you
in a convent?

201
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,461
- In the what?
- The convent.

202
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,381
You must be out your-- I'm gonna go back
and work this out with Vince.

203
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,551
You're a lunatic. Put me in a damn
convent with these people.

204
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,262
These people don't even have sex!

205
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,267
Deloris, Vince has a contract
out on you for 100 grand.

206
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,270
You've seen what he can do.
That one bullet, that's all it's gonna take.

207
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,313
Look, let me explain something to you.

208
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,483
Vince knows people all over the place.
You realise that?

209
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,528
- He'll be looking for me everywhere.
- Everywhere but this convent!

210
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,156
- Oh, come on.
- Nobody knows you're here but me.

211
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,284
We're trying to get you a quick court date.
One month, two months tops.

212
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,328
I promise I'm gonna spring you
as fast as I can.

213
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,290
What am I gonna do here?
I'm gonna go crazy here.

214
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,876
There's nothing here but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns.

215
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,127
What am I gonna do here?

216
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,755
Pray.

217
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,631
Pray?

218
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,509
Yes, but, monsignor,
we are a small convent.

219
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,553
Surely there are more
appropriate places.

220
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,432
We can save this young woman's life
and imprison a parasite, all in one gesture.

221
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,267
My heart goes out to her, of course.

222
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,812
My concern would be
she might subject the convent to danger.

223
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,066
The Reno Police Department assures me
you'll be protected from any harm.

224
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,818
They've promised
to make a generous financial donation.

225
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,780
And as you know,
your small convent is in danger of closing.

226
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:57,827
Well, if they can afford
to be so generous, so can we.

227
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,338
Excuse me.

228
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,675
Absolutely not. I couldn't possibly!

229
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,554
Think of it this way, reverend mother.
She's an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

230
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,139
That is not a person you can hide.

231
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,017
That is a conspicuous person
designed to stick out.

232
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:26,022
You have taken a vow of hospitality
to all in need.

233
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,983
I lied.

234
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,700
Lieutenant Souther,
everything is in order.

235
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,621
No, no, no, everything is not in order.
This woman does not like me.

236
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,790
Deloris, these are holy people.
They like everybody.

237
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,585
- This woman doesn't like me!
- One month, two months, tops.

238
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,462
No, forget it. I'm not staying here!

239
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,632
- Behave yourself.
- I'm not gonna stay here!

240
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,608
What is your name?

241
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,652
Deloris Van Cartier.

242
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,821
Is that your real name?

243
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,906
Yes. I happen to be a singer.

244
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,202
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

245
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,788
Look, before we get started,

246
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,708
I just want to say that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

247
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,960
I know it must be
a huge inconvenience for you.

248
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,214
Yeah, so I just wanted
to say thank you upfront.

249
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,220
I also have always--

250
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,183
And I've said this to people.
I've always admired you people.

251
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,018
Nuns, I mean. You know.

252
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:49,272
You're so Catholic. You know?

253
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:53,985
I mean, look, you're married to the big JC.
I mean, you're his old lady, you know?

254
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,112
It's an amazing thing to me.

255
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,739
I mean, of course you must be saying,

256
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,117
"Well, it's much better than being
hooked up with some kind of two-timing--"

257
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,078
Please, do not smoke in here.

258
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,665
Oh, sorry, sorry. You know,
I get so nervous, I get worked up

259
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,793
I just have-- I don't know. I'm sorry.

260
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,381
Look, Ms. Van Cartier, we have agreed
to conceal and protect you,

261
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,384
which we will do
to the best of our ability.

262
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,887
However it is essential
that you understand

263
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,349
that you are not in a sorority
or a speakeasy.

264
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,311
This is a convent. A religious order.

265
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,022
And there are certain rules
you must obey.

266
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,360
Saint Katherine's is a place
to commune and to pray.

267
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:39,989
And I will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion.

268
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,158
Do you understand?

269
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,827
- Yes.
- Good.

270
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,372
But do you understand
I'm the victim here?

271
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,040
Do you understand I'm the good guy?

272
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,961
I mean, they just kind of threw me
in here with you nuns.

273
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,505
I mean, do you get that?
I'm the good guy.

274
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,882
I mean,
I saw a guy get his face blown off!

275
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,636
So why don't you just give me the key
to my room? I'll lay low.

276
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,805
You stay out of my face,
I'll stay out of your face.

277
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,349
And I will commune my little black ass
in that room.

278
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,518
Can you handle that?

279
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,481
- I think it's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

280
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:18,778
Well, it's almost lunchtime.
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up.

281
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,781
And you'll certainly want to change.

282
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,575
Hope you don't think
I'll wear what I wore in Catholic school.

283
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,078
No, siree.
No ugly green jumpers for me.

284
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,122
And those stupid clunky shoes.

285
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,542
Oh, this gold thing,
could you have it dry-cleaned for me?

286
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:37,213
Open the cabinet to your left.
You will find suitable attire.

287
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,090
Oh, cool.

288
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,560
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

289
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,397
This is fine for covering a little bulge,
but now I've got holster hips.

290
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,524
People wish to kill you.

291
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,484
Anyone who's met you, I imagine.

292
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,405
A disguise is necessary
to protect us all.

293
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,866
While you are here,
you will conduct yourself as a nun.

294
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,535
Only I will know
who and what you truly are.

295
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,246
You will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever.

296
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,207
But look at me! I'm a nun!
I'm a penguin!

297
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:17,712
As from now and until you leave,
you are Sister Mary Clarence.

298
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,888
Mary Clarence like Clarence Williams Ill
from The Mod Squad?

299
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,474
Mary is in deference to our Holy Mother.

300
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,144
The Clarence is in honour
of Saint Clarence of Concordia.

301
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,063
There are three vows
every nun must accept.

302
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,108
The vow of poverty, the vow of obedience,
and the vow of chastity.

303
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,652
I am out of here with that.

304
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,321
Oh, man.

305
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,578
Good afternoon, sisters.
I apologise for my tardiness.

306
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:56,292
I would like you to welcome a new member
to our house. Sister Mary Clarence.

307
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:04,550
Mary Clarence comes to us
from a somewhat progressive convent.

308
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,596
However she's eager
to embrace a more disciplined life

309
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,225
and I am sure will make every effort
to conform to our ways.

310
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,851
I'll do my best.

311
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,896
- Would you like to be seated?
- Thank you.

312
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,579
Yes, Mary Patrick?

313
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,208
Reverend mother, on behalf of
all of the sisters here at Saint Katherine's,

314
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,963
I'd like to offer a great, big "hi there
and hello" to Sister Mary Clarence. Hi.

315
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,381
And as part of the welcome,

316
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,218
I thought that maybe our new sister
could offer today's blessing.

317
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,555
That is very thoughtful of you,
Mary Patrick, but I really--

318
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,850
Oh, yeah, yeah, I could do that. Sure.

319
00:23:56,227 --> 00:24:01,357
Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive.

320
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:10,158
And, yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of no food,

321
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,744
I will fear no hunger.

322
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,291
We want you to give us this day
our daily bread

323
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:23,463
and to the republic for which it stands
and by the power invested in me,

324
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,884
I pronounce us ready to eat. Amen.

325
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,427
Amen.

326
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,554
Be seated.

327
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,566
Thank you.

328
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,587
What are you people?
This stuff is terrible! It tastes like sh--

329
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,549
Sisters, we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence.

330
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,343
Why?

331
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,348
Only when our lips are silent
may our prayers truly be answered.

332
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,266
Then you don't have to eat this food.

333
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:22,563
Silence begins now
and ends at sundown.

334
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,149
How can you eat this stuff? It's terrible.

335
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,071
Mary Clarence,
I think you might enjoy a ritual fast.

336
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,990
A ritual fa--?
No, no, no, I don't think I would.

337
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:37,411
I'll just put a little salt on it. It'll be fine.
Look. Pass me the salt over there.

338
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,500
A fast. To remind you of those
who must endure without food.

339
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:48,422
No, I don't want you to take my plate.

340
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,591
And silence.

341
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,696
How can you let them grill me
for six hours?

342
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,656
I can't control
how long they question you.

343
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,034
- Did you go to law school?
- Yes, I went to law school.

344
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,120
- Did you graduate?
- I'm a lawyer. Of course I graduated!

345
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,622
Hey, Vince.

346
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,667
Nice talking to you. See you in court.

347
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,797
You got nothing on me, Souther.
If you don't stop harassing me, I'm gonna--

348
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,382
What? You're gonna what?

349
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,553
Nothing, nothing, lieutenant.
What my client is trying to say--

350
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,180
Is that he's scared.

351
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:23,976
And you know what?
He should be. Real scared.

352
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,854
See you around, boys.

353
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,653
Something's going on.

354
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,530
He's so damn cocky.

355
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,700
He's bluffing, Vince.
Don't worry about it.

356
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,245
You find Deloris?

357
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:47,083
She's gone. We don't know where she is.
She hasn't been back to her place all day.

358
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,627
He's got Deloris.

359
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,796
We gotta get her back.

360
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,507
Fax her 8-by-10 to every contact we got.

361
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,051
- I can't hear this.
- Deloris Van Cartier.

362
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,679
Quarter of a mil, dead or alive.

363
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,186
This is your cell, Mary Clarence.

364
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,440
- My what?
- Your cell. Your room.

365
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,488
Oh, man.

366
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:21,992
No wonder you waited till now
to spring this on me.

367
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,496
It's like a nightmare.
Where's the rest of the furniture?

368
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:30,918
Our lives are simple. We have little need
for material possessions.

369
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,755
This is out of the Stone Age.
Where's the phone?

370
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,799
Who would you call?

371
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,469
I don't know. Satan?

372
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,972
Your cell is more than adequate.

373
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,350
Fine. What do we do now?
Pray? What?

374
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,769
It's 9:00. Pleasant dreams.

375
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,148
Wait! Are you telling me
we go to bed by 9?

376
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:56,986
If I were you, I would use this time
to think about my life and its direction.

377
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,946
Or lack thereof.

378
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,531
There's nothing wrong with my life.

379
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,950
Before I came here,
I had a career, I had friends.

380
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:06,787
I had clothing that fit.
Before I came here, I was okay.

381
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,289
Oh, really?

382
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:12,793
From what I've heard, your singing career
was almost nonexistent.

383
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,671
And your married lover wants you dead.

384
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,091
If you're fooling anyone,
it is only yourself.

385
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,720
God has brought you here.

386
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,264
Take the hint.

387
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,191
Mary Clarence?

388
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,527
What?

389
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,614
Up and at them.
We don't want to be late.

390
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,949
What time is it?

391
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,743
Well, it's almost 5, Sister Sleepyhead.

392
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,537
Five a.m.?

393
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,332
Get out of here. I just went to bed
20 minutes ago. Scram.

394
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,710
Come on, the sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day.

395
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,259
We are a small congregation
this morning.

396
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:48,597
Too many mornings.
Something has gone terribly wrong.

397
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:54,186
Where is faith? Where is celebration?
Where is everyone?

398
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,481
Still, rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours,

399
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:02,236
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present.

400
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,239
Our choir mistress,
Sister Mary Lazarus,

401
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:08,742
has informed me that our choir,
while always superior,

402
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,205
has been toiling especially hard
on this week's selection.

403
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,832
Sister.

404
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,545
There was a raid on a pawn shop
in L.A. this morning.

405
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,840
Place was fencing stolen property.
They found this.

406
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:51,053
Database hoods.
What a wonderful world, huh?

407
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,348
"Beloved daughter missing.
Reward of $250,000.

408
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:58,310
Please, find our adored angel.
We miss her so. Dead or alive."

409
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,855
Vince is getting desperate.
So where'd you stash her, Eddie?

410
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,482
Where did I stash who?

411
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,901
You're not even gonna tell us?

412
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,737
I wouldn't even tell the pope.

413
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,584
I'm not gonna get this.
This is a little too complicated for me.

414
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,170
Don't you worry, you'll get the hang of it.
I'll help you.

415
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,339
Thank you.

416
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,008
Are you always this cheerful?

417
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:30,759
Am I?

418
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,053
All right, I am. I know it.

419
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,807
I can't help it. I've always been upbeat.
Optimistic, perky.

420
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,602
Even as a child, my mother used to say,
"That girl is pure sunshine.

421
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,230
She'll either grow up to be a nun
or a stewardess."

422
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,190
Coffee?

423
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,279
- Enough about me. What about you?
- Yes, what convent did you come from?

424
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:56,493
I came from the convent

425
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,914
of the Sisters of the Moonlite in Reno.

426
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,125
Oh, I love Reno.

427
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,627
- You do?
- Yes.

428
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:10,382
Well, you would have loved us.
We were a kind of pioneering order.

429
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:16,221
You know, we'd never wear any kind of
habit this tight, though. This is really tight.

430
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,809
Oh, I must say, our habits
do out you at the neck just a bit

431
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,020
Hear, hear!

432
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,147
That's enough jabber.

433
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,983
Vanity. A progressive convent?

434
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,695
Sounds awful.
I liked my convent in Vancouver.

435
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:36,241
Out in the woods. Wasn't all modern
like some of these newfangled convents.

436
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,621
We didn't have electricity.
Cold water, bare feet. Those were nuns.

437
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,414
Sounds wonderful.

438
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,251
It was hell on earth. I loved it.
This place is a Hilton.

439
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,838
Sister Mary Clarence,
when did you get your call?

440
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,257
What call?

441
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,553
Oh, the call, the call!
I didn't know which call you meant.

442
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,556
I was working in Reno
when I got the call.

443
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:04,311
And you don't know how hard it is
to get a call until you've worked in Reno.

444
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,898
We ministered to
a lot of different kinds of people.

445
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,485
Newlyweds, hookers, gamblers.

446
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,655
What a joy. How fulfilling to be able
to get right in there with your hands

447
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,115
and work with the people.

448
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,868
- And Reno. It's probably bursting with sin.
- It was. That's why I had to leave.

449
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:25,332
I mean, we had a hooker living next door
called Buckwheat Bertha who would--

450
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,377
Sister Mary Clarence,
could I have a word with you?

451
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,546
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

452
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,841
Yeah. Excuse me.

453
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,760
Get on with your work.

454
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,304
- Quickly, please.
- I was just talking to them.

455
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:43,100
Precisely. Enough chatter. Chores.

456
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:06,600
Yeah, I need to talk to Eddie Souther.
Yeah, it's an emergency.

457
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,229
- Souther.
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

458
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,897
You gotta get me out of here.

459
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,357
Deloris, you can't call me here.

460
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,525
Somebody's gonna catch on
to where you are.

461
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,195
But I'm going insane here.
All these people do is work and pray.

462
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,821
Work and pray. That's all they do.

463
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,117
Calm down. Look, I didn't want to
tell you this, we got some problems here.

464
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,536
What kind of problems?
What do you mean, problems?

465
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,163
Keeping our witnesses alive.

466
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,833
There's a leak in the department
and some of them end up dead.

467
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,378
- What?!
- Just sit tight.

468
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,922
You don't seem to understand
what I'm saying.

469
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:42,302
I am in a nightmare. This is my nightmare.
It's a nightmare, man. Get me out of here.

470
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:46,515
I mean it. Don't call me.
It's not safe. I'll be in touch.

471
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,268
Hello? Hello?

472
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,870
Yeah?

473
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,257
I brought you something.

474
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,384
My brother gave it to me
when I was a little girl.

475
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,344
I could never seem to get up on time.

476
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,347
I set it for 5.

477
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,686
<i>Out of bed, you daisy head.
Out of bed, you daisy head.</i>

478
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,187
It always made me laugh.

479
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,898
<i>Out of bed, you daisy head.</i>

480
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,278
I thought being away
from your convent

481
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,197
that even someone like you
could get lonely.

482
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,951
Have a seat.

483
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,253
- So which one are you?
- Mary Robert.

484
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,214
You have a little trouble getting up
at 5:00 too, Mary Robert?

485
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:05,886
Oh, not now. I get up a half an hour early
just to make sure.

486
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:10,265
It's not just the mornings.
It's that, all my life,

487
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,393
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things

488
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,896
a second faster or better than me.

489
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,524
Yeah, well, everybody's
playing catch-up nowadays.

490
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:25,405
So, Mary Robert.
Did you always want to be a nun?

491
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:31,161
I always knew that was my calling,
to lead a life of service, but, you see,

492
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,625
I've always felt that there's something
inside me that I want to give.

493
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:41,505
Something that's only me
and nobody else.

494
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:47,636
Does that sound like a terrible thing?
Like pride?

495
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,517
No, doesn't sound
like a terrible thing at all.

496
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,020
I'm so happy that you've come
to join us, Mary Clarence.

497
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:08,281
You know how sometimes it's as if
you have to be yourself or you'll just burst?

498
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,327
Yep, I do.

499
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,749
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mary Robert.

500
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:32,222
<i>Out of bed, you daisy head.
Out of bed, you daisy head.</i>

501
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:12,137
- Hey, wait up.
- Hey.

502
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,414
Nice tattoo.

503
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,089
Hey, sister.

504
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,009
<i>This jukebox got anything on it
from The Sound Of Music?</i>

505
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,240
- Wanna dance, sister?
- Why? You don't have any rhythm.

506
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,289
Young man,
take your foot down off that stool.

507
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,916
Now have a seat. Have a seat.

508
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,422
May I have a Coke, please?

509
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,357
What are you doing in here?

510
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,243
What are you guys doing here?
Look, you have to go. You have to go.

511
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,789
Oh, never mind. Go, go.
Just go that way. Just go that way.

512
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:08,295
Sister, expecting any more
of your friends?

513
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,382
Now, you guys wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

514
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,593
I thought that you might be
ministering to the winos,

515
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,721
the way that you did in your convent
in Reno, and I thought I could help.

516
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,515
And I saw her leave and it was very late,
so I followed.

517
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,642
What are you doing here?

518
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,897
I'm here to see a man
about a car for the convent.

519
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,107
- Really?
<i>'</i> Did you get it?

520
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,861
No, I didn't. And I'm gonna get you
out of here. Come on, come on, come on.

521
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,614
Oh, a jukebox! Oh, one song.

522
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,490
- Do you have a quarter?
- No, no, no.

523
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,368
Come on, he does, all right.
It'll come back to you tenfold. Thanks.

524
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,121
Hurry up. Hurry up.

525
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,084
I love this song.

526
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,215
One dance. I'll be right back.

527
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,094
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,346
- No!
- Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

529
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,849
- Come on. Let's go, go.
- I love this song.

530
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,726
We had a lovely time. We'll be back.

531
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,813
- Yes, we will. Good night.
- Thank you. Bless you.

532
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,859
This turns into a nuns' bar,
I'm out of here.

533
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,781
- I can't breathe.
- Just come on, come on.

534
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,741
Stop the giggling. Let's go.

535
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:22,178
The sisters have made clear to me
that they followed you of their own volition.

536
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,432
But they would never have ventured out
at all at night

537
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,600
had it not been for your example.

538
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,770
Listen, they just don't want to be stuck
behind these walls all the time.

539
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,857
These walls are the only
protection they have.

540
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:39,154
The streets are no longer safe for them.
And they are certainly not safe for you.

541
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,700
These robes no longer protect our sisters.
The walls do.

542
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,077
I'm sorry.

543
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,873
You really do care about them,
don't you?

544
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,333
Yes, I do.

545
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,462
And I care about you and your life.

546
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,632
I shall ask Monsignor O'Hara
and Lieutenant Souther

547
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:03,011
to find a safer and more suitable
situation for you.

548
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,096
Oh, no, come on.
Don't send me away. Really.

549
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,098
I'm just starting to get the hang of this.

550
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:12,645
I mean, look, I'm not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else, I swear.

551
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,815
What about forgiveness?
Isn't that what you preach?

552
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:18,026
There's gotta be something around here
that I can do

553
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,987
that's not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody.

554
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,114
You're right, Mary Clarence.

555
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,410
To err is human, to forgive divine.

556
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,204
You may stay.

557
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:34,209
But I shall restrict your activities
to a single task.

558
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,921
What's that?

559
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,216
Singing. You will join the choir.

560
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,011
Choir? No.

561
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,724
You will sleep and you will sing.
That will be your task until you leave.

562
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:54,979
No. The choir?
I mean, have you heard them?

563
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,233
The choir, Mary Clarence.

564
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,277
Is this the choir rehearsal?

565
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,656
Sure is. Come in and sing a spell.

566
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:09,494
- Soprano or alto?
- Whatever.

567
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,162
Thanks.

568
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,918
- Hi there.
- Hello, sister.

569
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:29,931
<i>Crown him with many crowns</i>

570
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:33,226
<i>The lamb upon his throne</i>

571
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:37,480
<i>All kingdoms of</i> the--

572
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,983
Mary Clarence, are you with us?

573
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,947
I don't know this one.
I'd better sit this one out. Excuse me.

574
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,659
Reverend Mother says Mary Clarence
has a background in music.

575
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:53,496
Really, Mary Clarence?
Were you a choir mistress?

576
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:58,167
- Sort of freelance.
- Freelance? Really?

577
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:06,509
You don't think I see? You think I took
vows yesterday? I know what you're up to.

578
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,555
- You and Reverend Mother.
- What?

579
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:15,393
You're a ringer. She brought you here
to replace me. Out with the old.

580
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,814
Oh, could you help us, Mary Clarence?

581
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,525
Mary Lazarus, you're terrific,
but we could really use some help.

582
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,569
- Please, you've heard us.
- We're terrible.

583
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:28,656
Please, would you do something for us,
please?

584
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:34,287
Well, there's a word for this. Mutiny.

585
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:37,373
So, Mary Clarence,
you think you can do better?

586
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,418
I believe I'd like to see that.

587
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,922
Go ahead, sister. Make them sing.

588
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:14,786
Okay.

589
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,622
Okay.

590
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,083
Where are the basses?

591
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,627
Oh, you should be over here.

592
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,255
And the altos? Where are you?

593
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:31,344
Sister, why don't you join them?
And, sopranos, where are you?

594
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,347
Oh, you've got to come down this way.

595
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,976
All right.

596
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:42,814
Basses, I want you to give me a D.

597
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:46,317
Altos, I want you to do a third above that.
Give me an F sharp.

598
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,779
And sopranos, give me an A.

599
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,573
Let me have Sister Alma
play it one time

600
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,495
so we all know what we're going to do
and we'll go from there.

601
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,498
Sister, will you give me
those notes, please?

602
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:10,883
Okay? On three. One, two, three.

603
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,303
Okay, okay, okay.

604
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,389
Very, very nice.

605
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:19,058
Sister, would you come
over here, please?

606
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:23,187
Just slide right in here for me, please.
Right here.

607
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,107
- That's a powerful instrument you have.
- Thank you.

608
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:31,070
But I think it's probably a good idea
if we bring you down out of the rafters.

609
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,406
I mean, everybody wants
to be close to God.

610
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,950
I'm just not sure you can do it vocally.

611
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:40,413
Okay? So I need you to sing an octave
below where you've been singing.

612
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,748
Okey-dokey.

613
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:45,418
And Sister Mary Robert,
could you come stand over here, please?

614
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,086
Yeah, come on over.

615
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:51,382
I noticed that you're moving your mouth,
but nothing's coming out.

616
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,802
So I'd like to just hear you by yourself,
if you don't mind.

617
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:58,014
Sister Alma,
could you give me an A, please?

618
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,019
Alma.

619
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,897
Check your battery.

620
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,692
Give me an A, please.

621
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,573
Okay. Wait.

622
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,494
Try this. Close your eyes.

623
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,997
Visualise yourself
in a room full of people.

624
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,626
Lots of silverware, people dropping stuff,
talking loud, drunks.

625
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:29,253
Women with trays going,
"What are you gonna have?"

626
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,132
Your voice has to carry over the din.

627
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,177
You have to get up over all of that
to be heard in the back of the room

628
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:40,556
where I'm sitting, listening,
straining to hear you. Okay?

629
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,560
Keep that in your mind when we do this.
Sister.

630
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:57,031
We call that an A with an attitude.

631
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,992
That's what you need.
You have to put attitude in what you sing.

632
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,702
Have to think
about what you're singing.

633
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,581
It's not just quacking. This is rejoicing.

634
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,668
You are singing to the Lord.

635
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,964
Let's review those notes again
and see if we can put it together. Sister.

636
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,345
Basses. Altos, sopranos.

637
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,431
On three. One, two, three.

638
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,940
Oh, we did it.
We actually sang a chord.

639
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:32,400
That was exciting.

640
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:35,278
Yeah, you sang a chord
for two seconds.

641
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:39,073
The next thing you have to learn how to do
is listen to each other.

642
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,117
That's a big key. Big key.

643
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,412
You must listen to each other
if you're going to be a group.

644
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,955
I knew that.

645
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:51,502
Mary Lazarus, as soon as I walked
in the door, I knew that you knew this.

646
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:55,756
Now, you're somebody who's
into hard work and discipline, aren't you?

647
00:52:55,923 --> 00:53:00,678
- Of course, I'm a nun. Four popes now.
- Four?

648
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:06,017
- How often do they rehearse?
- Twice a week, couple hours.

649
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:09,604
Not enough. I mean, listen to them.
They really need a lot of work.

650
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,731
They gotta rehearse every day.

651
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:13,566
She's good.

652
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:16,819
Well, do you think
they really could get better?

653
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:20,781
- I don't know. They're pretty raw.
- Wet behind the ears.

654
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,576
Oh, please, let us try.

655
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:28,623
- This is gonna be hell.
- Tell me about it.

656
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:58,402
Welcome this Sunday morning,
oh, ye few but faithful.

657
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,782
The choir, I'm told, has elected
a new director, Sister Mary Clarence,

658
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,410
who will lead them
in "Hail, Holy Queen."

659
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,399
- What do you think's going on up there?
- I don't know, man.

660
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:59,583
Hallelujah!

661
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:57,600
Girl groups? Boogie-woogie on the piano?
What were you thinking?

662
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,103
I was thinking more like Vegas.
You know, get some butts in the seats.

663
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:07,651
And what next? Popcorn, curtain calls?
This is not a theatre or a casino.

664
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,028
Yeah, but that's the problem.

665
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:11,864
See, people like going to theatres
and they like going to casinos.

666
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:15,075
But they don't like coming to church, why?
Because it's a drag.

667
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,245
But we can change all that.
See, we could pack this joint.

668
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:22,917
Through blasphemy?
You have corrupted the entire choir.

669
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,503
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

670
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:30,466
How can you say that?
I worked my butt off with these women!

671
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,469
They've given up their free time to do this
and they're good.

672
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,847
I mean, sister, we could rock this place!

673
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,098
Out of the question.

674
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,602
As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus
resumes her leadership of the choir.

675
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,312
Come in!

676
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,857
Reverend Mother,
I just wanted to congratulate you.

677
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,820
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.
What a marvellous programme.

678
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,907
Innovative, inspiring.
You're to be commended.

679
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,244
I can't wait till next Sunday
when the choir performs again.

680
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,412
Did you see the people
walk in off the street?

681
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:05,334
That music, that heavenly music.
Reverend Mother, it called to them.

682
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,753
It did?

683
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,255
I must tell the archbishop.

684
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,091
I'll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts,

685
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:15,094
your bold new fight
to keep your little convent alive.

686
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,514
And you must also include this. This is
something she would never tell you herself,

687
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,599
because this is the kind
of woman she is.

688
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,229
Sisters, she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people.

689
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,985
- Oh, this woman.
- Oh, bless her.

690
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,779
There are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with.

691
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:36,073
I mean,
that's why many of us became nuns.

692
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,284
Oh, it's really marvellous,
Reverend Mother.

693
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,161
There's a lot we could do for them
besides pray, sister.

694
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,871
You're a pioneer.

695
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:48,544
Monsignor, surely you realise
how dangerous this neighbourhood is.

696
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,338
And you will face that danger head-on.

697
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,883
- As if I could stop you.
- You couldn't.

698
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,219
You have my complete support
in this matter.

699
00:59:57,386 --> 01:00:01,140
Anything you can do to revitalise
this neighbourhood would be a blessing.

700
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:04,476
Don't you just love her?

701
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,312
Yes.

702
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,340
Yes, the failing convent at
Saint Katherine's has truly come alive

703
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,759
thanks to the efforts of its popular choir.

704
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,844
<i>What an amazing turnaround story.</i>

705
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,890
<i>This convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours.</i>

706
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:33,852
- Now, as you can see, <i>its</i> doors are open...
- Vinny, get over here.

707
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:38,315
<i>--Establishing facilities like a daycare
centre and a food kitchen for the homeless.</i>

708
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:41,902
- As a <i>matter</i> of fact...
- Vin, you gotta see these cute nuns.

709
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,571
I'm shooting pool!

710
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,783
Babe, we should send them money.
They're do-gooders.

711
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:51,870
<i>--Attribute this reach-out philosophy
to a new addition to the convent</i>

712
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:57,584
<i>Sister Mary Clarence,
who, unfortunately, is a little camera shy.</i>

713
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:01,588
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her myself.

714
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:07,719
<i>In related news, the pope visits the U. S.
And we'll have more on that in</i> a <i>moment</i>

715
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,768
- Good morning.
- Thank you so much.

716
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,187
- Good morning, monsignor.
- Good morning.

717
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,689
- Good to see you.
- Good morning.

718
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:27,114
Hey, hey, you looking for me?
What you doing here?

719
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,950
- How come I saw you on TV?
- That was not my fault.

720
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:33,120
These people just showed up.
But it's been really good for the convent.

721
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:34,705
You're supposed to be hiding out.

722
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:37,082
Remember?
Bullets flying through the air at you?

723
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,668
- Ring a bell?
- Yes.

724
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,379
But I can't talk about it now.
I have a show in five minutes.

725
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,173
Listen to yourself.
This is not a career opportunity.

726
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,592
You don't have to tell me that.

727
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,719
This would not be the place
to begin a career.

728
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,056
Hey, just promise me I won't see you
on the Letterman show, okay?

729
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:55,183
Okay.

730
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:59,688
Hey, I'm worried about you.
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

731
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,317
Okay. You gonna come to the show?

732
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,653
Yeah. I'd love to.

733
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:15,913
This Sunday's hymn is inspired
by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.

734
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,666
Now, Mary Magdalene
was a young lady with a past.

735
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,879
Oh, yes.
And she was no stranger to sin.

736
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:26,632
She was no stranger
to practically anybody.

737
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:32,304
Many condemned her.
The whole neighbourhood, in fact.

738
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:36,475
But one man refused to do so.

739
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:41,188
One man said,
"Hey, now. Hold on. Wait a minute.

740
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:45,108
Listen to the girl's story."

741
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:55,994
- Hail, girls.
- Hail, Mary. What's up?

742
01:05:56,161 --> 01:06:01,917
Well, Jerusalem's become a real drag.
Everybody hates me.

743
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,752
Not that guy over there.

744
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:08,382
Who, him? They all say he's different.
They say he's really weird.

745
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:12,469
We don't care what people say.
To us, he's always there.

746
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:13,929
Really?

747
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,700
Let's take it home, ladies.

748
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:06,083
Give them some of
that deep shoulder action.

749
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:40,951
- Ladies, ladies, you were fantastic.
- Sisters, you did good.

750
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:44,412
Oh, I'm so excited.
I can't wait till Sunday when we sing.

751
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:47,124
- I'd rather sing than do anything.
- It's better than ice cream.

752
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,127
- It's better than springtime.
- It's better than sex.

753
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,920
No, I've heard, you know.

754
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:54,631
Sisters, you're truly an inspiration.

755
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,926
And I've asked you here because
I bear remarkable news.

756
01:08:58,093 --> 01:08:59,511
Now, try to remain calm.

757
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:02,722
What I'm about to say
is nothing short of a miracle.

758
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,766
Well, I didn't believe it myself at first.

759
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,352
Monsignor, for goodness' sake,
what is it?

760
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:11,648
Oh, I'm sorry, sister. It's just that it's so
momentous, I'm still adjusting to the shock.

761
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:16,444
The pope, the pope himself, has heard
of our choir here at Saint Katherine's.

762
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,864
And when he visits San Francisco
next weekend,

763
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,199
despite his inordinately busy schedule,

764
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:24,619
he's requested a special concert here
on Sunday night.

765
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,538
No, no!

766
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:28,790
Oh, I'm dying, I'm dying-

767
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:33,753
Oh, sisters.
Oh, sisters, this is indeed glorious news.

768
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,090
Oh, monsignor,
we're both humbled and honoured.

769
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:39,801
And on such a supremely
solemn occasion,

770
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:43,096
I do feel a traditional programme
would be best.

771
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,515
You mean, traditional like the old way?

772
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,018
We're speaking of His Holiness,
Mary Clarence,

773
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,228
not a neighbourhood block party.

774
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:53,899
The pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility.

775
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,611
Your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place.

776
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,946
But, Reverend Mother,
everyone loves our new style.

777
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,823
It's brought people back to the church.

778
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:05,410
And that's why he's coming, because
we're doing something new and different.

779
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,288
Well, I feel this can be settled
by a simple vote.

780
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,374
- A vote?
- Of course, Mary Clarence.

781
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,919
A convent is not a police state.

782
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,795
I'm sure the sisters
are more than capable

783
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:19,174
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus.

784
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:22,093
Right. Now all those in favour
of performing a programme

785
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,471
of time-honoured, sacred music,

786
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:28,934
a truly spiritual repertoire,
raise your hands.

787
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,778
All those in favour of allowing
Mary Clarence

788
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:46,034
to select a more worldly programme,
however inappropriate, raise your hands.

789
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,631
The majority has spoken.

790
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:04,052
Reverend Mother, as always, you're a true
leader. Gracious and understanding.

791
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,930
It's gonna be wonderful, Reverend Mother.
You'll see.

792
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,975
I'm sure the presentation
will be a great success.

793
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,102
Congratulations, Mary Clarence.

794
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:18,066
And congratulations to you all.

795
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:24,614
His Holiness.
Now, we've got to get busy.

796
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,536
Come in.

797
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:31,830
You sent for me?

798
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:36,042
- You have a phone call.
- From who?

799
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:38,503
Lieutenant Souther.

800
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,552
Hello.

801
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,556
Hey, Deloris, great news.
I pulled some strings.

802
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:53,310
The judge agreed to move up the trial.
We'll be in court in a couple days.

803
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:56,855
Really? That soon?

804
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,065
In 48 hours, you're a free woman.

805
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:02,402
Oh, that's great.

806
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,572
Yeah, that's great.

807
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:08,283
Hey, well, don't thank me or anything.

808
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:13,580
No, it is. No, thank you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.

809
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:17,584
Yeah. All right. Bye.

810
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:25,967
Well, seems like your prayers
have been answered.

811
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:28,720
Gonna be out of here in a week.
I'm leaving.

812
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,638
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

813
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,808
- That makes two of us.
- What do you mean?

814
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:38,688
I have submitted my resignation
to Monsignor O'Hara. Privately.

815
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,941
I've asked to be relocated
as soon as possible.

816
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,736
But Why?

817
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,781
I must go where I can be of use.

818
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:53,370
But there's still
so much to be done here.

819
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,747
Look, if it's about me,
I'm gonna be gone.

820
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:59,834
Indeed. And after how long?
A few weeks?

821
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,586
I have been here for years.

822
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:05,715
Well, too long, I suppose.
I've become somewhat obsolete.

823
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,843
But you don't have to continue
being obsolete.

824
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,805
Look, everything that's happening here
is a good thing.

825
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,059
- Sister, you can still be part of it.
- Part of what?

826
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,895
Mary Clarence, it is one thing
to rabble-rouse,

827
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:21,648
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday.

828
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,528
You've raised the sisters' expectations.
You've excited and confused them.

829
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:30,532
They imagine this neighbourhood to be
some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.

830
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,660
Now, you and I know things
are not so simple.

831
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,913
There'll be disappointments
and rude shocks.

832
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,750
And you will have vanished.
How fortunate.

833
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:44,629
Look, I just got things going.

834
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:48,633
You are a formidable woman.
You could keep this going.

835
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,427
Could I?

836
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:55,098
Even if I wanted to, no.
I fear I am a relic.

837
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:58,226
And I have misplaced my tambourine.

838
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:01,312
- Good day, Mary Clarence.
- But, sister--

839
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,231
Good day.

840
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:08,361
Good day.

841
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,989
Don't peek.

842
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,993
Don't peek. Ready?

843
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,830
Crazy women. What have you done?
What is this?

844
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:21,124
- It's ice cream.
- I know that, but--

845
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:25,003
Well, it's a great big cuddly bear hug
of a thank-you from us to you.

846
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:29,883
Not thank you to me. Thank you to you.
I mean, when did you do this?

847
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,011
This is a sin. It's a wicked indulgence.

848
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:35,388
Didn't they have any butter pecan?

849
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:38,308
- Hope Reverend Mother doesn't catch us.
- Yeah, let's keep it down.

850
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:39,601
Is there any syrup?

851
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:44,314
Mary Clarence, this morning in prayers,
I thanked God for bringing you to us.

852
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,983
Since you've come,
everything has just happened.

853
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,444
Our choir is famous, for one.

854
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:53,406
We could cut a demo.
I could learn guitar.

855
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,701
Yeah, anything is possible.

856
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,870
- God works in mysterious ways.
- That's true.

857
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,749
You know, anything could happen.

858
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:06,544
I mean, any one of us could be transferred
out of here at any given time.

859
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,380
Are you leaving us?

860
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,885
No. Come on, no.
What are you talking about?

861
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:16,387
No, we're always gonna be together.

862
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:20,725
That's what Diana Ross said.

863
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:29,400
- Listen, that was a trio. We're a quartet.
- It's true.

864
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:34,197
Just missed him.
Souther just stepped out.

865
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,157
I need his signature on some things.

866
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,660
This stuff can't be processed
without him.

867
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:42,288
Well, just leave it here, Henry.
I'll make sure he signs it when he comes in.

868
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,608
We found her.

869
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,945
Beautiful work. What's the address?

870
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:17,907
<i>It's Church Street at 29th
in San Francisco.</i>

871
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,370
- Thought you were gone.
- Got all the way to the oar, no keys.

872
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:25,582
Tate said to leave
the money vouchers with him.

873
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,293
He said you'd sign them later.

874
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:47,020
Here's our leak, boys. Plug him up!

875
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,606
Get him out of here. Let's go, Tate.

876
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,317
The pope. Tomorrow.

877
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:55,737
Oh, my gosh, I'll be so nervous.
What if I forget the words?

878
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:59,240
You're gonna go straight to hell.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

879
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,451
Come on, sisters.
Rehearsal in five minutes.

880
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:03,953
- Go to rehearsal. I'll be there in a minute.
- Right.

881
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:17,091
One, two, three and slide.
One, two, three and slide.

882
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:20,595
One, two, three and slide.
Sister, take over now.

883
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:24,057
One, two, three, together.
One, two, three, together.

884
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,438
- Oh, come in.
- Where's Deloris?

885
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:32,357
- Is something wrong?
- They know she's here.

886
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,068
Oh, my goodness.
She's upstairs with the choir.

887
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,075
- Deloris.
- Hi.

888
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,911
Look, Vince knows you're here.
We gotta get out now.

889
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,746
I can't.
We sing for the pope tomorrow.

890
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:50,541
You're gonna be singing for Saint Peter
if you don't get your ass out of here now.

891
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,543
But I...

892
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:01,636
I can't do this. I can't leave.
It's like I'm deserting them.

893
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,721
Hey, I think they'll understand.

894
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,140
No, you don't understand.
They need me.

895
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:10,269
They need you? A bunch of nuns?
What for? Moral guidance?

896
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:13,606
- What, makeup tips?
- Let me tell you something.

897
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,234
We are talking about the pope.
This means a great deal to them.

898
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:19,153
And they have worked very hard for this
and they deserve it.

899
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,947
Where are you going?

900
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:25,702
- Where are you going?
- I am going to the little nuns' room, nosy!

901
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,727
There you are!
We've been looking for you.

902
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,895
- Rehearsal's about to start.
- Okay. Let's go.

903
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,314
- Surprise.
- Guess who.

904
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,400
- Rehearsal's this way, sister.
- Hey, Deloris.

905
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,569
- Hi. Yeah.
- All right, all right.

906
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:12,790
- What? Who are they?
- Reno scum.

907
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,876
Come on, man!

908
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:21,048
Come on, come on, let's go.
All right, all right.

909
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,269
Where are we going?

910
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,772
Your sister here's
got a special command performance.

911
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,482
Yeah, back at the Moonlite Lounge.

912
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,943
Look, why don't you just let her go?
She doesn't have anything to do with this.

913
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,404
Oh, yeah, sure.
So she can run right to the cops, huh?

914
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:49,410
Look, you just go with the ﬂow, okay?
Relax. You do what I tell you.

915
01:19:57,585 --> 01:19:59,086
Go!

916
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,508
- She's getting away.
- You don't have to worry about her.

917
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,719
- You got the one you came for.
- She's right. Let's go.

918
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,724
- Are you all right? It's okay, I'm a cop.
- They've got Mary Clarence and guns.

919
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:13,893
- Where are they taking her?
- The Moonlite Lounge.

920
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,645
- Come on, get out of the street.
- Okay.

921
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:32,703
- You mean they kidnapped her?
- Yes, two men. And they had guns.

922
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,664
Why would anyone kidnap a nun?

923
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,290
Were they Catholics?

924
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:43,047
She isn't a nun. She's a lounge singer.
Her real name is Deloris Van Cartier.

925
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,509
She witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent.

926
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:49,011
- She isn't a nun?
- She lied to us?

927
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,973
- But she was such a wonderful nun.
- Look what she did with the choir.

928
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,809
- She made us sing beautifully.
- That should have tipped us.

929
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:57,395
Well, I don't care who she is.
We can't sing without her!

930
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,605
She's our inspiration.

931
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:03,776
Reverend Mother. Please, I know that you
and Mary Clarence didn't always agree,

932
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:06,153
- but we've gotta help her, please.
- We must save her.

933
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:09,740
We can't leave it up to the feds.

934
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,327
Calm down, calm down. Mary Robert.

935
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,746
Think clearly. Have you any idea
who these two men were?

936
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:20,751
Yes, they were from Reno and
they're taking her to the Moonlite Lounge.

937
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,005
Reno, Nevada.

938
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,632
Mary Emmanuel,
tell the monsignor the situation.

939
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,635
- Yes, mother.
- The rest of you, follow me.

940
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,223
It's 1,500 for the run to Reno.
That's 500 less than I normally charge.

941
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,475
But we don't have $1,500.

942
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,769
Well, then I can't fly you there.
I'm sorry.

943
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,857
Look, I'm sorry. I've got some things
I have to check out here.

944
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:46,402
Father, do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need.

945
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,364
When he stands before you on the day of
judgment, do not send straight him to hell.

946
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:53,576
Please, do not treat him with
the same disregard that he's treated us.

947
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,494
Just because he can't show
charity to nuns,

948
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,205
try not to leave him without rewards
when he asks for them.

949
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:00,082
We know it is easier
to answer the prayers

950
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,126
of a man who has answered
the prayers of others,

951
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:05,421
but if he should come to you
for relief of pain--

952
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:09,216
Such as rheumatoid arthritis,
loss of hair, neck polyps.

953
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,636
Don't leave him bald
and yowling in despair.

954
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,138
Watch over him
as he refuses to watch over us.

955
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:16,599
If you cannot, we know that you
will have done your best.

956
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:20,227
- What goes around comes around.
- Sisters, sisters.

957
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:23,022
Hold on a second.

958
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:45,419
What did you think you were doing
running to the cops, Deloris? Hiding out?

959
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:47,463
Big no-no, babe.

960
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,382
Bet you're sorry now.

961
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:54,011
I'm sorry for all my sins, Vince.
And I'm sorry for yours.

962
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,555
I loved you, Deloris.

963
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,641
I gave you everything.

964
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:02,103
My affection, my time, a big-time career.

965
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,106
And how do you repay me?
What's the thanks I get?

966
01:23:05,356 --> 01:23:09,735
Where's the loyalty?
You shouldn't have done that to me, babe.

967
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,863
You'll be judged. We all will.

968
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,033
I don't get judged

969
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,328
Vince, she's been acting weird
since we picked her up.

970
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,331
It's like she's scared of nothing.

971
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:26,293
She's scared.
Tell the boys how scared you are.

972
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,629
I forgive you, Vince.

973
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:36,804
Waste her.

974
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,066
It's beautiful!

975
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:52,111
And what a lovely name. Reno.

976
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,447
And Gomorrah!

977
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:57,074
She was this doll.
She used to wear fruit on her head and go:

978
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:01,162
- Excuse me, Vince.
- Yeah.

979
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:02,705
It's done?

980
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,415
Not totally.

981
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:10,463
- What's the problem?
- Vince, we can't waste a nun.

982
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:16,552
What are you nuts talking about?
It's Deloris in a costume.

983
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:19,138
Well, Vince, how do you know
she didn't join up

984
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:21,390
and become a real nun
when she was there?

985
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:22,933
Things like this happen.

986
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:31,400
Because I know this woman in the biblical
sense and she ain't no nun.

987
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:34,779
Now, I don't want to hear any more of this
Go in there and do it.

988
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,572
Just don't come back till it's over.

989
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:39,283
- Okay.
- It's done.

990
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:43,788
- Okay, we go one, two, three, shoot.
- Wait.

991
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:47,166
We don't go one, two,
and shoot on three?

992
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,210
Get over there.

993
01:24:53,798 --> 01:24:57,551
One, two, three.

994
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,597
- You didn't shoot.
- Neither did you.

995
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:05,851
- I figured if you did, I wouldn't have to.
- That's what I figured.

996
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,439
Sisters, come on!

997
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,196
Deloris, we got it all worked out.

998
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:19,657
- Strip.
- What?

999
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:21,492
Come on, come on.
Take off the nun thing.

1000
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:23,327
Yeah, yeah, the nun thing.

1001
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:26,288
- What is she doing?
- Oh, my God. She's praying.

1002
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:30,459
Lord, I want you to forgive
Willy and Joey.

1003
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,879
Because they know not what they do.

1004
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:36,507
They're only doing
what Vince told them to do.

1005
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:39,385
Because Vince is too chicken
to do it himself.

1006
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:43,556
So he's called upon these two men
to take care of his business.

1007
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:46,308
So I want you to forgive them, Lord.

1008
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,444
- Amen.
- Amen.

1009
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:14,795
You all right? You all right?

1010
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,941
- Go find Vince.
- Right.

1011
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:42,781
Wait, wait, wait! Oh, my goodness.
There it is. The Moonlite Lounge.

1012
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:10,309
Brace yourself, sisters.
Spread out and look for Mary Clarence.

1013
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,312
Try to blend in.

1014
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,904
Hi. Excuse me. Sorry.

1015
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:25,115
Has anyone seen a nun?
A Carmelite nun? No? Sure?

1016
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:28,118
No, she's not really a nun.
She's just posing as a nun.

1017
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,745
It was a great shock to us--

1018
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:40,339
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1019
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:41,674
Place your bets.

1020
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,676
Red 23.

1021
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,303
Are you sure? How do you know?

1022
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,807
- Red 23.
- Me too.

1023
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:52,226
- Works for me.
- I'm on it.

1024
01:27:55,688 --> 01:27:57,064
Red 14.

1025
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:00,901
I was just trying
to teach you all a lesson.

1026
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,989
Oh, excuse me!

1027
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,832
Sister Mary Ignatius!

1028
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,875
Follow me.

1029
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,845
Block off the street.

1030
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:30,431
- But don't move in until I tell you.
- Okay.

1031
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:41,191
- What are you doing here?
- We're saving you.

1032
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,903
Mary Clarence, you're safe.

1033
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,364
Come on, move, move.

1034
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:50,326
Break! Now!

1035
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,830
- Joey.
- Vinny. There's a thousand nuns here.

1036
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:57,583
- What do we do?
- You go to the left. You go to the right.

1037
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,335
- I'll go down the middle.
- All right.

1038
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,965
Place your bets. Place your bets.

1039
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:23,567
Hey, babe.

1040
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:27,279
Yes, sweetheart?

1041
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,580
Seal off the exits
and get ready to move in.

1042
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:42,503
There's another way out.
Let's go. Come. Excuse us.

1043
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,857
Move in now.

1044
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:09,696
- I can't see a thing.
- Willy, hit the lights!

1045
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,327
Freeze!

1046
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:17,204
everybody!

1047
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,249
Joey.

1048
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,834
Where is she?

1049
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:25,921
I'm right here. I'm here.

1050
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:29,466
Leave them alone.
They don't have anything to do with it.

1051
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,260
I'm here.

1052
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,515
Calm down.

1053
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,444
Joey,do it

1054
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,739
I can't, Vince. She's still a nun.

1055
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:57,453
She's a broad, you got it? Just a broad.

1056
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,663
I guarantee you she is no broad.

1057
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,207
She is Sister Mary Clarence
of Saint Katherine's Convent.

1058
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:05,377
She's a model of generosity,
virtue and love.

1059
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:08,172
You have my word for it, gentlemen.
She is a nun.

1060
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:13,760
You hear that?
Now, aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?

1061
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:20,559
- Don't shoot!
- Drop it.

1062
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:21,935
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1063
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:25,105
Guns down. Drop it, okay?

1064
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:27,733
You all right? You okay?

1065
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,485
Oh, God.

1066
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:35,282
I'm shot! Watch the arm!

1067
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:39,661
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
Things got kind of out of hand.

1068
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,163
Oh, just kind of out of hand?

1069
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:44,625
Boy, am I glad you're a much better shot
than you are a protector.

1070
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:46,919
But...

1071
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,379
Thank you.

1072
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:51,924
- All right, come on.
- I was good to you.

1073
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:55,594
We had a great thing!
You sang in a hotel! Badly!

1074
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,804
How could you betray me like this?!

1075
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,308
- You are nothing!
- Get him out of here.

1076
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:04,686
- I got two words for you, Vince.
- Mary Clarence.

1077
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,649
Bless you.

1078
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:10,359
Let's go.

1079
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:11,777
- Come on.
- Hey!

1080
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,531
I hold you responsible for all of this.

1081
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,908
For introducing a lounge act
into my convent.

1082
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:23,205
For utterly disrupting our lives
and exposing us to mortal danger.

1083
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:25,958
Thank you.

1084
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:33,632
No, no, thank you. Thank you all.

1085
01:32:35,259 --> 01:32:36,760
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

1086
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:40,389
We thought you were a nun, Deloris.

1087
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:42,933
Van Cartier.

1088
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,607
Sisters, we have a concert to do.

1089
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:55,487
- I thought you were leaving.
- We can't both of us leave.
