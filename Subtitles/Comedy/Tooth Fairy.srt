1
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:43,113
Battle One on the boards with both
teams really digging for the puck.

2
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:49,215
Now, it squats loose and the ice wolves have it
and the puck is cleared out of the zone.

3
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,034
Give it up!

4
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:56,140
What a hit!

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,686
Come on boys! Use the body!
Take him away! Take him away!

6
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,254
- Raton’s going up the ice!
- Take him to the offside!

7
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,718
He shoots... nice save by Grant.

8
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:11,622
What a hit...What action!

9
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,263
The Ice Wolves are just getting hammered.

10
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:18,780
There is the familiar chant, Jim.

11
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:26,361
and the coach is going for the big defenseman,
Derek Thompson and here comes the Tooth Fairy.

12
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,830
Go in the dark jersey and hit it.

13
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:24,664
- That is an incisor.
- I got the tooth. Oh, I got the tooth, baby!

14
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:31,277
And the tooth fairy,
Derek Thompson has struck again.

15
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,891
You can't handle the tooth and that's
the tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth.

16
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,180
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.

17
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,829
Open the door for the Tooth Fairy.

18
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:03,463
Who's the Tooth Fairy?
Am I the Tooth...I'm the Tooth Fairy!

19
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,801
Stop it. Stop it.

20
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:14,079
- What's going on out here?
- Hey Thompson, come here.

21
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:17,500
- I want you to meet the future of our franchise.
- Ah... new kid.

22
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,115
He's probably not
going to be here for longer

23
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,460
than a cup of coffee till he
gets snapped up by the Kings.

24
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:26,048
But listen, while he is here.
Your job on the ice is to take care of him.

25
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,879
- Okay.
- Nothing else matters, alright.

26
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:28,232
Alright.

27
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:29,930
- Mick.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:32,214
Derek Thompson, Mick Donnelly
here first line striker.

29
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:33,990
Mick Donnelly, Derek
Thompson, he's your bodyguard.

30
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,701
- What's up, man?
- Welcome to pro hockey, kid!

31
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:37,997
Yeah, is there an
old-timers' game today?

32
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:42,377
I didn't realize you're even still
playing, man. I used to be a big fan.

33
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,732
Alright... See you later, man.

34
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:58,764
Mr. Thompson!

35
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,714
Sign the autograph for me.

36
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,776
Yeah, sure. Absolutely!
What's your name, buddy?

37
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,732
Gabe, I'm the third leading
scorer in my hockey league.

38
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,283
- And my team might with the Championship.
- Wow, that's fantastic. Good for you, Gabe.

39
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,898
One day, I'm going to play hockey
in the big leagues just like you used to.

40
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:22,447
- You work pretty hard at hockey, do you?
- Uh huh, I play almost every day.

41
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:25,388
- And I drive him almost every day.
- Ah...uh huh.

42
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:27,112
- How old are you?
- I'm eight.

43
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,407
You're eight, you're eight, okay.
Well, here's the deal, Gabe.

44
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,265
So, you're eight and you're
the third leading scorer

45
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,565
in your league behind
two other eight year-olds.

46
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:36,948
- Well, one's nine.
- Uh hmm. Okay, well.

47
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,240
See, Gabe, somewhere in this country
there's a seven year-old playing against

48
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:42,344
twelve year-olds and
he's outscoring them.

49
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:46,522
I mean, he's killing them. Making them
want to get run over by a Zambonian guy.

50
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,453
And there are a bunch
like that kid in every rink.

51
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,467
And when the time's right,
those kids will battle it out

52
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:53,627
and only a handful of
them will get signed.

53
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,681
Now let's say, you do make the NHL...

54
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,645
You won't...Now let's say you do.

55
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,676
Let's say you hit the show right out of
college but the show hit you right back.

56
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,060
And before you could stay slap shot,
you're pushed down to the minors

57
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,887
with a blown out shoulder
and nowhere to go.

58
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:15,670
Listen, lower your expectations.
That's how you're going to be happy.

59
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:19,845
There you go, Gabe.

60
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:33,946
I want to suck your blood... What, what
are you looking at and laughing at?

61
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:38,403
- Why aren't you afraid?
- Because those are French fries.

62
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:45,533
No, I can't eat French fries.
French fries are fatal to vampires.

63
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:52,979
- Hey, I have an idea.
- Can't talk, still dead.

64
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,795
Mommy, my tooth came out!

65
00:05:55,892 --> 00:06:03,153
- Hey, yehey! Oh, congrats.
- The tooth fairy's going to visit me tonight.

66
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:07,743
You bet, let's see.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

67
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:13,291
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm a tooth fairy.
- Thought you said you're a vampire.

68
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:16,725
You got some inconsistent mythology.

69
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:20,206
I have a lot of homework.
Can I be excused?

70
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,282
Yeah.

71
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:28,935
Mommy, it's time for you to go now
and Derek can start babysitting.

72
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:32,389
Not just yet. You want to go
and put your jemmies on?

73
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:37,357
I wonder if it would help if Randy and
you had some one-on-one time.

74
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:41,530
Ah..sure. I could do that. As long as
I don't have to be alone with him.

75
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:49,054
Calvin is here.
Oh, little ketchup.

76
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,948
- Oh, Tooth Fairy.
- You know what, I got it.

77
00:06:55,198 --> 00:07:00,697
- Look, I put on my pyjamas.
- Dracula's back from the dead.

78
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:08,199
Hey, what do you guys think of Donnelly?

79
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,355
- Oh man, that kid is fast.
- Even to Nits Grisly.

80
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,814
I love him already.
Like a long lost brother.

81
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,685
Can we just play?

82
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,821
Next to you.

83
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:24,988
Alright, I'm a little short. But this
autograph that says the "Tooth Fairy."

84
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:26,377
It's worth ten bucks on EBay.

85
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,163
Ten of these is a
hundred bucks, so I'm in.

86
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:31,011
No, no, no, no.
You have to pay.

87
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:34,870
Hey, it's me.
I'm a good boy.

88
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,377
- I'll be right back.
- He took his cards.

89
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:46,379
Hey Derek, don't the kids have
like a piggy bank or something?

90
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,745
- I'm home. Hey, guys.
- Hello, gorgeous.

91
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,359
You know what... I'm a little tired.

92
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,370
I'm not going to hang out
but I walk you guys out.

93
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:16,854
Mommy, mommy!

94
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:20,062
Mommy, mommy!
Mommy!

95
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,643
- What is it, honey?
- My tooth is gone.

96
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,428
- Well, that's cause the Tooth Fairy took it.
- But there's no money.

97
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:31,568
- I looked.
- Let's look together. I'm sure it's here somewhere.

98
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:35,160
- The vampire has returned!
- Not a vampire moment.

99
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:41,459
- It's not anywhere.
- Well, I bet that they took it to where...

100
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:43,167
...on the Tooth meter
to see what it's worth

101
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:46,131
before they bring you
the money. Right, Derek?

102
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,202
Sure, that's how the
whole tooth thing works.

103
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,220
No, that's not how it works.

104
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,853
You put the tooth under your
pillow, the tooth fairy flies into

105
00:08:55,854 --> 00:09:00,527
your room when you're sleeping,
takes the tooth and leaves a dollar.

106
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,605
- Where is it?
- Okay...

107
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,706
You tell me when to
stop when the Tooth Fairy

108
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,406
has been here coz I have five 10's...

109
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:09,557
Derek.

110
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,398
(Stop)

111
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:16,225
Okay. Tess, you're a big girl now.

112
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,675
You're six. So let's just
get this out of the way.

113
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:22,888
- There's is no such thing as a Tooth...
- Bingo, here it is.

114
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,488
How did it get down there?

115
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:28,846
Oh, you must have rolled over in
your sleep and it fell on the floor.

116
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:35,880
I forgot. People forget.

117
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,222
So then, your big idea to handle it
was to tell Tess there is no tooth fairy.

118
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,650
Carl, come on. The way
I see it, is the reason

119
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,231
why there are so many
unhappy people in the world

120
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:45,437
because all are cringed to
some version of what if...

121
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:46,397
Okay, so dreams are bad.

122
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:49,318
Well, they lead to unrealistic
expectations then yes.

123
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:50,965
- This is ridiculous.
- I know.

124
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,270
- I'm going to bed.
- Carl.

125
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:56,739
You...are leaving.

126
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,264
Don't get all dramatic.

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,935
I'm her mother. I get the say on
her childhood fantasies, not you.

128
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:45,022
Disbelief...Fairy...Summons...

129
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,352
What?

130
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,779
Thompson, Derek Thompson.

131
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,763
Yes, yes, God, it's me.
Is that you God?

132
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,960
- You're Thompson?
- You're God?

133
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,558
I'm Tracy, I'm your case worker.
What is this?

134
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,584
- How disappointing.
- Come with me, please.

135
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:38,734
No, thank you, thank you.
Fairy questionnaires.

136
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,283
What are you wearing?

137
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:43,291
I don't know what I'm wearing.
What are you wearing?

138
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,017
- Who is this guy?
- Dream Killer. I don't like your assault.

139
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,217
What did I do? Why am I here?
Where am I?

140
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,631
No one likes your kind, right here.

141
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:53,901
No one likes your attitude, the
way you always show up here acting

142
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,902
all strange, "Oh, why am I here?,
What are these giant wings man?"

143
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:58,997
Do we have a problem?

144
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:00,598
Yeah, we have a problem. Do we have a
problem, he said. We have a problem. Yeah,

145
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,138
we have a problem because you just said do
we have a problem which gives us a problem.

146
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,068
- That's right.
- Tracy, right?

147
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,557
Ah, what a pretty girl's
name you have.

148
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:09,135
Don't laugh at him.
That's not funny.

149
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,094
That's strike two and you
don't want to get to strike three.

150
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:14,765
- What happens after strike three?
- Strike four.

151
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,077
We'll get your uniform sort out in a minute

152
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,533
and then we can get you registered
and begin your training.

153
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,230
- Training for what?
- Oooh, training for what?

154
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:29,527
You, Mr. Thompson, are going to
spend some time as a Tooth Fairy.

155
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,186
Calm down, everyone.
Just let him to be harmless.

156
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,004
- Everyone alright?
- Oh really, is that what, your fairy patrol?

157
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:49,967
I'm 230 pounds, going to take a lot
more than just eight fairies to get me.

158
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:53,372
Fairy, hands off!
Is this fairy etiquette?

159
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:54,653
Where were we?

160
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:59,380
Help please! Wake me up! I'm in a
nightmare, please! Please, help me!

161
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,168
The nightmare is just beginning.

162
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,174
You want a shot at the title.
Is that it? You're feeling lucky?

163
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:18,224
Maybe I am. Hold this, baby.
I can see nothing, give it back.

164
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:22,920
You want a piece of this?
I'm ready to go.

165
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:31,162
- You just made a big mistake.
- He's got a magic wand.

166
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,220
What's next? You going to
pull a rabbit out of the hat.

167
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,255
Fairy fight!

168
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:40,256
Oh, now I got one too.  Let me
introduce you to the Hammer Brothers.

169
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:43,120
Sledge and Jack, who do you want?

170
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:46,216
Who do you want to meet?

171
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:50,021
Oh dear, looks like you
pick on the wrong fairy.

172
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:57,331
Oh, magic wand.
Oh my gosh, the magic wand.

173
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:01,088
What is going on here?

174
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:18,240
Stop it! You're behaving
like leprechauns.

175
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:20,466
He's got such a major attitude problem.

176
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:23,692
Oh, I'm well aware of his attitude.
Believe me.

177
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,239
- Hello, Mr. Thompson.
- Hi.

178
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:28,769
Sorry about the follow up
with your outfit.

179
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,560
Budget problems. Tracy
will take care of it.

180
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:32,806
Who him? Yeah, sure.

181
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,693
You, sir, are guilty of
disseminating disbelief,

182
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:43,301
killing dreams, committing
first degree murder of fantasy

183
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,432
which by Fairy Law....

184
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,325
Wait a minute. Is this because
of what happened with Tess...

185
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:47,681
Excuse me.

186
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,809
I haven't finished speaking.

187
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,024
Did I look as though I
had finished speaking?

188
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,589
I don't know. Everybody's got
a British accent around.

189
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,013
You've just interrupted me again

190
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,379
while I was admonishing
you for interrupting me.

191
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:02,475
Do I not look official enough?

192
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:06,128
I don't understand why policemen
or firemen don't get interrupted.

193
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,450
But you had a pair of wings and
suddenly all manners go out the window.

194
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:14,323
Shouldn't you be more in awe
of somebody with wings than without?

195
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,692
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

196
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:22,529
I could just fly up into the air
and do something crazy.

197
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:26,561
Maybe I breath fire.
You don't know.

198
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:33,118
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
I didn't mean it.

199
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,027
That is better.

200
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,333
In order to pay your
debt to humanity,

201
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:42,063
you are hereby ordered to
serve time as a tooth fairy.

202
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,718
Normal sentence is one week but

203
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:48,804
because you have the
nerve, the unmitigated gall,

204
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,846
to actually call yourself
the "Tooth Fairy"

205
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:55,356
thus make a mockery of
everything we stand for.

206
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:58,353
I'm sentencing you to two
weeks Tooth Fairy duty.

207
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:02,328
- Ah, no, no, no. No, it's unfair.
- Interrupting.

208
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,456
Interrupting again.
Unbelievable.

209
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,219
Take him away and see
that he's properly outfitted

210
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,791
and get him into
flying school.

211
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:14,603
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh but first, you get to meet Jerry.

212
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:20,116
Excuse me, Fairy Godmother.
I have one last question.

213
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,811
Does this tutu make
my butt a little big?

214
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,467
Yes...huge.

215
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,016
- Egg on the face.
- No, don't, no.

216
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,117
Oh good, you got the male version.

217
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:45,890
Get to a little spin so I can see.

218
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:48,330
How about I give you a little
spin of my fist around your nose?

219
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,153
Okay, what does that mean?

220
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:51,500
- It's a threat. That's what it means.
- You just said, you're going to do that.

221
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,378
- No, I'll punch you right in the nose.
- Just say that, it's much clearer.

222
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,388
- What's that? Oooh...
- It's just pathetic. It's like a child.

223
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,347
Chicken is fine. I
don't hate you, chicken.

224
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,202
I like you, chicken.
I hate your brisket.

225
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:07,331
Yeah, I'm coming.
Goodbye.

226
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:08,659
Never marry a leprechaun.

227
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,579
Oh, the dream popper.

228
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,878
Hey, did it make you feel
good to lie on that kid?

229
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:13,983
I didn't lie to a kid.

230
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,447
You told her there was
no tooth fairy, right?

231
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,111
- Right.
- Liar.

232
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,522
Look, I'm sorry. I...

233
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,477
Sorry is a beginning. Now,
if you're going to be a fairy

234
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,284
you got to be ready although...

235
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,164
Dude, there is a pill.
I mean, amazing pill.

236
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:36,596
If you take this pill, you
don't have to do any of these.

237
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,030
- Really?
- No, I was just kidding.

238
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,225
See, you're mad at me.
You believe and then I took it away.

239
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:44,277
Be mad at me. I don't care.
I have tenure.

240
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:46,335
Come on, walk with Jerry.

241
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:49,814
Okay, here's your tool pouch.
Waterproof, lot of compartments.

242
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,797
- You can get a lot of stuff in there. You dig?
- Yeah.

243
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,483
Okay.
This...

244
00:18:56,115 --> 00:19:00,694
This is your wand. Tooth detector,
radar jamming, keeps picking up radio client.

245
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,456
- I don't know what that's about.
- Okay, what's that?

246
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,109
Magic generator button. Does what
you ever wanted to do

247
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,119
but you
have to believe otherwise it won't work.

248
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,884
So it's pretty much useless to humans.

249
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:13,659
Ah this, you don't ever want to lose this.

250
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,305
- What is it?
- Well, it looks like an IPod adapter.

251
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:19,955
- Right, so what is it?
- It's an IPod adapter.

252
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,322
- What's it for?
- Listening to your IPod.

253
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:27,198
You get it for your IPod.
Did you not ask for your free IPod?

254
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,397
- No, really?
- I'm just kidding.

255
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:30,497
You know, why do you keep doing that?

256
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:33,001
I'm not well. I actually just
have a few months to live.

257
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,131
Oh, you're kidding.

258
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,120
Of course, I'm kidding. Why
would I share that with you?

259
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,979
I just met you plus
you lied to the kids.

260
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,498
Come on, we got business to do.

261
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:44,926
Invisibility spray. You use it, nobody
can see you except for other fairies.

262
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:49,653
And this, Dude, trust me.

263
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,635
Shrinking paste.

264
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,637
You put a little on your tongue,

265
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,869
you shrink down to about six
inches tall. You want to do it?

266
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,830
Come on, let's do it together.

267
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:00,105
Come on, let's do it. Come on,
we'll jump into each other's hands.

268
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:01,461
Well, I don't want to jump
in your hands, Jerry.

269
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,978
Really, come on, let's get small.

270
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,527
Sometimes when I'm home with the
wife, right. I'll take a double hit,

271
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:10,866
I'll get down to about that big and
let my feet dangle in the inkwell.

272
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:13,544
Then, when she's out.
I walk all over her body.

273
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,632
So when she wakes up,
there's these little footprints all over and she goes...

274
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:18,080
and I go, "Hey, I don't know."

275
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:21,809
See when you're married a long
time, you'll do stuff like this.

276
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:25,311
Alright, let's see. What else?
Oh, would you like a mint.

277
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:29,357
I made them myself. Here. Have a mint.
Taste it. Come on. Really good.

278
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,896
Go ahead. Come on.
Taste it. Help yourself.

279
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:37,129
These are good.

280
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,076
Well, these are good.

281
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,415
- Dog bark mints. Comes in very handy.
- For what?

282
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,358
Cats, mailmen, dogs
that comes up behind

283
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:51,133
you forget my drift or another kid
that you lied to comes after you.

284
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:52,758
How many times I got to
to say I'm sorry about that?

285
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,420
Six times.

286
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,159
I'm sorry, I was just kidding.
I can't believe you did this.

287
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,660
Did you play for years
without a helmet or something?

288
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,580
What is with you? It's like your brain
is in the penalty box. I'm telling you...

289
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:15,610
and you got like the eyes of
a shark but like deader.

290
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:17,383
Alright, listen.

291
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,259
Cat away. Very important.

292
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,747
If you're not a cat person, this
thing will come in very handy.

293
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,306
I almost have a senior fairy
moment. Don't you move.

294
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,301
This is my greatest invention ever.

295
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,604
Amnesia dust.

296
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:37,166
You throw a pinch, the
kid forgets everything

297
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,365
that happened for the last few seconds.

298
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,945
- Yeah, right. Come on.
- That's how it works.

299
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:41,740
That's how what works?

300
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:44,532
Amnesia dust. You throw a pinch,
the kid forgets everything

301
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:45,854
that happened for the last few seconds.

302
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:48,210
- That's how it works.
- That's how what works?

303
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,004
Amnesia dust, you throw a pinch
the kids forgets everything

304
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,699
that happened for the last few seconds.

305
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:54,780
- That's how it works.
- That's how what works?

306
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,061
Never gets old.

307
00:21:56,835 --> 00:22:00,683
You want to fly, you got to believe.
But you got to learn to use your wings.

308
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:02,722
Use my wings. You know how
ridiculous you sound right now.

309
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:05,458
Oh, who's your hobbit
friend over here?

310
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:10,570
Wait, you stay here, okay.
You have to learn from the best.

311
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:14,303
And some dang fool accused
this guy of being the best.

312
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:16,786
Well me and flying is just
not going to happen, okay.

313
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:20,468
I've got an old hockey injury so
I probably got a bad wing.

314
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,998
That's one I've never heard before.

315
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,563
- How's it going, Duke?
- What's up, man?

316
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,044
- Want me to turn a He-Man into Peter Pan.
- Oh, don't get me started, homey.

317
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,334
Oh, what is that? Your little
secret fairy jiving now.

318
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:33,570
Maybe you didn't hear me,
I said I got a bad wing, I can't fly!

319
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,839
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

320
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,660
- I'm tracking this baby up.
- Put me down.

321
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:49,132
- I think you're ready to practice FOA.
- FOA? What's FOA?

322
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:51,675
Flying Object Avoidance.

323
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:54,736
I'll throw something at you,
you get out of the way, okay.

324
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,835
Oh, you better not
throw anything at me.

325
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,336
- You want to get on him, Tracy?
- Put me down!

326
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,822
Imagine they're your responsibilities.
You're avoiding them.

327
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:08,414
- Bring it on.
- We will do!

328
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:18,737
Raise your right hand,
repeat after me: I, fill in your name

329
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:23,534
I, Derek Thompson...

330
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,725
Swear to uphold and perform...

331
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:27,811
Swear to uphold and perform...

332
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:31,566
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations...

333
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,382
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations...

334
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:35,947
of a Tooth Fairy.

335
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,057
of a Tooth Fairy.

336
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:47,939
of a Tooth Fairy.

337
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,921
And that I will not drink and fly.

338
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:52,529
Drink and fly?

339
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:56,179
Okay, now, it's serious.
That's serious.

340
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,995
That I will not drink and fly.

341
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:00,143
Welcome aboard.

342
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,020
These coupons are all
redeemable at the gift shop.

343
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:05,149
Oh, maybe I can have
a fairy bumper sticker.

344
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:08,897
Alright, I can see. That
it's real. Fairies do exist.

345
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,074
It's too late. Your
sentence begins tomorrow.

346
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,384
No, no, no...There's got to be a way
to postpone this like jury duty.

347
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:19,897
I'm sure up here you have fairy duty
or whatever it is you have up here.

348
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,413
I got the coaches breathing down my neck

349
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:23,537
and I've got to patch things
up with my girlfriend.

350
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:29,985
The interrupting thing.
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:33,096
Any assignment you miss,
you get another week.

352
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:37,436
And if you fail your terms of service
or tell anyone you're a tooth fairy,

353
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:39,354
your time will be extended indefinitely.

354
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:42,024
- Oh really? I'm not leaving.
- Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

355
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:43,251
No.

356
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:07,631
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:10,695
For what?

358
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:16,273
- What I said last night?
- Which part?

359
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,340
All of the parts that
deeply offended you.

360
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,406
Okay, everything I've ever said.

361
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:29,104
Or thought. Even before I met you.

362
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:45,457
- Want to come in?
- Oh yeah.

363
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:47,732
You can spend that
one on one time with Randy.

364
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,932
Yeah.

365
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:55,615
You know what,
let me go to my car

366
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:57,680
and get something
and I'll be right back.

367
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:02,988
Me and Randy.
Alright, yeah.

368
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,564
- I don't know you could shred like that.
- What do you want?

369
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,973
Well, I bought you a present.
Can you guess what it is?

370
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,785
Is it a puppy?

371
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:30,871
Why it's a guy and a puppy?
It's one of my hockey sticks.

372
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,095
And now after I signed your pal...

373
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:38,484
The "Tooth Fairy"

374
00:26:38,485 --> 00:26:41,786
Now, it's worth lot
of money. There you go.

375
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,812
Okay, I'm just going to
leave it right here.

376
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:51,938
I bet you get a lot of chicks
with that guitar, don't you?

377
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:53,100
Can we stop this now?

378
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,641
- Stop what?
- You're just like my mom's last boyfriends.

379
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:58,261
Just pretending to be
nice to me to impress her.

380
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:02,782
You're wrong. I'm much better
looking than your mom's past boyfriends.

381
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,156
Big boy pound for
trying to break the ice.

382
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:10,875
- No, it's going away.
- Look, I have to get back to practice.

383
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,749
Okay, how about you
come over to my place.

384
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,470
I could break out my old drum
kit, you can bring your guitar

385
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,912
and we could have a
jam session together.

386
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,903
Or how about I just go and tell
my mom you're actually pretty cool.

387
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:24,209
- and you stop trying to bond with me.
- I'll take that deal.

388
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:28,542
You'll never believe what Randy
said about you after you left.

389
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,561
He said that you're
actually pretty cool.

390
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:36,271
- Well, I am pretty cool.
- We'll see.

391
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:41,729
But whatever you're doing is
working so why don't you keep it up.

392
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:56,288
- Hmmm, who's T?
- I have no idea. I don't know.

393
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:58,589
What I do know is I would love
for you to close your eyes

394
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,199
coz I have an amazing surprise.

395
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,579
- Really. Okay.
- Yeah. Alright.

396
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,612
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

397
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,357
I'll be right back.

398
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,194
Is my surprise 6 foot 3
with dark brown eyes.

399
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:15,738
- Oh, you'll find out shortly.
- I love surprises!

400
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:19,293
Get ready!

401
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:28,134
- I know you're right in front of me.
- You should keep your eyes closed.

402
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,371
Okay.

403
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:36,708
- Everything's okay. Don't peek.
- Okay.

404
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,443
- I need some air.
- What?

405
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:44,312
- I'm not feeling well.
- Oh, should I come over.

406
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:49,016
- No, no. Give me some toilet paper.
- Of course, where is it?

407
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:52,822
It's upstairs in the bathroom.
It's way upstairs.

408
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,302
Oh my gosh!

409
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:58,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

410
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:00,116
- Who's this?
- It's me. It's Tracy.

411
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,358
- Tracy who?
- Tracy, your case worker.

412
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,932
Listen, your first assignment
is just falling asleep

413
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:05,948
so get yourself over quick.

414
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:09,887
- To 663 Shelter Cove.
- I thought that was a dream.

415
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:11,185
- Well, think again.
- Derek.

416
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,622
- Oh no, no.
- Where are you?

417
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:16,543
Bushes. Please don't come any
closer you can't see me like this.

418
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,824
It will ruin your
romantic image of me.

419
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:21,502
Oh, honey.
You are so sick.

420
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:26,830
I checked the entire bathroom
I couldn't find anything.

421
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:29,246
You got to look underneath the sink.
Underneath the sink.

422
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,703
Way back deep underneath the sink.

423
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,298
Okay.

424
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:36,725
You heard the rules.
You can't miss an assignment.

425
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,789
Plus those wings will stay on
your back until you get that tooth.

426
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:43,539
- Oh, man.
- You could clean up a little.

427
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:56,991
My wing.

428
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,587
- Delicately done. Well done.
- I can't believe this is happening.

429
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,065
Well, it is happening so can you get
in the house please and fetch the tooth.

430
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,537
No, no, no...I'm not going anywhere.
Why don't you go in?

431
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:15,111
- Oh, because it's not my job.
- That doesn't make any sense.

432
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,217
You're a fairy so why don't
you just go in and get the tooth?

433
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:18,877
Because I'm not a
winged fairy, alright.

434
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,849
I'm a case worker fairy which actually
bears a lot more responsibility.

435
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,360
You know, those little filing and
putting stuff along. It's tricky.

436
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,380
Ah, so what you're saying
is you're not good enough.

437
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:28,189
I'm not saying that.

438
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:30,349
- And they stuck you behind the desk.
- Now, I tell you what...

439
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,859
They did, alright, there's a lot of
wing discrimination in the workplace.

440
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,203
Very funny. Okay, tell me how are you
going to enter the house and get the tooth?

441
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:38,890
- Maybe I'll wing it.
- Brilliant. How are you going to get in the house?

442
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:41,706
- On a wing and a prayer.
- This is very very funny stuff.

443
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:42,698
But how are you going to get the tooth?

444
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:44,418
Which wing of the house
should I start with first?

445
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:45,721
Do you want another week?

446
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,996
No, no, no. I don't want
another minute of this.

447
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:51,098
So what do you suggest, Einstein?
I can't fly so do what?

448
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,161
How about you shrink yourself
down and slide under the front door?

449
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,887
Of course, just shrink
and slide in.

450
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,655
Yeah, that's what anybody
would do in this situation.

451
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:06,263
- Is this going to hurt?
- Let's hope so.

452
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,331
- Come on.
- And how do I get big again?

453
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:11,514
Oh, it's automatic. From
the moment you shrink

454
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:14,512
you start to gradually regroup.
It only takes about an hour.

455
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,423
Come on.

456
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:22,863
- I can't believe this.
- Eat it.

457
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:24,969
Shut up.

458
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,207
Do you like it?

459
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:32,743
Yum, yum, Derek Thompson.

460
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,846
Nice.

461
00:31:45,718 --> 00:31:48,892
Oh, not so brave now,
little wee man.

462
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,006
No, no, no, no, no...

463
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,592
Wing jokes aren't so funny now,
are they? The shoes on the other foot.

464
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,817
- Okay, okay
- Now, you should shoe me some respect.

465
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,827
I'll show you some respect when I get

466
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:02,566
bigger, I'm going to get up there
put that shoes on your face.

467
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,793
- You shouldn't upset me.
- Is that the best you got?

468
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:11,707
- Just take the money.
- Hey, watch it. Don't throw money.

469
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,433
Money's heavy.
Money is heavy.

470
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:23,888
I hate this. I can't believe...
Oh my wing, my wing.

471
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:24,888
I'm the tooth fairy.
I'm the tooth fairy.

472
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:38,414
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I saw something.

473
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:41,718
- What did you see?
- It was a little tiny man.

474
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,510
Nice kitty. Don't hurt me, kitty.

475
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:22,672
I'm a tooth fairy.
Disappear. Kitty be gone.

476
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:03,711
- Derek.
- Carl.

477
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:07,113
- Come cuddle with me.
- No.

478
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:10,227
- What?
- Going to bed. Still not well.

479
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:15,494
I'll call you when I'm bigger
I mean better.

480
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:19,218
Hello hockey fans. I'm Steve Libby
coming to you from Wolf Den

481
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:23,520
here in Lansing, Michigan.
Home of the Lansing Ice Wolves.

482
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,550
We're about to see the potentially
historic debut of an 18-year old phenol

483
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:32,634
Mick Donnelly who is just about set
to take the ice for the first time.

484
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:36,138
- So kid, you pumped up for your first game?
- Yeah, pops. I'm super pumped.

485
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,039
It just means one last game
till I'm out of here and into the begs.

486
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:40,681
You know what, I'm done being generous.

487
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:44,588
This is my kingdom, you're in my kingdom
now. I'm the king. You're not even a prince.

488
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:46,745
You know what you are, you're
like one of those little guys in tights

489
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:50,713
running around the court in a peppy wig.

490
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,140
Looks like you've been dethroned.

491
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:38,355
This is it. Final minute, regulation time.
The Ice Wolves lead the Roughnecks 2-1.

492
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:42,541
And the kid Donnelly has more than lived up to
the height. He's still working on that hat trick.

493
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,227
Off the face off, the puck
comes back to the Roughnecks.

494
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,211
There's a quick shot. Nice save.

495
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,062
The puck goes into the corner
and Donnelly picks it up.

496
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,781
Oh, now he puts on the brake
and spins out of trouble.

497
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:57,431
Whoa, look at him flying, Jim.

498
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:01,237
He beats another defender.
And here he comes.

499
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:03,623
Donnelly is pressing up the ice.

500
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:05,709
What a move!

501
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,734
He's going to the Roughnecks
like they're a bunch of blinded mules.

502
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:12,906
Donnelly surfing around the Roughneck goal.
He looks upfront to pass.

503
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:14,471
Now, he kicks off the board.

504
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:23,005
Now, Donnelly cruise himself off the
board and takes a pass from centre.

505
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:24,465
He looks to shoot.

506
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:35,579
No, not now.

507
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:43,657
What a move! Crashing open ice
hit to Donnelly and he's down.

508
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:46,590
Like Thompson was going to clear
Lambert out of the zone and suddenly,

509
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:50,982
instead he just dropped
to the ice, no one even touched him.

510
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:01,943
Hey, Thompson, you cost me a
hat trick and an interview on ESPN.

511
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:05,383
Hey, get over here.
I want to talk to you.

512
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,735
What are you doing?
Let's get out of here.

513
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:17,509
No, no, not...I'm very busy right now.
No autographs, I'm busy.

514
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:19,871
Fine, I'll wait.

515
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:22,744
What are you guys talking about?

516
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:27,326
- What's he wearing?
- Check out his feet.

517
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:35,867
Disappear.

518
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:39,369
No, no, no. Either you
come out or we're coming in.

519
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,060
- One...
- Stop it.

520
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,732
Two...

521
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:48,768
Three!

522
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:01,683
What happened? Why are you late?
Where have you been?

523
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,358
- Don't talk to me.
- Why are you wet?

524
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,834
- Shut up and I hate this job.
- What's that smell?

525
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:11,434
That's intense. I can't breathe.
That's too much.

526
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:15,725
- Hello.
- Hi.

527
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,372
- What the...
- Mom, I'm home.

528
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:25,202
Where's the kid?

529
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,404
- Be nice, be respectful and nice.
- I just came out of a toilet. You think I care?

530
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:39,765
Ah, Mama Fairy, there is your
tooth. So you do it with it, whatever

531
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,953
it is you do here in Fairy
World with your teeth.

532
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:47,300
Mr. Thompson, according to your case worker,
you're exactly embracing the Tooth Fairy spirit.

533
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:50,377
Really, is that what my case worker said?
So you called her and told her that.

534
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:53,235
Well, let me tell you something.
My case worker here has wing envy.

535
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,532
- Not true.
- It is true!

536
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:56,827
I am a giant fan of the job I do.
And all the administrating...

537
00:41:56,926 --> 00:41:58,738
- You hate this job.
- I love it. I look forward to it.

538
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,408
No you don't.
You hate this.

539
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:01,781
Will you two stop it?

540
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:04,809
Just look at what you
have done to this family.

541
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:10,016
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

542
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:11,372
I don't know.

543
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:13,272
Am I home yet?

544
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:20,629
It's not funny.

545
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,602
Did you see the dog?
His eyes were like that.

546
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:24,039
You overdid it.

547
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,532
Fairy Godmother, who is your
supervisor? Who is above you?

548
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,350
Gandhi? Who do I talk to?

549
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:31,053
Because I want to file
a complaint right now.

550
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:33,581
- You have another assignment.
- Another tooth. Are you kidding me?

551
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,419
Sometimes, there's a double-header.

552
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,987
Come on, just tell me where the tooth
is so I could get it and just go home.

553
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:42,865
Oh no, not until the child falls asleep.
Till then, I'm afraid you have to wait.

554
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,052
One kid's falling asleep in the afternoon,
another kid's up all night.

555
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:30,406
- Cup of tea.
- Good tea?

556
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,026
Refreshing.

557
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:02,711
Hi-ya, you feeling any better?

558
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:05,185
Yeah, a little bit. How
about you guys come on up?

559
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:07,892
- Hi Derek!
- Hi gorgeous!

560
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:11,353
Actually I have a
really big favour to ask.

561
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:13,834
Tess and I just got a last
minute invitation to...

562
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:17,332
- To beauty makeover party!
- Nice.

563
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,736
A beauty makeover party and I
was wondering because you're not

564
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:25,365
getting along so well now if Randy could
hang out with you for a little while.

565
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:29,961
(Please)

566
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:35,341
Yeah, yes, of course.

567
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:38,437
Super. Great. Thank you.
I'll make it up to you.

568
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:41,255
- Be good. Have fun.
- Bye.

569
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:45,615
Awesome.

570
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,005
I can see hockey's
been really good to you.

571
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:16,080
You want to hang with me or
do you want to go get a beauty makeover.

572
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:22,965
- Pretty cool stuff in here, huh.
- Yeah. Whatever.

573
00:45:23,398 --> 00:45:25,151
Why don't you take one
down? See how it sounds.

574
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:26,696
I don't want to.

575
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:29,152
Here. Give it a shot.

576
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:31,627
- Please don't, no.
- No, give it a shot.

577
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,505
Let's see how it sounds.
Go ahead.

578
00:45:40,686 --> 00:45:43,142
That sounds great.
I'm going to go check out

579
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,101
the drums and the sticks
and in the meantime

580
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:48,102
you just keep practicing coz
all that is just awesome.

581
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,825
- Hi, Randy.
- Hey, what's up?

582
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:12,118
- You sound pretty good.
- Thanks.

583
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:17,451
- Are you going to play in the Talent Show?
- Kelly, there you are.

584
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:20,147
- Why are you talking to Elmo boy?
- Don't be a jerk, Ben.

585
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,093
- Your dad's waiting. We have to go.
- Bye, Randy.

586
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:26,900
Bye.

587
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:30,658
Don't even think about talking
to her. You got it, loser?

588
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:31,300
Okay.

589
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,654
You should put this away
coz you stink.

590
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:40,176
- What are you doing with Randy's guitar?
- I don't know.

591
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,079
- You should give it back to him.
- Okay.

592
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,135
Now you could get out of here.
Beat it.

593
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:01,956
- Oh, you are in trouble now.
- We'll see.

594
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:05,542
Oh, I know, we'll see.
Can you beat two pair?

595
00:47:05,543 --> 00:47:06,984
Call me and find it out.

596
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:10,828
Oh, big boy put $10 on this big
boy totals. Look at that, me too,

597
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,352
I'm not scared coz it's aces over kings.

598
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:17,569
- Flush.
- No.

599
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:23,193
- Yes.
- Nice.

600
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:30,141
Can I ask you something?

601
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,366
It's about your body and how
it's changing, isn't it?

602
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:40,097
What?

603
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:45,833
You know, everything that's happening to you
and your body now is completely natural.

604
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,359
Stop talking! Stop talking!
Eeew! No! Stop talking!

605
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:54,057
- Okay, okay. Well, you...
- That wasn't what I was going to ask you at all.

606
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:56,719
- Okay, okay. Alright.
- That wasn't even close.

607
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:59,343
Big boy pound for not wanting
to talk about puberty.

608
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:08,207
Thank goodness. Believe me.
I don't want to talk about it either.

609
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:11,818
Alright, so what's up seriously?

610
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:16,300
Alright, well. There's this Talent
Show coming up at my school and...

611
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:17,969
Okay.

612
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:25,035
My mom thinks I should play in it
and I'm kind of...I don't know.

613
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:29,071
- Well, maybe you should play in it.
- Yeah?

614
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:35,442
Yeah, yeah. You'll be great.
I heard you play. You're really good, man.

615
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:38,661
And the chicks they
love guitar players.

616
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:42,889
- We're back!
- Hey, baby. We're up here.

617
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:45,163
Don't tell your mom
I said that about girls.

618
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,460
- Hi boys!
- Hi!

619
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:50,588
- How did it go?
- Well, I lose some chips.

620
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:53,917
- Does not!
- He absolutely does and you look...

621
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:58,068
- Gorgeous!
- You took the words right out of my mouth.

622
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,213
You guys hungry?
How about we go get some supper?

623
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:02,534
Love to.

624
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,541
Where did you go, then?

625
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:14,169
Oh no.
You guys got to go.

626
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,144
Is someone hurt?

627
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:17,248
No, not hurt the way
that you have to be worried.

628
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:20,301
And both of you look beautiful
and I will call you later. I'm so sorry.

629
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,345
- Okay.
- Bye.

630
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,923
- Shrinking paste.
- Nope. Not that again.

631
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,988
- Amnesia dust.
- No.

632
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:29,918
- Flying.
- Bad wing. Forget it.

633
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:34,643
Hey, and by the way, your all-purpose
magic generator button, it doesn't work.

634
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:35,825
It's broken.

635
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:40,192
- Here's an idea, brain box. Why don't you...
- Don't touch my pouch. It's my pouch.

636
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:41,125
- That was too much.
- What do you want?

637
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,135
I'm just saying, you got the
magical invisibility spray.

638
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:45,600
Okay, that's relatively
the approved.

639
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:48,086
Yeah, I know that.

640
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:55,434
Ignore my last comment.

641
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:07,699
Hey, what a surprise. It doesn't work.
Your stuff stinks.

642
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:12,490
- Nice.
- Till it wears off.

643
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,403
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

644
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:28,840
Go.

645
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:37,172
Are you lost?
Can we help you?

646
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,370
How would you like
a little amnesia dust?

647
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:49,791
- Where am I?
- Just go to the white light, my friend.

648
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:54,910
Nice doggie.

649
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:57,639
No, not me, doggie.

650
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,800
What is this?

651
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:05,943
- It's a long and delightful story.
- Where's the tooth?

652
00:51:06,665 --> 00:51:08,642
Can I get a little help here?

653
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:12,711
That would be all.

654
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:20,369
You might just be the
worst tooth fairy ever.

655
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:22,816
- Oh, by the way, I need some more stuff.
- Stuff?

656
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:25,943
Stuff. The magic powder, the gunk,
the stuff. I need some, notify Q.

657
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:28,089
No, no more stuff.

658
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:31,486
Well, that's brilliant. I have a week and a
half left on my job. How am I suppose to do that?

659
00:51:31,492 --> 00:51:35,379
I'm sorry, we're running very low on
funding. And would you like to know why?

660
00:51:35,476 --> 00:51:41,790
- No, not really.
- Because children aren't believing as they used to.

661
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:48,931
It's not just us. It's unicorns, leprechauns,
dragons, all those departments. Completely gone.

662
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,875
If this trend continues, Tooth
Fairly Land would cease to exist.

663
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:59,569
No child will ever again receive
a visit from a Tooth Fairy. Ever.

664
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:02,887
No more visit from the Tooth Fairy.
So what?

665
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:08,465
You really don't get it, do you?

666
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:14,655
You don't see the children fantasies,
their abilities to imagine are important.

667
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,353
Why? It nourishes their very souls.

668
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:19,948
It's the foundation that
allows them to dream.

669
00:52:20,038 --> 00:52:24,628
Dreams are bad.
They're bad. They're useless.

670
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,937
- You're done.
- For the week?

671
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:32,225
No, for the night. Unless, you
wish to stay for Fairy-eke.

672
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:35,564
Oh my....No.

673
00:52:49,468 --> 00:52:51,269
I got what you need.

674
00:52:53,687 --> 00:53:00,112
- What's that?
- Goods, stuff, package, bag, bomb, the juice.

675
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:04,238
The Bing, the Bang, Frisco special,
pink lady, little drummer boy.

676
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:05,286
Who are you?

677
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,417
Zingy. But you can call
me whatever you want.

678
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,206
You can call me Sigma, Zigmaister.

679
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,772
- Please stop talking.
- You know, they want you to fail.

680
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:17,051
- What?
- Think about it. You fail. They talk on more time.

681
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:21,205
It's like credit card debt, man.
They just want to keep you paying forever.

682
00:53:22,454 --> 00:53:26,900
- Yeah?
- You really want to play that game.

683
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:28,599
- So...
- A thousand bucks.

684
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:31,907
- A thousand bucks. You're killing me, Zingy.
- How bad do you want this to end?

685
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,645
Can I write you a check?

686
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,025
Oh, my goodness!

687
00:53:49,942 --> 00:53:51,423
You can see me?

688
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:54,705
Oh, man.
This better work.

689
00:53:54,786 --> 00:53:56,948
Oh no, what is that?

690
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,112
What are you doing?

691
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:14,690
What did Zingy give me?

692
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,455
- Just stay calm.
- 911. 911.

693
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:24,667
- Fine, I just need the tooth.
- There's an alien on my porch.

694
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:37,132
You are amazing.
Lily is so tagged off

695
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:39,778
because she has to send another
fairy to clean up your mess.

696
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:43,150
I'd learned my lesson.
Never buy black market stuff.

697
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:44,964
I can't go through another
two weeks without it.

698
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:47,145
Yes, you can, friend.

699
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:51,444
You just have to surrender to a higher
power and take it one day at a time.

700
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:55,816
Hello. Case workers decide
who can see us and who can't.

701
00:54:55,821 --> 00:54:56,880
Which is something you'd know

702
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:59,296
if you ever paid me any attention,
ever listened to everything I say.

703
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,112
But no.
You always...

704
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,574
Shut up!

705
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:07,387
Hey, my friend, you really
need to get yourself cleaned up.

706
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,447
If you want I can give you a pamphlet.

707
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,446
Oh and FYI, your sentence
is being extended.

708
00:55:12,447 --> 00:55:14,861
Lily just tagged on
another week so well done.

709
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:19,301
- Great. Just what I need.
- I think it is what you need, friend.

710
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:22,872
Listen, I can give you fresh
supplies right now on one condition.

711
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:24,570
From now on, you follow the rules.

712
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:28,543
You embrace the fairy spirit and
you start listening to old muggings here.

713
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:32,563
Fine. I'll be the best Tooth Fairy ever.

714
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,573
You keep running out on me
to see I don't even know who

715
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:41,806
and then you never call and
when I do finally hear from you

716
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:44,360
it's to bail you out of jail.

717
00:55:44,882 --> 00:55:46,794
What's going on with you?

718
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:51,135
I want to tell you
but I can't.

719
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:53,277
Why not?

720
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:57,313
I just can't.

721
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,781
I know what this is. This
is you acting up because

722
00:56:01,782 --> 00:56:03,112
you are afraid of making a commitment.

723
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,798
You're nervous by us
getting serious, aren't you?

724
00:56:06,744 --> 00:56:10,204
Yes, that's it. You know me so well.

725
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:12,309
I'm nervous about how
serious we're getting.

726
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,331
What?

727
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:23,919
You're a woman and frankly
you wouldn't understand.

728
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,593
What?

729
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:26,348
No.

730
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,688
No, I'm not nervous
about us getting serious.

731
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,152
As a matter of fact, I wouldn't even
think about getting serious with you.

732
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:36,381
What?

733
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:46,166
I'm afraid and Carl I love you so much.

734
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:50,359
I'm scared of messing up
and I'm scared of losing you.

735
00:56:54,488 --> 00:56:56,433
I understand.

736
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,796
So glad you could share that with me.

737
00:56:59,008 --> 00:57:01,709
Where can I get some of that?

738
00:57:02,124 --> 00:57:05,261
What are you doing?
Are you oiling up your abs again?

739
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,602
- I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

740
00:57:07,677 --> 00:57:11,060
Hey, I've been stepped on,
flushed, bitten and arrested.

741
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:14,963
Will you stop complaining? You
promised to embrace the fairy spirit.

742
00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:18,348
Oh, I'm embracing the
fairy spirit, alright.

743
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:20,162
But I'm doing it...

744
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:25,824
My way.

745
00:57:26,762 --> 00:57:30,746
- I'm not sure that's in the rules.
- Oh yeah.

746
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:08,947
I'm just here for the tooth, sir.
Just the tooth.

747
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:13,373
I'm going to take my glove away.

748
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,026
That's it.

749
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:22,635
Now, just hand over the tooth.
Nice and easy.

750
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:31,369
Let it go. Let it go.
I said let it go.

751
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:37,214
Very good.
You have a good night, sir.

752
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:51,947
- Who are you?
- I'm the Tooth Fairy.

753
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:55,351
Oh yeah.

754
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:02,546
You got it?
Alright, let's go.

755
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:05,258
Alright, Mick, how's life is
Lansing so far for you?

756
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,970
It's been good. You know,
I'm the new blood of the team and...

757
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:09,118
you know, some of
these wolves are getting

758
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,516
a little bit longer than
tooth if you know what I mean.

759
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:13,654
When you say longer than
tooth that would seem to be

760
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,730
a veiled reference to Derek
Thompson "The Tooth Fairy"

761
00:59:16,835 --> 00:59:19,129
It's not a rivalry, you know.
I respect my elders.

762
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,798
Is Thompson taking
you under his wing?

763
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,510
No, man. His wings are
tattered. My wings are brand new.

764
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:25,700
I'm ready to fly and you know,
I like to do my own thing.

765
00:59:25,805 --> 00:59:28,412
Alright, a confident young hockey player.
Good luck this afternoon.

766
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:29,768
Thank you very much.

767
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:30,916
Now, the Ice Wolves dumped the puck

768
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,106
in the New Haven zone and
we can make a line change.

769
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:33,989
Mick, get ready!

770
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:36,503
- Finally.
- Hey, good luck out there, buddy.

771
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:37,721
Okay.

772
00:59:37,722 --> 00:59:39,651
No, I mean it. I think
you're going to do great

773
00:59:39,652 --> 00:59:41,268
coz you're the bustiest
hockey player ever.

774
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:42,527
Whatever.

775
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:45,134
Mick, change, change!
Hit them. Hit them.

776
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:46,804
- Yeah.
- Come on, sport.

777
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:51,338
Donnelly jumps into the play
and takes a cross slice pass.

778
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,194
The Ice Wolves trying
to cross the boom line.

779
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:55,489
They're scrambled in
front of the net now.

780
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,617
These two rivals starting to get
a little feisty with each other.

781
01:00:16,735 --> 01:00:18,900
Oh yeah.

782
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:23,540
Alright, here we go!
Here we go! Here we go!

783
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:27,503
Puck goes in the corner but
Motley chases it down.

784
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:30,801
- What's up with Donnelly, Jim?
- Donnelly, get in there.

785
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:35,129
The puck squirts loose around the board.

786
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,205
Now Donnelly picks it up and speeds
to the point looking to set up a play.

787
01:00:38,216 --> 01:00:39,734
Beat them, beat them,
beat them!

788
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:41,299
Hi!

789
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:43,594
He takes a hell of a fall!

790
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:45,103
What happened there, Jim?

791
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:47,460
- Who hit him?
- Did someone hit him, Jim?

792
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,273
What is going on?

793
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:57,869
- What's he doing?
- Stop it.

794
01:00:59,195 --> 01:01:00,502
Is he laughing?

795
01:01:07,759 --> 01:01:09,173
Donnelly, are you okay, kid?

796
01:01:10,951 --> 01:01:12,052
What?

797
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:16,315
- Are you trying to test me, kid?
- Get off the ice!

798
01:01:16,365 --> 01:01:19,587
If you don't want to play games you
can head over to Health Care Centre.

799
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:21,453
Get out of here, right now. Move it.

800
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:29,227
So, what did I miss?

801
01:01:35,544 --> 01:01:37,469
Why do you bark?

802
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:51,137
I'm not going to be ready. I
might get up there and blow it.

803
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:53,615
No, you'll be fine. We just
got to keep practicing, come on.

804
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:56,649
Everyone's going to laugh at me.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

805
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:02,811
Maybe they will or maybe you'll
blow the roof off the place, huh.

806
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:06,432
Man, you're good but you'll
not going to find out if you quit.

807
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:10,141
You can't score if
you don't take the shot.

808
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,182
Yeah, when was the
last time you took a shot?

809
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:22,291
Listen, when I first
started I was a scorer.

810
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,988
First round draft pick of the
Devils. Playing in the begs.

811
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:26,288
So what happened?

812
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,325
I busted my shoulder
one night in Chicago.

813
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:31,827
They sent me down to the minors
to recover and it took forever.

814
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:34,003
I got so angry and
frustrated, one night in a game

815
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,611
I got into some meat head from New Haven.
I knocked out a couple of his teeth,

816
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:41,133
the crowd went crazy and they
started calling me "The Tooth Fairy"

817
01:02:41,134 --> 01:02:43,532
And it's stuck.

818
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:48,221
And I haven't scored in years.

819
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,263
But I got more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league.

820
01:02:57,158 --> 01:02:59,484
Like isn't your
shoulder all healed now?

821
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,707
Yeah, it's just not the same.

822
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:06,883
But how do you know? You don't even try.

823
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:09,890
You can't score if you
don't take the shot.

824
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,684
I tell you what...
I will if you will.

825
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,868
Okay. I'll take that deal.

826
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,282
I have another tooth.

827
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,686
That must be good.
That moment.

828
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,650
When you hand over the tooth.

829
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:49,196
No, I'm not interested.
Just wondering, you know.

830
01:03:49,197 --> 01:03:50,491
How it felt?

831
01:03:50,602 --> 01:03:52,192
Why don't you find out yourself?

832
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:53,990
We've been through this,
I'm not a winged fairy.

833
01:03:54,068 --> 01:03:56,767
Okay, okay, explain to me one
more time. Why can't you have wings?

834
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:58,841
Sorry, do you know nothing
about fairy evolution?

835
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:02,089
Fairy evolution. Who wrote that?
Charles Drawing?

836
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:05,737
Inspired, really.
According to fairy evolution

837
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:07,774
some fairies can grow
wings and some can't.

838
01:04:07,814 --> 01:04:09,849
And you know, I'm
one of the unlucky ones.

839
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:12,719
Tracy, you don't have to
have wings to be a tooth fairy.

840
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:17,512
- Remember you got all of these.
- That is true.

841
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:21,845
Somehow, you got to show them
your strengths, speed, agility, flexibility.

842
01:04:23,617 --> 01:04:25,618
And how am I going to do that?

843
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:28,085
Around the cones! Around the
cones! Around the cones!

844
01:04:28,086 --> 01:04:29,962
Quick feet!
Quick feet!

845
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:38,823
No, come back!
Come back!

846
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:44,131
- Where are you doing?
- Look at this...

847
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:47,134
It's three feet high. You're
eight feet tall. Come back.

848
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:54,042
- Oh, dinosaur!
- No, it's not!

849
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,373
What the heck!

850
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:03,846
Come on.
Rollercoaster.

851
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:06,994
- Come on.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

852
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:08,512
- Are you okay?
- No.

853
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:17,563
Bathroom robe is
my worst nightmare.

854
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:27,759
- I got it. I got it.
- I'm bad.

855
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:38,592
You look like a beautiful
reindeer with your legs.

856
01:05:38,593 --> 01:05:40,599
You can plant seeds. You're planting.

857
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:47,002
Not on the kid. On yourself.
Amnesia dust. Amnesia dust.

858
01:06:18,165 --> 01:06:21,191
You sound great.
You're going to kill them tomorrow night.

859
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:24,285
So, what do you think?

860
01:06:28,713 --> 01:06:34,475
Nice. That is big time.
Randy Harris. Talent Show.

861
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:36,138
I like that slot too.

862
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:37,625
You really think I can
be a famous rock star?

863
01:06:38,023 --> 01:06:41,019
Like Clapton or Hendrix
or Steve Ray Vaughn.

864
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,694
- You want to straight.
- Yeah.

865
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,477
Okay.

866
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:49,079
You're getting pretty good, right.

867
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,706
So let's say you keep
working at it really hard.

868
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:54,372
Then, let's say you
become the best 13-year old

869
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:56,298
guitarist in your neighbourhood.

870
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:59,454
Here's the deal: You got to remember
that are a lot of neighbourhoods out there

871
01:06:59,935 --> 01:07:02,603
with a lot of 13-year old
guitarist but somewhere out there,

872
01:07:02,604 --> 01:07:06,313
there's a 12-year old who's shredding,
I mean he's killing that guitar.

873
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:18,507
You know what.
Yeah, it's possible.

874
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:21,173
Cool.

875
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,007
Go get them.

876
01:07:24,842 --> 01:07:28,908
Late in the 3rd period, the Ice Wolves
are down 4-3 to the Arrows

877
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:32,142
Donnelly's getting a breather
but having another great game.

878
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:36,105
The Arrows leading scorer Springwood
takes the pass and he is on the move.

879
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,280
Mick, your line's up.

880
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:39,900
Hey old man, got a fresh
pair of defence on?

881
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:42,945
Ah, you'll never know,
kid. This might surprise you.

882
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:47,326
The Ice Wolves dumped the puck into
the Arrows zone and change lines on a fly.

883
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,829
That's suppose to put
Donnelly back in the game.

884
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,835
Out there, he's got the puck in roll
so they're crossing the blue line.

885
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,562
Change!
Change!

886
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:02,568
And here's comes Thompson on
the bed replacing Josh.

887
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:11,692
Thompson knocks Crosslink
flat on his back

888
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:14,664
and kicks the puck to neutral
zone where Browning picks it up.

889
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:18,418
Thompson jumps back into play
and Donnelly weeds around Crosslink.

890
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:23,111
Now, Thompson takes the pass
right on his stick as Donnelly flies in the play.

891
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:27,283
It's a 2 on 1 with Thompson of
all people leading the way.

892
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:27,805
Pass it!

893
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:31,872
You can see Donnelly screaming for
the puck but Thompson won't give it up.

894
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:39,902
Thompson looks to pass.
No, he beats the pass.

895
01:08:39,903 --> 01:08:42,822
He's got the top shelf wide open.

896
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:46,464
- Pass it!
- Pass!

897
01:08:48,586 --> 01:08:52,197
No.

898
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:56,871
What is he thinking?

899
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,710
The Arrows have numbers
they're coming up the ice.

900
01:09:02,801 --> 01:09:04,799
They shoot. They score.

901
01:09:06,954 --> 01:09:12,341
Jim, it looked like Thompson was
actually going to shoot and he just choked.

902
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:29,590
You're not a hockey player,
you're a sideshow attraction!

903
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:36,731
You know what, why don't you watch
tomorrow's game from the bench, you bum.

904
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,428
Great!

905
01:09:59,982 --> 01:10:03,719
- Hey honey, how was your game?
- Not good.

906
01:10:03,798 --> 01:10:06,212
- Derek, guess what? I
have another loose tooth.

907
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:06,960
Good for you, honey.

908
01:10:07,241 --> 01:10:10,904
- What's the matter, hon.?
- Everything. Nothing, you know. Forget it.

909
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:13,082
Can we go practice now?

910
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,025
You know what, can we skip today's
session. I just don't have it in me.

911
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,250
- But the Talent Show's tomorrow night.
- You'll be fine.

912
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:20,773
- I need at least one more run through it.
- No, you don't, okay.

913
01:10:20,844 --> 01:10:23,479
No, I do need it. I just
need a little more practice.

914
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,864
Just so I can get down.

915
01:10:24,931 --> 01:10:27,195
It doesn't matter what
you do in the Talent Show.

916
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:29,527
You're never going to be a famous rock
star. You're just going to be another

917
01:10:29,632 --> 01:10:32,588
kid with a guitar. So do yourself
a favour and just give it up, okay.

918
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:32,954
Derek!

919
01:10:32,955 --> 01:10:36,397
Look, baby. I'm sorry but
it's for his own good. Trust me.

920
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,744
Come on, Tess!

921
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:52,695
- What is wrong with you?
- I had a bad day.

922
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:54,779
- You had a bad day?
- Yeah, I had a bad day, okay.

923
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:57,071
No, no. That is not okay.

924
01:10:57,072 --> 01:10:59,523
You are never going to speak
to my children again.

925
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:03,909
- We are done.
- Carl.

926
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:10,355
You know what your problem is,
Derek? You can't say what if.

927
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,879
And you never will.

928
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:38,245
Okay. Okay.

929
01:11:39,783 --> 01:11:42,620
Okay, okay, okay.
Alright.

930
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:50,628
Who wants to hear some good news?
I do. Come on.

931
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,826
- Why are you here?
- Lily gave me this.

932
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:59,864
Obviously, it's just a permit but
the main thing is I'm on the way.

933
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:01,727
Okay well, you should be
on your way out of my place.

934
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:02,596
I'm going to bed.

935
01:12:02,597 --> 01:12:05,040
No, this is all thanks to you.
We got to go out and celebrate.

936
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:07,739
I know a place where all the hot
fairy godmothers hang out.

937
01:12:07,826 --> 01:12:08,941
Are you out of your mind?

938
01:12:08,942 --> 01:12:13,082
I just lost everything that's important
to me. My girlfriend, those kids.

939
01:12:13,099 --> 01:12:15,162
And I'll probably just
hang out my skates for good.

940
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:18,059
All because like an idiot I bought
into your tooth fairy garbage.

941
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:20,868
And look where it's gotten me.

942
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:23,795
What? You make one effort
after all these years

943
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:26,156
and it doesn't work out and
suddenly you're just going to give up?

944
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:30,912
It's not suppose to be that easy.
And you know it.

945
01:12:31,993 --> 01:12:37,672
I'll tell you what I do know. I
know that you don't have wings.

946
01:12:37,882 --> 01:12:40,745
So that means you can't fly.

947
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:45,656
That also means that you can never
ever ever be a tooth fairy.

948
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:48,505
And what happens if you try to
escape out of a 10-storey building?

949
01:12:48,506 --> 01:12:49,501
I'll tell you what happens.

950
01:12:49,554 --> 01:12:53,836
Splat! Just like that.

951
01:13:01,451 --> 01:13:03,237
You know what's really sad?

952
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,358
The person you hurt the most
with all your dream killing is not

953
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:09,112
Randy or Carl or even me.

954
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:13,821
- It's you.
- Get out.

955
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:16,655
- Fine.
- Good.

956
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:23,996
Fine.
I'm going to bed.

957
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:29,210
1:24 left in the 3rd period but the
Ice Wolves still trailing 1 to nothing.

958
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:33,421
And Derek Thompson is still
completely in the coach's doghouse.

959
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:36,029
I don't think he's seeing a second
of ice time the whole game here.

960
01:13:36,099 --> 01:13:37,002
Here we go.
Here we go.

961
01:13:37,003 --> 01:13:40,443
As he has all game on transport
tranquil the mute grove

962
01:13:40,444 --> 01:13:43,050
continues to replace
Thompson on the first line.

963
01:13:44,302 --> 01:13:46,492
Face off won by the Glover Myth.

964
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:49,260
Oh, what a hit!

965
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:52,858
Donnelly seals the puck. Now he's
rushing up the ice sure-handed.

966
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:54,474
Only Cloudy can get back.

967
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:56,769
Let's go, Mick.
Let's go, Mick.

968
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:03,599
This is classic, Jim. Every move
Donnelly makes comes unanswered.

969
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,962
Donnelly moves to his left. Oh,
he's got blood out of detention

970
01:14:06,963 --> 01:14:11,263
and Donnelly moves around him.
He's got the defence of Mcphee, he shoots.

971
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:13,975
Oh, it's a crossbar.

972
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:17,493
Hey, what happened?
He blew the whistle.

973
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,987
That behind the play, Jim.
Petranco got sucker punched

974
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:23,333
and I don't think he's getting up.

975
01:14:31,203 --> 01:14:38,111
Thompson. Go.
Go!

976
01:14:48,091 --> 01:14:49,306
Alright, here we go, boys!

977
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:51,706
The Ice Wolves have less
than a minute to score, Jim

978
01:14:51,707 --> 01:14:53,687
and send this game in overtime.

979
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:57,597
Off the face off, it's
Class ford with the puck

980
01:14:57,599 --> 01:15:00,465
and he start their driving
as the clock winds down.

981
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:05,158
I don't know, Jim. It looks to me like Thompson
is just going through the motions out there.

982
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:10,305
Thompson just got leathered!
How could that not be a penalty?

983
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:13,105
He just got tossed.

984
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,142
I think the Tooth Fairy just got
a taste of his own medicine.

985
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:32,323
Look at Thompson, Jim.

986
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:35,497
It looks like he's got some
jump back in those legs.

987
01:16:35,498 --> 01:16:38,543
Thompson's rushing across the ice
and I don't think it's to make friends.

988
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:41,369
Well, this is going to hurt.

989
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,819
No, he pulled off, Jim. He didn't
throw a check. Incredible!

990
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:50,239
He steals the puck and now is
barrelling down the ice.

991
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,368
- Look at him go!
- They just can't keep up with Thompson.

992
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:55,454
He's making moves we
haven't seen in a long time.

993
01:16:55,664 --> 01:16:57,541
What is that guy?

994
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:00,774
Thompson now has only
one defender to beat.

995
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:05,497
- He takes the stick on the face.
- I don't think he's going down.

996
01:17:05,598 --> 01:17:09,555
No, he stays on his feet.
He's going to shoot!

997
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,479
He shoots!

998
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:21,004
He scores!

999
01:17:38,313 --> 01:17:41,962
Derek Thompson has not take a shot
in nine years and one of the most

1000
01:17:41,963 --> 01:17:45,716
amazing shots I've ever seen
and ties it up at one-all.

1001
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:48,323
Call me the mayor of Southville.

1002
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:49,907
Let's do it again.

1003
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:57,053
Hey old man.
Not bad.

1004
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:04,353
Nice shot, dude!

1005
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:14,768
And here we go. We're under
20 seconds as both teams

1006
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:18,292
head to the centre line for a face off.

1007
01:18:24,043 --> 01:18:25,765
Oh no.

1008
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,179
The Ice Wolves win the draw.

1009
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,255
Here's a cross slice pass
to Thompson who ices it.

1010
01:18:35,274 --> 01:18:38,085
- Why would he do that, Ed?
- I have no idea, Jim.

1011
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:39,630
No, I can't leave now.

1012
01:18:39,723 --> 01:18:42,404
This is my last chance
to actually play the game.

1013
01:18:42,405 --> 01:18:43,730
To go out the way I came in.

1014
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:46,540
Well, I could cover for you.
After what I've seen, you deserve it.

1015
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:48,767
Thompson, what are you doing?

1016
01:18:49,014 --> 01:18:50,996
- Who's he talking to?
- Yeah, but aren't you just a trainee.

1017
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:54,351
- Isn't that breaking the rules?
- Please, I've learned from the best.

1018
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:55,783
But I do think, you should
look at the address

1019
01:18:55,784 --> 01:18:58,187
before you decide.

1020
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:06,531
It's Cary’s house.

1021
01:19:06,595 --> 01:19:11,407
- Hey 14, come on, let's go.
- Thompson! Get back in the game.

1022
01:19:11,471 --> 01:19:15,889
- I can go. Lily does not have to know.
- But I'll know.

1023
01:19:17,098 --> 01:19:19,597
This is my house to take care of.

1024
01:19:41,638 --> 01:19:45,189
- Let's do this.
- How? You can't fly.

1025
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:49,383
- Good time to learn.
- I knew you had it in you.

1026
01:19:58,087 --> 01:20:00,010
Go get them.

1027
01:20:08,253 --> 01:20:10,892
You want to fly you got to believe.

1028
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:14,547
No need to panic. It's
just a giant amnesia gun.

1029
01:21:14,548 --> 01:21:17,735
It's painless. You
won't remember a thing.

1030
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:26,703
Don't you forget about me...
You will.

1031
01:21:28,157 --> 01:21:30,580
Good luck finding your cars.

1032
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:58,893
- Tess.
- Derek.

1033
01:22:00,038 --> 01:22:02,723
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.

1034
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:10,529
- I like your costume.
- I have to tell you something.

1035
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:18,762
I was wrong. The tooth fairy.
It's real and it's me.

1036
01:22:19,058 --> 01:22:21,068
I know.

1037
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:25,929
No, honey, I'm not talking
about the hockey tooth fairy.

1038
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,939
I'm a real tooth fairy.

1039
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:32,101
No, you're not.

1040
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:48,813
- You are the real tooth fairy.
- It will just be our secret, okay.

1041
01:22:49,109 --> 01:22:50,917
Okay.

1042
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:36,019
Randy.

1043
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,041
What are you doing here?

1044
01:23:41,629 --> 01:23:46,302
- I have to talk to you.
- Go away.

1045
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:53,415
Listen. Those things I said
yesterday, I was wrong.

1046
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,415
I don't care.

1047
01:23:56,416 --> 01:24:01,576
You got to keep playing
guitar. You're really good.

1048
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:06,662
And nothing you love doing that
much could ever be a waste of time.

1049
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:10,982
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:30,216
Even if I wanted to, I can't.
I smashed my guitar, remember?

1051
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:32,924
Tonight is the Talent Show.

1052
01:24:36,444 --> 01:24:38,822
Hold on a second.

1053
01:24:55,171 --> 01:25:00,868
- Maybe this will help.
- Whoa, it's awesome.

1054
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:05,897
- How did you do that?
- All-purpose magic generator.

1055
01:25:07,924 --> 01:25:10,727
- What are you wearing?
- You'll find out.

1056
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:11,948
In the meantime,
put some clothes on.

1057
01:25:11,949 --> 01:25:14,751
We can still make
the Talent Show, okay.

1058
01:25:14,937 --> 01:25:16,975
Come on.

1059
01:25:20,724 --> 01:25:22,815
Derek.

1060
01:25:23,506 --> 01:25:27,562
Mommy! Derek is the tooth fairy.

1061
01:25:35,035 --> 01:25:40,140
You rented a fairy costume
to make it up to Tess.

1062
01:25:40,755 --> 01:25:45,592
Yes, that's what I did.

1063
01:25:46,636 --> 01:25:50,298
Hey mom, Derek got me a new guitar
and he's taking me to the Talent Show.

1064
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:54,615
- What time is it? You'll never make it.
- Don't worry about that. We can make it.

1065
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:58,485
You, that way. You guys, go upstairs
and get there soon. We'll see you.

1066
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,900
Oh yeah.

1067
01:26:02,969 --> 01:26:06,027
- Where's your car?
- No car. Let's go.

1068
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,564
Hang on.

1069
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:14,615
- How is this happening?
- It's okay, it's okay.

1070
01:26:14,832 --> 01:26:16,661
Yeah, but like, how was it possible?

1071
01:26:16,662 --> 01:26:19,846
Well, it all started one night I
got a summons underneath my pillow.

1072
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,207
What the heck is a summons?

1073
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:24,244
A summons is like an invitation. I
got an invitation to go to Fairyland.

1074
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,648
- Fairyland?
- It's where I got these cool wings.

1075
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:28,299
I met this guy up there named Tracy.

1076
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,376
He kind looks like a walking
toothpick with the eyes of a big tuna.

1077
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:34,245
By the way I can shrink
myself down to six inches.

1078
01:26:36,517 --> 01:26:37,837
Pretty good.

1079
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,983
What?

1080
01:26:48,014 --> 01:26:51,568
Sorry buddy, I've already
broken enough rules.

1081
01:27:01,414 --> 01:27:03,294
Randy, there you are. We've
been looking all over for you.

1082
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:06,842
You're coming up. Get in
there and tune up, come on.

1083
01:27:08,222 --> 01:27:10,027
- Another tooth.
- Thank you.

1084
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,793
You're welcome. I've got
a concert I got to get to.

1085
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,380
No, you skidded quite a
few rules tonight, Mr. Thompson.

1086
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:17,788
But wait, I took care of Carl.
I dusted Randy.

1087
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:21,310
And Tess, she's only six
so pretty soon she'll forget.

1088
01:27:21,545 --> 01:27:24,211
And even if she doesn't
at least now she'll...

1089
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:30,317
- She'll always...
- Always...what?

1090
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:37,796
She will always...
Believe.

1091
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,269
Like I will.

1092
01:27:41,504 --> 01:27:46,074
I get it. Dreams are
good for everyone.

1093
01:27:51,514 --> 01:27:59,616
Mr. Thompson, I hereby
relieve you of tooth fairy duty.

1094
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,174
- Ah, you're good.
- She's a pro.

1095
01:28:07,514 --> 01:28:12,132
- Congratulations.
- Put that away.

1096
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:22,699
I tend not to do the whole
physical contact thing.

1097
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,354
Oh, you like me.
I know you like me.

1098
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:26,913
You do the whole distant
administrator to me.

1099
01:28:26,914 --> 01:28:30,921
A thing which I understand but
somewhere in there, you like me.

1100
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:38,683
- You like me.
- Well, let's not get frisky.

1101
01:28:39,432 --> 01:28:42,912
- I really got to go.
- Yeah, could you wait just one second?

1102
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:47,704
- Tracy, I need another word with you.
- Ah, what's this about?

1103
01:28:47,797 --> 01:28:56,488
Anybody that can rehabilitate
Mr. Thompson more than deserves this.

1104
01:29:04,642 --> 01:29:08,093
- What is it?
- It's your wings, Tracy.

1105
01:29:08,574 --> 01:29:12,525
Wear them with pride,
every time you collect a new tooth.

1106
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:15,529
- You're a tooth fairy, buddy.
- I got my wings.

1107
01:29:15,534 --> 01:29:17,431
You got your wings.

1108
01:29:18,749 --> 01:29:23,271
- You need this.
- I don't know why I'm speaking like this.

1109
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:31,850
No...Thank you, my lady.

1110
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,784
Listen, this is all great and
I'm very very proud of you.

1111
01:29:34,785 --> 01:29:36,689
You're the tallest tooth
fairy in the world now.

1112
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:39,205
But I got to go. Somebody's
got to put me down.

1113
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:43,111
Tracy, would you like to
do the honours or shall I?

1114
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:49,006
- Oh, so honours..oh, a gift! Yeah.
- I'm afraid not.

1115
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:53,171
You'll not remember anything
that happened in Fairyland.

1116
01:29:53,172 --> 01:29:54,205
Why?

1117
01:29:54,346 --> 01:29:58,262
Coz that's just the way we do it.

1118
01:30:00,733 --> 01:30:02,314
I'll never forget you.

1119
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:10,486
I can't believe you
showed up at the rink.

1120
01:30:10,487 --> 01:30:12,584
It's just the way we do things.

1121
01:30:15,684 --> 01:30:19,421
Thank you, Tracy.
For everything.

1122
01:30:22,011 --> 01:30:26,780
You big, four-eyed giraffe,
back to the zoo.

1123
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:31,460
And you get that head
back to Easter Island.

1124
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:37,821
- Hammer Brothers are still in town.
- Let me meet those guys.

1125
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,831
- You're my man.
- And you are my fairy.

1126
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,612
How can we make us stay in touch?
Can we email?

1127
01:30:44,614 --> 01:30:46,386
That's what I'm thinking.
We should be able to email each other.

1128
01:30:46,387 --> 01:30:47,430
Do you blog?
I do blog.

1129
01:30:47,524 --> 01:30:48,972
You write a blog. I would
love to read your blog.

1130
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:50,321
You want to read my blog?

1131
01:30:50,084 --> 01:30:53,387
- Do you face book coz I could poke you?
- I love getting poked.

1132
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:12,216
Oh, there you are.
I couldn't find you.

1133
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:16,500
Yeah, I was just at...

1134
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:21,655
- I am so exited.
- Me too.

1135
01:31:22,105 --> 01:31:24,688
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1136
01:31:25,393 --> 01:31:28,057
- Hi, honey.
- Hi Derek!

1137
01:31:35,494 --> 01:31:40,430
And then we go for our last
performer of the night, Randy Harris!

1138
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:48,341
Randy!

1139
01:32:16,194 --> 01:32:18,717
Go Randy!

1140
01:33:38,533 --> 01:33:41,813
- Way to go, Randy!
- Great job!

1141
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,596
Great, Randy!
That's my kid!

1142
01:33:57,188 --> 01:34:01,258
Hey, I was just wondering
what if we got married?

1143
01:34:06,068 --> 01:34:09,513
What if we got married?

1144
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:17,499
That's what I said,
I said "what if"

1145
01:34:19,056 --> 01:34:21,067
- Yes!
- Yeah.

1146
01:34:30,073 --> 01:34:32,478
We're getting married.

1147
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,289
Yeah, whoa!
