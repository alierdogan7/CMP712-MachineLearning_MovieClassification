A real people person.

6
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,507
In high school,
I felt Iike that mouse

7
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,261
that gets dropped
into the snake cage
and just kinda sits there,

8
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,388
frozen, trying to blend in.

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,143
I guess I remember being
happy when I was a kid.

Back when you
just naturally expect
good things to happen.

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,780
Now I just expect the worst

13
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,450
and try not to
get my hopes up.

14
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,703
Which is why I'm here.

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,371
Does that answer
the question?

16
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,335
Usually people just say
where they're from and
where they worked before.

Great. (LAUGHS) I'm
already overqualified.

uptight about giving out

get in there with...

criticize your technique
the whole time?

and stake him out.

as your boss.

No, it's just
this work thing.

97

Yeah, I think it'd be
great if you went out,
did a Iittle social stuff.

98
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,983
Get out of your funk.

99
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,610
I have no funk.
I'm totally funkless.

with your friends.
I think it's a great idea.

What's wrong with me?

102
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,371
Well, you're sad.
I don't know how
to describe it.

103
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,875
It's Iike there's
a cloud following you.

104

and you're a virgin.

106

I don't ever see
you with any guys.

107
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,800

the Iast time you
brought a guy home.

you know I'm not

109
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,430
on Craigslist
having casual encounters?

110
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,432
Or when I was
away at the dorms?
You weren't there.

111
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,808
I talked to Amy.

112

to my college roommate?

113
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,436

flames on your Iaptop?

you go back to?

I don't know.

121
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,431
I'm fine here.

122
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,932
I would definitely go back.

123
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,435

Come on!

129
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,908
No. That wasn't a time.

130
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,746
Yeah. Okay.

131
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,289
Yeah.

Get in, retards.

133
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,511
So, here's what
I'm thinking. We're
budgeted for two rooms,

134
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,887
but if we share a room,

135
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,806
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.

136
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,516
What, drugs?
JEFF: That's exactly right.

137
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,644
Easy, Arnau,
we're messing
with you, pal.

for buffets and shit.

coke or anything

studying for an exam?

Biological
and Iife sciences.

144
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,909
Makes sense.
So what are you doing
interning at a magazine?

Close.

Wait, what about this one?

She wants to stop whoever

Yeah, I'm sure.

pretty amazing stuff, man.

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,542
I'll tell you about
the cat in the box theory,
it'll blow your mind.

00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,170
It's Iike I'm the only
one who really gets it.
You know?

199
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,047
I started this dialog

"Do the rules of quantum

"mechanics allow for
alternate histories?"

And he just blasted me.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
You know, people are
just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,

205
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,351
but they're just,
Iike, Iooking at
this Iittle sliver of time,

It's not a fixed thing,

I gotta do

What's his Iast name?

Sorry, ma'am,
he's a Iittle...

216
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,624
No, no,
it's a positive comment.
It's Iike complimenting him.

217
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,003
Oh. Oh, good.
Um, Kenneth Calloway.

218
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,172

219
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,637

Here. No photos,
that's a drag.

00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,402
Okay, good.
She still Iives here.
She Iives in this town.

225
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,654
Who is Liz McHollis?

226
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,739
She was a girl
I had a fling with

227
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,658
when my family used to
come here over the summers.

228
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,620
She was this really
smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blow job.

229
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,333
If there's one girl
that I still
think about, honestly.

230
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,173
Here she is. Look at you,
you went all rogue.
What did you get?

231
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,507
Got his name,
where he works.

232
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,842
Great.

233
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,469
What did you guys get?

234
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,474
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.

235
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,600
What?

236
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,478
He came here to hook up
with an old high
school girlfriend.

237
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,938
Seriously? That's
what you've been doing?

238
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,357
Well, I've been doing
other stuff too, but

239
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,651
maybe this will
change your attitude
a Iittle bit.

240
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,654
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.

241
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,739
So?

242
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,824
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.

243
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,493
I'd be weirded out
if some guy tried

244
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,119
to track me down
after 20 years.

245
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,039
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried
to track you down.

246
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,790
DARIUS: Why?
JEFF: Who would do that?

247
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,793
Tomorrow morning,
I'll go in.

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,671
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad

249
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,090
and get the scoop
on this yo-yo.

250
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,434

This is definitely it.

251
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
What a piece of shit.

252
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
AII right,
I'm goin' in.

253
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,316
How do I Iook,
Arnau? Good.

254
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,442
Good.

255
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,152
Can I go in?
No, you did
good Iast night,

256
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,780
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna
overwhelm the guy.

257
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,032
AII right?
Wish me Iuck.

258
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,876
So, uh...

259
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,714
Do you go out
a Iot back home,
Iike clubs and stuff?

260
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,258
Not really.

261
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,511
You know those
really tight Ieggings
that girls wear,

262
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,846
do you ever wear those?

263
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,139
No.

264
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,184
I think you would
Iook nice in them.

00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,286

My name is Jeff.

271
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,611
Look, I saw your ad
in the classifieds.

272
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,904
I wanna know if
you need a partner.

273
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,575
What's your mission?

274
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,035
What do you mean
what's my mission?

275
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,911
What's your reason
for going back?

276
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,833
Well, who wouldn't want
to go back? It's
an amazing opportunity.

277
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,793
To go back in time,
you know?

278
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,672
See gladiators
and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.

Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.

Who wouldn't want
to go back, Kenneth?

282
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,890
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?

283
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,939
Well, do you need a partner?

284
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,572
Can you Iook fear
and danger in the eye?

285
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,115
That's an odd question.

286
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,535
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye

287
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,746
and said, "Yes"?

288
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,208
Sure.

289
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,376
Get off my porch.

290
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,920
Let's start over.
Come on, we could be pals.

291
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,548
Let's go back in time.

292
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,344
Man, that smile...

293
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,138
What is that smile?

294
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,974
You don't know pain.

295
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,267
I don't know pain?

296
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,352
You don't know regret.

297
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah. AII right.

298
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,480
You don't know...
Okay.

299
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
Well, it was
really nice to meet you.

300
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,578
That's what I thought.

301
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,831
(SIGHING)

302
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,667
So, what'd he say?

303
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,420
Well, he's the real deal.
That ad is no prank.

304
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,215
He's not Iike retarded,
but there's something
wrong with this guy.

305
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,759
Definitely didn't
Iike my ass,
I'll tell you that.

306
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,511
So, what,
that's it?

307
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,304
Oh, no,
this just got good.

308
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,307
What makes you think
he won't slam
the door in my face, too?

309
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,476
'Cause you gotta be
sincere and charm him,
okay?

310
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,104
He's used to assholes
Iike me coming and
making fun of him.

311
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,274
Uh, also probably
none of the other people
were beautiful girls.

312
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,276
Easy, Arnau.
What?

313
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,319
But he's right.
Use that, too.

314
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,196
There's something off
about this guy, okay?

315
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,949
So you gotta go slow,
Iike you're trapping
a skittish animal.

316
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,285
You know, Iure him, play coy.

317
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,911
Girls know how to
do that shit.

318
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,456
You're dangling my vagina
out there Iike bait?

319
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,915
What if this guy's
a murderer?

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,126
What if he cuts me up into
Iittle pieces and eats me?

321
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,336
Then the story's even better.

322
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,659
Do you sell guns here?

323
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,329
What kind of guns?

324
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,663
I don't know.

325
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:48,084
Something sexy and affordable
with killing power.

326
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,006
You should try
C&R Guns in Wilkins.

327
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,175
The state of Washington
does not allow

328
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,677
the sale of firearms
in the business premises
of a grocer.

329
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,762
Hmm.

330
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
What about those thingies

331
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:08,480
with the spiky ball
at the end of
the chain things?

332
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,399
You know, with the...
Do you have those?

333
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,110
What exactly is
the intended use?

334
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,197
Is there a pest problem,
or hunting?

335
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,115
Well, if your ad had
been written properly,

336
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,117
I may have a better idea
of what I need.

337
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,288
My ad?
Yeah.

338
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,832
It's pretty sloppy.

339
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Excuse me?

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,042
You heard me.

341
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,503
I hope you worked harder
on your calibrations.

342
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,799

00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,841
Nobody's seen
my moves before.

511
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,135
Haven't brought
a candidate this far into
the training process.

512
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,428
Really?

513
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,597
We'll be Iearning
from each other from now on.

514
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,517
Good.

515
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,065
We still have to
discuss your reason
for going back.

516
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,110
That's classified
information.

517
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,529
I can appreciate that,
I respect that,

518
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,155
but I have
a certain responsibility

519
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
to keep as the Ieader
of this mission.

520
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,368
Then I have to tell you
that it's personal.

521
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,540
Darius, sometimes
I think we are progressing
in this mission,

522
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,626
and then other times,
I'm not so sure.

523
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,429
I'm going back to
stop my mother from dying
when I was 14.

524
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,436
How'd she die?

525
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,772
She was killed by some guy.

526
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,235
Just some guy
at a gas station
took her and killed her.

527
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,237
Oh, man.
Just some random thing?

528
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,655
Yeah.

529
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,875
Well, no, actually.

530
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,005
She was driving home.
It was really Iate,

531
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,009
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...

532
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,057
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.

533
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,061
Because I had to
have chocolate milk.

534
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,150
So Iike five minutes Iater,
she called me

535
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,404
to tell me that she
got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.

536
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,240
And her voice was Iike,

537
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,203
really excited,
Iike she was really happy.

538
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:37,126
And I was,
Iike, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.

539
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,798
That was the Iast time
I talked to her.

540
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,426
That's not your fault.

541
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,806
Yeah. That's
what they tell me.

542
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,562
AII right, Darius.

543
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,651
I think you're ready.
I trust you.

544
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,820
Good.

545
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,698
You should.

546
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,067
Jeff! Hey!

547
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,610
Hey. Liz,
it's great to see you.

548
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,529
Look at you.
Look at you.

549
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,822
So, this is where you Iive.

550
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,198
This is my house.

551
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,325
Well, Iook, I wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

552
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,202
I was gonna come,
but work's
getting crazy and...

553
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:57,582
I was sad 'cause you
got me thinking about you
on that Facebook.

554
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,169
I never thought
I'd see you again.

555
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:06,549
Oh, God, excuse me.
Would you come in?

556
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,634
I'd Iove to.

557
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,055
Your hair's red.

558
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,181
Yeah.

559
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,558
It's different.

560
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,727
Yeah. I changed it.

561
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,021
It's just about the only
thing I've changed.

562
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,064
Really?

563
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,316
Yeah.

564
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,485
Kind of. What about you?

565
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,654
A Iot has changed.
Almost, Iike, everything.

566
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,197
Tell me.

567
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,699
The car... I got an Escalade.

568
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,245
And my job's going really
well. Got a great condo.

569
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,957
Tell me about your Iife.

570
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,667
I just did.

571
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,836
(CHUCKLES) I've got to read
this magazine of yours.

572
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,046
Oh, don't.

573
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,589
That is so exciting.

574
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,215
It's not that exciting.

575
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,800
You know what?

576
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,595
I always thought
you'd do something
special with your Iife.

577
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,138
If you knew what
it was really Iike,

578
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,723
you wouldn't say
it was special.

579
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,683
Oh, come on. What...

580
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,851
What's wrong with your neck?

581
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,102
Sorry I'm doing that.

582
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,646
It's just I got
this shooting pain.

583
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,230
I have to share a bed
with a male intern.

584
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,274
And I don't feel Iike
rubbing asses with him, so...

585
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,442
(LAUGHING)

586
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,860
Let me see.

587
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,278
You don't have to do that.

588
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,363
Oh.

589
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,323
Ooh.

590
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,991
You need to put
some heat on that.

591
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,159
(OVEN TIMER DINGS)
I do?

592
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,994
Oh, I have pies in the oven.

593
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,496
You make pies?

594
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,914
I made some pies.

595
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,542
I made, uh, peach, apple,
strawberry rhubarb.

596
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,003
Which one do you want?

597
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,713
Yeah.

598
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,300
LIZ: Mmm.
(MOANING)

599
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,053
Liz, that is unbelievable.

600
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:39,350
You bake pies,
you give these massages,

601
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,061
and you're not married?

602
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,105
I don't get it.

603
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,483
I was married.
He was a ball player.

604
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,904
And I was the good
Iittle wife, baking
cookies for the team.

605
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,823
Oh, my God,
you bake cookies, too?

606
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,116
Cameron got traded,

607
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,536
and when he went
up to the Marlins,
he started making money

608
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,165
and started messing around
with those Miami girls.

609
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,334
Well, I can
say this honestly,

610
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,627
Cameron's an idiot.

611
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:08,963
Yeah, well, we were young.

612
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:13,008
Hey, do you have
one free night while
you're in town?

613
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:17,012
Because I would
Iike to make you
a homemade dinner.

614
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,309
I wanna eat that
homemade dinner.

615
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,354
DARIUS: I'm just gonna
press "record." Okay.

616
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,316
So, Kenneth, why are you
looking for a partner?

617
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,360
I feel Iike

618
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,448
the world is mostly
full ofjankholes,

619
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,451
but I believe that
there are purists out there,

620
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,077
and that's why I put
that ad in the paper.

621
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,706
It's my hope that
if you're watching
this video,

622
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
something incredible
has happened.

623
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,545
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.

624
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,046
While I would Iike
to maneuver through

625
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,423
this world with
an open heart and mind,

626
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,883
sometimes that
doesn't gain you favor.

627
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,093
So I just need to be
equipped with
the necessary skill sets,

628
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,554
guns, training,
weapons, fighting,

629
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,223
in case I encounter
any obstacles that
need to be defeated.

630
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,058
The area is clear.
DARIUS: Oh, my God!

631
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,268
Mission accomplished.

632
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
Wow! Man,
that was intense.

633
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,314
Task completed.

634
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,816
KENNETH: The mission
has to do with regret

635
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,153
and the mission has
to do with mistakes.

636
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,114
The mission's
also about Iove.

637
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,747
I'm already saying too much.

638
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,167
Aren't you interested
in some of this
equipment or something?

639
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,669
Can we talk
about something else?

640
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,758
So it's very important
that you and I do not
abuse the power

641
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,176
that will come
with our knowledge
of the future.

642
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,805
No matter how tempting
it will be to
gain personal fortune

643
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,058
or notoriety by say,
being the first
person to Iist

644
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,685
the Contra code for up, up,
down, down, Ieft-right,
Ieft-right, B-A-start.

645
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,272
Or to say,
"Hey, Ieave your Star Wars
figurines in the box

646
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,858
"'cause they'll be
worth Iike hundreds more
if they are super pristine."

647
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,862
But what about if it's,
Iike, for the betterment
of future society?

648
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,825
Absolutely not.
We have to stick to the plan.

649
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,496
So when do you fill
me in on the plan?

650
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,374
Pretty soon.
The action's getting hungry.

651
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,793
Ugh.

652
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,044
I can't eat here.

653
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,838
KENNETH: Why?

654
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,297
See that kid?
He's Iike a mutant kid.

655
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,217
Hey, there's
something on your ear.

656
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,510
Um...

657
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,136
It's fine, it does...
Are you okay?

658
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,055
It Iooks Iike it's
falling off or something.

659
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,057
No, no, no. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

660
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,602
Shit! Sorry. It's off.

661
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,481
DARIUS: Kenneth!

662
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,566
The mission's off,
I'm sorry.

663
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,235
Forget it.
You're not the right one.

664
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,925
Hey, what's wrong?

665
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,636
It's fake.

666
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,389
What's fake?

667
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,765
My flipping ear is fake.

668
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
They used to make fun of me,
all the other kids.

669
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,112
My parents could only
afford one prosthetic,

670
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,698
so I had to wait
until I was fully-grown.

671
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,450
You know that's not
a big deal, right?

672
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,659
Yes, it is!

673
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,203
No, it isn't.
People used to
make fun of me, too.

674
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,705
Yeah, right.

675
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,084
I shave my arms and
wax my upper Iip, okay?

676
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,961
You're saying that to
make me feel better.

677
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,046
I'm serious.

678
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,340
I had a freaking mustache
until I was 14.

679
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,095
(SIGHS)

680
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,308
Okay, we can still do this,

00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:03,607
Kenneth? Are you okay?

854
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,733
KENNETH: I can't talk
right now, okay?

855
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,568
Just watch your back.
Okay.

856
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,528
Stay Iow and Iay Iow.
Yeah.

857
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,448
Go to the beach,
I'll pick you up.
It's almost time, Darius.

858
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,537
DARIUS: This is
totally crazy.

859
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:18,997
Who do you think
those guys are?

860
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,290
I have no idea.

861
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,334
Maybe he's not
totally insane,

862
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,085
maybe he really thinks
he's doing something and...

863
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,503
I don't know.

864
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,049
What? Why are you
Iooking at me Iike that?

865
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,718
I don't know.
You got a thing for this guy?

866
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,136
What?

867
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,141
No! I'm talk...

868
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,393
(SIGHS)
You saw those guys.

869
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,104
Can I ask you a question?
Do you mind, as a reporter?

870
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,731
What?

871
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,192
What is it that
you two weirdos do
when you're off alone?

872
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,195
I'm getting information.
What are you doing
when you're off alone?

873
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,571
I'm seeing an old friend.

874
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,325
Just take me to the beach.
I have to meet him.

875
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,292
AII right, this is it.

876
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,627
It's pretty obvious
they see

877
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,170
a threat in me possessing
this kind of power.

878
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,589
It's not clear yet what
entity they represent.

879
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:12,384
Their presence here
definitely accelerates
the plan, though.

880
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,137
They're gonna
have one of their
guys at every door,

881
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,390
but you should be okay.
I don't think
they've ID'ed you yet.

882
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,017
Got it.
Good Iuck.

883
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,061
Wait!

884
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,730
Go! Go!

885
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,244
Shannon?

886
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,750
I'm supposed to
give this to you.
This is from Kenneth.

887
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,053
Kenneth said to
give this to me?

888
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,726
My wife, she's...

889
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,397
You tell him...

890
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,902
Tell him I hope he gets
wherever he's goin'

891
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,532
and it all works out
Iike he wants.

892
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,160
I'll tell him.

893
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,633
AII good?

894
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:37,927
Yeah.

895
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,014
What?

896
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,517
Nothing.

897
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,415
Yeah, we're getting
some really
great stuff, Bridget,

898
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm gonna need
a couple more days.

899
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,128
Bridget, I'm doing
an interview right now.

900
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,964
Yeah, I'll send you
an e-mail with
all the information,

901
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,217
and I'll paint
you a real picture.

902
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,968
Okay. I have to
go right now.

903
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,512
Wow.

904
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,932
That all seems so dangerous.
Her running around
with this guy...

905
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,517
Oh, she'll be fine.
You got any more

906
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,060
of that Ieftover pie?
That was pretty good.

907
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,189
I was thinking about you
and the time
we spent together.

908
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,151
I was pretty ripped
back then. Top of
my game back then.

909
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,611
You were not ripped.
Yes, I was.

910
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,030
(LAUGHS)
Why don't you feel me now?

911
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,209
You Iook great.

912
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,639
KENNETH: Are you familiar
with cryptography?

913
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,932
Yeah. Of course.

914
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,809
Yeah. Well, I prefer
the St. Goodnight
code and cipher

915
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,144
for sending messages
that can't be compromised.

916
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,815
It's just 4-4-3-1 -4 and
then you just reverse
the whole thing, okay?

917
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,233
Yeah. Got it.

918
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,735
Learn it.
Practice it.

919
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,738
Hey!

920
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,657
If I show you something,
will you promise

921
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,409
not to tell anybody
else about it, ever?

922
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,618
Yeah.

923
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,333
When we go back in time,
if anything bad happens,

924
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,961
if somebody gets hurt,

925
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,338
or if you mess up,
or if the guys

926
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,799
who are after me
find me and catch me,

927
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,927
put a note inside this tin.
I'm gonna do the same thing.

928
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,848
If anything goes wrong,
we go back and we fix it.

929
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,224
Okay.

930
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,270
(SIGHS)

931
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,274
So far so good.

932
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,235
So that's been
there since 2001?

933
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,404
Since I was a kid.

934
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,323
I used to come up here

935
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,783
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was Iittle.

936
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,452
Do you know
what Star Wars is?

937
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,038
Yes.
Yeah.

938
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:14,250
So, when I was younger,
I used to bring my
Star Wars figures up here,

939
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,752
'cause I didn't
wanna Ieave 'em

940
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,211
back at the house
'cause they'd get Ionely.

941
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:21,299
And some of
the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,

942
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,551
they would throw them
in the fire and stuff...
Really?

943
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,929
This was before my
martial arts training,
of course.

944
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,972
But I found
this hiding spot

945
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,516
and sneak out here
at night,

946
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,645
and put 'em in the tin,
take them out,

947
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,022
then put them back
in the morning and...

948
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,148
Anyway...

949
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,651
I wish I could see you
when you were a Iittle kid.

950
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,320
I was not as impressive
as I am now,
I can assure you.

951
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,155
What?
Yeah.

952
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,617
Okay.

953
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,827
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.

954
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,454
Come on.

955
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,931
That was the best sex
I've ever had.
And I've had a Iot of sex.

956
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,017
That's what you said
about the roast chicken.

957
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,353
That was the best
roast chicken I ever had.

958
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,315
You don't know
how Iong I've
thought about this.

959
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,069
You've become this,
Iike, character

960
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,281
in my head that's Iike,
it feels Iike
you're from a fairy tale,

961
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:30,535
and you're Iike this purity
that's just not in my Iife.

962
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,996
Aww.

963
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,706
You are so cute.

964
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,503
Hey.
This is gonna sound crazy.

965
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,340
I want you to come
to Seattle with me.

966
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,969
What?
Yeah.

967
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,639
(CHUCKLES) It's crazy,
but I want you to come...

968
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,349
Jeff, the minute you
drive out of this place,

969
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:54,976
you are not going to
want to be with me.

970
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,146
That's just not true.
That's what I'm saying,
I mean, do you not feel this?

971
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,605
You're not in your
right mind right now.

972
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,982
I'm absolutely
in my right mind.

973
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,192
This is the clearest
I've been in a Iong time.

974
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,531
I've done this before.

975
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,241
You haven't done it with me.

976
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,993
No, I've done this
before and I'm too old.

977
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,828
We're the same damn age.

978
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
Oh.

979
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,346
That's perfect.

980
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,640
That's unbelievable.

981
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,480
Unbelievable. Okay.
Great. This is good.

982
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,940
This is perfect.
I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.

983
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,692
You're right.
You know what?

984
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,736
I open up my heart
to you and...
(LAUGHING)

985
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,822
Thank you,
because my head
was turned around...

986
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,074
Jeff...

987
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,408
But it ain't anymore.

988
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,411
I think you're being
a Iittle crazy about this.

989
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,622
Yeah. I think you're
crazy for saying no.

990
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,582
Please go.

991
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,464

Why are you sitting here?

00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,694
Why would you be
sitting on your computer?
You are a young man.

You got the whole
world ahead of you.

00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,867
I'm asking you to
be a man and try.

997
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,037
Are you ready to have
a crazy night with me?
'Cause I'm ready.

998
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,163
Say you're ready.
Say you're ready.

999
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,373
I'm ready.

00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,958
My man. Good answer.

1001
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,460
Let's do something stupid!

1002
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,629
Stay here.

partied in an Escalade?

Here we go.
Here we go.

00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,606
You drink. Open that
up and start drinking,

of set up here,

really come up here
after September, so

having a second home,

come to spend some nights

00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,100
I circled the Iocation
on the map,

1024
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,187
this way you'll always
know where to find
the truck and this campsite.

1025
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,940
Don't get Iost.

1026
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,358
Okay.

1027
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,322
What's that?
Is that a guitar?

1028
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,907
No, it's called a zither.

1029
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,700
Can you play this?

1030
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,203
Not very well at all.

1031
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,331
My dad had one,
he was really good.

1032
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,541
Belinda really
Iiked music, so...

1033
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,169
I always wished I could have
played her something,

1034
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,088
so I've been writing her
this song for when
I see her again.

1035
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,798
Will you play it?

1036
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,717
It's...
Please?

1037
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:01,055
No, it's not finished
and it's really just
not very good, so...

1038
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,224
Well, I'll tell you
if it's good or not.

1039
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,643
Okay.

1040
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,813
It's only halfway done,
so it's just Iike...

01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,063
I didn't want to hang
out with these three.
I did it for you!

1076
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:57,815
I don't think so.
It's fine. You go.

1077
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,316

No.

I'm not judging you.

You don't know this about me,
but I don't care
about that stuff.

No, Jeff, I'm not gay, no.

1084
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,870
This is set up perfectly.
Do you not think she's hot?

You're acting
Iike it's so easy.

1086
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:12,997
Because it is so easy.

1087
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,331
No, Jeff. It's easy
for you, not for me.

1088
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,583
Why not?

1089
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:19,462

Do you just wanna
see me get embarrassed?

No!

Come here.

1092
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,845
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.

get this opportunity
very much Ionger.

these pedophile glasses off

1098
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,529
and don't wear these,
they make you Iook
Iike a weirdo, man.

1099
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm gonna put these on you.
Holy shit!

1100
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,992
Look at that killer.

1101
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,702

crushes chicks.

1102
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,622

of you and show you how
good you Iooked right now,

1105
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,292
Okay.

1106
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,711

who drives jets.

1107
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,047
Pop this shit. Uh-oh!

1108
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,133
Boom, boom, boom.

1109
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:07,384
Act Iike you've
been there before.

1110
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,386
You're not gonna
be your age forever.

1111
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,388
One day, you're
gonna be the old dirtbag.

1112
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,309

This is the moment
you Iive for.

1113
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,393
Okay.
Okay?

1114
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,187
Okay.

1115
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,235

Jeff, what the fuck?

1119
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,786
It's so early, Bridget.

1120
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,831
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what
you're doing down there?

Yes. That's what I'm doing.

1122
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,296
I've been going over
the notes that
you've been sending in.

1123
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,967
This Belinda St. Sing,
the ex-girlfriend he said
died in an accident.

1124
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,677
Is that her name?

1125
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,971
Yeah, that's right.
Why?

1126
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,362
You're past curfew.

1127
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,447
Were those girls with you?

1128
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,948

Mmm.

1129
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,825
Hey, you know that
girl your boyfriend

1130
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,661
was going back in time
to save, Belinda?

1131
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,745
Yeah?

1132
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,957
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.

01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,630
How? What do you mean?

1135
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,382
Bridget called and
set up an interview.

1136
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,218
I think
your Iittle boyfriend
is seriously nuts.

1137
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,145
Yeah, I know,
he's totally nuts.

1138
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,064
He's completely crazy.
I know.

1139
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,400
So she's alive. Okay.

1140
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,194
I wanna do the interview.

1141
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,696
That's fine.

1142
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,581
You sure
you got this, kiddo?

1143
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,543
Yeah?

1144

Darius?
Hi.

1145
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,440
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1146
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,108
Nice to meet you.

1147
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,735
Come on in.

1148
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,571
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.

1149
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,158
He worked at Anderson's,

1150
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,785
which was
the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,

1151
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,704
and he was really nice.

1152
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:08,417
Different just than
the typical guys, I guess.

1153
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,169
So how Iong were
you guys together?

1154
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,837
Uh...

1155
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,507
Well, we were never
really together, together.

1156
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,594
You never dated?

1157
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,431
I mean, I wouldn't call
it dating. He was, um...

1158
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,976
He was one of
those guys, who

1159
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,145
you kind of know
has a crush on you,

1160
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,940
but he's really nice
and so you're
really nice back.

1161
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,987
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily, um,

1162
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,992
fit into your Iife,
you know, with your
friends and everything.

1163
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,660
He was

1164
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,791
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?

1165
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,837
Yeah. Yeah,
I know what you mean.

1166
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,842
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?

1167
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,928
After that,
I started dating Rob,

1168
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:04,139
who was my Iast boyfriend
before I met my husband,

1169
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,434
and then Kenneth
quit the restaurant.

1170
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:11,063
I didn't see him for
a while after that.

1171
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,106
Then there was the accident.

1172
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,610
Accident?

1173
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,657
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.

1174
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,826
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.

1175
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:24,952
My God!

1176
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,539
So I convinced Rob
to just Iet him go
and we...

1177
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,291
We told the police
it was a hit and run.

1178
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,544
I haven't seen him
since then.

1179
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,838
But you said
you've seen him recently.

1180
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:37,881
How is he?

1181
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,553
He's good.

1182
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,363
Excuse me.
Darius?

1183
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,658
Can we have
a moment of your time?

1184
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,827
Nothing to be
alarmed about.

1185
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,079
We'd just Iike to
ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.

1186
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,499
Whoa. Guys?
We're from
Seattle Magazine.

1187
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,334
We're just here doing
a story on this guy.

1188
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,670
We're not involved
with what he's
involved with.

1189
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,838
What do you want with him?

1190
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,507
SMITH: He's been contacting
government scientists
on the Internet,

1191
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:24,011
asking questions
about our particle
accelerator in Berkeley.

1192
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,512
We've been
investigating Calloway

1193
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,598
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him
of being an agent.

1194
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,765
He can't be a spy.

1195
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
He was arrested
in Colorado for

1196
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,352
breaking into
a nuclear physics
Iaboratory.

1197
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,104
And then there was
the recent robbery

1198
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,606
at a medical
research center here.

1199
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,940
Oh, yeah?
And what did he take?

1200
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,903
Are you sure it was him
that broke into
the medical research place?

1201
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,070
You have evidence?

1202
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:43,906
We're confident.

1203
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,617
He hasn't been
back to his house
in the past 24 hours.

1204
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,118
Give us a call if
you hear from him?

1205
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Will do.

1206
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,456
Thank you.
Thank you.

1207
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,294
So, what's
your story about?

1208
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,755
Oh, the story.

1209
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,381
(CHUCKLES)

1210
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,300
I don't know anymore,
actually.

1211
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,973
You all right?

1212
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,605
You sure?

1213
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,275
Yeah.

1214
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1215
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,134
Kenneth?

1216
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,682
Kenneth? I'm coming in.

1217
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,734
KENNETH: Darius?

1218
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,403
Hey. What are
you doing here?

1219
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,282
Everything's set.

1220
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,993
We move the machine
to the Iaunch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.

1221
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,619
How'd you get in here
anyway? The spooks

1222
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,163
are all over me.
It's crazy out there.

1223
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,581
I had to sneak in
through the back.

1224
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,417
Hey, we need to talk.

1225
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,755
About Iast night. I know.

1226
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,051
Last night

1227
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,720
was a thunderbolt.

1228
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,681
But I realize

1229
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,642
our working relationship
became complicated,

1230
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:22,230
so for now, maybe
we just re-focus and
concentrate on the mission.

1231
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,565
Whose house is this?

1232
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:28,070
It's my house.
My parents Ieft it to me.

1233
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,405
Where are the Iasers?
Can you show me the Iasers?

1234
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,116
What's wrong with your voice?

1235
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,951
Where's the time machine?

1236
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,536
The time machine is
at the Iaunch site.

1237
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,163
Oh, right,
it's at the Iaunch site.

1238
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,456
Darius.

1239
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,959
What are you doing?

1240
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,129
I talked to those guys
who are following you.

1241
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,508
And they told me
that you stole
those Iasers because

1242
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,260
you're some kind
of spy or something.

1243
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,347
That's perfect.
Let them think that,

1244
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,933
it works in our favor.
It's better. Seriously.

1245
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
I also talked to Belinda.

1246
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,980
What?
Yeah.

1247
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,649
You did not talk to Belinda.

1248
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,733
Yeah, I did.

1249
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,568
I talked to Belinda.
I was just at her house.

1250
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,986
No! No!

1251
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,448
What are you doing?

1252
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,290
She's alive!
She's alive! Okay.

1253
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:24,668
This is good. Okay.

1254
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,587
This means
the mission must have

1255
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,631
been successful,
and we have saved her

1256
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,633
and we've come
back to the present...
Hey, hey...

1257
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:35,428
Hey, you can be
honest with me, okay?

1258
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,097
I really Iike you.

1259
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,348
Okay.

1260
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,267
Yes. But this is the thing.

1261
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:43,895
It's a complicated science
and cannot be
measured by our brains...

1262
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,438
You can't time travel!

1263
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,984
This is all crazy.
Okay, you Iied to me.

1264
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,360
Listen to me.

1265
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,528
What else are
you Iying about?

1266
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,738
Hey, hey, Iisten to me.

1267
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,826
You come to that
Iaunch site at 5:00 p.m.,

1268
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,789
you take my hand
and I'll show you
who can't time travel.

1269
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,670
Oh, shit!

1270
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,009
AII right?

1271
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,179
Darius! They're
right behind the house!

1272
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,014
Wait...
They're right behind me.

1273
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,640
Wait, you're with that guy?

1274
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,685
Are you...
No.

1275
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,103
Were you making fun of me?

1276
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,271
No, I would have never...

1277
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,647
Nobody was making
fun of you, Kenneth.

1278
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,066
We are writing
an honest piece about
you for a magazine.

1279
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,902
Magazine? Darius, don't...

1280
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:33,153
We're not
making fun of you.

1281
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,237
Get out of my house!

We're here to help.

No, I'm Ieaving tonight!

1284
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,630
So is he really building
a time machine or what?

1285
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,964
Why did you
make me do this?

1286
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,342
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.

1287
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,636
You don't care
about the story!
You don't care about him.

1288
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,512
You just came here
to hook up with
old girlfriends.

1289

1290

01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,203
I know what they
were Iooking for.
I saw it, it was Iike a,

01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,080
Iike a jet engine

01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,724
Darius, have you
seen this stuff before?

1297
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,482
What the hell was
he building in here?

1298
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,486
DARIUS: I don't know.

1299
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,993
You don't think
he actually built it,
do you?

1300
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,161
Holy shit!

1301
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,006
Move!

Kenneth, I'm sorry.

Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?

1307
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,756
No.

1308
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,050
I promise.

1309
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,595
I Iied about the story,
but everything else

1310
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,597
was real, okay?
That was really me.

1311
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:57,982
Then get on.

1312

I'm going back for you now.

01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,105
AII right. You trust me?

1316
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:43,820
Come on.

I'm doing, okay?
