1
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,564
Horatio.

2
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,801
Emma. What are you doing here?

3
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,530
I couldn't bear to let you go
without saying goodbye.

4
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,966
You shouldn't have come, Emma.
People will talk.

5
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:26,010
Let them talk.
I'm tired of hiding our love away.

6
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,969
- I'm not ashamed of how I feel.
- Neither am I.

7
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,167
But we both know we shouldn't be together.

8
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:34,766
- Shouldn't? Who says we shouldn't?
- My conscience.

9
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:39,001
My conscience tells me
everything I feel for you is wrong.

10
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:43,202
But my heart, my heart says...

11
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,682
I can't live without you.

12
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,488
- Promise me you'll return.
- I promise.

13
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,324
Because if Napoleon doesn't kill me,

14
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,608
then being away from you surely will.

15
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,486
Cut! Yeah, brilliant, thank you.

16
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,168
- Could you see me?
- Yeah, definitely.

17
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:14,800
Excellent. We'll get out
before that fat little extra gets his face in.

18
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,799
Okay.

19
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,604
DIRECTOR: Rest the guys for 10 minutes.

20
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,603
That's correct. Yeah, great.

21
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:28,488
We're moving on to 37.

22
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,169
Hey. Who are we using
for the girl by the carriage?

23
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,082
We thought this one.

24
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:48,847
No, I said I needed some decent tits
and they're... rubbish.

25
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:54,684
Well, I could maybe pad them up a bit.
Or just sort of, like, push them...

26
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,966
- You could use these.
- Bingo.

27
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,168
Bingo these in half an hour
after I've had a wee fiddle with them.

28
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,687
- I just need to squeeze them.
- Well, work on them over lunch, yeah?

29
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:06,968
Because at the moment
they're just, urgh, nothing.

30
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,167
- Okay.
- Good.

31
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,082
Would it be easier just to use these?

32
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:15,687
We made a decision to use mine, so can we
just go with these? If I just squeeze them...

33
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,602
It would be less work.

34
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:21,240
You've got padding at the bottom of them.
Can I get some padding?

35
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,121
MAGGIE: This cow's like,
she's like sticking her tits in his face

36
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:30,999
and I'm saying, "He said he wanted to use
my tits. Can we just go with my tits, please?"

37
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,047
I think Meryl Streep
went through a similar thing.

38
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,123
- I know it's not important but...
- It is important.

39
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,850
I remember Laurence Olivier
having a rant in Richard III

40
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,525
because they wanted to use
stunt testicles and he said,

41
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,808
"Listen, these gonads are going to be seen
because they went to RADA.

42
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,724
"You either use the Lord Olivier plums
or nothing at all."

43
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,164
Next.

44
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:52,004
Ahh... And what do you recommend,
my good man?

45
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,523
- Chicken's the warmest.
- Is it? I'll have that, then.

46
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,119
Chicken.

47
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,526
Your heart's not in this, is it?

48
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,205
Although one of your pubes is, I see.

49
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,401
- Straight in there like that, no messing.
- It's not a pube, it's a dog hair.

50
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,324
It's all right, it's not a pube,
it's a dog hair, everyone.

51
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,005
I thought it was a pube.
It's not, it's just a dog hair.

52
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:24,482
If you do get a hair in there, he just
gets it out with his big sausage fingers.

53
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:29,287
- I don't know why I do this.
- What?

54
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:33,159
All this. "Oh, we'll cut before
the fat bloke gets his face in shot."

55
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,766
It's just absolutely demeaning.
I don't know why I put myself through it.

56
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,081
- Because you're an actor.
- This isn't acting.

57
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,560
Getting the back of your head
or your arm in a shot.

58
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,848
And bloody Ross Kemp in every scene,
he gets all the lines.

59
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:47,286
Do you know what I mean?
Why is he the star and not me?

60
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,839
There but for the grace of God go I.
And it's just... What?

61
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,489
- It's not quite.
- Well, it is.

62
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,163
It's not just luck, is it?

63
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,004
- Why not? We're about the same age...
- No, he's younger than you.

64
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:58,241
- No, he's not. We're about the same age.
- Is he?

65
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,970
- Yeah.
- He looks a lot younger than you.

66
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,167
You're having a laugh.
He hasn't got any hair.

67
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,890
He's meant to look like that.
He's shaved it all off.

68
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,121
It's like cool, it's like Vin Diesel.

69
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:10,520
Vin Diesel?
Sorry, are we looking at the same bloke?

70
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:15,480
Have another look, right. Look at him there.
He looks more like Zippy from Rainbow.

71
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:16,890
(MIMICKING ZIPPY) Hello!

72
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,805
Bungle, what are you doing
in the Queen Vic, Bungle?

73
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,645
Phil, why did you sleep with my wife?
Look, look.

74
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,570
Vin Diesel hasn't got
a perfectly round little head

75
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,119
that opens and shuts like Pac-Man, look at it.

76
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,690
- He's got less chins than you as well.
- One chin, one chin each.

77
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,490
- Yeah, but yours is growing another one.
- Shut up.

78
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,039
In five years' time,
he's still going to look pretty rugged

79
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:45,330
- and you're just going to look like a pelican.
- A pelican? Good, nice one.

80
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,282
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

81
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,929
Well, obviously him.

82
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,127
- Husband material?
- Could be.

83
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:56,362
- What are you basing it on this time?
- Don't know but look at him.

84
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:59,284
He's all dashing and handsome in his green.

85
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,649
Why do men not dress like that nowadays?

86
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,165
Because they'd get beaten up on the Tube.

87
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,886
- All right?
- All right, Greg.

88
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,408
- Indeed I am.
- Good.

89
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:28,479
I'm actually working across the way,
Studio H, the big one.

90
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:31,449
Doing a film with Mr Vinnie Jones.

91
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:35,206
So, actually, just learning a few lines
I've got to do with him later.

92
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,441
- Lines?
- Yes, indeed.

93
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,164
Well done.

94
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,560
So what's your part in this epic, then?

95
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,642
The fourth seaman from the left or...

96
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,210
Hardly.

97
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,328
You got something a bit more...
Bit meatier, bit more substantial.

98
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,403
You got a speaking part or a... No?

99
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,685
Not in this one, no.

100
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:55,649
- Seriously, how do you survive?
- Don't worry about it, really.

101
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,370
- Digging into the savings?
- Not really.

102
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,329
The pile diminishes, does it?
Gotta get some work soon.

103
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,766
- Gotta get some work soon.
- Working all the time, mate.

104
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,682
- Don't worry about it.
- Sort of.

105
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,887
Are your parents still sending you money?

106
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,520
Well, yeah. Either that or I,
you know, threaten to sign on.

107
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:15,001
And lo! The cheque doth cometh in the post.

108
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:17,047
- It keeps the wolf from the door.
- Good.

109
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,804
How is the door of the house
your parents bought you, is that all right?

110
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,244
- Yes, it's fine.
- Good.

111
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,448
- Look, I've got lines to learn.
- Thanks for coming over and sharing that.

112
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,250
- Seriously, mate, something will crop up.
- Don't worry about it.

113
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,162
Don't worry about it, mate.
Worry about yourself.

114
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,445
- Stiff upper lip.
- Yes.

115
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:33,762
- And other clichés too numerous to mention.
- Don't mention them then.

116
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:36,126
- See you later, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

117
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:38,042
Tosser. Not you.

118
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:07,924
Excuse me. Do you mind
if I go in front of you, please?

119
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,161
- What?
- Can I go before you?

120
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,004
- Why?
- I've got a little bit of a stomach upset.

121
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,490
Oh, okay.

122
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:21,086
- Hello.
- Hi.

123
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:24,163
I think she wants to go in front of you,
she's got diarrhoea.

124
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:27,968
Don't want it exploding everywhere. Messy.

125
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,404
Thank you.

126
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,847
Saw you looking.

127
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,161
Thought I'd better get it out of the way.

128
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,565
Yeah, it is me.

129
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,650
Hi, I'm Andy.

130
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,970
- How you doing?
- Oh!

131
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,689
- Sorry, did that hurt?
- No...

132
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:03,730
Good. I was worried I might have hurt you.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

133
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,690
If I had meant to hurt you, you wouldn't
have any ribs left so you got off lightly.

134
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,205
- Let's leave it there.
- Okay.

135
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,845
You know, I love playing military parts.

136
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,366
Well, as you know, I was in the SAS.

137
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:22,128
No. I knew you did that TV show
about the SAS.

138
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,961
Yeah, but how did I know
how to do all that shit in it?

139
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,802
I assumed you had consultants and stuff.

140
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,610
If that's what you believe,
then that's what you believe.

141
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:34,603
All right, I wasn't in the SAS
for six months and they didn't say,

142
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,921
"Ross, why don't you give up
this acting lark?

143
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,889
"We could really do with you
in Afghanistan."

144
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:41,609
- Did they?
- Couldn't say.

145
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:45,001
All I know is, if I do get into a fight,
I'd better have an escape route

146
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:49,403
because I don't want to go to prison
for murder, because that's what it would be.

147
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:52,164
Because my body is a lethal weapon.

148
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:54,801
And me in prison, face like this.

149
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,370
Pretty boy.

150
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,691
I'd be in the shower just lathering up,

151
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,763
a couple of guys would come in
wanting a bit of Kemp arse.

152
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,842
I'd see them in the mirror and...

153
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,526
What I'm saying is,
you'd best not get into a fight with me.

154
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,524
Sure.

155
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,283
Or a conversation.

156
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:29,128
What do you do when you're not doing this?
What's your day job?

157
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,202
I work in a pub.

158
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,488
- What about you?
- I do this full time. I'm an actor.

159
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,926
- You do this full time?
- Yeah, yeah.

160
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,763
Like most actors, I act full time.

161
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:42,207
Yeah, but this isn't really acting, is it?
I mean, this is extra work.

162
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,964
Well, no, supporting artist work, innit?

163
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:48,202
But it's just, this is just pocket money.
I am actually an actor.

164
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,761
Right. I was gonna say 'cause you can't
really make a living from being an extra.

165
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

166
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:57,164
No, but he used to have a proper job.
He used to... He owns his own house.

167
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,323
Doesn't have to pay a mortgage
so he can afford to live on a pittance.

168
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,403
I don't live on a pittance, though, do I?
People pay me to act so...

169
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,800
- Yeah, you say you're an actor.
- Yeah, I do.

170
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,927
- But what have you actually acted in?
- I've appeared...

171
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,765
I mean proper acting, not walking in
the background. I mean, actually speaking.

172
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,445
- I know.
- Well?

173
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,528
- What, you want me to...
- Yeah.

174
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,646
Okay.

175
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,321
- My Family, the Robert Lindsay sitcom.
- Really?

176
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:25,483
Yeah, it was just a thing,
sort of a scene on the bus

177
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,402
and the bus conductor come along

178
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:30,528
and, "Tickets please," and I just went,
"Yeah, sure, no problem."

179
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:33,409
- Did you?
- Yes.

180
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:35,169
- That was the line?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,923
He comes along and goes, "Tickets please,"

182
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,683
and I go, "Yeah, no problem. Mate,
there you go."

183
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:41,331
So if I got that episode and watched it,
that's what I'd see you say,

184
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:43,527
- "Sure, no problem."
- Well, yeah.

185
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:45,647
(MUMBLES) "...there you go."

186
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:48,291
Well, I didn't... What was that?
What's the line?

187
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:50,487
- What's the problem?
- What is the line?

188
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,323
The conductor wants the ticket,
I'm showing him it.

189
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,163
And what do you say?

190
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,048
He asks for my ticket.

191
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,962
- Yeah.
- And I go...

192
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,124
I can't hear what you're saying.
No, let's do it like it is actually on the screen.

193
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:05,521
I'll be the bus driver, okay,
and you just be you, all right?

194
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:08,045
Tickets please, can I see your tickets please?

195
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,001
I can't hear anything.
No one can hear anything.

196
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,208
- It was years ago.
- But that's not proper acting.

197
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,486
- What is it, then?
- I can tell you what acting is.

198
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,768
- I can tell you what I've acted in...
- Not interested.

199
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:23,287
I've acted in, and I'm talking proper
speaking parts, in Emmerdale,

200
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,929
- Silent Witness.
- Silent Witness?

201
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,490
- Silent Witness.
- Shh!

202
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:30,320
I was a narc in The Bill,
that was a recurring character,

203
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:33,642
that was three episodes
and really good lines of dialogue.

204
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,881
You haven't even been in The Bill, have you?

205
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,485
- I don't want to be in The Bill.
- You haven't even been in The Bill?

206
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:40,289
Listen, I don't want to be in The Bill.

207
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:42,566
- Have you ever been in Casualty?
- Yeah.

208
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:46,360
- The TV show Casualty?
- Well, no, but... No.

209
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:06,168
Right, this is the deal.

210
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,970
You've been my agent
now for, what, five years?

211
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:12,407
And you're not getting me
any real acting work.

212
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,289
- Nothing's coming in.
- Nothing's coming in. In five years?

213
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:17,487
That's the problem.
I'm as annoyed as you are.

214
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:21,530
But I'm not sure there's a demand for,
you know, little 45-year-old blokes.

215
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,646
43.

216
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:25,962
Whatever. You know, I wonder,
are you sure you want to be an actor?

217
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:30,249
You've given it five years, nothing's come in.
Maybe it's time to just throw in the towel.

218
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,527
My agent, ladies and gentlemen. My agent.

219
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:36,728
- Look... Hello, mate, all right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

220
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,530
- That's all right. Do you know Barry?
- All right, Shaun. How's it going?

221
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,683
I'm working with a friend of yours
at the moment, Ross Kemp.

222
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,250
- How is he?
- Yeah, good.

223
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:47,607
I wouldn't mention Ross' name round here.
Ross is sort of mud with Barry

224
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:50,967
because it was Ross that persuaded
Barry to leave EastEnders.

225
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,849
Ross leaves, he goes to ITV.
He says it's a million pounds or nothing.

226
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,444
They give him a million pound contract.

227
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:59,319
So I go with Barry and say we want a million
pounds or nothing, they chose nothing.

228
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,881
They went with the nothing option that time,
didn't they?

229
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:06,486
You were upset, weren't you? Depressed.
Couldn't get out of bed for two weeks.

230
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,482
I was livid and looking back,
what I should have done is,

231
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:11,563
I shouldn't have given them
the nothing option. I should have said,

232
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,643
"We want a million pounds or we want £500,"

233
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,449
and that way we'd have
definitely got something.

234
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,169
- £500?
- Exactly, this is it.

235
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:21,641
- But live and learn, don't you?
- This isn't living though, is it?

236
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:24,404
Don't start that again.
I've got loads of stuff for you.

237
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,685
Like what?

238
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:29,241
There's a light flickering in the gents.
Could you have a tinker with that?

239
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:31,003
Yeah, I could do that.

240
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,561
Could I use your computer later?
I've just got to get the new CV knocked up.

241
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,642
Yeah, yeah, knock yourself out.

242
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,087
- Well, see you.
- All right, then. Cheers, B.

243
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:47,840
Sorry, the reason I'm here is
I want to know what your plan of action is.

244
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,762
What's your strategy?
What is your business plan?

245
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:53,161
My plan is when you get some work,
then I can start making some money.

246
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,685
Because what I'm no good at is,
you know, breaking an act.

247
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:59,127
So when I'm successful, you can deduct
12 and a half percent, no problem.

248
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:01,281
15 for adverts.
That's what I'm hanging on for, really.

249
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:03,931
You just want someone
to call up and give me an advert.

250
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,569
That would be amazing, brilliant.

251
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,211
Right, okay.
Make sure the phone's on the hook, then.

252
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,920
You joke about it. It was unplugged
for two days. No one noticed.

253
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:19,643
The man does not know where to start, okay?

254
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,526
This is my CV that he's sending
out to people.

255
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,365
I mean, casting agents, producers.
He typed it himself, okay.

256
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:31,800
"From 1986 to 1999 Andy Millman
worked at the Natwest in Wokingham.

257
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:35,810
"Andy left this comfortable,
adequately-paid job

258
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,884
"to try and become an actor,
despite his age, weight and looks.

259
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,566
"Andy claims to be a great actor
but has not yet had the chance to prove it

260
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,724
"because, so far, he's had no offers
except extra work which, as you know,

261
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:50,484
"is pointless and badly paid.

262
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:54,007
"Acting is Andy's dream.
If you can make that dream come true,

263
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,809
"please, please call."

264
00:15:55,891 --> 00:16:00,089
- I mean, it's like he's writing to Jim'll Fix It.
- Oh, you have to fire him.

265
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:04,369
I can't fire him, can I? I can't bear to see
his stupid little face. He'd be devastated.

266
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:07,045
- Yes, but it's your career.
- I know.

267
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:10,441
What are you going to do?
I mean, you'll have to find all your own work.

268
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,523
Yeah, having a dog and barking yourself
springs to mind.

269
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:17,684
Start today, start now.
Go up to the director and ask him for a line.

270
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:20,524
Ross Kemp.
You've spoken to Ross Kemp, haven't you?

271
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,806
- Yes.
- Go up to Ross Kemp and ask him for a line.

272
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:26,770
Just say to him, "I thought you were
brilliant in EastEnders, Ultimate Force.

273
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,842
I loved you in Spandau Ballet.

274
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,001
- What?
- Spandau Ballet.

275
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,527
He wasn't in Spandau Ballet.
That was Martin Kemp.

276
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,806
Martin Kemp was in EastEnders
and Spandau Ballet.

277
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,927
- Who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

278
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,206
- Are they not brothers?
- No.

279
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:45,719
Martin Kemp and Gary Kemp
were the brothers.

280
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,688
- Well, who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

281
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:50,763
- Who's his brother?
- I don't know if he's got a brother.

282
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:55,527
Yes, he does. He's got that little bald one
with the pink face that looks like him.

283
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:57,283
Phil Mitchell?

284
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:00,920
His on screen brother. Phil and Grant
Mitchell, but they're not really brothers.

285
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,162
Yes, they are. They're the Mitchell brothers.

286
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:08,563
What do you mean, the Mitchell brothers?
You know his name is Ross Kemp.

287
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,883
What bit's confusing you?

288
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,849
The brothers.

289
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,647
The brothers?

290
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,045
What?

291
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:24,167
Is that confusing you, too?
Do you think we've landed in the future?

292
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,003
Shut your face.

293
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:30,368
MAGGIE: You see, this is why I can never
go and speak to that guy

294
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:34,330
because I'm not smart enough for him.
He's an intellectual.

295
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,164
How do you know he's an intellectual?
You've never even spoken to him.

296
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:40,402
- Well, he reads the big papers.
- Oh, the big papers, sure.

297
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,403
See, it's always the same,
if a bloke is really smart,

298
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,130
I just always worry that
I'm not clever enough for him.

299
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:50,090
He's going to want to talk about politics
or whatever and I won't know what to say.

300
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:54,449
One time, I went out with this bloke and
we were in the pub playing the quiz machine

301
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,843
and it was for a fiver and the question
came up "Who discovered America?"

302
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:01,240
And I just panicked and I said, "Colombo."

303
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,526
See, you're laughing because I'm stupid.

304
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:07,603
No, it's an easy mistake to make.
They sound the same.

305
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:09,170
That's what I thought.

306
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,242
- You should just go and talk to him.
- You think?

307
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:14,084
Yeah, I don't know why you're so shy.
Just go and talk to him.

308
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,887
The FT.

309
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:34,246
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

310
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,727
NASDAQ, you twat, what are you like?

311
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:42,121
- You play the markets, do you?
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,202
How's it going? Any tips?

313
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:50,766
Buy high, buy low. Buy low, sell high.

314
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,845
- What you reading?
- It's Frank Kermode's book on Shakespeare.

315
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,728
It's for my new PhD.

316
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:03,201
Shakespeare, eh? Oh! Bloody genius, him.

317
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,851
Midsummer Night's Dream. Bottom...

318
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,764
- Oh, how is your diarrhoea?
- Fine, it's good.

319
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,969
- I'm going to get a coffee, I think.
- I've got to go and call my broker anyway.

320
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,440
All right. I was going to ask
if you wanted to get one.

321
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,568
Definitely. He's not there anyway,
he's away on holiday.

322
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,079
All right.

323
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:32,679
Hiya.

324
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:38,209
They're making a film over there
with Vinnie Jones.

325
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,486
What's he doing making a film?
He's a bloody footballer.

326
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:47,126
- Look at the size of those lights.
- You reckon they're big lights?

327
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,930
If I wanted big lights, I could have big lights.

328
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:53,003
I just don't want big lights.
I want small lights if anything.

329
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:00,408
I know an old colleague of yours
actually, Shaun Williamson.

330
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:03,120
- Shaun?
- Barry off EastEnders.

331
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,724
- Oh, Barry, yeah.
- Yeah.

332
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:07,848
We've got the same agent
because I'm actually a real actor.

333
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,365
I'm just, well, not just an extra

334
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,682
so if there was a line going in this
with just a little bit of dialogue,

335
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:17,286
it'd be great for me because,
as I said, I'm a proper actor.

336
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,568
Yeah, I hope you're better than him.
I mean, he's a bloody footballer.

337
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:23,848
He's good at what he does, isn't he?
The old "hard man" thing, I suppose.

338
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,288
- Because he actually is in real life so...
- You reckon? You think he's a tough guy?

339
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,761
I'd like to see him come at me
with all that "I'm a hard bastard" stuff.

340
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:36,561
I'd say, "Put the baseball bat down,
it's just you and me, skin on skin."

341
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:40,005
Stripped to the waist, to the death.

342
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:46,086
I'm trained.
He starts with me, I will destroy him.

343
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:55,159
Okay. Well, as I say, if you could
put a word in, I could just do a line.

344
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,049
Yeah, I'll sort that out for you, no problem.
No problem.

345
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,123
Really?

346
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:04,805
Cheers. I'll see you later.

347
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:17,289
I tell you, if there's a hag, a washerwoman,
toothless wench to be had, it'll be me.

348
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:20,841
I'm never the one that gets to wear
the taffeta dress, it's not fair.

349
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,206
- They've padded you up.
- That's actually me.

350
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:28,683
I was going to ask, I hope it doesn't seem
pushy, but would you like to go for a meal?

351
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,921
Yeah, I'm starving.

352
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,127
Oh, not right now but I thought maybe later.

353
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:36,681
Yeah, no, absolutely, yeah. Oh, I'd love to.

354
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,921
- Good.
- Okay, then.

355
00:21:56,531 --> 00:22:00,649
What you doing here?
Still scavenging the bins for food, are you?

356
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:04,724
No need. Bloody waiting on a scene
I've got to do with Ross Kemp.

357
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:07,484
He asked me personally so... Good, though.

358
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,164
Yeah, well done.

359
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:15,039
- Shame it's only telly but, you know...
- Not really.

360
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:18,840
It's something. I mean, keep at it,
you might make it into the films.

361
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:22,048
Yeah, but what I wouldn't do is
do a film with Vinnie Jones,

362
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:23,803
he's a footballer but that's all right.

363
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:27,042
You say he's a footballer
but he's still been in films, hasn't he?

364
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:29,645
You know, with John Travolta
and Nicolas Cage.

365
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:32,882
What did he get paid for that, by the way?
Because I was talking to Ross...

366
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,644
You know Ross got a million pounds
to go to ITV?

367
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,848
- Yeah. Pretend to be a hard man.
- Not really.

368
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:42,048
- Unlike Vinnie. Real life hard man.
- Hmm.

369
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:46,488
Yeah. On a serious note,
Ross explained to me,

370
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:51,167
you know, Ross was trained by the SAS
and he said if Vinnie Jones

371
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:56,041
tried his antics on with him, he'd rip him
apart so you might want to warn him that.

372
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,530
- He said that?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,444
I'm not stirring shit, just warning.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

374
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,999
I don't care about him,
but I wouldn't want to see him get hurt.

375
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,127
I've said my bit so...

376
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:08,840
- I've got to go. I'll see you later.
- See you later, mate.

377
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,962
You've done so much.

378
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:19,928
Not really. I'm probably a bit older than you.

379
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:22,127
- How old are you?
- 34.

380
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:25,681
Well, I'm actually older than you
but thank you very much.

381
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,604
Well, you don't look it.
I thought you were in your 20s.

382
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,841
You never, did you? Oh, God.

383
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:33,764
I'm not!

384
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,321
- Anything you fancy?
- Possibly.

385
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,607
- I meant on the menu.
- I know.

386
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,845
- What have you been saying?
- About what?

387
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:58,560
Why am I hearing that Vinnie Jones
is looking for me and he wants to batter me?

388
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,289
I haven't said anything.

389
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:03,249
How's he know I've been slagging him off?
Who have you been speaking to?

390
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:06,164
No one. You're not scared of him, are you?

391
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:09,448
No. Not with what I could do to him.

392
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,965
- With your SAS stuff and that.
- Yeah.

393
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,121
I mean, do you know what that stands for?

394
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,520
SAS? Special Air Service.

395
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:19,369
What?

396
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:21,681
Special Air Service, isn't it?

397
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,410
- It doesn't stand for that.
- Doesn't it?

398
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:29,086
I've talked to actual SAS people,
they've told me what it stands for.

399
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,843
What does it stand for, then?

400
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:34,245
Super Army Soldiers.

401
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,406
Su... Are you sure?

402
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,403
Yeah, I mean actual SAS people
have told me that.

403
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:46,369
The actual guys themselves
and they should know.

404
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:50,729
- They weren't winding you up?
- They wouldn't do that to one of their own.

405
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:55,239
No. I thought it was Special Air Services.

406
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:59,085
Special Air Services? I mean, that sounds
like FedEx or something, doesn't it?

407
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:03,767
Registered delivery or whatever. Do you
think a postman needs arms like these?

408

Did I get these muscles lifting jiffy bags?

409
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:11,684
Definitely not.

looking for a fight, I will unleash hell.

going" bollocks. What you been saying?

- What are you talking about?
- What's all this I've been hearing?

424
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,846
- Shit about you think you're harder than me.
- Where have you heard this?

425
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:30,446
Some extra I've been doing a scene with
said he heard it over here.

426
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:34,524
You been trying to impress the extras
by telling them you're harder than me?

No.

No, you're not.
And if I hear you slag me off anymore,

431
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,648
I'll come over here and I'll show you
what really hard is.

432
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:52,485
- Do you know what really hard is?
- Beating me up and that.

Yeah. Do you know what really hard is?

434

Beating up and that.
Kick him in the bollocks.

435

- All right.

Why did you say you did?

444
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:46,967

No, go to Family Affairs. I've had an offer.

There's no bullying at Family Affairs,
they're really nice people.

Cut! That's good, print that,
move to the next one. Mike.

480
00:30:33,746 --> 00:30:36,897
Richard, that's exactly what I was talking
about with the smoke, thank you.

481
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:38,544
Right. I want to go in tighter, all right.

482
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:40,139
- Did you see me?
- It was brilliant.

483
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:41,784
You'll get more money for that.

484
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,345
- Do I?
- It's a direction, yeah?

485
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,779
- Yes.
- You get more money.

486
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:47,016
- Excellent.
- It's called supplementary performance fee.

487
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,585
- Talk to the production manager.
- Brilliant.

488
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,975
- Am I going to sort everyone's life out?
- Here we go.

489
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,660
Talk to the production manager
and you'll get a few extra quid.

490
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,464
God knows you could do with it.

491
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:58,663
- These aren't my clothes.
- You could have fooled me.

492
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:15,697
Hey, guys.
Guys, people, can we gather around, please?

493
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,139
Guys.

494
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:24,705
This is Goran,
this is the man whose story we're making.

495
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:33,263
Okay, he's the reason we're gathered here,
to share his story with the world.

496
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:37,064
A lot of you might be thinking
why am I making this movie.

497
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:41,856
Sure, you guys look at me as one of
the world's most successful comedy actors.

498
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:43,584
What does that mean?

499
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:47,136
I mean, yeah, I make Along Came Polly
and it opens to $32 million.

500
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:50,855
One of the biggest Martin Luther King Junior
birthday holiday opening weekends ever.

501
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,016
Goes on to gross 170 million worldwide.

502
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:54,937
Meet the Parents, double that.

503
00:31:55,026 --> 00:32:00,578
But what does the money and the success
mean in real terms?

504
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:04,455
If I find a little orphan child in a war zone...

505
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,257
hiding in a burnt out building,

506
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:11,464
his parents murdered,
persecuted for his race,

507
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,901
his religion, what am I going to do?

508
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,982
Pop on Dodgeball on DVD?

509
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,340
It's a funny film.

510
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,860
Thanks and I can put on Dodgeball

511
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:23,938
and he's going to laugh for an hour
and 32 minutes.

512
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:28,019
You know, escape reality for a while,
but what happens when the film finishes?

513
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,898
Back to reality.

514
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:34,058
Still an orphan, still living with fear.

515
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:35,864
How do I help him, hm?

516
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:38,496
Put on Dodgeball again?

517
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:42,101
Sure he's going to laugh again,
he'll see things he didn't see the first time,

518
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:46,418
it's layered, it was made like that,
but this can't go on indefinitely, all right?

519
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,294
At a certain point, you know, after the fifth,
sixth, seventh viewing,

520
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,583
he's still laughing,

521
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:56,977
but it's not getting
to the root of the problem, okay?

522
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:00,175
How do I help him?

523
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,055
Make Dodgeball 2?

524
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,102
Make this movie.

525
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:07,303
Make people think. Change attitudes.

526
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:12,259
So, think on that
while you're sipping on your frappuccinos.

527
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:15,895
- And what are we doing? Mike?
- Let's have a break.

528
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,659
Break time, okay, good.
Thank you, thank you very much.

529
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,214
Thanks, everyone.
Back at quarter past, thank you.

530
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:34,777
BEN: And I want you to just be coming
straight in, without...

531
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,778
There shouldn't be a delay
between when the grenade has gone off

532
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,697
and when you guys come around.

533
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:43,301
Ben, is it possible, please, more smoke?

534
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,058
- Was there more smoke?
- Yes.

535
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:47,614
Okay, can I get more smoke, please!

536
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,378
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

537
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:52,458
All right, guys, now while
we have the smoke, can you come around...

538
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,218
- Also...
...charging right... Yeah.

539
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:56,376
The Coke, it's not cold.

540
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:59,936
Sorry, okay,
just kill the smoke for a second. What?

541
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:01,584
My Coke is not cold.

542
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,258
- Your Coke's not cold?
- No.

543
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,621
- Okay, all right. Mike?
- Yeah.

544
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,818
Can we get him a cold Coke? Okay?

545
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,096
Make sure his Coke is always cold, okay.

546
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:13,256
Look at that, he gets anything he wants.

547
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:15,576
I know,
but he's been through a lot, hasn't he?

548
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,224
I know he's been through a lot,

549
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,900
but they're making a film,
he's not a competition winner.

550
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,817
That's where the real power lies here.

551
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:26,297
- I think he's quite attractive actually.
- Forget it, I know what you're thinking.

552
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:28,900
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered.

553
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,465
That's awful. Why?

554
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,935
Well, for one,
he's not going to be a barrel of laughs.

555
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:36,575
Two, you can't compete with her. It's not
like the marriage started going downhill

556
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,180
and she was boozing and sleeping around,
do you know what I mean?

557
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,177
She was taken from him
at the peak of their love.

558
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:44,975
She's gone out on a high,
she's like Marilyn Monroe or Jimmy Dean,

559
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,422
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered. Rule one.

560
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:50,497
Choose someone else.

561
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:52,656
Well, who then?

562
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,623
It's as easy as that, isn't it, to you?

563
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:57,185
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

564
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:00,144
Yeah come in, just one second.

565
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,535
I think maybe I'm owed some money.

566
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:05,265
Some supplementary performance money
or something, I think?

567
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:07,780
Right, give me one second.

568
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,335
Hi.

569
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:13,461
Hi.

570
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,184
How can I help?

571
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:18,622
Yes, the thing, the supplementary acting fee.

572
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:21,345
Right, I'll have to check
with the first AD really.

573
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:23,986
- Let me get your details up.
- Okay.

574
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,341
- What's your name?
- Maggie Jacobs.

575
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,894
- Just take a seat, Maggie.
- Thank you.

576
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,543
(MAGGIE SIGHING)

577
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:43,936
I hope your wife doesn't catch me
on your sofa.

578
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,425
Or your girlfriend.

579
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,542
- I'm not married.
- Or your girlfriend.

580
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:50,056
I haven't got a girlfriend.

581
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:53,504
- Or I suppose your boyfriend.
- I'm not gay.

582
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,146
I should be worried
your husband catches you in here.

583
00:35:57,306 --> 00:36:00,696
I'm not married and I don't have a boyfriend
and I'm not a lesbian.

584
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,822
I'm all done, available.

585
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:14,425
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

586
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:16,979
Hello.

587
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,934
Erm, you get on well with Ben.

588
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:24,382
I wondered if you could sort of, like,
have a word with him about me

589
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:28,385
because I'm a proper actor,
I'm an extra in this but I've done, you know...

590
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,183
lines...

591
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,699
You okay?

592
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:35,180
Yeah.

593
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,824
What you got there?

594
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:39,295
My wife, pictures of my wife.

595
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:42,217
I heard about that, yeah, sorry.

596
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:46,379
- Memories. Wonderful love.
- Yeah.

597
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,415
This is her, very beautiful.

598
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:50,700
She is.

599
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:54,938
Our first holiday.
Here she is with my son, one year old.

600
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,256
- Nice boy.
- Nice no more.

601
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:59,621
Dead. Dead boy.

602
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:06,018
My wife again.

603
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,461
Oh, I shouldn't look at that.
Was she sunbathing?

604
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:10,776
No, she is dead.

605
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,016
- Lying in the street.
- Oh, I see now.

606
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,824
- Dead.
- Yeah, yes.

607
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:20,263
- Why did you take...
- Why did I take photograph of her?

608
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,940
To show the world what must be shown.

609
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:25,745
This is why I want film to be made
by Ben Stiller.

610
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,384
Ben Stiller of Zoolander, sure.

611
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,343
You look. Dead, naked.

612
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:30,541
- Yeah.
- You look.

613
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:33,777
I am, but I'm only looking
at her dead naked face.

614
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,782
Where did you get these developed?

615
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:40,219
My cousin.

616
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:43,662
I was going to say, it's not the sort of thing
you pop into Boots with.

617
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:44,781
Boots?

618
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:49,223
Oh, it's a chain of chemists,
high street pharmacy.

619
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:52,139
They don't just do pharmacy now,
they do everything.

620
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:56,777
They do gifts, sandwiches,
weight watchers, smoothies, things like that.

621
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:59,255
We don't have Boots.

622
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:03,459
You missed a trick. True Print give you a
free film when you get something developed.

623
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:05,138
So you're a mug.

624
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:09,299
Anyway, if you could put a word in to Ben
to get me a line...

625
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,339
in this...

626
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,265
I'll catch you later.

627
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,065
He's got photos and everything.

628
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:31,216
- That's not going to help, is it?
- No.

629
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:34,457
What worries me is I can't push it,
can't go up to him and remind him,

630
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:38,016
"Sorry to interrupt you again when you're
thinking of your slaughtered loved ones

631
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:41,223
"but that line, have you done anything
about it?" Do you know what I mean?

632
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:43,866
Might seem a wee bit insensitive, eh?

633
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,902
Yeah, it could do.

634
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,944
- Oh, be warned, Jackie Greer's on the prowl.
- Why?

635
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,540
- She's having a birthday do.
- Forget it, I'm not going.

636
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,901
- I'm not going if you're not going.
- Don't go, then.

637
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,898
No, but I can't not go
because she's always really nice to me.

638
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,659
- Well, have an excuse ready.
- Like what?

639
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:03,742
My standard is,
"Oh, my sister's coming down to stay."

640
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:06,420
I find out exactly when it is, though.
I go, "When is it?"

641
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:07,985
"This Saturday."
"This Saturday?

642
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,057
"I can't, my sister's coming down."

643
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:12,421
You're gutted,
you'd loved to have gone but family...

644
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:17,375
Oh, hello, you two.
I like your hair like that. Isn't she beautiful?

645
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:19,981
Now listen up, no excuses.

646
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,423
My birthday this week, I'm having
birthday drinks. I'm 21 again.

647
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:28,694
And I command you both to be there
and I won't take no for an answer.

648
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:29,855
Okay.

649
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,301
- My sister's...
- When is it?

650
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:36,095
- When is it?
- Friday, after we wrap. It's only local.

651
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:37,579
- This Friday?
- This Friday?

652
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,655
Yeah, Friday.

653
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:42,739
Oh, no, I can't do this Friday,
my sister is coming down.

654
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:45,864
Well, bring her along, I'd love to meet her.

655
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,378
Okay, I'll bring her along.

656
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:52,218
- Well, you can't bring her along.
- No.

657
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,137
- You can't actually physically bring...
- Why?

658
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:57,980
You haven't got a sister, you're confused.
My sister's coming down.

659
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:59,340
I just got confused.

660
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:01,257
- So you can come?
- Yes, I can come.

661
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,622
- And you, darling?
- As she said, my sister's coming down, so...

662
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,537
And as I said, bring her along.

663
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:09,265
But what she didn't say was
she's coming down because she's ill.

664
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:10,574
Oh, brilliant.

665
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:13,226
- God, is it serious?
- We're not sure.

666
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:15,740
- Well, send her my love.
- I will.

667
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:17,822
- But I will see you there?
- Definitely.

668
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,215
- Yes, I've got no excuses.
- Yeah.

669
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:23,346
ANDY: See you later.
MAGGIE: Bye.

670
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:24,905
Brilliant.

671
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:27,102
- Oh, my God, you're coming.
- No, I'm not.

672
00:40:27,186 --> 00:40:30,417
I've got to be punished because you
didn't think on your feet quickly enough?

673
00:40:30,506 --> 00:40:32,974
- I can't go on my own.
- I can't go at all.

674
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,739
- What if my sister died?
- What's she got?

675
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:39,462
I haven't got a sister.

676
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:42,663
- You haven't got a sister?
- No, I made it up, an excuse.

677
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,422
Reading a little magazine there, are you?

678
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:47,462
- Yes.
- Do you understand it?

679
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:50,625
Would you rather have all your food
too salty or too sweet?

680
00:40:50,706 --> 00:40:52,981
Doesn't matter if it's too anything.
It's rubbish, isn't it?

681
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,704
You see, I would have too salty.

682
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,380
No, it'd be rubbish.
If it's too salty, it'd be rubbish.

683
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:58,740
Yeah, but I like savoury things.

684
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:01,135
But you said too salty,
which means it's horrible.

685
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:03,501
- I like crisps.
- Don't ask me any more questions.

686
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,895
- Hello, again.
- MAGGIE: Hey, hello.

687
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:08,056
- This is my friend Andy.
- Hi.

688
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:09,864
Hiya. Jon.

689
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:12,744
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just having lunch.

690
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:16,660
- That's what we're doing, isn't it?
- Yeah, just letting it cool down here, though.

691
00:41:16,746 --> 00:41:19,101
Having a bit of lunch
just before we go back to work.

692
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:22,064
- Are you having to work late tonight, then?
- No, not tonight.

693
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,934
I'm going to a drinks do. I don't know
if you know, it's Jackie Greer's birthday.

694
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:29,860
Oh, my God, I'm going! I'm already going.
Oh, spooky.

695
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,982
I'm sure you're welcome
to come along as well.

696
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:34,057
I can't, I'm doing anything else.

697
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:37,024
So do you know Jackie Greer very well,
good friends?

698
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:40,621
Not really, no. The producer's going down
so he sort of asked us to go along.

699
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,743
- You know, team bonding or whatever.
- The producer of this?

700
00:41:43,826 --> 00:41:47,819
Yeah, Martin the producer. He's going to
be there. He knows Jackie from years back.

701
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,785
Yeah, I'll probably move stuff around.
I might as well come down for a couple of...

702
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:56,018
Yeah? Okay, we'll see you later on then
for a drink and a bit of a laugh, eh?

703
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:57,459
That'd be great, yeah.

704
00:41:57,546 --> 00:42:01,744
Yeah, well I'd better get this down me.
Line my stomach. Coq au vin.

705
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:05,738
- Sounds a bit rude, doesn't it?
- Not really.

706
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,384
What have you gone for?

707
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,936
Oh, boring.
Just three bean salad, spinach and smoothie.

708
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:15,099
- I'm on a high fibre diet.
- Oh. No bowel cancer for you, then.

709
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:19,063
Hopefully not, no.

710
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,266
- Okay. See you later.
- See you later, bye.

711
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:23,665
Bye.

712
00:42:24,506 --> 00:42:26,542
- "No bowel cancer for you, then?"
- All right.

713
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,378
Classic. That's really funny.

714
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,984
- Hi.
- Hello.

715
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:37,704
- You all right?
- Yes.

716
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,254
- You're not going to...
- No, no, I'm good.

717
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:43,895
- Good. Well, I got you a gift.
- Why?

718
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:47,296
Just to say thanks for being part
of this amazing project, you know.

719
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:48,944
Oh, thank you very much.

720
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:52,814
And to thank you for the line you said
you'd get me, do you remember?

721
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:55,136
- Did I?
- Yeah, you probably don't remember

722
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:58,024
because you were crying
about your dead family and stuff.

723
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:00,256
But you said you'd ask Ben for a line.

724
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:03,258
Are you going to ask Ben for a line?

725
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:05,655
Yes, I can do that.

726
00:43:05,746 --> 00:43:07,976
I didn't know what to get you,
got you vouchers.

727
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,738
- Vouchers?
- Yeah.

728
00:43:09,826 --> 00:43:11,942
Fifteen quids' worth.

729
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,256
- It's like money?
- It's exactly like money

730
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:16,701
but you can only spend it at Top Shop.

731
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:20,096
So, you'll ask Ben, yeah?

732
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,454
Yeah.

733
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,935
Brilliant. Fifteen quid.

734
00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:26,903
See you later.

735
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:32,944
(GUNSHOTS)

736
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:36,023
(EXPLOSION)

737
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,425
Cut! Cut!

738
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:43,297
Why is he laughing?
Why are you laughing, hm?

739
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,696
- I tripped up.
- What's so funny?

740
00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:48,458
I tripped up.

741
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:52,016
Okay. All right, do you think this is funny?

742
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,297
You think war is funny?

743
00:43:54,386 --> 00:43:57,219
Do you think genocide is funny? Huh?

744
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:59,976
Are you his mum? Yeah. Let me ask you this.

745
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:03,138
Do you think this'll be funny?
If I shot your mother right now?

746
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,581
If I shot your mummy in the face,
would that make you laugh?

747
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,418
Do you think that would be funny?

748
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:10,976
If I blew your mother's face off now,
would that make you laugh?

749
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,944
Okay, so maybe you should think
of that next time you trip, okay?

750
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,062
Let's do it right now, let's go.

751
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,382
- BEN: Still rolling.
- And the atrocities continue.

752
00:44:21,386 --> 00:44:22,819
BEN: And action!

753
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:24,817
It's so itchy, this.

754
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:42,820
- JACKIE: Maggie and Andy.
- Hi.

755
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:48,539
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

756
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:51,902
Thank you so much. I wasn't expecting you,
I thought your sister was ill.

757
00:44:51,986 --> 00:44:55,023
Yes, but it turned out to be
not as serious as we first thought.

758
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,825
So, yeah, women's problems.

759
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:01,618
Typical, quite a build up.
I had to get out of the house in the end.

760
00:45:01,706 --> 00:45:06,063
I thought she was gonna have my face off.
A Rottweiler with lipstick.

761
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,864
Busy, though.

762
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,455
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

763
00:45:10,546 --> 00:45:12,901
Someone said the producer was coming.
Is that...

764
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:15,102
It's Martin, he's over there.

765
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,904
- Oh, okay.
- You look gorgeous.

766
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:20,023
Look at you, I wouldn't have thought
to put that with that...

767
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:32,095
...and that's the same problem we've got...

768
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:33,900
Hello!

769
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:36,102
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

770
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:38,780
No, it was Elaine's idea originally.

771
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,334
He says that every time,
but it was both of us.

772
00:45:41,426 --> 00:45:45,578
It's usually true. Anyway,
it's modern retellings of the old stories

773
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,543
and we're going to make several of them.

774
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:50,140
It's going to be a little bit like
Kieslowski's Decalogue.

775
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:51,705
- Have you see those?
- Yes.

776
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:56,018
Well, you know there's that one character,
the Watcher, and it's a fantastic character.

777
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:58,336
Have you read that
Kieslowski on Kieslowski book?

778
00:45:58,426 --> 00:45:59,620
No, I haven't.

779
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:03,016
He wrote later that he was so upset
that he left him out of two of the films

780
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,824
'cause he really wished he was...

781
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:07,181
It's his fault, should've...

782
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:11,616
Do you want a drink?
I'm a friend of Jackie's. My round.

783
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,743
- Oh, great, we're on champagne.
- Three glasses of champagne.

784
00:46:14,826 --> 00:46:18,216
- Oh, just get a bottle.
- Yes, definitely.

785
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:21,694
Anyway, so...

786
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:25,975
What do you mean,
why have you not seen me around?

787
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:27,215
I've gone red.

788
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,774
Have you done other productions?
Are you an actress?

789
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:32,096
- No.
- Oh, you look like you should be an actress.

790
00:46:32,186 --> 00:46:33,938
- Costume dramas or something like that.
- Yeah?

791
00:46:36,946 --> 00:46:39,062
I'd imagine it'll be seconds...

792
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:53,898
Hi. Andy.

793
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:55,783
Oh, Andy, yeah. Oh, cheers.

794
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:56,901
Cheers.

795
00:46:56,986 --> 00:47:01,457
Just thinking what you and Ben
are doing in this film, wonderful,

796
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:03,616
it moved me, so...

797
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:05,264
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

798
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:08,224
Can I ask you something?
What was your inspiration?

799
00:47:08,306 --> 00:47:10,376
Well, obviously the story.

800
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:11,694
Oh, yeah.

801
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:13,981
In film terms. Probably something like the...

802
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,784
- Are you a film buff?
- I adore films.

803
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,664
Well, I'll tell you what I re-watched
when we were planning this.

804
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:19,735
Oh, please do.

805
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:22,386
Andrzej Wajda's War Trilogy.
They're extraordinary, aren't they?

806
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,581
Yeah.

807
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:28,137
Ben's been watching them, particularly in
relation to battle scenes, a lot of Kurosawa.

808
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:29,739
Oh, okay.

809
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:33,296
Yeah, particularly in relation
to the kineticism of the mise en scène.

810
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:35,820
In the film. Yeah, I see.

811
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:37,339
You a fan? Generally?

812
00:47:37,426 --> 00:47:39,018
- Yes.
- Of Japanese cinema?

813
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,983
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, well.

814
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:43,378
Kurosawa's obviously a master.

815
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah, he's number one.

816
00:47:44,826 --> 00:47:47,135
I suppose on a personal level,
I'm more a fan of Ozu.

817
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:50,980
Me, too, but I think they're both,
they're both big boys.

818
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:54,217
- The aesthetics are completely different.
- Chalk and cheese, but...

819
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:57,855
- He tends to knock the camera off.
- And the other one just lets it on.

820
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:00,255
It was Elaine actually
who turned me on to Ozu.

821
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,576
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, I wasn't really a fan before.

822
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,019
Really?

823
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,218
No, I'm sure you've found this.

824
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:08,661
You say to someone, "Do you like
Japanese cinema?" and they say,

825
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:10,145
"No, can't get into it, boring."

826
00:48:10,226 --> 00:48:12,296
And you say,
"Well, do you like the Magnificent Seven?"

827
00:48:12,386 --> 00:48:14,263
- And they say, "Yes."
- Yeah, they like that.

828
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:17,497
And you think, well,
it's a remake of the Seven Samurai.

829
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:20,339
Yeah, yeah, course it is.
What, they didn't know that?

830
00:48:20,426 --> 00:48:22,781
- No.
- Seven's the clue. Can't just make that up.

831
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,699
No, it really upsets me.
I want everyone to love the Seven Samurai.

832
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:30,496
I love all the number films, really.
Seven Samurai, Ocean's Eleven, Dirty Dozen.

833
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:33,384
Which is about as many as I think
you can have on screen at once.

834
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:35,980
- But seven is perfect for me.
- Apologies for this,

835
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,660
but I don't really recognise you.
What are you doing?

836
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:43,376
I'm an actor, yeah. Although at the moment,
I'm concentrating more on background work,

837
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:46,856
looking out towards getting a speaking role.
In anything.

838
00:48:46,946 --> 00:48:49,904
- Andy, sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all.

839
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:51,419
Listen, can I have a quick word?

840
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:53,576
- Not now, I'm a little bit busy.
- Two minutes.

841
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:56,738
- I'm in the middle...
- Don't mind us. We'll be here.

842
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:58,657
Yeah? Okay, all right.

843
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:05,824
I just wanted to let you know that
Jon's going on somewhere else

844
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:07,544
- and he's asked me to go with him.
- Fine.

845
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:10,823
I wanted to let you know
because it was me who dragged you here.

846
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,295
You'd be all annoyed
because I'd disappeared...

847
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:14,899
I'm fine, I'm chatting.

848
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,897
- He's nice.
- He is, yes.

849
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:21,096
- Foot doesn't bother you?
- Eh?

850
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:23,905
I know you're a deeply shallow person,
I thought the foot would be a problem.

851
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,055
What do you mean?

852
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:29,025
He's got one leg shorter than the other, look.
He's wearing one of them big shoes.

853
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:31,666
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't notice that?

854
00:49:31,826 --> 00:49:34,135
Well, no, it was under the table, wasn't it?

855
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:36,660
- Yes. Must have been a big table.
- No, don't.

856
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:38,384
- What?
- I didn't see.

857
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:42,141
Oh, look at him. He's a lovely man.
He's funny, he's attractive.

858
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:45,024
Look at him, everybody loves him,
life and soul of the party.

859
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:47,700
- Certainly the sole.
- Oh, come on.

860
00:49:47,786 --> 00:49:51,256
If you're above it. If you don't mind
being known as Maggie, "Who's Maggie?"

861
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:54,497
"Maggie, the girl who goes out with
the fellow with the big shoe," that's fine.

862
00:49:54,586 --> 00:49:56,497
But they can do something
about it now, can't they?

863
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:59,100
- No.
- Some doctor in China or something.

864
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:02,701
No, it's weird, that's the one thing
they can't do anything about.

865
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:06,062
They can give you a new face, new heart,
new lungs, new liver, new anything,

866
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:07,579
but if you go to a doctor and you say,

867
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,861
"Doc, I've got one leg
slightly shorter than the other,"

868
00:50:09,946 --> 00:50:11,584
doesn't matter if you got a million pounds,

869
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:15,454
they can send you to Switzerland and
all you're coming home with is a big shoe.

870
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,504
- Stop it.
- That's fine, if it's not a problem for you.

871
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:21,100
I'm not so shallow
that I can't see beyond his big foot.

872
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:23,984
I know you,
you'll get involved and it will be a problem.

873
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:26,216
All I'm saying is this,
don't rush off with him tonight.

874
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:29,184
Sleep on it, if it's not a problem tomorrow,
give him a call.

875
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:32,736
- In the morning?
- Absolutely, why rush into it now? He's here.

876
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:36,142
- Hey.
- Hi.

877
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:38,342
I'm ready to get going if you are.

878
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:41,381
Now? Right now?

879
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:44,261
Er... I don't think I can go right now.

880
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,621
Oh, right. You said you fancied it just then.

881
00:50:47,706 --> 00:50:49,936
Yeah, but he just reminded me of something.

882
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:53,336
- Yeah, I just reminded her.
- I don't think I can go.

883
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:57,704
Is it... Is it the leg?

884
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,180
Hm?

885
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:04,857
Is it the fact that I've got one leg
shorter than the other?

886
00:51:06,706 --> 00:51:08,662
- I hadn't noticed.
- You hadn't noticed?

887
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:10,020
I hadn't.

888
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:18,260
- You hadn't noticed that?
- Oh! No.

889
00:51:18,426 --> 00:51:21,498
- I hadn't. God, it's a big clumpy one.
- Don't say clumpy.

890
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:25,545
- It's like a big Herman Munster.
- Oh! Don't say...

891
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:28,462
- Er...
- Oh, that's...

892
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:31,185
Do these come in any other styles?

893
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:33,945
Do you have to buy a pair
and throw one away?

894
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:39,018
It's been good talking to you.

895
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:41,859
- Just interested because...
- I've never seen a live one.

896
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:44,221
Maybe I can phone you tomorrow.

897
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:48,094
No. No, don't worry about it.
You've shown your true colours.

898
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:54,175
- That was you.
- It wasn't my fault. How was it my fault?

899
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,858
That poor man.

900
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,983
All his life he's had to deal with people
that are so shallow

901
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:03,582
that they can't see beyond his foot thing
and he's going to think I'm like that.

902
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:04,894
You are.

903
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:07,216
I don't want him to know that.

904
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:10,662
- Well, don't say Herman Munster then.
- Well, it just slipped out.

905
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,498
Herman Munster just slipped out?

906
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,985
Bit more room.

907
00:52:25,026 --> 00:52:28,655
We were having a conversation earlier
about films, weren't we?

908
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,304
You'd have hated it.

909
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:34,857
I was going to ask you about this film.
Are there any parts left to cast?

910
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:38,222
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Oh, that's a shame.

911
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:41,224
- Jon seemed quite upset.
- Was he?

912
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:44,544
I thought you were getting on with him.
You seemed to be.

913
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:45,820
Yeah, we were.

914
00:52:45,906 --> 00:52:48,136
But you don't want to see him
because of his foot?

915
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:51,502
- I didn't say that.
- But it is though, isn't it?

916
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,054
Well, it's her private life, innit?

917
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:58,617
Yeah, I'm just saying that I think it's a shame
that she obviously goes through life

918
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:00,896
not liking anyone that's different than her.

919
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,624
That's not true.

920
00:53:03,106 --> 00:53:06,621
She's gets on with anyone,
tall, thin, black, white, yellow.

921
00:53:06,706 --> 00:53:08,503
She's not prejudiced.

922
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:11,575
- Who's yellow?
- What?

923
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:17,420
Well, you were just listing racial types,
black, white... Who's yellow?

924
00:53:23,386 --> 00:53:24,739
(ANDY CLEARS THROAT)

925
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:28,142
- That's what we call the Chinese sometimes.
- Oh, do we?

926
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:31,821
The Chinese? Well, one, I'm American

927
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:35,825
and two, my parents are Japanese,
not Chinese.

928
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:37,976
Oh, yes, Japanese, Chinese I wasn't...

929
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:42,378
What do you mean, Japanese, Chinese?
Both the same to you, are they?

930
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:45,424
Well, don't make me sound like a racist,
I don't happen to know

931
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:48,020
the intricate differences
between Japanese and Chinese people.

932
00:53:48,106 --> 00:53:49,983
There's that thing
that they teach you at school.

933
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:51,101
No.

934
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,223
Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees,
what are these?

935
00:53:57,186 --> 00:53:59,700
- Do you remember it?
- Yeah, it rings a bell.

936
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:01,981
- Okay? That's us.
- Yeah.

937
00:54:02,066 --> 00:54:03,818
ANDY: Cheers, good night.

938
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:07,300
- Are we going?
- Yeah. Do you know why?

939
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:08,785
- No.
- Guess.

940
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,857
- Because of the foot.
- No.

941
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:19,697
- I know the first...
- Then we've got the second one.

942
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:23,984
Okay, I don't need to hear, you know,
the story of how we got to this point.

943
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:27,695
I know what point we're at, I'm just
wondering when we can actually shoot it.

944
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,065
- Hey.
- Hi.

945
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:31,465
- Good news.
- Yeah?

946
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:33,776
- I got you line.
- Really?

947
00:54:33,866 --> 00:54:37,620
I talk to Ben, he say, here, you see.
Journalist Two.

948
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:40,459
"Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there."

949
00:54:40,546 --> 00:54:43,140
(WITH ACCENT) Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there.

950
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,217
- What you doing?
- The accent. I was gonna...

951
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:48,616
- Don't.
- I won't do the accent. That's brilliant.

952
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:50,503
- Okay.
- Excellent.

953
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:51,621
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

954
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:55,096
Hold on. Sorry, there's two journalists here.
Journalist One and Journalist Two.

955
00:54:55,186 --> 00:54:57,495
I'm Journalist Two,
but Journalist One's got all the lines.

956
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,295
Look, him, him, him, me, snipers.
Him, him, him.

957
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,781
I think I should do Journalist Two, you know.

958
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:05,936
I think someone else already doing that.

959
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:09,541
- I know, but we could swap. I'd be better.
- I got you a line.

960
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:12,379
I know, but remember the vouchers.
I got you the vouchers, didn't I?

961
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:13,785
I put them towards this top.

962
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:15,618
- Brilliant. Doesn't that look good?
- Nice.

963
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:18,937
Looks really good. Have a word
and see if I could do Journalist Two.

964
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:20,345
He's busy.

965
00:55:20,426 --> 00:55:24,738
Yeah, but he's always busy. Just get
a quiet moment when he's not so busy.

966
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:27,943
Kelvin, go back to one on this,
we've got to work this out.

967
00:55:28,026 --> 00:55:29,459
- Ivan, when you come...
- Igor.

968
00:55:29,546 --> 00:55:30,740
- What?
- Igor.

969
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:33,465
Igor, okay, when you knock her down,
don't ask her to come down.

970
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:35,138
You smack her in the back of the head

971
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:37,615
and then you come here
and you jam it into her mouth.

972
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,139
You can't put your hand up, okay?

973
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:41,979
Boom, you jam her in the mouth,
break her jaw on the first one.

974
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:44,057
Second one nose, okay. Her jaw's broken,

975
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:46,341
she's swallowed her teeth,
blood's coming out, all right?

976
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,099
Then you smack her again across the side,
breaking the neck.

977
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,460
All right, can we do this again, please?

978
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:52,741
- Go and get him now.
- Okay, I try.

979
00:55:53,786 --> 00:55:55,299
- GORAN: Ben.
- Yeah.

980
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:58,344
I need to swap the lines.

981
00:55:58,426 --> 00:56:00,542
What do you mean,
you need to swap the lines?

982
00:56:00,626 --> 00:56:02,378
For my friend. He wants to...

983
00:56:02,466 --> 00:56:04,616
Your friend? No, no, I gave your friend a line.

984
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:08,062
Yes, but I want him to have more.

985
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,296
You want him to have more?

986
00:56:10,386 --> 00:56:13,105
- You want him to have more lines?
- Yes.

987
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:16,974
I don't understand, are you directing
the movie or am I directing the movie?

988
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:21,423
No, but this is my story.
My memories, my tribute to my dead wife.

989
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:27,939
Would you stop going on
about your fucking dead wife?

990
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,904
All right, let's do another rehearsal.
Right away, please.

991
00:56:37,986 --> 00:56:39,260
Ben.

992
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:41,703
That was a wee bit much.

993
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,139
Ben?

994
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,376
I'm sorry, what's your name?

995
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:50,656
Oh, wait a minute, I remember.
I don't give a shit.

996
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:53,263
- Get out of my face.
- All right.

997
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:56,975
Don't have a go at her,
she was just worried about Goran.

998
00:56:57,826 --> 00:56:59,145
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

999
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:01,376
What's that? Who?

1000
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:03,741
- Nobody.
- That's right, nobody.

1001
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:06,304
Yeah, and who am I?

1002
00:57:08,026 --> 00:57:10,699
It's either Starsky or Hutch,
I can never remember.

1003
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:15,102
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- You tell me, you were in it.

1004
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:16,699
- Get off my set.
- Okay.

1005
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:18,504
Get off my set.

1006
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:21,218
Hey, hey, question.

1007
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:24,184
Do you know how much Meet the Fockers
made in its opening weekend?

1008
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,700
- No.
- No, you don't, do you?

1009
00:57:26,786 --> 00:57:28,777
What do you think?

1010
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:30,777
- Don't know.
- Take a wild guess.

1011
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:31,981
Twenty million?

1012
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:36,537
Way off. Double it, add six.
46, three days. 70 million, five days.

1013
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:38,935
500 million worldwide.

1015
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:43,303
Well done. Bye, nerd.

1016
00:57:43,746 --> 00:57:45,338
- Oh, I'm a nerd?
- Yeah.

1017
00:57:45,426 --> 00:57:46,700
I'm a nerd.

1018
00:57:46,786 --> 00:57:50,495
I've kissed Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore.

1019
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:52,975
I slapped Jennifer Aniston's butt.

1020
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:54,977
- In films.
- It still counts.

1021
00:58:02,506 --> 00:58:04,224
It still counts.

1022
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:10,218
It still counts. I did it, I actually did it.

- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Okay, we'll get it on that, thank you.

1029
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,757
- Was I in it?
- I don't know.

1030
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,991
No, I wasn't in it. What is the point
in getting all tarted up like this

1031
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,356
- if you're not going to make it to the scene?
- You look quite dapper.

1032
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,750
- It's a Nazi uniform.
- I know. It's a bit natty, though, isn't it?

1033
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,274
- Natty?
- I bet it's more comfortable than this.

1034

This is riding up my clunge.

1035
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,275
Can you imagine hiding from the Gestapo
for weeks on end dressed like this?

1036
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,510
Yeah, it must have been awful.

1037
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,115
- It's actually very slimming that.
- Yeah? I'll wear it out Friday night.

1038
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,350
She's right. I can see what she means.

1039
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,237
Yeah? You think I look good in this?

1040
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,074

- Not sure.

Okay, take care moving on now.
Thanks, chaps.

1045
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,829
- Do you know what worries me?
- Don't know.

1046
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,150
Where do baby ants go to school? Go on.

1047
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,074
No, all these people going about
pretending to be nuns.

1048
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,674
- What do you mean?
- Do you think that's right?

1049
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,352
- It's a film.
- I know.

1050
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,432
But they're all wandering around
as holy ladies.

1051
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,159
Wouldn't that offend God or someone?

1052
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,800
- Offend God or someone?
- Does it not worry you a bit?

1053
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,474
No. What, offending God? I'm an atheist.

1054
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,472
What one's that? Is that the one
where you haven't decided what...

1055
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,518
No, that's agnostic. I'm an atheist.
I firmly believe there is no God.

1056
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,592
- Why?
- Wh... The burden of proof is not on me.

1057
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,989
The burden of proof is on the people
who say there is a God.

1058
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,310
I don't believe in God, I believe in science.

1059
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,109
Do you not believe in anything
like ghosts or spirits or anything?

1060
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,320
No, I don't believe in ghosts or spirits
or elves. Certainly not God, no.

1061
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,312
So what do you think happens
when you die?

1062
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,109
Well, if you're buried,
you go in the ground and you're worm food.

1063
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,077
See, I don't like that.

1064
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,757
I would rather believe that there is a God
and your soul just floats away on to eternity.

1065
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,475
All your friends from school will be there,
all the ones you haven't seen for ages,

1066
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,233
and all your dead pets
and just, like, all nice people.

1067
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,470
You don't have to worry about worms.

1068
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,951
You believe in God, then.

1069
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,349
I think I need to go for a wee.

1070
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,271
Oh, that's the third one already.

1071
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,079
Good. Well, keep me posted
throughout the week.

1072
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,798
Maybe keep a journal.

1073
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,318
Oh, God!

1074
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,550
- What have you done?
- What?

1075
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,471
What's happened? Are you all right?

1076
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,190
No, I've got cerebral palsy. Don't worry.

1077
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,713
Oh, good.

1078
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,112
- I thought you'd had a fall or something.
- No, I'm cool. Really.

1079
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,952
Oh, hello, then. I'm Maggie.

1080

- Hello.
- Good to meet you.

1082
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,031
- Are you in this as well?
- Oh, she's just here to watch.

1083
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,716
- I was going to say...
- Oh, I have a bit of spare time, you know,

1084
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,554
because my tap dancing class
was cancelled so...

1085
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,998
Right.

1086
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,275
Joke, tap dancing, me.

1087
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,590
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1088
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,555
- I've got a question about your props.
- Go on.

1089
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,871
- Where's all this stuff come from?
- You just buy it.

1090
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,272
What, there's a shop for
a 30 foot swastika is there?

1091
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,954
No, I got that from home. It's my Nan's.

1092
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,193
Here she is.

1093
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,474
- All right?
- Yeah.

1094
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,711
Hey, do you want to have lunch
with us later?

1095
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,917
I can't. I've got to go
and see my fool of an agent.

1096
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,231
- Still going well, is it?
- I went in the other day, right,

1097
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,108
and he said to me, "Andy," he said,
"if I don't get a decent client soon,

1098
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,510
"I'm going to have to go full time
at The Carphone Warehouse."

1099
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,953
Unbelievable.

1100
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,395
- Here, got to go.
- See you later.

1101
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,119
- Go and move some props around.
- Will do.

1102
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,236
- Going well, is it?
- Yeah, it's good.

1103
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,834
That's longer than a day you've been
going out with this one.

1104
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,309
- Three weeks.
- That has got to be a record for you.

1105
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,153
- Cheekiness.
- No, well done. Good bloke.

1106
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,629
- Well, I'm glad you like him.
- Yeah, good.

1107
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,637
- What?
- Nothing.

1108
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,199
- Married?
- No.

1109
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,032
- Gay?
- No!

1110
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,037
It is something, though.

1111
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,874
He likes to talk dirty on the phone.

1112
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,950
He'll call me up
and he's coming out with all this filth.

1113
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,109
Why would you tell me that?

1114
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,470
What does he say? What does he say?

1115
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,713
He calls up and says things like...

1116
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,633
"Ooh, what are you doing?"

1117
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,199
What do you say?

1118
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,034
I didn't know what was going on at first,
didn't realise, and I was just honest with him

1119
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,113
and I said, "I'm just cleaning out
the vegetable drawer of the fridge."

1120
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,191
Well, he probably thought
that was a euphemism.

1121
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,273
"Oh, I'm cleaning out my vegetable drawer."
"Oh, I am scrubbing my front step."

1122
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,191
- Have you talked dirty back to him?
- No.

1123
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,633
- Have you?
- No, I have not.

1124
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,995
I don't know what to say to him.
It's too embarrassing.

1125
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,789
- Yeah.
- What if I say something and he laughs at me

1126
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,429
or something and it's too much
and he gets all offended?

1127
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,718
Well, no, it's just all stuff like,
"Oh, I'm playing with myself."

1128
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,836
Oh, that sounds interesting.

1129
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,549
- Hi. Not me, her.
- Go on.

1130
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,034
Her boyfriend likes to talk dirty on the phone
and she doesn't know what to say to him.

1131
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,475
Oh, yeah, that can be a bit awkward.

1132
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,155
Why don't you just start off
with something light, you know, like...

1133
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,997
"I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka
between my Oompa Loompas."

1134
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,356
You know, something a bit jokey
and then you can get more hardcore.

1135
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,638
Rattle off the old classics like,
"I'm playing with my dirty pillows."

1136
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,077
"I'm aching for your big purple-headed
womb ferret." And then go straight in hard,

1137
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,233
"Get round here because I'm fudding
myself stupid and I'm bloody loving it."

1138
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,958
- All right?
- Yeah.

1139
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,155
Yeah.

1140
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,752
Anyway, better get on. Good luck.

1141
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,472
Love to Sam Mendes.

1142
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,112
Kate Winslet just talking dirty to...

1143
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,559
Anne Frank and Joseph Goebbels.

1144
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,676
Just... another normal day.

1145
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,675
- Guten Tag, Fräulein.
- Oh, hi.

1146
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,069
(WITH GERMAN ACCENT)
What is this "Oh, hi"?

1147
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,957
Sorry, is that meant to be German?

1148
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,350
You are resisting the great German
sense of humour. You are English, ya?

1149
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,433
Then I have something for you
that will make you roll in the aisles.

1150
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,277
This is funny to you, yeah,
because it looks like a thingy. Yeah.

1151
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,319
Actually, this will make you laugh.
Jesus, look, pissed up nutter over there.

1152
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,471
She's had a few.

1153
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,357
Actually, is she pissed or mental?

1154
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,192
Oh, here she comes.

1155
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,111
- That's my sister.
- Huh?

1156
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,997
She's got cerebral palsy.

1157
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,071
No... not... her.

1158
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,551
Another nutter that was...
Not another nutter, she's not...

1159
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,599
She's gone now, the one I meant.
Shot on and just shot off again.

1160
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

1161
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,792
- This is my sister.
- Hiya.

1162
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,313
- Francesca.
- You all right?

1163
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,277
Hiya, you all right?

1164
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,430
What do you do in this, then?

1165
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,599
What Judith...?

1166
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,355
- No, she said what do you do in this?
- Oh, a background artist.

1167
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,318
Oh, right. And what does that entail?

1168
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,113
What does that entail?

1169
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,590
Yeah, just standing around, really.
Although it's not what I do.

1170
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,797
I'm a real actor,
this is just sort of like pocket money.

1171
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,553
Yeah, well I bet they all say that, don't they?

1172
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,513
All right, mate. Come and check this out.
I just typed in 58,008 into a calculator...

1173
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,352
and lo and behold, amazingly,
it comes up "boobs".

1174
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,993
You see that? That's worth knowing, isn't it?

1175
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,588
Good.

1176
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,195
What can I do... Oh, sorry.

1177
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,952
Better get that. Hang on.

1178
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,600
(PHONE RINGING)

1179
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,708
Just...

1180
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,833
Hello? It's gone.

1181
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,229
That's... annoying.

1182
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,993
It's weird that,
it always happens with that one.

1183
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,434
- Turn it off.
- Okay, I'll put it on vibrate.

1184
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,358
How do you do that?

1185
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,109
Erm... what can I do for you?

1186
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,711
You called me in for a meeting.

1187
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,552
Did I? What was that about?

1188
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,870
I don't know, you said you wanted to see me.

1189
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,315
All right. I'll just check on here.

1190
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,236
- What's the gist of it?
- It'll be on here.

1191
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,518
I've got everything organised on there
so it's all...

1192
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,471
I'm looking at the wrong date.

1193
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,869
- Erm... it's the third today, isn't it?
- Fourth.

1194
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,712
Fourth. Yeah, I was looking
at the wrong date.

1195
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,631
Tuesday 3rd, blank.

1196
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,677
What does it say here?
It just says, today, "catch-up meeting".

1197
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,274
Just to catch up, really, with you
and find out what's been happening

1198
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,830
- tell you about what's coming in and...
- Okay, what's coming in?

1199
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,511
Nothing's come in according to that.

1200
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,953
- Nothing's come in?
- No.

1201
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,508
Okay, good. Well, that was well worth it.

1202
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,672
Apart from sitting there waiting for
the phone to ring, what have you done?

1203
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,274
Have you called anyone?
Have you sent the script out?

1204
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,793
What script? Sorry?

1205
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,189
Oh, man, the script I gave you
two months ago.

1206
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,395
That sounds good.

1207
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,789
- The sitcom.
- Yeah? Funny?

1208
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,711
You haven't read it?

1209
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,633
What's it called?
Because I can get on to that.

1210
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,798
- When the Whistle Blows.
- I'll just write down "When the 'W' Blows."

1211
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,678
Don't put "W", you'll forget what the "W"
stands for. Write it out.

1212
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,671
- No, When the Wind Blows.
- Whistle.

1213
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,672
I'll put that in. "W" equals wind.

1214
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,955
- Whistle!
- Whistle. It's there.

1215
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,871
- It's in.
- That's safe then, is it?

1216
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,349
That's done. I can forget about that.
That's on its way, yeah?

1217
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,158
I've got my best man on it?

1218
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,356
- Yeah.
- Safe hands, safe hands.

1219
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,958
- Do you want to put another meeting in?
- Any point?

1220
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:43,033
May as well. And then when nothing
comes in, just phone you up and cancel it.

1221
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,759
That's a plan.

1222
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,195
I don't think of him as an agent now.

1223
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,078
I think of him as a bloke
who had some cards printed up

1224
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,594
in a vending machine in the garage
with the word "agent" on them.

1225
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,591
That, to me, is his qualifications.

1226
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,309
He sent me up for the lead role in Billy Elliot.

1227
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,359
Yeah, right, the man in charge of my career.
I'm glad you're finding this funny.

1228
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,158
She's laughing at my life.

1229
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,549
Aw.

1230
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,870
It must be lovely to see her laughing.

1231
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,959
She laughs all the time. She lives to laugh.

1232
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,793
Well, you have to be able to laugh,
don't you?

1233
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,030
Keeps you sane.

1234
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,758
I thought she was sane?

1235
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,229
No, I mean, it keeps anybody sane.

1236
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,959
Oh, right, yes. People laughing and...

1237
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,352
You know, don't you reckon if you can
laugh, you can cope with, like, anything?

1238
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,708
It's a God-given gift, isn't it?
Laughing in the face of adversity.

1239
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,037
- You're quite religious, are you?
- Yeah, we both are.

1240
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,033
We both really believe, right,
that God gives us a struggle

1241
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,429
and that's the point of life, isn't it?

1242
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,354
You know, to overcome
the difficulties thrown at you

1243
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,195
and the greatest thing is you know
that in heaven, everything will be all right.

1244
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,158
Maggie, do you believe in God or...?

1245
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,879
- Yes, I do, I think, yes.
- Oh, great.

1246
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,397
And what about you, Andy?
Do you believe in God?

1247
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,109
Like, do you believe
everything will be okay in heaven?

1248
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,599
Yeah.

1249
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,511
- What faith are you?
- What...?

1250
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,672
- What faith are you?
- Catholic.

1251
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,070
- Oh, really? So are we.
- Oh, excellent.

1252
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,039
Lot of us about and I am definitely one of us.

1253
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,036
Catholicism, the "C" word.

1254
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,793
Not the "C" word, a "C" word.

1255
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,189
Heaven, yeah, amazing.
It's going to be brilliant up there.

1256
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,238
You're going to have an amazing time,
you'll love it.

1257
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,996
Be like lbiza or something.

1258
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,634
Please, Lord...

1259
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,792
let us know that you have seen
what we have seen.

1260
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,953
Please, Lord.

1261
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,120
You have to let us know
that we are not alone.

1262
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,797
Thank you, Lord.

1263
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,839
DIRECTOR: Cut!

1264
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,990
Christ, that is bloody hot.

1265
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,196
Oh, fuck, my fucking knees.

1266
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,475
- Can we go again on that?
- Not now.

1267
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,313
- Does it have to be that hot?
- It's okay now.

1268
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,439
I'm sweating like a bastard.
No wonder they lose their rag sometimes.

1269
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,480
Oh, hiya. How did it go
with your dirty phone call?

1270
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,790
Oh, I haven't done it yet. I'm working up to it.

1271
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,871
Well, here is another one that's always good.

1272
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,758
Just do all the preliminary stuff
and then you go, "Hang on,

1273
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,719
"why is the slut from next door just coming
into my bedroom and is taking her bra off?"

1274
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,598
Then you just pretend
you're getting it on with her.

1275
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,399
- I couldn't do that.
- Course you can, you're an actress.

1276
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,517
No, I'm not. I'm just an extra.
You're the actress.

1277
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,319
- A brilliant actress, by the way.
- Yeah, she is.

1278
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,837
I'm an actor as well as... If there's a line
going in this film, I'd love to be part of this.

1279
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,595
I'd just like to say, I think, you know,
you doing this is so commendable.

1280
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,639
Using your profile to keep
the message alive about the Holocaust.

1281
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,191
My God, I'm not doing it for that.

1282
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,238
I don't think we really need
another film about the Holocaust, do we?

1283
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,835
It's, like, how many have there been?
You know, we get it, it was grim, move on.

1284
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,435
No, I'm doing it because I've noticed
that if you do a film about the Holocaust,

1285
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,272
guaranteed an Oscar.

1286
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,318
I've been nominated four times, never won.

1287
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,915
And the whole world is going,
"Why hasn't Winslet won one?"

1288
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,595
Definitely, yeah.

1289
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,108
That's, er, that's why I'm doing it.

1290
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,270
Schindler's bloody List.

1291
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,998
The Pianist.

1292
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,435
Oscars coming out of their arse.

1293
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,072
Well, good luck, then.

1294
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,071
- It's a good plan.
- Thank you.

1295
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,754
- Good luck with your phone call.
- Okay.

1296
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,432
- See you later.
- Bye.

1297
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,080
- Can we go again?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1298
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,598
DIRECTOR: And action.

1299
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,072
(BOOTS SQUEAKING)

1300
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,554
Sorry.

1301
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,232
DIRECTOR: Cut there, thank you.

1302
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,231
All right, reset, please.

1303
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,032
- Are you married or single?
- Why?

1304
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,796
- I think my sister might like you a bit.
- Really?

1305
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,757
She's only human.

1306
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,993
...square head, I must say.

1307
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,759
Anyway, I meant to ask you actually,

1308
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,035
a couple of friends of mine are having
a get together tonight.

1309
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,031
Wondered if you were free,
would you like to come along?

1310
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,678
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

1311
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,876
Definitely. Ya!

1312
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,877
Oh, my God,
I've got Jeremy Clarkson's clothes.

1313
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,193
- I can't... It's awful.
- Well, what sort of a party is it?

1314
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,874
Well, she said a get together
with some friends, probably casual,

1315
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,190
but I want to look good, don't I?

1316
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,189
Ooh!

1317
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,788
I know. You said
she was quite a classy, stylish...

1318
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,438
- Yeah.
...type of lady.

1319
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,873
This. Look.

1320
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,755
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us,
over the world's tempestuous sea.

1321
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,513
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us

1322
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,750
for we have no help but Thee.

1323
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,109
Yet possessing every blessing
if our God our father...

1324
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,191
- Lovely suit.
- Thanks.

1325
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,316
I like to look good for a prayer meeting.

1326
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,631
...our God descending,
fill our hearts with heavenly joy.

1327
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,438
Love with every passion...

1328
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,272
How long is this going to take,
out of interest?

1329
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,794
- An hour and a half.
- Hour and a half!

1330
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,112
Time for a drink afterwards?

1331
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,713
- Yes.
- Yes?

1332
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,314
...nothing can our peace destroy.

1333
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,630
Isn't that lovely?
Thank you, Lisa, it was lovely.

1334
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,311
Hi, it's me.

1335
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,316
Yeah, no, I'm good. You?

1336
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,629
Good. Yeah, I'm ready.

1337
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,269
Okay.

1338
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,909
I'm not wearing anything.

1339
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,753
No, you're not wearing anything?

1340
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,912
Hey, both of us are not wearing anything.

1341
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,752
What am I doing? Yeah.

1342
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,193
Er...

1343
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,909
First off, I'm fudding myself stupid

1344
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,434
and I'm bloody loving it.

1345
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,588
Fudding.

1346
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,637
I think she wanted me to wear my uniform.
You told her how good I looked in my...?

1347
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,869
Really nice.

1348
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,235
Yeah, she really liked it.
Do you know what uniform it is?

1349
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,436
German. I know, yeah.

1350
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,557
With what they did,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

1351
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,108
I don't think you two
have been formally introduced.

1352
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,475
- This is Andy, Father.
- How are you, son?

1353
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,710
You don't have to do that. I'm not the Pope.

1354
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,032
No, old habits die hard. My old priest
used to make me kiss him on the ring.

1355
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,351
On his finger.
There was none of that going on.

1356
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,996
That makes me sick as well, people saying
priests are paedophiles and kiddie fiddlers.

1357
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,073
There's probably, I mean, there probably are.
I mean, you probably know some,

1358
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,789
but it's no higher percentage of perverts in...

1359
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,634
But they, you know...
They're in all walks of life, aren't they?

1360
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,396
You know, there are nonces everywhere
but let's not exaggerate it is what I'm saying.

1361
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,393
I've never been touched by a priest.
I've been touched by God. Not in that way.

1362
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,029
In the heart but, you know... or...

1363
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,191
Er...

1364
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,840
Oh, condoms. It's just...

1365
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,919
Do we need them? I don't think so.

1366
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,356
Let the free seed of love gush forth.

1367
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,229
Who was your confirmation saint?

1368
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,599
Mine?

1369
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,318
- Saint Bernard.
- Saint Bernard?

1370
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,395
Who was your priest growing up?

1371
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,475
Father.

1372
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,274
Flaa-heer-ty.

1373
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,709
Flah... Father Michael Flatley.

1374
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,711
- Michael Flatley?
- O'Flatley.

1375
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,438
Irish fellow.

1376
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:41,718
- And where was his parish?
- Just the parish of where I grew up my town,

1377
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,189
the holy parish of Wokingham.

1378
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,790
I've done a lot of work in the London
and Thames area...

1379
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,074
Oh, yeah?

1380
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,357
...and I've never heard of
a Father Michael O'Flatley.

1381
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,192
No, he died.

1382
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,198
Dead. Untraceable.

1383
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,468
He won't be replaced. Not by me anyway.

1384
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,437
He was a great man.

1385
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,789
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Go for it.

1386
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,715
And it may seem blunt, but honesty
is a cornerstone of the Catholic faith.

1387
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,233
Amen to that.

1388
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,477
- Are you a Catholic?
- Am I a...?

1389
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,950
- Are you a Catholic?
- Am I a Catholic?

1390
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,591
Well, if you're asking to see
some official documentation,

1391
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,272
you're going to be gutted.

1392
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,670
Have you been confirmed?
Have you ever taken Communion?

1393
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,872
No, actually.

1394
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,790
- Did Father Flatley exist?
- O'Flatley.

1395
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,757
Did he ever exist?

1396
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,589
No.

1397
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,794
Why have you been pretending
to be a Catholic?

1398
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,711
Because it does no harm.

1399
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,319
Does it?

1400
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,910
- We've all had a laugh.
- Was it just to get close to me?

1401
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,077
Well, I do fancy you if that's...

1402
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,678
Even you must think...

1403
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,715
And I thought you might not get off
with someone who wasn't Catholic.

1404
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,677
Sorry, I wouldn't get off with you anyway.
I don't believe in sex before marriage.

1405
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,872
Really?

1406
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,391
In this day and age.

1407
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,197
Bit annoying, to be honest.

1408
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,351
I can't believe you lied to me
just to try and sleep with me.

1409
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,638
I'd already lied
before I tried it on with you so...

1410
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,597
Well, what was the first lie?

1411
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,753
The f...

1412
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,473
I didn't want to upset her.

1413
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,710
Sorry, what do you mean?

1414
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,712
- Sorry, what the what?
- What do you mean?

1415
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,677
Oh. Oh, well.

1416
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,629
She was saying the only thing
that keeps her going

1417
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,191
is the thought that one day she'll be
in heaven and everything will be all right.

1418
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,477
And I didn't want to go,
"No, you're barking up the wrong tree, love.

1419
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,073
"There's no God, there's no heaven.

1420
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,958
"You're not going to be up there
talking normally and running around...

1421
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,918
"Legs and playing volleyball
and everything."

1422
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,911
So, I didn't... I said...

1423
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,155
It's like a white lie, isn't it?

1424
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,832
Look, if it makes you feel uncomfortable,
then you shouldn't do it.

1425
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,038
- But I want to make you happy.
- I'm happy if you're happy.

1426
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,351
It's just a silly little thing, isn't it?
I mean, it's a bit of fun.

1427
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,670
If you're not into it, so be it. That's cool.

1428
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,796
- Really?
- I'm going out with you because of you.

1429
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,677
My God, really?

1430
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,713
- Do you know what?
- What?

1431
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,949
You're cool.

1432
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,359
I like to think so.

1433
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,793
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

1434
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,233
- Good.
- All right.

1435
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,753
- How are you?
- Good.

1436
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,070
- Oh, how was the date?
- The date?

1437
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,473
Erm... oh, good.
Let me just go over some highlights for you.

1438
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,120
Lied to a priest
in front of a room full of Christians.

1439
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,953
Some of them elderly,
some of them just weird and bewildered.

1440
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,190
So insulted them and their belief system.

1441
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,475
Made a woman hate me
for the rest of her life.

1442
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,996
Yeah? Didn't believe in God before.
Definitely going to hell.

1443
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,479
I liked her as well.

1444
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,553
Oh, here, listen, but don't worry.
I know someone who'd be perfect for you.

1445
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,997
She's desperate and she has trouble hanging
on to men 'cause she's clinically depressed.

1446
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,753
- Have you got her number?
- I do. I think it's in my phone.

1447
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,673
I'm being sarcastic because
I don't want to go out with a psychopath.

1448
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,228
- She's quite nice underneath.
- Oh, she just cuts you

1449
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,072
if she forgets to take her lithium.

1450
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,230
Hi. How did it go? With the phone?

1451
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,198
Oh, oh, this is my boyfriend Mike.

1452
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,068
This is Mike, I don't think you've met before.
Mike, this is the actress Kate Winslet.

1453
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,151
- Hi, Mike.
- Hiya, great to meet you.

1454
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,958
- How you doing?
- Do you want a tea?

1455
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,792
No, it's fine.

1456
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,997
So, it's the weekend,
you all got any big plans?

1457
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,277
I tell you what we're going to do,
we're going to have a big spring clean.

1458
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,238
Yeah, my husband's going to be
rummaging around in my basement

1459
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,436
while I polish his Oscar.

1460
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,431
I see what you mean.
No, I'm going to be in the garage probably.

1461
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,435
Just cleaning the car. Giving the old girl's
headlamps a good soaping up.

1462
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,715
Giving them a good seeing to.

1463
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,998
Can I just say, I mean, you probably get this
all the time, but can I just say I'm a big fan.

1464
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,390
- I've seen Titanic, like, five times as well.
- Oh, that's sweet.

1465
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,278
- Have you seen Titanic?
- Yeah, great, brilliant.

1466
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,669
A lot of it was...

1467
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:55,114
It's, erm...
A lot of it is CGI actually, you know that?

1468
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,270
- Half the boat...
- Really?

1469
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,994
- What you doing?
- Just checking that.

1470
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,072
Is it all right?

1471
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,831
Yeah, I think so.

1472
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,317
So you've told them, have you?
About the phone call?

1473
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,868
- No, no, I haven't.
- You've told them about the phone call.

1474
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,758
I can't believe you told other people.
Hey, where you going?

1475
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,875
Just...

1476
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,394
You know everything anyway
so you might as well watch the break-up.

1477
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,836
- What? No, listen...
- Well, how can I trust you now?

1478
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,275
Were you really doing anything?

1479
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,511
When you said you were rubbing it,
were you really rubbing it?

1480
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,397
No.

1481
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,999
I don't know what to do.

1482
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,640
I don't know what to do,
this is such a betrayal.

1483
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,109
- You're just laughing at me behind my back.
- I'm not.

1484
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,031
Then what's all this with her?

1485
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,311
- I was getting advice.
- Off Kate Winslet?

1486
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,156
Are you proud of yourself? Are you?

1487
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,756
You think because
you were in the biggest film ever

1488
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,910
you've got the right to
mock the little people?

1489
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,353
No.

1490
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,908
So that stuff about
your husband polishing his Oscar,

1491
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,639
- was that supposed to mean wanking?
- Yeah.

1492
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,516
And your basement meant?

1493
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,113
My fanny.

1494
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,548
Pathetic.

1495
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,238
Thanks very much.

1496
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,718
I keep seeing her around.
What is up with her?

1497
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,155
She's got cerebral palsy.

1498
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,313
Oh, that's worth remembering, I tell you.
That is another way you win an Oscar.

1499
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,110
Seriously, think about it.
Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot. Oscar.

1500
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,190
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, Oscar.

1501
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,236
John Mills, Ryan's Daughter, Oscar.

1502
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,151
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

1503
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,038
You are guaranteed an Oscar
if you play a mental.

1504
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,308
- See you later.
- Cheers.

(TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN
BY CAT STEVENS)

1506
01:27:37,535 --> 01:27:40,049
What's on your mind? Seriously, talk to me.

1507
01:27:40,935 --> 01:27:43,051
Why am I not getting any acting roles?

1508
01:27:43,815 --> 01:27:45,851
I've been thinking about this.
I'm glad you brought it up.

1509
01:27:45,935 --> 01:27:47,846
I've got a feeling it could be your shape.

1510
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:51,644
It is a very unusual shape and I'm not sure
who would be looking for it.

1511
01:27:51,735 --> 01:27:54,932
- Could you maybe do a bit more exercise?
- Could you maybe do a bit more work?

1512
01:27:55,015 --> 01:27:58,894
- I don't know...
- We can banter all we like but, I mean,

1513
01:27:58,975 --> 01:28:03,014
if you insist on remaining, you know, a blob,

1514
01:28:03,095 --> 01:28:05,848
could you maybe at least get a tan?

1515
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:08,403
They're looking for a fat bloke
with a tan, are they?

1516
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:12,044
What's that for?
Oliver Stone's story of Buddha?

Before I get up and walk out of here,
possibly forever,

1518
01:28:16,295 --> 01:28:20,004
- have you got anything for me at all?
- Loads of stuff.

1519
01:28:20,095 --> 01:28:25,169
Do you fancy panto in Guildford
with Les Dennis?

1520
01:28:25,255 --> 01:28:26,483
No.

1521
01:28:30,015 --> 01:28:31,733
- What, that's it?
- Yeah.

1522
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:35,526
- You said there was loads of stuff.
- I thought you'd go with that one.

1523
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:40,532
What's the role?

1524
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:43,334
It is the part of the Genie in Aladdin.

1525
01:28:43,415 --> 01:28:45,883
They're happy with a fat bloke for that,
are they?

1526
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:48,413
With a tan ideally.

1527
01:29:11,935 --> 01:29:14,529
I promise you,
listen, I've done a panto before.

1528
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:17,766
- Ah! Andy Millman, this is Les Dennis.
- Hi. I know who you are.

1529
01:29:17,855 --> 01:29:19,083
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1530
01:29:19,175 --> 01:29:22,212
- Andy is playing our Genie.
- Oh, no, really?

1531
01:29:22,295 --> 01:29:23,523
Yeah.

1532
01:29:23,615 --> 01:29:25,924
- Could Chris Biggins not do it?
- He was busy.

1533
01:29:26,015 --> 01:29:27,528
- Biggins was busy?
- Yeah.

1534
01:29:27,615 --> 01:29:29,606
That's a nightmare.

1535
01:29:29,695 --> 01:29:31,606
What about John Thomson off Cold Feet?

1536
01:29:31,695 --> 01:29:35,244
Well, he was available but he screwed up
the audition. He was very nervous.

1537
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:36,814
Yeah, he can get nervous. That's a shame.

1538
01:29:36,895 --> 01:29:39,011
Sorry, can I just say,
if you're interested in a famous face,

1539
01:29:39,095 --> 01:29:40,847
I represent Barry from EastEnders.

1540
01:29:40,935 --> 01:29:43,449
Not for this part though, no.
It's too late, isn't it?

1541
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:45,093
This part's taken, innit?

1542
01:29:45,175 --> 01:29:47,325
What about Jono Coleman?
I thought he was up for it.

1543
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:51,567
Yes, but since he did Celebrity Fit Club
he's... Well, he's just not fat enough.

1544
01:29:52,975 --> 01:29:55,330
I've got Barry on the phone now,
if you're interested...

1545
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:57,246
No point, is there? No, the vacancy's filled.

1546
01:29:57,335 --> 01:29:59,724
Remember you took
12 and a half percent, ring any bells?

1547
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:01,567
Sorry, Barry.

1548
01:30:01,655 --> 01:30:03,611
No one on the list was available, then?

1549
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:08,132
No, and in the end we were running out
of time and we just got desperate so...

- LES: Andy.
- Hi.

1553
01:30:40,415 --> 01:30:42,645
- Can I introduce this gorgeous creature?
- Hello.

01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:44,566
- This is Simone.
- Hi.

Show him your ring. Engagement ring.
Cost an arm and a leg.

1556
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:51,694
Didn't want you seeing her and thinking,
"Who's that stunner? I'll make her mine."

1557
01:30:51,775 --> 01:30:54,289
- Hands off, she's taken.
- Silly.

get going, sweetheart. See you later.

- See you later.

01:31:08,015 --> 01:31:09,448
Save it for later.

1562
01:31:14,655 --> 01:31:18,284
Eh? We asked 100 people,
"Which comedian is going to land on his feet

1563
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,411
"and get his end away
with an absolute cracker?"

1564
01:31:20,495 --> 01:31:24,249
You said, "Les Dennis," our survey said,
"Ding, top answer!" Jammy bastard.

1565
01:31:24,335 --> 01:31:26,610
Yeah, well done.

1566
01:31:26,695 --> 01:31:29,812
Still, it's about time I had
a bit of good luck, isn't it?

1567
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:35,050
The stuff that's happened to me,
been in the papers.

1568
01:31:35,135 --> 01:31:37,205
- I don't know.
- You do.

1569
01:31:37,295 --> 01:31:39,570
- Did you watch me on Celebrity Big Brother?
- It was good.

1570
01:31:39,655 --> 01:31:42,931
Might have been entertaining for you,
but I was at my lowest ebb.

1571
01:31:43,015 --> 01:31:45,529
The shit that was flying around
before I went in.

1572
01:31:45,615 --> 01:31:49,369
I remember I was sitting there one day
thinking, "What's the point, eh?

1573
01:31:49,455 --> 01:31:51,446
"What is the point?"

1574
01:31:51,535 --> 01:31:55,813
And... l've never really
told anybody this before.

1575
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:57,453
Okay.

1576
01:31:57,535 --> 01:31:59,412
- I even considered suicide.
- Oh!

1577
01:31:59,495 --> 01:32:01,725
Yeah, actually thinking
I'm going to end it all.

1578
01:32:01,815 --> 01:32:05,046
I'm thinking, "I'll do it here, live on telly.
That will show them."

1579
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:08,969
And as I was thinking about it,
Melinda Messenger came in, lovely girl.

1580
01:32:09,055 --> 01:32:11,853
- She was chatting away.
- Took your mind off it?

1581
01:32:11,935 --> 01:32:15,814
Yeah, I was looking at her tits. Lovely.

1582
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:20,653
And I was thinking, "Come on, Les,
look at them. Life is worth living after all."

1583
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:23,852
I mean, I'd seen them loads of times
in the papers and on the telly,

1584
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:25,687
but when you're face to face with them...

1585
01:32:25,775 --> 01:32:28,687
- Live.
...you go, "Yeah, well done."

1586
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:31,733

1592
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:49,164
I just spotted him
shopping in New Bond Street.

1593
01:32:49,255 --> 01:32:51,564
Doubt he can afford much around there,
can he?

1594
01:32:51,655 --> 01:32:53,327
Well he can because I just saw him

1595
01:32:53,415 --> 01:32:56,213
and he was spending
a fucking shit load of cash, all right?

1596

- All right.

It's the first time he's treaded the boards.

01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:26,283
Things have changed a bit, mind.

1607
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,685
There was a time when I wouldn't have had
to share a dressing room.

1608
01:33:30,615 --> 01:33:33,175
Back in the day I'd have had
two dressing rooms if I'd wanted.

1609
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:36,964
One for me, one for all the cards
and flowers from all the well-wishers.

1610
01:33:37,055 --> 01:33:39,615
Little presents and things they sent me.

1611
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:44,692
Don't need a whole dressing room
for those three, do you?

1612
01:33:47,815 --> 01:33:48,884
No.

1613
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:55,972
What were you doing?
You said you had to...

1614
01:33:56,055 --> 01:33:58,091
- What?
- You were about to do something.

1615
01:33:58,175 --> 01:34:00,894
Yeah, I've got to go to the post office.

1616
01:34:01,895 --> 01:34:05,171
- See you later.
- Yeah, it was really nice to meet you, bye.

1617
01:34:05,255 --> 01:34:07,246
- Yeah, nice to see you, bye.
- Bye.

1618
01:34:12,175 --> 01:34:15,326
One and two, three and four,

1619
01:34:15,415 --> 01:34:18,213
five, six, seven, eight.

1620
01:34:18,295 --> 01:34:21,173
One and two, three and four,

1621
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,644
five, six, seven, eight.

1622
01:34:23,735 --> 01:34:26,329
All right, stop, stop, stop.
You're missing something.

1623
01:34:26,415 --> 01:34:28,883
I'm not getting something.
What is it? What am I not getting?

1624
01:34:28,975 --> 01:34:31,489
- What am I looking for?
- I know.

1625
01:34:32,335 --> 01:34:34,132
Somebody else.

1626
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:35,887
- Yes?
- 110%% .

1627
01:34:35,975 --> 01:34:37,966
You should be giving me a 110%%
all of the time,

1628
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:41,206
but that is not what I was thinking of.
What am I looking for?

1629
01:34:41,295 --> 01:34:42,933
- Okay.
- T and T.

1630
01:34:43,015 --> 01:34:47,770
Correct. T and T. And what is T and T?
Come up here and show them.

1631
01:34:48,335 --> 01:34:52,567
T and T. Tits and teeth, yes. Tits and teeth.

1632
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:55,215
And before any of you have me
up on sexism charges,

1633
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:57,013
do not forget this is my daughter.

1634
01:34:57,095 --> 01:34:59,450
That is all right. One more time...

1635
01:34:59,535 --> 01:35:03,369
- I know that girl.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1636
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:06,253
Hold on, his daughter?
But he's definitely gay.

1637
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:09,170
He can't be gay if he's got a daughter.

1638
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:13,248
- Oscar Wilde was married with two kids.
- Well, he couldn't have been gay.

1639
01:35:13,335 --> 01:35:15,485
- What, Oscar Wilde?
- Yeah.

1640
01:35:15,575 --> 01:35:19,090
- I've got to stop hanging around with you.
- That's lunch, back at 2:00.

1641
01:35:20,455 --> 01:35:22,332
I do know her.

1642
01:35:25,535 --> 01:35:28,174
- Oh, hi.
- Hiya.

1643
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:31,770
Maggie! Do you remember me?
Lizzie Bunton?

1644
01:35:31,855 --> 01:35:34,972
Daddy? We worked on that
BBC kids' show together,

1645
01:35:35,055 --> 01:35:37,410
- The Orphans of Penny Farthing Lane.
- Penny Farthing Lane.

1646
01:35:37,495 --> 01:35:39,008
Brilliant that.

1647
01:35:39,095 --> 01:35:43,407
Daddy, this is my friend Maggie.
We worked on Orphans together.

1648
01:35:43,495 --> 01:35:46,646
Hello, nice to meet you.
Lan Bunton, everyone calls me Bunny.

1649
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:50,330
- Oh, already started your lunch I notice.
- It's a banana.

1650
01:35:50,415 --> 01:35:52,883
# Food glorious food

1651
01:35:52,975 --> 01:35:55,330
# Hot sausage and mustard

1652
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:58,327
# While we're in the mood

1653
01:35:58,415 --> 01:36:00,610
# Cold jelly and custard #

1654
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:03,454
- No, no, no, no. Cust-terd.
- # Custard #

1655
01:36:03,535 --> 01:36:07,005
- No, come on, cust-terd.
- # Custard #

1656
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:09,563
# Cust-terd #
# Custard #

1657
01:36:09,655 --> 01:36:12,533
- Don't worry about it.
- BUNNY: No, come on.

1658
01:36:12,615 --> 01:36:14,970
# Custard #
# Cust-terd #

1659
01:36:15,055 --> 01:36:16,249
# Custard #

1660
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:20,692
There. See, if something's worth doing,
it's worth doing correctly. Must dash.

1661
01:36:21,455 --> 01:36:23,127
I'll catch up with you later, then.

1662
01:36:23,215 --> 01:36:24,443
- Yes.
- Definitely.

1663
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:25,968
Bye-bye.

1664
01:36:26,055 --> 01:36:28,125
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1665
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,887
Give her a kiss.

1666
01:36:29,975 --> 01:36:33,206
- Don't.
- Oh, where have you been hiding her?

1667
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:37,203
Oh, she's really lovely
but she's a wee bit mental.

1668
01:36:37,295 --> 01:36:41,254
- Of course she's mental. Her dad's a gay.
- He can't be gay.

1669
01:36:41,655 --> 01:36:45,091
Ho, ho, ho! Smarties. Yum, yum, yum.

1670
01:37:09,335 --> 01:37:10,370
(DOOR OPENING)

1671
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:12,491
(WHISTLING MERRILY)

1672
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:16,493
- Les, you all right, mate?
- Hiya.

1673
01:37:16,575 --> 01:37:18,611
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1674
01:37:18,695 --> 01:37:21,493
- What have you got in your little bag?
- It's the local paper.

1675
01:37:21,575 --> 01:37:23,327
Don't want to blow my own,
not with my back,

1676
01:37:23,415 --> 01:37:25,849
but there's a little article in here.
Hi, darling. Listen to this.

1677
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:28,324
"Family Fortunes loser Les Dennis

1678
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:31,691
"is on the comeback trail
thanks to a starring role in Aladdin.

1679
01:37:31,775 --> 01:37:33,811
"Things are looking up for Les, 50,

1680
01:37:33,895 --> 01:37:38,127
"who recently announced his engagement
to beautiful fiancée Simone Lewis, 26.

1681
01:37:38,215 --> 01:37:40,445
"With an age gap of a quarter of a century,

1682
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:42,844
"Dennis is clearly punching
above his weight again

1683
01:37:42,935 --> 01:37:45,324
"but insists they are very much in love."

1684
01:37:45,415 --> 01:37:48,088
- Marriage, faithfulness.
- Do you want to get some lunch, darling?

1685
01:37:48,175 --> 01:37:50,814
- I can't, I promised I'd meet a friend.
- A friend.

1686
01:37:50,895 --> 01:37:52,886
- Do you want some money?
- Yes, please.

1687
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:54,203
- Fifty okay?
- Yeah.

1688
01:37:54,295 --> 01:37:55,887
Bit much for lunch, innit?

1689
01:37:55,975 --> 01:37:57,693
- Bye.
- Bye.

1690
01:37:58,535 --> 01:38:01,129
- Alone again.
- Yeah.

1691
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:04,013
- Do you want to get some lunch?
- I can't. I've already eaten.

1692
01:38:04,095 --> 01:38:05,323
Yeah?

1693
01:38:05,415 --> 01:38:08,407
- But I'll come for a coffee with you.
- Yeah.

1694
01:38:08,495 --> 01:38:11,248
Yeah, course I will, course I will.
If that's what you want.

1695
01:38:11,335 --> 01:38:13,326
Yeah. Thanks.

1696
01:38:15,735 --> 01:38:17,851
Come on, then, what shall we have?

1697
01:38:20,695 --> 01:38:22,094
Maggie.

1698
01:38:22,175 --> 01:38:23,654
- Oh, it's you.
- Hello.

1699
01:38:23,735 --> 01:38:26,454
I'm trying to find my way out of here.
It's like a blooming maze.

1700
01:38:26,535 --> 01:38:29,732
- Come in. This is my dressing room.
- Oh, look at it.

1701
01:38:29,815 --> 01:38:31,646
I share this with the other girls in the chorus.

1702
01:38:31,735 --> 01:38:33,566
Yeah? Where are they?

1703
01:38:33,655 --> 01:38:37,648
I think they've all gone to lunch.
Sometimes they forget to invite me.

1704
01:38:38,415 --> 01:38:40,053
Right.

1705
01:38:40,135 --> 01:38:43,093
- What are you doing on Sunday?
- What, this Sunday?

1706
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:44,210
I'll tell you what you're doing.

1707
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,331
- You're coming to my party.
- My sister might be...

1708
01:38:46,415 --> 01:38:51,170
It's going to be my birthday on Sunday
and I'm having a party. I'm going to be 29.

1709
01:38:51,255 --> 01:38:55,009
It's very important and I'm just inviting
my very best friends like you.

1710
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:56,289
Yeah.

1711
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:59,412
It's going to be brilliant.
Oh, my parties are always great.

1712
01:38:59,495 --> 01:39:01,565
- Yeah?
- Please come.

1713
01:39:01,655 --> 01:39:03,725
There will be entertainment there
and everything.

1714
01:39:03,815 --> 01:39:05,567
- Oh, well.
- Please, please.

1715
01:39:05,655 --> 01:39:08,294
- Oh, I'm just thinking...
- You must! You must!

1716
01:39:08,895 --> 01:39:12,092
- Okay, then.
- Brilliant.

1717
01:39:12,175 --> 01:39:14,405
Let me just check with Daddy
that that's okay.

1718
01:39:14,495 --> 01:39:16,884
Yeah, you'd better check with him first.

1719
01:39:18,975 --> 01:39:21,330
- Do not come in!
- Daddy, it's Lizzie.

1720
01:39:21,415 --> 01:39:23,883
I won't be a minute. Do not come in!

1721
01:39:25,135 --> 01:39:27,251
I'm just finishing up a meeting.

1722
01:39:38,415 --> 01:39:42,294
Okay, we've finished.
This is an old friend. Bye, Paul.

1723
01:39:43,415 --> 01:39:45,087
And old friend.

1724
01:39:45,175 --> 01:39:46,369
- Daddy.
- Yes?

1725
01:39:46,455 --> 01:39:49,128
- Can Maggie come to my party, please?
- Of course, dear.

1726
01:39:49,215 --> 01:39:52,252
The little bastard's pinched my watch.

1727
01:39:52,335 --> 01:39:54,246
- He nicked your watch?
- It's fine...

1728
01:39:54,335 --> 01:39:56,644
- Call the police.
- Do not call the police!

1729
01:39:56,735 --> 01:40:00,410
And don't tell your mother, she'll only worry.

1730
01:40:01,055 --> 01:40:04,127
That happened before, didn't it?
With your mobile phone?

1731
01:40:04,215 --> 01:40:06,854
- The crime rate's through the roof.
- Yeah.

1732
01:40:28,175 --> 01:40:29,893
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1733
01:40:29,975 --> 01:40:33,172
Cheer up. Turn that frown upside down.

1734
01:40:33,255 --> 01:40:35,132
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

1735
01:40:35,215 --> 01:40:37,683
- Is everything okay? You look a bit down.
- No, I'm fine.

1736
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:39,447
If you're worried about the audiences,
don't be.

1737
01:40:39,535 --> 01:40:43,084
They're always a bit thin early on but
they'll pick up as we get towards Christmas.

1738
01:40:43,175 --> 01:40:45,973
We've got the press in tonight,
they'll rave about it. It's a good show.

1739
01:40:46,055 --> 01:40:47,886
Oh, it is, yeah.

1740
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,808
- Can I ask your opinion about something?
- Yeah.

1741
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:52,647
- What do you make of Simone?
- She's fine.

1742
01:40:52,735 --> 01:40:54,009
- Beautiful girl.
- Yeah.

1743
01:40:54,095 --> 01:40:56,655
- Lovely girl, I'm very lucky.
- You are, yeah.

1744
01:40:56,735 --> 01:40:59,613
- When is the wedding?
- We're thinking June, July.

1745
01:40:59,695 --> 01:41:03,768
Summer wedding. That'll be good if, when...
Well, it will happen, I suppose.

1746
01:41:04,255 --> 01:41:07,088
- Congratulations again.
- Oh, cheers, mate, cheers.

1747
01:41:10,495 --> 01:41:13,407
- I can't marry her.
- Why? What have you heard?

1748
01:41:13,495 --> 01:41:15,929
- Nothing. What do you mean?
- No, what did you say?

1749
01:41:16,015 --> 01:41:19,690
It's just that I've been doing a bit of thinking
and I just don't think I can marry her.

1750
01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:22,528
It's not fair. I mean, don't get me wrong.

1751
01:41:22,615 --> 01:41:24,333
- Funny little switch.
- Nothing wrong physically.

1752
01:41:24,415 --> 01:41:25,564
I'm sure.

1753
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:28,488
The sex is extraordinary.
Some of the stuff she dreams up.

1754
01:41:28,575 --> 01:41:30,406
What is that for?

1755
01:41:30,495 --> 01:41:33,487
She likes to video us
and we watch it back together.

1756
01:41:33,575 --> 01:41:37,329
And sometimes I can't believe
it's my arse going up and down.

1757
01:41:37,415 --> 01:41:41,693
- I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
- Well, think about something else, then.

1758
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:45,006
It will break her heart
but now I'm back on the up and up.

1759
01:41:45,095 --> 01:41:48,770
The papers is just the beginning. I'll be in
the full glare of the media spotlight again.

1760
01:41:48,855 --> 01:41:50,493
- I can't put her through that.
- No.

1761
01:41:50,575 --> 01:41:51,724
- She's young.
- Yeah.

1762
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:54,045
- She can't take that pressure.
- Probably not.

1763
01:41:54,135 --> 01:41:58,811
Who knows what this will lead to?
More TV, maybe even Hollywood.

1764
01:41:59,335 --> 01:42:03,328
I just think I'm better off letting her go now
before she falls in love with me any deeper.

1765
01:42:03,415 --> 01:42:05,212
I think you're making the right decision

1766
01:42:05,295 --> 01:42:08,332
and I'm so glad you said this
because it's a weight off my mind.

1767
01:42:08,415 --> 01:42:11,771
I saw her getting off with the stagehand
and that's who she's with now.

1768
01:42:11,855 --> 01:42:13,811
Well, I wasn't going to say anything
but you...

1769
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:18,127
Oh, I wish I hadn't, but you were
going to finish it anyway and I...

1770
01:42:23,015 --> 01:42:25,609
You're not upset, are you?

1771
01:42:25,695 --> 01:42:27,447
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1772
01:42:27,535 --> 01:42:29,491
The house is open, gentlemen...

1773
01:42:31,295 --> 01:42:32,569
Sorry.

1774
01:42:33,415 --> 01:42:37,010
- Les, cover it up, mate.
- Yeah.

1775
01:42:40,415 --> 01:42:42,167
I'll shut the door.

1776
01:42:47,095 --> 01:42:51,247
Look, Wishy, what's this?
It looks like the magic lamp.

1777
01:42:51,335 --> 01:42:53,849
- What do you think I should do?
- Just leave it here.

1778
01:42:54,455 --> 01:42:56,411
What do you think, gang?

1779
01:42:56,495 --> 01:42:59,885
Should I just leave it here
or should I give it a rub?

1780
01:43:00,015 --> 01:43:01,528
AUDIENCE: Give it a rub.

1781
01:43:01,615 --> 01:43:04,652
- What? Can't hear you?
- Rub it.

1782
01:43:04,735 --> 01:43:06,646
- Rub it?
- Yes.

1783
01:43:06,735 --> 01:43:10,091
Okay. If you say so, I'll rub it. Here goes.

1784
01:43:16,335 --> 01:43:20,726
- Blimey, what a big puff.
- (CAMP VOICE) Cheeky. Hmm.

1785
01:43:20,815 --> 01:43:22,567
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)

1786
01:43:23,895 --> 01:43:26,853
- Who are you?
- Well, I'll be anyone you want me to be,

1787
01:43:26,935 --> 01:43:29,165
but you can call me Genie.

1788
01:43:31,535 --> 01:43:34,174
How does somebody as big as you
fit into this tiny lamp?

1789
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:37,531
Don't worry about it, I'm used to
squeezing myself into tight holes.

1790
01:43:37,615 --> 01:43:41,244
Oh! No pain, no gain.

1791
01:43:42,255 --> 01:43:46,168
WISHY: Can you help us?
We're in danger, the evil Abanazar is after us.

1792
01:43:46,255 --> 01:43:50,009
- What makes you think that?
- We heard him say he wants to get Aladdin.

1793
01:43:50,095 --> 01:43:52,051
Don't we all?

1794
01:44:04,295 --> 01:44:05,967
Abanazar has a glorious ring.

1795
01:44:07,775 --> 01:44:11,324
I know the line. What's the point though, eh?

1796
01:44:11,895 --> 01:44:14,409
They don't care. Look at them.

1797
01:44:14,535 --> 01:44:18,369
- LES: You lot enjoying yourselves?
- Yeah.

1798
01:44:18,455 --> 01:44:20,491
Yeah, well tell your faces.

1799
01:44:21,415 --> 01:44:24,407
And maybe some of your friends as well,
get them along.

1800
01:44:24,495 --> 01:44:27,134
The empty seats aren't laughing much,
are they?

1801
01:44:27,295 --> 01:44:31,208
- BOY: Get on with it.
- You bloody get on with it. Ignorant.

1802
01:44:33,815 --> 01:44:36,966
How many of you
are thinking of leaving at half-time?

1803
01:44:41,215 --> 01:44:43,126
Even less people here then, won't it?

1804
01:44:43,215 --> 01:44:45,934
Even more embarrassing
for those that have stayed.

1805
01:44:53,055 --> 01:44:56,092
- Where do you want to go from?
- How about 1992?

1806
01:44:58,295 --> 01:45:01,128
No, where do you want to go
from in the script?

1807
01:45:01,215 --> 01:45:04,173
I don't know.
Just do some more of the queer shit.

1808
01:45:04,255 --> 01:45:06,405
Let's just get through it, shall we?

1809
01:45:06,495 --> 01:45:11,285
Oh, I've been in that lamp so long
I'm bent out of all recognition.

1810
01:45:22,935 --> 01:45:24,926
- Hello!
- Hi.

1811
01:45:25,015 --> 01:45:27,813
- Come in. Look at you.
- Thank you.

1812
01:45:28,975 --> 01:45:31,694
Everyone, this is Maggie.

1813
01:45:32,575 --> 01:45:34,293
Hello, Maggie.

1814
01:45:39,215 --> 01:45:40,967
You know Dad.

1815
01:45:41,055 --> 01:45:45,970
That's Maureen and John and Barbara
and Len and that's Nana.

1816
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:52,363
We're just waiting for Frank and Jean.
They said they'd be here by 8:00.

1817
01:45:52,455 --> 01:45:56,243
- What time is it dear?
- About 8:00.

1818
01:45:57,495 --> 01:46:00,407
Irene, fetch the Glade. Nana's let off again.

1819
01:46:00,495 --> 01:46:02,486
Why don't you sit next to Nana?

1820
01:46:09,135 --> 01:46:10,887
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

1821
01:46:17,255 --> 01:46:19,166
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1822
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:22,729
Thanks for doing this tonight
on your only night off.

1823
01:46:22,815 --> 01:46:25,966
- It's not a chore.
- I was scared to be alone tonight.

1824
01:46:26,055 --> 01:46:28,285
Bit worried about
what I might do on my own.

1825
01:46:28,375 --> 01:46:30,252
- Well, you're not alone.
- No.

1826
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,172
We asked 100 people,
"Will Les Dennis ever hang on to a bird?"

1827
01:46:34,255 --> 01:46:35,973
Our survey said...

1828
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:37,249
We asked 100 people,

1829
01:46:37,335 --> 01:46:39,724
"Do you want to go out tonight
and watch Les Dennis in panto?"

1830
01:46:39,815 --> 01:46:41,851
Our survey said...

1831
01:46:41,935 --> 01:46:44,130
Why don't people want to come out
and see Les Dennis?

1832
01:46:44,215 --> 01:46:46,171
- They do.
- Why don't twice as many?

1833
01:46:46,255 --> 01:46:48,894
Well, because you're competing
with a lot these days, aren't you?

1834
01:46:48,975 --> 01:46:52,126
- Internet, DVDs.
- Where did it all go wrong, eh?

1835
01:46:55,055 --> 01:46:57,808
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1836
01:46:57,895 --> 01:47:00,284
- You're a comedian, right?
- Yeah.

1837
01:47:01,335 --> 01:47:04,884
- I haven't seen you make a joke in five years.
- What do you mean?

1838
01:47:04,975 --> 01:47:08,126
When you're on telly and stuff, when
you're on chat shows or in Big Brother.

1839
01:47:08,215 --> 01:47:10,445
You're talking to the chickens
but you're moaning about stuff.

1840
01:47:10,535 --> 01:47:12,127
That's the way they cut it.

1841
01:47:12,215 --> 01:47:16,288
There you go, moaning about stuff.
Make a joke about it. Make a joke.

1842
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:18,366
What was that impression you used to do?

1843
01:47:18,455 --> 01:47:20,252
Lmpressions. I did loads.

1844
01:47:20,335 --> 01:47:22,565
- What was it?
- Mavis Riley, Coronation Street.

1845
01:47:22,655 --> 01:47:24,691
- Do that.
- No, I'm not doing that.

1846
01:47:24,775 --> 01:47:25,969
- Do it.
- No!

1847
01:47:26,055 --> 01:47:28,853
- Go on.
- "I don't really know."

1848
01:47:28,935 --> 01:47:31,813
- That's great.
- Yeah, I know. It is good, yeah.

1849
01:47:31,895 --> 01:47:34,807
You need another one, she hasn't really
been on telly for 15 years, but...

1850
01:47:34,895 --> 01:47:36,886
- Yeah.
- Good.

1851
01:47:36,975 --> 01:47:38,647
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1852
01:47:38,735 --> 01:47:42,648
but I'm famous for more than a Mavis Riley
impression and Family Fortunes.

1853
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:45,925
I am famous for other things, aren't I?

1854
01:47:46,015 --> 01:47:47,334
Er...

1855
01:47:47,415 --> 01:47:50,088
The Les Dennis Laughter Show?
Russ Abbot's Madhouse?

1856
01:47:50,175 --> 01:47:51,574
- Were you in that?
- Yeah.

1857
01:47:51,655 --> 01:47:55,091
- Well then, if you...
- You don't remember. Nobody remembers.

1858
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:57,006
That's why I'm in a shitty little panto

1859
01:47:57,095 --> 01:47:59,370
where the only people laughing
were that bunch of gays.

1860
01:47:59,455 --> 01:48:02,686
- Nothing wrong with gays.
- I know. But they'll laugh at anything.

1861
01:48:02,775 --> 01:48:05,608
No victory making a bunch of gay fellows
laugh. They'll laugh at anything.

1862
01:48:05,695 --> 01:48:07,526
- Look at that Graham Norton.
- He's all right, isn't he?

1863
01:48:07,615 --> 01:48:09,173
Is he? Is this funny, is it?

1864
01:48:09,255 --> 01:48:13,009
"Oh, look at this website
about cocks and fannies!"

1865
01:48:13,095 --> 01:48:15,689
"Oh, Jackie Collins, what lovely tits!"

1866
01:48:15,775 --> 01:48:18,573
"Do you like a cock up your arse? Oh!"
Is that funny?

1867
01:48:18,655 --> 01:48:21,089
It is quite funny when you do it,
but keep it down a little bit.

1868
01:48:21,175 --> 01:48:22,813
- We're in a pub.
- What is that?

1869
01:48:22,895 --> 01:48:25,284
I want to do something more high brow.
Oscar Wilde or something.

1870
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:26,888
Yeah, definitely. He was gay.

1871
01:48:26,975 --> 01:48:29,205
I know, but not in the same way,
he was clever.

1872
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:31,490
Would this have been funny,
him going through customs,

1873
01:48:31,575 --> 01:48:33,884
"I have nothing to declare but my genius."

1874
01:48:33,975 --> 01:48:39,288
"Oh! And this vibrating tongue
for pleasuring fannies! Oh!" Is that funny?

1875
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:41,252
Again, quite funny when you do it,

1876
01:48:41,335 --> 01:48:44,486
but it's Sunday, can you keep
the fannies down to a minimum?

1877
01:48:46,055 --> 01:48:48,125
LIZZIE: Why can't I just stay in this?

1878
01:48:48,215 --> 01:48:51,048
BUNNY: Because that is not the costume
we said you'd wear.

1879
01:48:51,135 --> 01:48:53,888
Olivia Newton John
wouldn't be seen dead in that.

1880
01:48:53,975 --> 01:48:56,648
Look, just do as you're told, will you?

1881
01:49:08,215 --> 01:49:11,252
- I'm changing, I'm changing.
- It's me, it's Maggie.

1882
01:49:13,135 --> 01:49:14,329
Hi.

1883
01:49:14,415 --> 01:49:17,373
Your mum said I had to come up
and have a look at all your awards

1884
01:49:17,455 --> 01:49:19,446
- and cups and...
- Oh. Here they are.

1885
01:49:19,535 --> 01:49:22,208
- Wow, look at that.
- Gymnastics.

1886
01:49:22,695 --> 01:49:25,448
- Second, second, first.
- First, that one.

1887
01:49:26,815 --> 01:49:31,445
Lots of photographs of your dad there,
doing his... Whatever he's doing.

1888
01:49:33,575 --> 01:49:35,645
I don't see any photographs
of you with your friends.

1889
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:39,045
- Have you got any friends your own age?
- Yeah, you. You're my best friend.

1890
01:49:39,135 --> 01:49:41,933
- Apart from me?
- Well, all the friends downstairs.

1891
01:49:42,015 --> 01:49:43,733
They're all friends, they're all old friends.

1892
01:49:43,815 --> 01:49:47,251
They are old friends. It looks like the cast
of Last of the Summer Wine down there.

1893
01:49:47,335 --> 01:49:50,930
Dad said when I'm famous
that I'll have all the friends I'll need.

1894
01:49:51,015 --> 01:49:53,370
He said I'd have too many friends.

1895
01:49:53,455 --> 01:49:55,013
Do you enjoy all this, though?

1896
01:49:55,095 --> 01:49:58,849
I mean, really,
all this dressing up and performing?

1897
01:49:58,935 --> 01:50:00,209
Yeah, I love it.

1898
01:50:00,295 --> 01:50:03,492
But do you, though? Is this what
you want to do or is it what your dad wants?

1899
01:50:03,575 --> 01:50:05,486
Dad knows what's good for me.

1900
01:50:05,575 --> 01:50:08,487
I've been doing this
since I was two, it's in my blood.

1901
01:50:08,575 --> 01:50:11,089
But it wasn't your ambition
when you were two, was it?

1902
01:50:11,215 --> 01:50:14,890
I mean, I think you seem to be missing out
on a whole load of stuff.

1903
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:17,773
Just... I think he's suffocating you a bit.

1904
01:50:18,535 --> 01:50:21,766
You're making me sad and it's my birthday.

1905
01:50:21,855 --> 01:50:22,924
Sorry.

1906
01:50:29,615 --> 01:50:31,287

# Well, you've got to speed it up

1921
01:51:07,015 --> 01:51:09,688

- Sorry, Dad.
- Don't apologise to me.

1930
01:51:41,135 --> 01:51:43,695
Apologise to the audience
who thought that you ruined it.

1931
01:51:43,775 --> 01:51:47,484
That was bad. It was bad
because we did not do enough rehearsal.

1932
01:51:47,575 --> 01:51:50,931
- I was getting ready for my birthday.
- We were all getting ready for your birthday.

1933
01:51:51,015 --> 01:51:53,290
Some of us found time to practise
and some of us didn't

1934
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:56,412
because you were too busy worrying
about a stupid bloody dress.

1935
01:51:56,495 --> 01:51:58,690
And now you have let down your public.

1936
01:51:58,775 --> 01:52:00,891
- What is the golden rule?
- Never let down your public.

1937
01:52:00,975 --> 01:52:02,931
Never let down your public.

1938
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:07,247
Well, you have let them down and you've
let me down and you've let yourself down.

1939
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:11,687
Enjoy the rest of the day. Maybe next time
you'll listen to your silly old daddy.

1940
01:52:11,775 --> 01:52:14,972
- Maggie was right.
- Why? What did Maggie say?

1941
01:52:15,055 --> 01:52:17,285
- This is weird.
- I didn't say weird.

1942
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:20,492
I should have friends my own age
like she said.

You do look like the cast
of Last of the Summer Wine.

1944
01:52:23,295 --> 01:52:27,004
- Great show.
- I want to start living my own life.

1945
01:52:27,095 --> 01:52:31,452
Do you know what I want to do in life?
No, because you've never asked me.

1946
01:52:39,735 --> 01:52:41,771
Well, well, well.

1947
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:45,564
It seems quite a poisonous element
has entered our little home.

1948
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:48,294
- Quite a nasty little piece of work.
- Can I just say...

1949
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:50,843
I think that you should go,
you have done quite enough damage.

1950
01:52:50,935 --> 01:52:54,007
Oh, God, this is daft, this is silly...

1951
01:52:54,095 --> 01:52:57,770
It's his house.
If he wants you to leave, you should leave.

1952
01:53:05,975 --> 01:53:10,127
Bye, Nana. Yeah. Bye, everybody.

1953
01:53:11,255 --> 01:53:15,612
Oh, I just want to say, do you mind
if I take a couple of sandwiches for the train?

1954
01:53:15,695 --> 01:53:18,892
I haven't eaten since 4:00
and I've got no food in the house.

1955
01:53:18,975 --> 01:53:21,125
Didn't think I was going to get
chucked out of the party.

1956
01:53:21,215 --> 01:53:24,252
You should have thought of that
before you fucked up my daughter's life.

1957
01:53:24,335 --> 01:53:26,053
- Good night.
- Okay.

1958
01:53:30,455 --> 01:53:34,334
When the laughter stops,
when the audience departs,

1959
01:53:34,415 --> 01:53:38,533
when the make-up has been removed,
what is left of the clown?

1960
01:53:38,975 --> 01:53:41,284
Nothing but an empty costume.

1961
01:53:43,975 --> 01:53:47,126
I should have listened to that.
Do you know who said that?

1962
01:53:47,215 --> 01:53:49,968
- Jean Paul Sartre?
- Bobby Davro.

1963
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:54,571
Davvers took me aside, he said, "Beware,
Les, you won't always be riding high."

1964
01:53:54,655 --> 01:53:56,805
But I wasn't even listening.

1965
01:53:56,895 --> 01:54:00,888
I was too busy telling him some of the funny
answers we get on Family Fortunes.

1966
01:54:00,975 --> 01:54:04,684
Have I ever told you any of those?
Like I said to this woman,

1967
01:54:04,775 --> 01:54:07,050
"Name something red."
She said, "My cardigan."

1968
01:54:07,135 --> 01:54:11,333
How could that have been up there?
We survey 100 people, how'd they know?

1969
01:54:11,415 --> 01:54:14,293
"Name a domestic pet,"
this fella said, "Leopard."

1970
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:16,047
- That's not domestic, is it?
- No.

1971
01:54:16,135 --> 01:54:17,534
No way.

1972
01:54:19,135 --> 01:54:20,932
What about her?

1973
01:54:21,015 --> 01:54:23,404
No, I'm not interested in birds anymore.

1974
01:54:23,495 --> 01:54:27,170
They just bleed you dry and
then they're off out the door. Bye-bye.

1975
01:54:27,255 --> 01:54:29,291
She's been looking at you all night.

1976
01:54:29,935 --> 01:54:33,530
She's pissed up. She's a pissed up slapper.

1977
01:54:34,215 --> 01:54:37,207
I'm not about to have a one night stand
with a pissed up slapper

1978
01:54:37,295 --> 01:54:40,970
just to make myself feel a bit better.
I've still got some dignity.

Hello?

1982
01:54:56,895 --> 01:55:00,410
Would you rather have a bionic arm
or a bionic leg?

1983
01:55:00,495 --> 01:55:04,773
Good question.
Bionic leg so I could hop to work.

1984
01:55:05,295 --> 01:55:08,651
So would I. I'd have a bionic leg
but it would be for kicking.

1985
01:55:09,735 --> 01:55:13,125
Actually, I tell you what, a bionic arm
would come in useful some nights.

1986
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:16,209
- How do you mean?
- Doesn't matter.

1987

- I'm starving. Have you eaten anything?
- No.

Can I come over and cook you something?

1989
01:55:23,415 --> 01:55:26,054
It's 11:30. And you can't cook.

1990
01:55:26,775 --> 01:55:31,246
- Fair point. Well, see you tomorrow, then.
- Yeah.

they were messing around in his shop,
and they chucked bleach in his eyes

2043

frazzled, useless eyes.

02:01:49,825 --> 02:01:53,022
- Yeah, all right.
- Bit of a break from the old routine.

2078
02:01:55,625 --> 02:01:58,378
Whoa. Where are you going?
You can't come on here, it's actors only.

2079
02:01:58,465 --> 02:02:00,899
- I am an actor.
- No, you're background.

2080
02:02:00,985 --> 02:02:04,455
- Your bus is over there. This is for actors.
- I am an actor.

2081
02:02:04,545 --> 02:02:06,695
No, your voucher is green,
that means you're background.

2082
02:02:06,785 --> 02:02:10,539
Okay. So you're judging my entire career
on the colour of my voucher?

2083
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:13,617
No, I'm sure you've had major roles
in other things.

2084
02:02:13,705 --> 02:02:15,297
- He hasn't.
- Shut up.

2085
02:02:15,385 --> 02:02:17,376
- I can't let you on here. Okay?
- Sure.

2086
02:02:17,465 --> 02:02:20,855
There's no one on, though. Can I just
eat here and go? I'll be five minutes.

2087
02:02:20,945 --> 02:02:22,378
- I can't allow it.
- No?

2088
02:02:22,465 --> 02:02:24,183
You can't come on here.

2089
02:02:24,265 --> 02:02:27,257
You've got a perfectly good bus over there.
This bus is for actual actors.

2090
02:02:27,345 --> 02:02:28,778
Yeah, don't know why I asked!

2091
02:02:28,865 --> 02:02:31,982
Mental! As if I could go on a bus
meant for other people.

2092
02:02:32,065 --> 02:02:34,784
- I don't really know him. Can I come on?
- No.

2093
02:02:35,545 --> 02:02:36,773
Okay.

2094
02:02:38,145 --> 02:02:39,260
Pig.

2095
02:02:56,985 --> 02:02:57,974
Hiya.

2096
02:02:58,065 --> 02:02:59,578
- Got any more jokes?
- I haven't. No.

2097
02:02:59,665 --> 02:03:01,462
- Come on, eh?
- I...

2098
02:03:02,585 --> 02:03:04,337
What's ET short for?

2099
02:03:04,425 --> 02:03:06,734
- Don't know.
- He's only got little legs.

2100
02:03:08,225 --> 02:03:10,022
- My uncle was like you.
- Was he?

2101
02:03:10,105 --> 02:03:14,098
A very funny guy.
Not towards the end, though.

2102
02:03:14,185 --> 02:03:17,018
Not so much to laugh about towards the end.

2103
02:03:17,105 --> 02:03:19,414
Lost both his legs, you see. Thrombosis.

2104
02:03:20,105 --> 02:03:23,654
There was very little to laugh about
when he knew he was stuck downstairs.

2105
02:03:23,745 --> 02:03:28,421
No legs and he could hear his wife upstairs
with another man having it off.

2106
02:03:30,825 --> 02:03:34,340
Despite the morphine,
he could still hear her up there.

2107
02:03:34,425 --> 02:03:35,699
At it.

2108
02:03:36,745 --> 02:03:39,498
They reckon he died of a broken heart
in the end.

2109
02:03:40,905 --> 02:03:44,102
Still, it's a wonderful gift that.

2110
02:03:46,065 --> 02:03:47,464
Laughter.

2111
02:03:48,985 --> 02:03:51,294
Yeah. The gift that keeps on giving.

2112
02:03:51,385 --> 02:03:55,014
I've got to go and slash my wrists.
I'll see you later, all right?

2113
02:03:55,105 --> 02:03:57,414
Hey, what are you doing
on Saturday afternoon?

2114
02:03:57,505 --> 02:03:58,540
Why?

2115
02:03:58,625 --> 02:04:02,618
I thought you could come round my place,
couple of lads, open a couple of cans.

2116
02:04:02,705 --> 02:04:05,936
I got a new DVD. Do you know what it is?

2117
02:04:06,025 --> 02:04:07,458
Vera Drake.

2118
02:04:09,585 --> 02:04:12,975
Tempting. I've got to watch the game.

2119
02:04:13,065 --> 02:04:15,625
It's Chelsea-Man U. So, see you later.

2120
02:04:15,705 --> 02:04:17,821
When are we gonna go for that night out?

2121
02:04:18,945 --> 02:04:21,664
- What?
- I know a lovely little restaurant.

2122
02:04:21,745 --> 02:04:25,499
You said shall we go for an evening out
and I didn't say no.

2123
02:04:25,585 --> 02:04:27,621
- Are you going back on your promise?
- It's not a promise.

2124
02:04:27,705 --> 02:04:30,173
- It was.
- You did me a favour, which I thank you for,

2125
02:04:30,265 --> 02:04:33,735
but I don't think it warrants
a whole evening out, a candlelit meal.

2126
02:04:33,825 --> 02:04:36,737
- What's wrong with going for a meal?
- Nothing. But a bit weird.

2127
02:04:36,825 --> 02:04:39,134
What's weird about a couple of mates
having a meal together?

2128
02:04:39,225 --> 02:04:42,376
- We're not really friends...
- But that's how we'll become friends.

2129
02:04:42,465 --> 02:04:44,899
I go out for meals with people
that are already friends.

2130
02:04:44,985 --> 02:04:48,102
I don't go up to people and go,
"All right, mate. I don't know you from Adam

2131
02:04:48,185 --> 02:04:50,221
"but do you want to go
to Butlins for the weekend?

2132
02:04:50,305 --> 02:04:52,660
"You might be a mental case
but let's find out." It's mad.

2133
02:04:52,745 --> 02:04:54,497
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

2134
02:04:54,585 --> 02:04:56,303
What you...

2135
02:04:56,385 --> 02:04:57,784
Oh!

2136
02:05:04,065 --> 02:05:05,657
- Hi.
- Hello.

2137
02:05:07,185 --> 02:05:09,653
- Hi. It's Maggie.
- Yeah, Dan.

2138
02:05:10,345 --> 02:05:11,778
- Hi again.
- Yeah.

2139
02:05:14,505 --> 02:05:16,894
So how long
have you been in this lark, then?

2140
02:05:16,985 --> 02:05:20,341
I've only been acting for a couple of years.
Done a couple of plays.

2141
02:05:20,425 --> 02:05:22,893
I'd like to do more films
but they're hard to come by.

2142
02:05:22,985 --> 02:05:25,738
- So, I'm just trying to get into TV.
- Sure.

2143
02:05:25,825 --> 02:05:28,862
To be honest, there's not a lot
of black faces needed on television.

2144
02:05:28,945 --> 02:05:30,458
No.

2145
02:05:30,545 --> 02:05:32,661
- Crimewatch.
- What?

2146
02:05:32,745 --> 02:05:36,215
The reconstructions on Crimewatch.
They always need black actors.

2147
02:05:37,705 --> 02:05:41,664
Or white actors.
They need black actors and white actors.

2148
02:05:41,745 --> 02:05:44,543
Depending on who's committed the crime
that day.

2149
02:05:44,625 --> 02:05:47,344
I mean, there's criminals, black criminals.

2150
02:05:47,425 --> 02:05:50,895
Certainly there's white criminals
as well as black criminals.

2151
02:05:51,665 --> 02:05:55,180
Oh, God!
I've just remembered I've got to go...

2152
02:05:56,065 --> 02:05:59,455
Yeah, what was that again? It was the...
It was a bag.

2153
02:05:59,545 --> 02:06:01,661
Yes, I'll see you later.

2154
02:06:06,665 --> 02:06:09,384
Why don't you just tell him
you don't want to be his friend?

2155
02:06:09,465 --> 02:06:11,933
It's too damning.
You can't say that to someone.

2156
02:06:12,025 --> 02:06:15,142
That is saying that you fundamentally
have a problem with their personality.

2157
02:06:15,225 --> 02:06:17,864
- What are you gonna do?
- The only honourable thing I can do.

2158
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:20,095
- What?
- Add him to the long list of people

2159
02:06:20,185 --> 02:06:23,018
that I have to avoid for the rest of my life.

2160
02:06:23,985 --> 02:06:25,737
You can never have that time back.

2161
02:06:25,825 --> 02:06:29,500
I sat through a whole evening of
Comic Relief once because I was...

2162
02:06:29,585 --> 02:06:31,098
Sorry, excuse me.

2163
02:06:31,185 --> 02:06:32,698
- Are you an actress in this film?
- Yeah.

2164
02:06:32,785 --> 02:06:34,423
- You can't come on here.
- Sorry?

2165
02:06:34,505 --> 02:06:38,942
You can't come on here. This bus is for
supporting artists and you're an actress.

2166
02:06:39,025 --> 02:06:41,903
- What are you talking about?
- You've got your own bus there.

2167
02:06:41,985 --> 02:06:43,976
And we've got our own bus.
I'm not allowed on yours,

2168
02:06:44,065 --> 02:06:47,580
you're not allowed on mine,
but you can come on. On you go.

2169
02:06:48,745 --> 02:06:50,576
- No.
- This is pathetic.

2170
02:06:50,665 --> 02:06:53,463
I know. It is pathetic, isn't it?
But you can't come on.

2171
02:06:53,545 --> 02:06:56,264
- Get out the way.
- Look, I don't make the rules here.

2172
02:06:56,345 --> 02:06:58,905
- You're a child.
- Yeah, well, that's as may be.

2173
02:06:59,585 --> 02:07:03,737
We'll stick to our own, you stick to your own
and then we're all happy.

2174
02:07:12,785 --> 02:07:14,457
- He doesn't think you're a racist.
- He does.

2175
02:07:14,545 --> 02:07:17,662
He's just seen me say to a black woman,
"You're not allowed to sit on this bus."

2176
02:07:17,745 --> 02:07:20,179
It's like that whole racism
on a bus incident all over again.

2177
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:23,894
- The Rosa Parks incident?
- It wasn't in a park, it was on a bus.

2178
02:07:24,705 --> 02:07:25,899
Sure.

2179
02:07:25,985 --> 02:07:28,977
He doesn't think you're a racist.
And even if he does, which he doesn't,

2180
02:07:29,065 --> 02:07:31,101
he's wrong because you're not.
Don't worry about it.

2181
02:07:31,185 --> 02:07:36,134
But what if I am and I don't know it?
What if subconsciously, I'm a little bit racist?

2182
02:07:37,825 --> 02:07:41,500
- Well, there is that test I can give you.
- What test?

2183
02:07:41,585 --> 02:07:44,258
The racism test. The one they give you
when you join the council

2184
02:07:44,345 --> 02:07:46,654
- to make sure you're not racist.
- I've never heard of it.

2185
02:07:46,745 --> 02:07:49,464
- Do you want to do it? Just 10 questions.
- Go on, then.

2186
02:07:49,545 --> 02:07:52,696
Right, you've got to answer
just totally honestly, okay?

2187
02:07:54,425 --> 02:07:58,782
Just relax, you've got nothing to
worry about unless you are a racist.

2188
02:07:58,865 --> 02:08:02,699
Question one is who would you
rather see with their shirt off?

2189
02:08:02,785 --> 02:08:04,741
Brad Pitt or Sir Trevor McDonald?

2190
02:08:04,825 --> 02:08:07,020
- Brad Pitt, obviously.
- Obviously.

2191
02:08:08,945 --> 02:08:11,743
- What?
- No, I can't say anything till the end.

2192
02:08:11,825 --> 02:08:14,658
Right, question two.
This is about racial awareness.

2193
02:08:14,745 --> 02:08:17,657
'Cause often you catch out a real racist
because they don't know

2194
02:08:17,745 --> 02:08:20,054
or care about any black issues.

2195
02:08:20,145 --> 02:08:22,454
Who's the Prime Minister of Great Britain?

2196
02:08:22,545 --> 02:08:23,773
- Tony Blair.
- Correct.

2197
02:08:23,865 --> 02:08:26,299
Who is the Prime Minister of Namibia?

2198
02:08:30,785 --> 02:08:32,343
I don't know.

2199
02:08:32,425 --> 02:08:34,541
You knew the white one. Okay, good.

2200
02:08:35,225 --> 02:08:37,580
Oh, dear. Who is the Queen of England?

2201
02:08:37,665 --> 02:08:39,303
- Queen Elizabeth II.
- Correct.

2202
02:08:39,385 --> 02:08:41,455
Who is the President of Djibouti?

2203
02:08:42,545 --> 02:08:45,935
This is ridiculous.
I've never even heard of blooming Djibouti.

2204
02:08:46,025 --> 02:08:48,778
Please do not ridicule
the totally valid African language.

2205
02:08:48,865 --> 02:08:50,583
Right, next question.

2206
02:08:50,665 --> 02:08:53,782
Who would you rather have waiting for you
when you got home tonight?

2207
02:08:53,865 --> 02:08:56,015
Johnny Depp or OJ Simpson?

2208
02:08:57,305 --> 02:09:00,263
- Johnny Depp because of the murder thing.
- Because of the murder thing?

2209
02:09:00,345 --> 02:09:02,461
I think you'll find
that Mr OJ Simpson was acquitted

2210
02:09:02,545 --> 02:09:04,615
but in your eyes 'cause he's black,
he's still guilty.

2211
02:09:04,705 --> 02:09:07,777
- People still think he is guilty.
- Racist people still think he's guilty.

2212
02:09:07,865 --> 02:09:09,981
- I'm not a racist.
- I'm just going by the test.

2213
02:09:10,065 --> 02:09:12,420
I'm trying to get off with a black person.

2214
02:09:12,505 --> 02:09:14,939
Yes, but according to you,
you wouldn't want him waiting for you

2215
02:09:15,025 --> 02:09:16,617
in your house when you got home tonight.

2216
02:09:16,705 --> 02:09:18,855
Only because I would go,
"How did you get in here?"

2217
02:09:18,945 --> 02:09:22,096
Now he's breaking and entering as well.
Fascist.

2218
02:09:22,185 --> 02:09:24,540
Right, I'm going to go and ask him out now.

2219
02:09:24,625 --> 02:09:26,058
- Hold on.
- Watch.

2220
02:09:26,145 --> 02:09:29,182
Tell him you had a hate rating of 9.8,
one more than Hitler.

2221
02:09:29,265 --> 02:09:31,256
Watch, I'm going now.

2222
02:09:34,425 --> 02:09:36,017
He said yes.

2223
02:09:36,105 --> 02:09:39,415
He is so lovely and totally amazing
and I'm going out for a drink with him.

2224
02:09:39,505 --> 02:09:40,699
- When?
- Tonight.

2225
02:09:40,785 --> 02:09:43,504
- Well done.
- I'm a wee bit nervous about this date.

2226
02:09:43,585 --> 02:09:45,303
Racist.

2227
02:09:45,385 --> 02:09:47,421
- Did you get my plate?
- No.

2228
02:09:47,505 --> 02:09:49,018
You left it.

2229
02:09:50,665 --> 02:09:52,223
ANDY: Quick!

2230
02:09:53,345 --> 02:09:58,135
Oh, very cool. It'd be funny
if you were squashed like that, wouldn't it?

2231
02:10:00,465 --> 02:10:03,377
Would you rather die of the cold
or die of the heat?

2232
02:10:03,865 --> 02:10:07,255
Would you rather be trapped in a freezer
or trapped in a microwave?

2233
02:10:07,345 --> 02:10:10,542
- How would you get trapped in a microwave?
- Hiya.

2234
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:11,899
- You going to the station?
- No.

2235
02:10:11,985 --> 02:10:13,543
- Going back into town?
- No.

2236
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:15,855
- Where you going, then?
- We're just...

2237
02:10:16,865 --> 02:10:18,901
We're going in here.

2238
02:10:20,225 --> 02:10:22,136
- Really?
- Yeah.

2239
02:10:22,225 --> 02:10:23,704
- So...
- Why?

2240
02:10:24,585 --> 02:10:26,701
- We're going to visit his mum's grave.
- Yes.

2241
02:10:26,785 --> 02:10:28,343
Taking her some flowers and stuff.

2242
02:10:28,425 --> 02:10:31,223
- You haven't got any flowers.
- Not taking her some flowers.

2243
02:10:31,305 --> 02:10:34,342
Collecting the dead flowers
from all the other visits.

2244
02:10:35,145 --> 02:10:37,454
That's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

2245
02:10:37,545 --> 02:10:41,299
She's buried in the graveyard
next to the studio we're working at.

2246
02:10:41,385 --> 02:10:44,775
- Handy. That's why we're going.
- We'll see you later.

2247
02:10:44,865 --> 02:10:46,821
Do you mind if I come with you?

2248
02:10:46,905 --> 02:10:48,941
Why would I? Come on.

2249
02:10:59,945 --> 02:11:04,257
You don't have to wait around. I'll be about
half an hour and I get quite emotional so...

2250
02:11:04,345 --> 02:11:07,576
That's all right, that's not a worry.
That's not a problem, mate. No.

2251
02:11:07,665 --> 02:11:10,782
I've spent a lot of time by graves.
I'm used to it.

2252
02:11:10,865 --> 02:11:12,856
You take your time. Enjoy.

2253
02:11:14,105 --> 02:11:16,335
Yeah. Which one is it anyway?

2254
02:11:16,425 --> 02:11:17,904
- Which one?
- That one.

2255
02:11:17,985 --> 02:11:20,294
- That one.
- The one with the...

2256
02:11:20,665 --> 02:11:22,018
Yeah.

2257
02:11:22,825 --> 02:11:26,374
- There she is.
- Rebecca Leibovitch.

2258
02:11:26,465 --> 02:11:27,944
Mum.

2259
02:11:28,025 --> 02:11:30,334
Sounds Jewish.
I didn't know you were Jewish.

2260
02:11:30,425 --> 02:11:32,177
Didn't you? Oy!

2261
02:11:32,665 --> 02:11:34,496
Yeah, oy.

2262
02:11:35,825 --> 02:11:38,544
Good God, died in 1953.

2263
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,616
How old does that make you, then?

2264
02:11:42,785 --> 02:11:45,902
- At least 52. 52.
- You're 52?

2265
02:11:45,985 --> 02:11:48,180
- Don't look it one bit.
- No, thanks.

2266
02:11:48,265 --> 02:11:49,903
Hard to believe, isn't it?

2267
02:11:49,985 --> 02:11:54,217
Just like it's hard to believe that we were
just passing my dead mother's grave...

2268
02:11:54,305 --> 02:11:56,614
who is Jewish.

2269
02:11:56,705 --> 02:11:58,980
She was born in 1893.

2270
02:11:59,065 --> 02:12:01,704
So she died when she was 60.

2271
02:12:02,945 --> 02:12:04,503
In childbirth.

2272
02:12:04,585 --> 02:12:08,021
They warned her. They said,
"Becky, you cannot have a kid at your age."

2273
02:12:08,105 --> 02:12:10,539
- But old Ma Leibovitch didn't listen.
- No.

2274
02:12:10,625 --> 02:12:13,344
- And here I am, 52 and Jewish.
- Yeah.

2275
02:12:14,825 --> 02:12:17,100
- Okay.
- Why did you change your surname, then?

2276
02:12:17,185 --> 02:12:20,257
Fed up with the persecution.
The usual story, isn't it?

2277
02:12:20,345 --> 02:12:23,496
Enough is enough, proud race and religion.

2278
02:12:24,345 --> 02:12:25,937
- Is your dad round here?
- No.

2279
02:12:26,025 --> 02:12:27,538
He's still alive.

2280
02:12:27,625 --> 02:12:28,944
- Really?
- Apparently.

2281
02:12:29,025 --> 02:12:31,255
- How old is he, then?
- 100.

2282
02:12:31,345 --> 02:12:33,984
- He's doing well though for 100.
- Yeah.

2283
02:12:35,785 --> 02:12:39,141
Do you like taking the mickey out of me?
This fun for you, is it?

2284
02:12:39,225 --> 02:12:40,578
What?

2285
02:12:40,665 --> 02:12:42,815
That is not your mother's grave.

2286
02:12:44,145 --> 02:12:46,454
- Oh, no!
- And I don't think you're Jewish.

2287
02:12:46,545 --> 02:12:49,457
- No she pointed to that...
- Why do you keep lying to me?

2288
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:51,297
- I don't keep lying to you.
- Yes, you do.

2289
02:12:51,385 --> 02:12:53,774
You said that we were going to go
for a nice meal.

2290
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:57,335
Then you went back on that.
Do you think I haven't got any feelings?

2291
02:12:57,425 --> 02:13:00,701
I know you've got feelings. Which is why
I thought I would avoid the issue.

2292
02:13:00,785 --> 02:13:03,583
I don't want to go for a meal with someone...

2293
02:13:03,665 --> 02:13:06,384
You won't go for a meal with me
because you hate me.

2294
02:13:06,465 --> 02:13:08,103
- I don't hate you.
- You hate me so much

2295
02:13:08,185 --> 02:13:12,258
that you can't bear to sit opposite me, have
a nibble on a bit of food in my company.

2296
02:13:12,345 --> 02:13:15,894
- I could have a meal with you.
- I know, I'm not the joker of the pack.

2297
02:13:15,985 --> 02:13:19,216
- That's nothing to do with it.
- All right, I might not be able to do that.

2298
02:13:19,305 --> 02:13:22,422
I'm reliable.
If I say I'll be somewhere, I'm there.

2299
02:13:22,505 --> 02:13:24,735
I know. I'm quite happy
to have a meal with you.

2300
02:13:24,825 --> 02:13:26,656
You're just saying that now because...

2301
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:28,781
- No, I'd like to have a meal with you.
- When?

2302
02:13:28,865 --> 02:13:30,184
- Any time.
- Tonight?

2303
02:13:30,265 --> 02:13:31,664
- Not tonight.
- See what I mean?

2304
02:13:31,745 --> 02:13:33,178
Okay, tonight.

2305
02:13:33,265 --> 02:13:36,416
Tonight will be fine.
Let's have a meal tonight, okay?

2306
02:13:36,505 --> 02:13:38,257
I'm looking forward to it.

2307
02:13:41,425 --> 02:13:43,700
Aw... poor... Oh, no. Come on.

2308
02:13:48,505 --> 02:13:51,815
Louise, 13. Karen, 10.

2309
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:56,098
Haven't seen either of them in three months.

2310
02:13:57,345 --> 02:14:00,382
Word of advice, never get married.

2311
02:14:02,185 --> 02:14:04,221
And if you do get married,

2312
02:14:04,305 --> 02:14:07,377
don't let your wife
go to the greengrocer's on her own.

2313
02:14:08,225 --> 02:14:09,783
- Right?
- Right.

2314
02:14:10,585 --> 02:14:15,136
She was going out three, four times a week.
Getting fresh fruit and veg.

2315
02:14:16,425 --> 02:14:19,223
I said to her,
"Why don't we do one big shop?"

2316
02:14:20,265 --> 02:14:23,701
No, she wasn't having that.
She was always down there.

2317
02:14:25,585 --> 02:14:27,496
I got suspicious, you know.

2318
02:14:27,585 --> 02:14:31,180
My wife's going out
8:00 at night to buy cauliflower.

2319
02:14:34,985 --> 02:14:37,260
Right, then. What we having?

2320
02:14:39,025 --> 02:14:41,983
- Shall I order us some champagne?
- No, it's not appropriate.

2321
02:14:42,065 --> 02:14:45,853
We'll have a lager. We'll have a lager each,
down it and go home and watch telly.

2322
02:14:45,945 --> 02:14:47,742
In our separate homes.

2323
02:14:49,585 --> 02:14:53,055
- I don't... What are you going to have?
- I don't know.

2324
02:14:54,425 --> 02:14:56,939
Cor, I just can't decide.

2325
02:14:57,065 --> 02:14:59,420
- What a tragic couple we are.
- We're not a couple.

2326
02:14:59,505 --> 02:15:02,861
His wife left him and I'm out shagging,
regular as clockwork.

2327
02:15:11,265 --> 02:15:13,733
(THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS PLAYING)

2328
02:15:23,665 --> 02:15:25,064
(CHATTING)

2329
02:15:30,785 --> 02:15:35,984
There's this stallion of a horse, right,
being brought on to set,

2330
02:15:36,065 --> 02:15:40,456
and whose got to ride it? Me. Okay. All right.

2331
02:15:40,545 --> 02:15:43,901
So, okay, I can't go out like a chump.
So I big up my chest

2332
02:15:43,985 --> 02:15:45,737
and I'm going to ride this horse.

2333
02:15:45,825 --> 02:15:48,737
- I get on the horse...
- Got to go to the toilet.

2334
02:15:49,585 --> 02:15:51,098
Yeah, sure, yeah.

2335
02:15:54,705 --> 02:15:57,094
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

2336
02:15:57,185 --> 02:15:59,653
- No, you've got something. What is it?
- No, it's fine.

2337
02:15:59,745 --> 02:16:01,258
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

2338
02:16:01,345 --> 02:16:03,620
Come on, let me see. What you got?

2339
02:16:07,625 --> 02:16:09,343
It's just a golliwog... toy.

2340
02:16:10,065 --> 02:16:11,657
- A golly toy.
- A what?

2341
02:16:12,465 --> 02:16:13,944
A golly toy.

2342
02:16:14,025 --> 02:16:18,815
Don't worry about that, though.
I mean, I have had Sambo... San... Sinbad

2343
02:16:18,905 --> 02:16:22,341
since I was about six or seven.
He's been in the family for years.

2344
02:16:22,425 --> 02:16:25,417
So, I mean, that's harmless.
I think, if I was a racist,

2345
02:16:25,505 --> 02:16:27,894
I wouldn't be about to do
what we were about to do.

2346
02:16:27,985 --> 02:16:32,422
Not that I know what we were about to do,
but whatever you want to do I'm up for it.

2347
02:16:32,505 --> 02:16:34,780
- Why were you trying to hide it?
- I wasn't hiding it.

2348
02:16:34,865 --> 02:16:38,460
I was putting it there because it puts me off.
Well, it doesn't put me off.

2349
02:16:38,545 --> 02:16:41,696
I was putting them altogether,
all the toys together.

2350
02:16:41,785 --> 02:16:43,855
Because all the toys are equal.

2351
02:16:43,945 --> 02:16:46,334
(PUPPET VOICE) Hello. How are you?

2352
02:16:46,425 --> 02:16:50,418
Hello, there... Hello, there. How are you?

2353
02:16:50,505 --> 02:16:54,498
I'm fine. I'm not a racist.
In fact, I think I fancy you.

2354
02:16:54,585 --> 02:16:56,223
Oh! Oh!

2355

(PUPPETS MOANING)

2356
02:17:09,985 --> 02:17:12,658
- I think I'm going to shoot off.
- No, really?

2357
02:17:12,745 --> 02:17:13,973
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

2358
02:17:14,065 --> 02:17:17,296
No, it's totally cool. I just think
the black thing's getting in the way here.

2359
02:17:17,385 --> 02:17:18,500
No, it's not.

2360
02:17:18,585 --> 02:17:20,701
Don't worry, I don't think
you're a racist or anything.

2361
02:17:20,785 --> 02:17:23,174
I just think that it's on your mind
and you can't get past it.

2362
02:17:23,265 --> 02:17:26,018
So, you know, we should just relax
and rewind things a bit.

2363
02:17:26,105 --> 02:17:29,142
Okay. Look, can I just say something?

2364
02:17:29,225 --> 02:17:32,740
The black thing, it's not an issue.
I hardly notice it, really.

2365
02:17:32,825 --> 02:17:35,897
Maggie, it's fine. It's cool.
Let's do something next week, shall we?

2366
02:17:35,985 --> 02:17:37,703
- We'll go out Friday.
- Yes.

2367
02:17:37,785 --> 02:17:39,423
- Dinner, dancing?
- Definitely.

2368
02:17:39,505 --> 02:17:42,895
I love dancing, me. Are you a good dancer?

2369
02:17:42,985 --> 02:17:46,295
Not that there's any reason
why you should be a good dancer.

2370
02:17:47,225 --> 02:17:50,103
I have to... I'm going to go.
I'll speak to you tomorrow.

2371
02:17:50,185 --> 02:17:53,302
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right, see you.

2372
02:17:53,385 --> 02:17:55,262
- See you. Okay.
- Bye.

2373
02:17:55,345 --> 02:17:57,700
Thanks again for the wine and everything.

- This is delicious. Try that.
- No, what are you doing?

- Jesus, listen to that.
- What?

I can't go through with this.

I'm 43 years old

are out with their wives or their girlfriends.

02:18:56,865 --> 02:19:00,574
because I felt sorry for you.
And don't take this the wrong way,

2392
02:19:00,665 --> 02:19:03,259
I looked at you and I thought,
"What a pathetic loser."

2393
02:19:03,345 --> 02:19:05,859
And I took pity on you and that's why I came.

2394
02:19:05,945 --> 02:19:07,981
I'm worse off than you in many ways.

2395
02:19:08,065 --> 02:19:12,263
I'm lower on the chain than you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

2396
02:19:14,265 --> 02:19:17,541
And I'm not having a go at you
because I know you're a nice bloke.

2397
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:21,538
But, I've got to go, mate,
because I'm actually depressed.

2398
02:19:22,425 --> 02:19:26,418
Wait, I understand.
I know what you're saying.

2399
02:19:27,825 --> 02:19:28,940
Look...

2400
02:19:30,105 --> 02:19:33,814
I got you this as a surprise.
I was going to give it to you later

2401
02:19:33,905 --> 02:19:36,738
- but you may as well have it now.
- What is it?

2402
02:19:38,985 --> 02:19:40,338
That...

2403
02:19:41,785 --> 02:19:46,540
is two tickets for the Ben Elton musical,
We Will Rock You.

2404
02:20:02,585 --> 02:20:04,780
What are you doing?

2405
02:20:16,905 --> 02:20:18,975
Oh! Hm...

2406
02:20:26,745 --> 02:20:28,576
See you later.

2407
02:20:29,305 --> 02:20:30,784
Cheers.

2408
02:20:43,505 --> 02:20:45,655
I've really had it with all this. I am so fed up.

2409
02:20:45,745 --> 02:20:47,542
- It'll be all right.
- What will?

2410
02:20:47,625 --> 02:20:50,776
People always say that.
What'll be all right? When will it be all right?

2411
02:20:50,865 --> 02:20:54,699
- I'm 43. I've got nothing.
- No, listen, things are looking up.

2412
02:20:54,785 --> 02:20:58,061
You've got a line
with Samuel L. Jackson, haven't you?

2413
02:20:58,145 --> 02:21:02,775
- It's a start. Please, don't be like this.
- Oh, it's just...

2414
02:21:02,865 --> 02:21:06,699
It's just after last night, I was...
How was your evening? Any better?

2415
02:21:07,465 --> 02:21:08,944
Word of advice.

2416
02:21:09,025 --> 02:21:11,664
If you get the most amazing,
gorgeous, good looking black guy

2417
02:21:11,745 --> 02:21:15,340
in the world back at your house,
don't leave your golliwog lying around.

2418
02:21:15,425 --> 02:21:17,143
That's remarkable advice, cheers.

2419
02:21:17,225 --> 02:21:19,864
Then he caught me trying to hide it
which made matters worse.

2420
02:21:19,945 --> 02:21:21,697
Why did you try and hide it?

2421
02:21:21,785 --> 02:21:25,903
I didn't want to offend him. And he was right
'cause the black thing was on my mind.

2422
02:21:25,985 --> 02:21:29,375
I didn't know whether to talk about
black things or not talk about black things.

2423
02:21:29,465 --> 02:21:32,138
I ended up talking about
what I thought he wanted to hear.

2424
02:21:32,225 --> 02:21:35,103
Don't pander to him just because he's black.

2425
02:21:35,185 --> 02:21:37,904
- Lf he says, "I like reggae," and you don't...
- Which I don't.

2426
02:21:37,985 --> 02:21:39,782
...then say you don't.

2427
02:21:39,865 --> 02:21:42,857
It's not being racist. It's having an opinion.

2428
02:21:42,945 --> 02:21:47,257
- I'll go and have a wee word with him now.
- Aye, go and have a wee word with him.

2429
02:21:51,105 --> 02:21:52,697
- Hi.
- Hey.

2430
02:21:52,785 --> 02:21:55,094
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yes, of course.

2431
02:21:55,185 --> 02:21:57,619
I just wanted to say that I hate reggae.

2432
02:21:58,345 --> 02:22:00,063
- Sorry?
- I hate reggae, I hate it.

2433
02:22:00,145 --> 02:22:04,696
It's slow, everything sounds the same,
it's boring, I can't be doing with it.

2434
02:22:04,785 --> 02:22:06,184
What do you think?

2435
02:22:06,265 --> 02:22:08,574
- I don't particularly like reggae, either.
- Right.

2436
02:22:08,665 --> 02:22:10,815
Well, even if you did like it,
I would still hate it.

2437
02:22:10,905 --> 02:22:13,373
- What sort of music do you like?
- Well, I like jazz.

2438
02:22:13,465 --> 02:22:15,456
I hate jazz. I hate it.

2439
02:22:15,545 --> 02:22:18,503
In fact, do you know
who I really hate in jazz?

2440
02:22:18,585 --> 02:22:21,782
You know that big fat black man?
Him with the big fat puffed out cheeks

2441
02:22:21,865 --> 02:22:25,221
and his bulging out eyes and everything,
he's like trumpet man.

2442
02:22:25,305 --> 02:22:27,978
- Sasquatch...
- Satchmo. Louis Armstrong.

2443
02:22:29,145 --> 02:22:31,295
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

2444
02:22:31,745 --> 02:22:34,578
- Do you hate all jazz?
- Yeah, that's just my opinion.

2445
02:22:34,665 --> 02:22:37,179
It's not based on anything else
other than the music

2446
02:22:37,265 --> 02:22:40,894
because I hate anybody doing it,
you know, like black or white.

2447
02:22:40,985 --> 02:22:44,295
Sorry, we were just having
a conversation about music.

2448
02:22:44,385 --> 02:22:46,296
Obviously, she doesn't hate jazz.

2449
02:22:46,385 --> 02:22:49,297
Yes, I do, but I like
lots of other things, white or black.

2450
02:22:49,385 --> 02:22:53,424
- I like you, for example. I think you're great.
- Thank you.

2451
02:22:53,505 --> 02:22:58,135
I don't normally watch films more than once,
but I thought The Matrix, I loved it.

2452
02:22:58,225 --> 02:23:00,978
- It was amazing.
- Yes, it's a good film.

2453
02:23:01,065 --> 02:23:04,455
- Good film, that's all she's saying.
- And you were brilliant in it.

2454
02:23:05,665 --> 02:23:07,701
I wasn't in that one.

2455
02:23:07,785 --> 02:23:09,503
- Wasn't in it.
- Yeah, you were.

2456
02:23:09,585 --> 02:23:11,257
- He should know.
- You were in The Matrix.

2457
02:23:11,345 --> 02:23:12,744
- He was the main one.
- No.

2458
02:23:12,825 --> 02:23:16,101
No, I can assure you I was not in The Matrix
but Laurence Fishburne was.

2459
02:23:16,185 --> 02:23:18,745
- That's why you're confused.
- I know what you're thinking.

2460
02:23:18,825 --> 02:23:21,055
She doesn't think you all look alike.

2461
02:23:21,945 --> 02:23:24,698
If that's... what you were thinking.

2462
02:23:24,785 --> 02:23:28,824
No, I'm just saying she doesn't...
She's not racist.

2463
02:23:28,905 --> 02:23:31,021
- No, sir.
- No way, she's not a racist.

2464
02:23:31,105 --> 02:23:34,893
In fact, she's been trying to get a black guy
to shag her for a few weeks so...

2465
02:23:34,985 --> 02:23:36,338
That one.

2466
02:23:36,425 --> 02:23:40,179
Specifically. But, I mean, it's open to all.
Not all, I mean, you... definitely.

2467
02:23:40,265 --> 02:23:42,142
I know you're married

2468
02:23:42,225 --> 02:23:45,615
but, if you wanted to,
you could be up her like a rat up a drainpipe.

2469
02:23:50,825 --> 02:23:52,577
Yeah. Okay.

2470
02:23:57,705 --> 02:23:59,218
Pulp Fiction.

2471
02:24:02,625 --> 02:24:05,662
- Are we ready for the next shot?
- Yeah, are we ready yet?

2472
02:24:06,505 --> 02:24:09,975
Why are they keeping him waiting...?

2473
02:24:13,025 --> 02:24:15,016
- Can I see you about...
- Yeah, we're off. We're off.

2474
02:24:15,105 --> 02:24:18,336
Yeah, but we can't because you've got
the line with Samuel L. Jackson.

2475
02:24:18,425 --> 02:24:21,303
I haven't, that's the point.
I haven't got a line with Samuel L. Jackson

2476
02:24:21,385 --> 02:24:23,615
because the line "Right up a drainpipe".

2477
02:24:24,865 --> 02:24:26,935
Okay, well, cheers, everyone. Thanks.

2478
02:24:27,745 --> 02:24:29,258
That's my hat there.

2479
02:24:29,345 --> 02:24:32,303
ANDY: Yeah, that's it.
Another good day being friends with you.

2480
02:24:32,385 --> 02:24:34,853
(TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN
BY CAT STEVENS)

2481
02:25:13,422 --> 02:25:18,212
To the dread rattling thunder,
have I given fire

2482
02:25:18,302 --> 02:25:22,136
and rifted Jove's stout oak with his own bolt.

2483
02:25:23,662 --> 02:25:27,575
The strong-based promontory
have I made shake.

2484
02:25:28,502 --> 02:25:32,131
And by the spurs
plucked up the pine and cedar.

2485
02:25:34,422 --> 02:25:38,973
Graves at my command
have waked their sleepers.

2486
02:25:40,222 --> 02:25:45,580
Op'd and let 'em forth by my so potent art.

2487
02:25:47,462 --> 02:25:51,091
Here's one. What would you rather be?

2488
02:25:51,982 --> 02:25:53,973
Is now the best time to do this?

2489
02:25:55,142 --> 02:25:57,702
Right. Would you rather be you,

2490
02:25:57,782 --> 02:26:01,934
with your face and your legs
and the brain of a chimpanzee...

2491
02:26:02,022 --> 02:26:03,421
Brilliant.

2492
02:26:03,502 --> 02:26:07,017
...or would you rather be a chimpanzee,
but with your brain?

2493
02:26:07,782 --> 02:26:09,295
I can't answer that.

2494
02:26:09,382 --> 02:26:12,533
It's too inane, even for you.
That's the worst one yet.

2495
02:26:14,902 --> 02:26:17,735
...and deeper than did ever plummet sound.

2496
02:26:18,582 --> 02:26:20,732
I'll drown my book.

2497
02:26:23,142 --> 02:26:24,734
DIRECTOR: And cut!

2498
02:26:24,822 --> 02:26:26,175
Good. Very good.

2499
02:26:26,502 --> 02:26:28,538
DIRECTOR: Patrick, happy?

2500
02:26:29,502 --> 02:26:31,220
Okay, so we're...

2501
02:26:43,862 --> 02:26:44,851
Oh, for...

2502
02:26:45,622 --> 02:26:47,772
- All right?
- Yeah.

2503
02:26:48,622 --> 02:26:52,501
- Now that is acting.
- Yeah, I know what acting is, Greg.

2504
02:26:52,582 --> 02:26:54,857
Well, you know what watching acting is.

2505
02:26:55,102 --> 02:26:58,253
Actually, you can watch me later.
I've got a line.

2506
02:26:59,062 --> 02:27:03,135
"All's lost. To prayer, to prayer, all's lost."

2507
02:27:03,222 --> 02:27:06,020
- That's embarrassing.
- You don't know what it means, do you?

2508
02:27:06,102 --> 02:27:08,172
- Not the way you did it, no.
- But you don't know what it means?

2509
02:27:08,262 --> 02:27:10,617
- I don't care what it means so...
- You've no idea?

2510
02:27:10,702 --> 02:27:13,774
No, because while you were at school
swotting up on Shakespeare,

2511
02:27:13,862 --> 02:27:15,580
I was out living a real life, shagging birds.

2512
02:27:15,662 --> 02:27:17,971
You told me you didn't have sex
till you were 22.

2513
02:27:18,062 --> 02:27:19,893
- Why are you joining in?
- Interesting.

2514
02:27:19,982 --> 02:27:21,176
No, it's not.

2515
02:27:21,262 --> 02:27:23,776
You said your mum
wouldn't let you bring girls home.

2516
02:27:23,862 --> 02:27:25,773
- Why are you still joining in?
- The plot thickens.

2517
02:27:25,862 --> 02:27:28,615
The plot doesn't thicken
because I could have been lying to her.

2518
02:27:28,702 --> 02:27:30,340
- Calm down!
- Lf you were lying,

2519
02:27:30,422 --> 02:27:34,381
why did you say that you lost your virginity
to a woman that looked like Ronnie Corbett?

2520
02:27:34,462 --> 02:27:37,215
And it's good night from me.

2521
02:27:38,342 --> 02:27:41,493
- Rubbish.
- I've got to go. That's great. Good luck.

2522
02:27:41,582 --> 02:27:45,291
I hope you have better luck with the acting
than you clearly have had with the ladies.

2523
02:27:45,382 --> 02:27:46,815
You don't know anything.

2524
02:27:46,902 --> 02:27:48,733
- See you later.
- Bye.

2525
02:27:50,022 --> 02:27:51,580
I'd love to show him.

2526
02:27:51,662 --> 02:27:53,857
Don't worry.
You will get off with another woman.

2527
02:27:53,942 --> 02:27:56,775
I mean my acting career!
I get off with birds all the time.

2528
02:27:56,862 --> 02:27:58,295
Sorry.

2529
02:27:58,382 --> 02:28:00,657
Why did you tell him
about the Ronnie Corbett woman?

2530
02:28:00,742 --> 02:28:01,857
I don't know.

2531
02:28:10,302 --> 02:28:11,735
PATRICK: Enter.

2532
02:28:15,822 --> 02:28:19,337
Oh, hi. I'm probably going to get fired
for even being here.

2533
02:28:19,422 --> 02:28:23,734
I'm an extra in this, but I'm an actor, really.

2534
02:28:23,822 --> 02:28:27,258
And, well, I'm desperate
and as I said, I'm really sorry but...

2535
02:28:27,342 --> 02:28:29,936
Oh, come on, don't apologise. Sit down.

2536
02:28:30,022 --> 02:28:33,253
You're hustling. Acting is a noble
profession but it's a tough one.

2537
02:28:33,342 --> 02:28:35,458
So how are you getting yourself out there?

2538
02:28:35,542 --> 02:28:38,818
Well, I'm just getting my face around
in anything I can,

2539
02:28:38,902 --> 02:28:42,338
but, you know, I suppose I'm networking,
but I've written a script.

2540
02:28:42,502 --> 02:28:45,016
You see, writing, you see, that's the key.

2541
02:28:45,102 --> 02:28:47,855
- I'm writing myself at the moment.
- Right.

2542
02:28:47,942 --> 02:28:51,901
You see, as actors,
the only choice we have is yes or no.

2543
02:28:51,982 --> 02:28:56,214
Whereas if you're writing your own material,
you're creating your own opportunities.

2544
02:28:56,302 --> 02:28:57,940
Well, this is my thinking, yes.

2545
02:28:58,022 --> 02:28:59,899
I'm writing this screenplay

2546
02:28:59,982 --> 02:29:03,816
and I find the whole process
absolutely exhilarating.

2547
02:29:03,902 --> 02:29:06,257
What's yours about,
if you don't mind me asking?

2548
02:29:06,342 --> 02:29:08,014
How best to explain it?

2549
02:29:08,102 --> 02:29:09,774
- You've seen me in X-Men?
- Yes.

2550
02:29:09,862 --> 02:29:12,012
The character I am, Professor Charles Xavier,

2551
02:29:12,102 --> 02:29:16,141
if you remember, he can control things
with the power of his mind.

2552
02:29:16,222 --> 02:29:18,338
- Yes.
- Make people do things and see things.

2553
02:29:18,422 --> 02:29:21,539
So I thought,
"What if you could do that for real?"

2554
02:29:21,622 --> 02:29:24,500
I mean, not in a comic book world
but in the real world.

2555
02:29:24,582 --> 02:29:27,255
- Oh, right.
- So in my film I play a man

2556
02:29:27,342 --> 02:29:31,335
- who controls the world with his mind.
- Right. That's interesting.

2557
02:29:31,422 --> 02:29:35,495
Yes. For instance, I'm walking along
and I see this beautiful girl

2558
02:29:35,582 --> 02:29:38,938
and I think I'd like to see her naked
and so all her clothes fall off.

2559
02:29:39,902 --> 02:29:41,574
All her clothes fall off?

2560
02:29:41,662 --> 02:29:44,654
Hm. Yes, and she's scrabbling around
to get them back on again

2561
02:29:44,742 --> 02:29:48,018
but even before she can get her knickers on,
I've seen everything.

2562
02:29:48,102 --> 02:29:50,058
You know, I've seen it all.

2563
02:29:50,742 --> 02:29:54,018
- Okay. It's a comedy, is it?
- No.

2564
02:29:55,022 --> 02:29:58,412
It's about what would happen
if these things were possible.

2565
02:29:58,582 --> 02:30:01,699
- What's the story, though? What's the...
- Well, I do other stuff.

2566
02:30:01,782 --> 02:30:04,535
Like, I'm riding my bike in the park
and this policewoman says,

2567
02:30:04,622 --> 02:30:07,773
"Oi! You can't ride your bike on the grass,"
and I go, "Oh, no?"

2568
02:30:07,862 --> 02:30:09,580
And her uniform falls off.

2569
02:30:09,662 --> 02:30:12,972
And she goes, "Ah!" and she's trying
to cover up but I've seen everything.

2570
02:30:13,062 --> 02:30:17,101
Anyway, and I get on my bike, I ride off.
On the grass.

2571
02:30:19,022 --> 02:30:23,573
So, it's mainly you sort of going around
seeing ladies' tits.

2572
02:30:23,702 --> 02:30:24,851
Mainly.

2573
02:30:24,942 --> 02:30:27,900
And I do other stuff like,
I go to the World Cup Final

2574
02:30:27,982 --> 02:30:31,372
and it's Germany versus England
and I wish that I were playing.

2575
02:30:31,462 --> 02:30:33,817
And suddenly I am
and I score the winning goal.

2576
02:30:33,902 --> 02:30:37,133
They carry me into the dressing room
and there's Rooney and Beckham

2577
02:30:37,222 --> 02:30:39,782
- and then Posh Spice walks in and...
- Her clothes fall off?

2578
02:30:39,862 --> 02:30:41,090
- Instantly.
- Sure.

2579
02:30:41,182 --> 02:30:43,173
- She doesn't know what's happening.
- No.

2580
02:30:43,262 --> 02:30:45,332
- But I've seen...
- Seen everything.

2581
02:30:45,422 --> 02:30:46,935
Again.

2582
02:30:47,942 --> 02:30:51,935
Good. Is there a narrative at all?
Is there like a story in the film or is it just...

2583
02:30:52,022 --> 02:30:56,493
- Well, I'm a sort of James Bond figure.
- Right.

2584
02:30:56,742 --> 02:31:00,018
And I have to go to Iraq
to rescue these hostages.

2585
02:31:00,102 --> 02:31:03,412
And I get there and I rescue them,
but they're all women.

2586
02:31:03,502 --> 02:31:06,380
And they're naked
because their clothes had rotted off.

2587
02:31:06,462 --> 02:31:10,057
But I get them into the helicopter
and I'm flying the helicopter,

2588
02:31:10,142 --> 02:31:13,452
but I can still sneak a look in the mirror
and I can see everything.

2589
02:31:13,542 --> 02:31:16,136
You know, one of them is bending over,
two of them are kissing.

2590
02:31:16,222 --> 02:31:19,180
- They've turned lesbian?
- Because they'd been in the camp so long.

2591
02:31:19,262 --> 02:31:22,811
It can happen. Well, good luck with that.
I've just written a sitcom,

2592
02:31:22,902 --> 02:31:25,814
but I wonder if you could give it
to anyone you know, you know.

2593
02:31:25,902 --> 02:31:27,301
- Yes.
- In film or TV...

2594
02:31:27,382 --> 02:31:29,213
- Is there any nudity in it?
- Any...

2595
02:31:29,302 --> 02:31:31,099
- Any nudity in it?
- Not really.

2596
02:31:31,182 --> 02:31:33,412
- Oh.
- Well, there could be.

2597
02:31:33,502 --> 02:31:34,855
Men or women?

2598
02:31:35,302 --> 02:31:37,020
- Either.
- Oh.

2599
02:31:37,102 --> 02:31:38,854
Well, just women.

2600
02:31:39,782 --> 02:31:41,977
- Right.
- I'd need to rewrite, but...

2601
02:31:42,062 --> 02:31:45,657
in the meantime, if you could give it
to anyone in TV or film or...

2602
02:31:45,742 --> 02:31:48,210
Yes, definitely. I will make it so.

2603
02:31:51,302 --> 02:31:53,611
You've seen Star Trek: The Next Generation?

2604
02:31:53,702 --> 02:31:57,092
- I haven't, no.
- Your wife won't let you have it on?

2605
02:31:57,622 --> 02:32:00,773
- I'm not married.
- Oh. Your girlfriend, then?

2606
02:32:00,862 --> 02:32:03,251
I have no girlfriend. I live alone.

2607
02:32:03,342 --> 02:32:07,096
You're not married, you haven't got
a girlfriend and you don't watch Star Trek?

2608
02:32:08,182 --> 02:32:09,740
No.

2609
02:32:11,142 --> 02:32:12,621
Good Lord.

2610
02:32:13,502 --> 02:32:16,733
You're probably wondering why
I called you in for an unscheduled meeting.

2611
02:32:16,822 --> 02:32:20,576
- Got the wrong day?
- No, not at all, no. These are exciting times.

2612
02:32:20,662 --> 02:32:21,981
I know you've been busy.

2613
02:32:22,062 --> 02:32:25,418
I've been busy as well generating
a lot of heat about your sitcom script.

2614
02:32:25,502 --> 02:32:26,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

2615
02:32:26,822 --> 02:32:30,019
Took the liberty of sending the script to
a production company, Picard Productions.

2616
02:32:30,102 --> 02:32:34,459
They sent it to the BBC comedy department,
who got in touch, and there's a lot of buzz.

2617
02:32:34,542 --> 02:32:36,134
What, the BBC have called you?

2618
02:32:36,222 --> 02:32:37,940
Yeah. They just say, "We love the script.

2619
02:32:38,022 --> 02:32:41,332
"We'd like to get you in and
have a meeting, a chat and brainstorm."

2620
02:32:41,422 --> 02:32:44,334
- Brilliant. Who's the production company?
- You wouldn't have heard of them.

2621
02:32:44,422 --> 02:32:48,301
A little company called Picard Productions
set up by Patrick Stewart. I sent it to them...

2622
02:32:48,382 --> 02:32:51,101
- You sent it to Patrick Stewart?
- "This is dynamite stuff..."

2623
02:32:51,182 --> 02:32:52,774
- Recently?
- About two months ago.

2624
02:32:52,862 --> 02:32:55,820
No, you didn't. I gave it to him on set.

2625
02:33:05,782 --> 02:33:08,421
Even if I haven't done anything
towards this...

2626
02:33:08,502 --> 02:33:11,653
please can I still have
my twelve-and-a-half percent?

2627
02:33:11,742 --> 02:33:13,255
Please.

2628
02:33:15,702 --> 02:33:18,262
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah? Thank you.

2629
02:33:19,062 --> 02:33:21,178
I mean, that's sort of the way it's done so...

2630
02:33:21,262 --> 02:33:23,651
Have you thought about
who could play the main character?

2631
02:33:23,742 --> 02:33:25,698
- I'm playing the main character.
- Really? Are you sure?

2632
02:33:25,782 --> 02:33:29,491
You're a bit of a nobody. I'm not sure
they'd cast a nobody in the main role.

2633
02:33:29,582 --> 02:33:31,300
Well, we'd insist.

2634
02:33:31,382 --> 02:33:33,942
I think the obvious choice
is right under your nose. Barry.

2635
02:33:34,022 --> 02:33:36,582
Yeah. No offence, Shaun.
I'm playing the lead character.

2636
02:33:36,662 --> 02:33:38,459
Are you sure 'cause he's really versatile?

2637
02:33:38,542 --> 02:33:40,772
- I'm sure he is.
- I'm not sure what it is you can do.

2638
02:33:40,862 --> 02:33:43,740
Barry can do all sorts. Do your serious.

2639
02:33:43,822 --> 02:33:46,780
You do love me, Janine, you do.
I know you do.

2640
02:33:46,862 --> 02:33:49,899
- Yeah. Do your comical.
- Pat, you've trodden on my foot! Get off!

2641
02:33:49,982 --> 02:33:52,018
- He's a singer as well.
- # Mustang Sally #

2642
02:33:52,102 --> 02:33:55,139
- Loud, isn't it?
- He did a gig once without a microphone.

2643
02:33:55,222 --> 02:33:56,655
There wasn't a microphone there.

2644
02:33:56,742 --> 02:33:58,937
He turned up for this gig,
there was no PA system, nothing.

2645
02:33:59,022 --> 02:34:00,819
- Tell him.
- They were going to cancel the gig.

2646
02:34:00,902 --> 02:34:03,018
I said, "You're having a laugh!
I don't need a microphone.

2647
02:34:03,102 --> 02:34:05,297
- "Microphones are for wimps."
- He said microphones are for wimps.

2648
02:34:05,382 --> 02:34:08,499
I belted it out, just like that,
in front of what, 140-odd people.

2649
02:34:08,582 --> 02:34:11,016
And they were really spread out
because it was a thousand-seater venue.

2650
02:34:11,102 --> 02:34:13,536
Lot of empty seats, didn't faze him,
just went for it. Go on, do it.

2651
02:34:13,622 --> 02:34:16,420
# All you want to do is ride around Sally #

2652
02:34:16,502 --> 02:34:19,255
- Sing it with me now!
- # Ride, Sally, ride #

2653
02:34:19,342 --> 02:34:21,617
- What are you doing?
- Just having a little sing-song.

2654
02:34:21,702 --> 02:34:24,580
I'm doing the lead in this, okay?
I'm playing the lead character.

2655
02:34:24,662 --> 02:34:26,539
That's it, I don't want to discuss it.

2656
02:34:26,622 --> 02:34:28,021
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

2657
02:34:28,102 --> 02:34:30,980
I don't know...
You've never struck me as a funny bloke.

2658
02:34:31,062 --> 02:34:32,415
Sorry?

2659
02:34:32,502 --> 02:34:35,221
You always come in here
and you're really negative and a bit...

2660
02:34:35,302 --> 02:34:36,815
Doesn't that tell you something?

2661
02:34:36,902 --> 02:34:39,370
I know what you're saying but
I don't get Barry any work and he's happy.

2662
02:34:39,462 --> 02:34:41,418
- Not entirely happy.
- Calm down, mate.

2663
02:34:41,502 --> 02:34:44,892
Giving it all this in front of a client. If you've
got an issue, have a meeting with me.

2664
02:34:44,982 --> 02:34:48,179
You've been hanging around with him
too much, giving it this.

2665
02:34:56,222 --> 02:34:58,782
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

2666
02:34:58,862 --> 02:35:02,298
- Lain Morris, Head of New Comedy.
- I'm Andy. This is my agent.

2667
02:35:02,742 --> 02:35:05,302
- Darren Lamb. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you. Good.

2668
02:35:05,382 --> 02:35:07,418
- Okay, well, take a seat.
- Thank you.

2669
02:35:12,782 --> 02:35:15,615
Okay, we're just waiting for one more person.

2670
02:35:15,702 --> 02:35:18,739
I want you to meet Damon Beesley.
He's a producer here,

2671
02:35:18,822 --> 02:35:22,019
but he's also a great writer
and he's a script editor and I'd like to...

2672
02:35:22,102 --> 02:35:24,093
(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)

2673
02:35:25,102 --> 02:35:29,732
Room for a small one? Cheeky,
you started without me. Not for the first time.

2674
02:35:29,822 --> 02:35:32,131
What's he been saying? It's all lies.

2675
02:35:32,222 --> 02:35:34,258
Lucky for you, I haven't said anything at all.

2676
02:35:34,342 --> 02:35:35,821
- Andy, this is Damon.
- Hi.

2677
02:35:35,902 --> 02:35:39,690
Oh, bloody hell, we're not worthy,
we're not worthy.

2678
02:35:39,782 --> 02:35:42,250
Je t'aime your script. I wet myself laughing.

2679
02:35:42,342 --> 02:35:45,175
At last, some real talent at the BBC.

2680
02:35:45,262 --> 02:35:47,139
- Cheers.
- He's happy.

2681
02:35:47,222 --> 02:35:48,496
Where are we?

2682
02:35:48,582 --> 02:35:51,380
I just wanted to find out
where you see this project going.

2683
02:35:51,462 --> 02:35:53,054
- BBC 1.
- No, I don't actually.

2684
02:35:53,142 --> 02:35:54,860
- BBC 3?
- No, BBC 2.

2685
02:35:54,942 --> 02:35:57,410
I think that's just really good for comedy.

2686
02:35:57,502 --> 02:36:00,016
I think if you come up
with a new project on BBC 1,

2687
02:36:00,102 --> 02:36:02,536
you've got to really water it down,
you know?

2688
02:36:02,622 --> 02:36:04,897
- I don't want a laughter track.
- No laughs.

2689
02:36:04,982 --> 02:36:07,177
- There'll be laughs.
- There'll be big laughs.

2690
02:36:07,262 --> 02:36:09,822
But I just want it to be...

2691
02:36:09,902 --> 02:36:12,780
I don't want it to be a comedy
aimed at people without a sense of humour.

2692
02:36:12,862 --> 02:36:14,978
I want people to be able to think about it.

2693
02:36:15,062 --> 02:36:17,656
I don't want it filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

2694
02:36:17,742 --> 02:36:20,734
Unless you guys disagree with that,
in which case we can change all that.

2695
02:36:20,822 --> 02:36:22,653
- Just do whatever you want to do.
- No.

2696
02:36:22,742 --> 02:36:24,698
No, there's no need to do that.

2697
02:36:24,782 --> 02:36:27,933
What I would say, though,
is because this is your first project,

2698
02:36:28,022 --> 02:36:30,536
I would like you to initially write
with someone else.

2699
02:36:30,622 --> 02:36:32,260
- He will write with anyone.
- I won't.

2700
02:36:32,342 --> 02:36:35,254
He will not write with anyone,
that's a deal breaker.

2701
02:36:35,342 --> 02:36:37,378
No. I'd like to write it myself

2702
02:36:37,462 --> 02:36:40,932
just because it's based on
my own experiences, really.

2703
02:36:41,022 --> 02:36:43,900
The character is based on a boss
I used to work for.

2704
02:36:43,982 --> 02:36:46,701
And I just generally think
the best things are auteured.

2705
02:36:48,102 --> 02:36:49,535
Turd?

2706
02:36:51,662 --> 02:36:52,777
No?

2707
02:36:55,222 --> 02:36:57,782
All right, I'm happy for you
to write it yourself

2708
02:36:57,862 --> 02:37:00,979
but I would feel happier getting Damon
just to work with you as script editor.

2709
02:37:01,062 --> 02:37:04,850
Someone to bounce ideas off, just tidy up
the first script. I think it's a bit flabby.

2710
02:37:04,942 --> 02:37:07,820
Yeah, it's just a bag of ideas at the moment,
but yeah, fine.

2711
02:37:07,902 --> 02:37:12,578
I think the best thing to move this forward
is to get you two together in a little room.

2712
02:37:12,662 --> 02:37:14,653
- Oh!
- Shh!

2713
02:37:16,462 --> 02:37:18,578
Inappropriate at a meeting at the BBC, that.

2714
02:37:18,662 --> 02:37:20,971
- Okay, that would be great.
- Okay.

2715
02:37:21,062 --> 02:37:24,816
Okay, let's talk cash because,
as you know, this script is piping hot.

2716
02:37:24,902 --> 02:37:27,700
- So we're looking for big bucks.
- We don't need to talk cash now.

2717
02:37:27,782 --> 02:37:29,613
We need to talk a little bit about cash.

2718
02:37:29,702 --> 02:37:33,331
Just get some money up front for,
you know, supplies, pencils.

2719
02:37:33,422 --> 02:37:36,300
- I could probably find you a computer.
- You happy with a computer?

2720
02:37:36,382 --> 02:37:38,657
- Yes.
- He's happy with that. We'll go with that.

2721
02:37:38,742 --> 02:37:39,936
Okay, good.

2722
02:37:40,022 --> 02:37:41,501
- You sure you're happy?
- Yes.

2723
02:37:41,582 --> 02:37:43,095
- Thanks.
- Great.

2724
02:37:43,182 --> 02:37:45,457
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.

2725
02:37:54,182 --> 02:37:57,015
# Celebrate good times, come on #

2726
02:37:57,102 --> 02:37:59,696
Did you get it? Oh, brilliant.

2727
02:37:59,782 --> 02:38:01,454
- Oh, well done!
- Oh, yes.

2728
02:38:01,542 --> 02:38:02,816
Someone's celebrating.

2729
02:38:02,902 --> 02:38:05,860
What, a wealthy old relative
popped her clogs, has she?

2730
02:38:05,942 --> 02:38:07,660
No. So why am I celebrating?

2731
02:38:07,742 --> 02:38:10,779
Could be because of the TV show
the BBC have just given me.

2732
02:38:10,862 --> 02:38:13,660
- TV show?
- Yeah, pilot for a sitcom. So...

2733
02:38:13,742 --> 02:38:16,097
- What sitcom?
- The sitcom I wrote.

2734
02:38:16,182 --> 02:38:19,094
- You're not funny.
- Well, the BBC beg to differ.

2735
02:38:19,182 --> 02:38:22,891
- What's it about?
- It's about my old boss I used to work for.

2736
02:38:22,982 --> 02:38:24,256
Write about what you know.

2737
02:38:24,342 --> 02:38:29,291
I'd just like to say I've got something for you,
just to say thanks for all the great times.

2738
02:38:29,382 --> 02:38:32,419
Just a few crumbs from the table.
Share the wealth.

2739
02:38:32,502 --> 02:38:35,141
I am devastated, really,
to be leaving you lot behind.

2740
02:38:35,222 --> 02:38:37,452
We've had such great...
Especially you, Julie.

2741
02:38:37,542 --> 02:38:39,931
- Lucy.
- Whatever. Shouldn't you be in costume?

2742
02:38:40,022 --> 02:38:41,899
- I am in costume.
- Yeah?

2743
02:38:41,982 --> 02:38:44,815
Why did we never...
And you, will you please call me?

2744
02:38:44,942 --> 02:38:48,332
- I haven't got your number.
- Yeah, 079... (MUMBLING)

2745
02:38:48,422 --> 02:38:50,856
- 07 what?
- Listen up. 0793334...

2746
02:38:50,942 --> 02:38:54,617
All the threes, put them all in otherwise
it doesn't work. And in a particular order.

2747
02:38:54,702 --> 02:38:56,135
- Get it off Julie...
- Lucy.

2748
02:38:56,222 --> 02:38:57,621
- Whatever.
- I haven't got your number.

2749
02:38:57,702 --> 02:38:59,420
- I'll text it to you.
- You haven't got my number.

2750
02:38:59,502 --> 02:39:02,096
I know, but I'll work it out.
Then we'll all have it, won't we?

2751
02:39:02,182 --> 02:39:05,891
Then we can arrange the camping trip
we've always talked about.

2752
02:39:05,982 --> 02:39:08,177
- Anyway, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

2753
02:39:08,262 --> 02:39:09,934
See you later, man.

2754
02:39:10,022 --> 02:39:13,856
You all right? You look a bit pale.
Could you get some rouge for Greg?

2755
02:39:13,942 --> 02:39:16,172
- I'm fine.
- You all right? You look a bit sick.

2756
02:39:31,022 --> 02:39:32,614
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

2757
02:39:45,662 --> 02:39:48,699
I think structurally,
we're all higgledy-piggledy-pew

2758
02:39:48,782 --> 02:39:52,616
and I think we can get to the boss coming in
quicker and set him up straight away.

2759
02:39:52,702 --> 02:39:56,377
Well, we could start with him actually
walking in to work, in the first scene.

2760
02:39:56,622 --> 02:39:58,817
He just actually comes in
and that's when you see him.

2761
02:39:58,902 --> 02:40:02,577
The real Ray used to come in to work
every day without fail.

2762
02:40:02,662 --> 02:40:04,618
He'd just walk up to someone
and say something like,

2763
02:40:04,702 --> 02:40:07,011
"Have you done those invoices?"
And they'd go, "No."

2764
02:40:07,102 --> 02:40:10,492
And he'd go, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

2765
02:40:10,582 --> 02:40:12,652
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

2766
02:40:12,742 --> 02:40:16,451
Brilliant. We're having that.
That's super, that's funny. Do it again.

2767
02:40:16,542 --> 02:40:18,931
That's what he used to do,
just go up to someone

2768
02:40:19,022 --> 02:40:22,935
and go every time, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

2769
02:40:23,622 --> 02:40:25,658
That's great. That will be a catchphrase.

2770
02:40:25,742 --> 02:40:28,176
- I'm not sure about catchphrases.
- No, it'll be great.

2771
02:40:28,262 --> 02:40:31,413
People can say it. "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

2772
02:40:31,502 --> 02:40:34,380
- I just think catchphrases are too easy.
- Are you having a laugh?

2773
02:40:34,462 --> 02:40:36,453
I think it could get a little bit
annoying after a while.

2774
02:40:36,542 --> 02:40:39,739
Do you fancy a coffee?
I haven't had one in about 20 minutes.

2775
02:40:39,822 --> 02:40:42,461
Shall I get one from upstairs
or do you fancy one from Costa's?

2776
02:40:42,542 --> 02:40:45,215
- It might take me a bit longer.
- That one, then.

2777
02:40:45,302 --> 02:40:47,770
Are you having a laugh?

2778
02:40:47,862 --> 02:40:51,537
- Oh, hello. Can we help?
- Hi. It's my friend Maggie. Come in.

2779
02:40:51,622 --> 02:40:53,977
- This is Damon.
- Oh, you cow, I love your bag.

2780
02:40:54,062 --> 02:40:55,211
Oh, thank you.

2781
02:40:55,302 --> 02:40:57,338
I'm just off on a cappuccino run,
do you want one?

2782
02:40:57,422 --> 02:40:59,731
No, it's fine. I'm just here for a wee minute.

2783
02:40:59,822 --> 02:41:02,814
Okay, well, lovely to meet you.
See you again, hopefully.

2784
02:41:02,902 --> 02:41:04,381
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

2785
02:41:04,462 --> 02:41:06,737
DAMON: Oi, Bowker, you poofter!

2786
02:41:06,822 --> 02:41:09,416
- Welcome to our world.
- Look at you.

2787
02:41:09,502 --> 02:41:12,255
- Take a seat. Take a letter.
- I will.

2788
02:41:12,342 --> 02:41:14,014
(MAGGIE GIGGLES EXCITEDLY)

2789
02:41:14,102 --> 02:41:16,980
- Are you well?
- Yeah, well, you know. Got my health.

2790
02:41:17,102 --> 02:41:19,662
- But listen, how's it going here?
- He's doing my head in.

2791
02:41:19,742 --> 02:41:21,141
- Who?
- Who?

2792
02:41:21,222 --> 02:41:24,498
Who? Who do you...
The owner of this monstrosity.

2793
02:41:24,782 --> 02:41:28,934
Quentin Crisp who just skipped down
the corridor going, "I want a cappuccino."

2794
02:41:29,022 --> 02:41:31,661
Oh, he's too gay, he's too gay.

2795
02:41:31,742 --> 02:41:35,132
- What do you mean?
- No one needs to be that gay.

2796
02:41:35,222 --> 02:41:37,816
- What do you mean he's too gay?
- He's a cliché of a gay.

2797
02:41:37,902 --> 02:41:42,373
If I was doing Give us A Clue and
the clue came up "A gay bloke", I'd do him.

2798
02:41:42,462 --> 02:41:46,057
- Unbelievable.
- Well, that's just a wee bit homophobic.

2799
02:41:46,142 --> 02:41:49,976
It's not homophobic.
No, I don't care how much arse sex he has.

2800
02:41:50,062 --> 02:41:52,337
But why does he have to be that camp?

2801
02:41:52,422 --> 02:41:54,652
Screaming and clapping.
When does that happen?

2802
02:41:54,742 --> 02:41:58,018
When do you suddenly think,
"Well, I prefer a nice little saveloy

2803
02:41:58,102 --> 02:42:01,572
"to a battered cod
so I'd better walk like this."

2804
02:42:01,662 --> 02:42:03,937
- I liked him.
- Of course you do.

2805
02:42:04,022 --> 02:42:07,571
- Women like you love the gays.
- What do you mean, women like me?

2806
02:42:07,662 --> 02:42:09,857
Wrong side of 30, six out of ten for looks.

2807
02:42:09,942 --> 02:42:12,410
You've got someone to go to the disco with,
haven't you?

2808
02:42:12,502 --> 02:42:15,414
And you walk in with him and you go,
"No, I'm not sharking, I've got a bloke."

2809
02:42:15,502 --> 02:42:19,415
But if a bloke comes up that you fancy,
you go, "Oh, him? He's just my gay friend."

2810
02:42:19,502 --> 02:42:21,891
- Perfect. It's a safety net.
- Six out of ten.

2811
02:42:21,982 --> 02:42:25,179
- Yeah.
- Is that all I get? Six out of ten?

2812
02:42:25,262 --> 02:42:28,220
- I don't know...
- Look me in the eye and say six out of ten.

2813
02:42:28,302 --> 02:42:30,452
Shall I look you in your wonky eye
or your good eye?

2814
02:42:30,542 --> 02:42:33,614
I have got one eye a wee bit higher up
than the other one.

2815
02:42:36,942 --> 02:42:38,261
- See you.
- Bye.

2816
02:42:38,342 --> 02:42:41,175
I was going to ask you,
how are you getting on with Andy?

2817
02:42:41,262 --> 02:42:44,538
He's lovely, isn't he?
He's very talented. Very funny script.

2818
02:42:44,622 --> 02:42:46,772
You've not run into
any of his funny little ways?

2819
02:42:46,862 --> 02:42:49,740
- No.
- Well, he can be quite odd sometimes.

2820
02:42:49,822 --> 02:42:52,495
I just wanted to let you know
that he is like that with everybody.

2821
02:42:52,582 --> 02:42:55,938
- How do you mean?
- Well, like noise.

2822
02:42:56,022 --> 02:42:57,933
He's got this thing about noise.

2823
02:42:58,022 --> 02:43:00,172
Like, I've seen him at a restaurant,
somebody at the table nearby

2824
02:43:00,262 --> 02:43:03,413
is cutting their meat too loudly and
he's getting himself all annoyed about it.

2825
02:43:03,502 --> 02:43:06,335
Oh, note to self. Cut meat quietly.

2826
02:43:06,422 --> 02:43:10,051
Yes. And you might find you might want
to just tone it down a little bit.

2827
02:43:11,222 --> 02:43:14,294
- Tone what down?
- Well, you're quite camp, which is great,

2828
02:43:14,382 --> 02:43:17,340
but I think maybe sometimes
he thinks you're too gay.

2829
02:43:18,182 --> 02:43:19,695
Did he say that?

2830
02:43:19,782 --> 02:43:22,615
Yeah, but I mean, he wasn't being nasty
about it. I just think...

2831
02:43:22,702 --> 02:43:25,500
Oh, no. I've said the wrong thing.
I shouldn't have, should I?

2832
02:43:25,582 --> 02:43:27,777
No, no, I'm fine. I'm glad you told me.

2833
02:43:27,862 --> 02:43:31,298
Oh, good. Thank God for that.
I thought I'd put my foot in it by telling...

2834
02:43:31,382 --> 02:43:32,895
- Not at all.
- Okay.

2835
02:43:32,982 --> 02:43:36,292
- Well, it was lovely to meet you.
- Absolutely. Lovely to meet you.

2836
02:43:36,382 --> 02:43:38,293
- See you again.
- I'll take it on board.

2837
02:43:38,382 --> 02:43:39,895
Bye.

2838
02:43:47,662 --> 02:43:50,574
You have one message. Message one.

2839
02:43:50,662 --> 02:43:51,811
(BEEP)

2840
02:43:51,902 --> 02:43:55,895
Hello, dear. It's your daddy here, er...
with your mummy.

2841
02:43:55,982 --> 02:43:59,338
- Erm... nothing important.
- MUM: Oh, give it to me.

2842
02:43:59,502 --> 02:44:03,620
Hello, dear. Great news about Andy.
We're so pleased for him.

2843
02:44:03,702 --> 02:44:08,059
And it just got us thinking that maybe you
should try and do something with your life.

2844
02:44:08,182 --> 02:44:11,299
I mean, your dad and I aren't expecting
anything spectacular.

2845
02:44:11,382 --> 02:44:14,260
We were just thinking maybe a wee job
you could be proud of.

2846
02:44:14,342 --> 02:44:17,732
You know, we love you so much,
we hate to think of you growing old

2847
02:44:17,822 --> 02:44:21,610
and being poor and living in squalor
and dying a spinster.

2848
02:44:21,702 --> 02:44:24,296
So, just give us a call
to put our minds at rest

2849
02:44:24,382 --> 02:44:27,374
that you're not just frittering your life away,
would you? Okay?

2850
02:44:27,462 --> 02:44:31,091
And if things get any worse, you can always
come back home. We've still got your room.

2851
02:44:31,182 --> 02:44:33,093
DAD: Well, it's sort of my study now.

2852
02:44:33,182 --> 02:44:36,219
MUM: We could easily squeeze in
a tiny wee single bed.

2853
02:44:36,302 --> 02:44:38,816
All right then, give us a call, sweetheart.
Bye for now.

2854
02:44:38,902 --> 02:44:40,176
DAD: Bye dear.

2855
02:44:40,262 --> 02:44:41,331
Bye.

2856
02:44:43,142 --> 02:44:44,939
(SIGHING)

2857
02:44:46,462 --> 02:44:50,296
Okay, great. Well, I love the changes.
I think this is looking great. Well done.

2858
02:44:50,382 --> 02:44:53,374
- Oh, thank you.
- I think we're ready to move things forward.

2859
02:44:53,462 --> 02:44:57,580
I'd like to shoot a non-broadcast pilot
with a view to making a series.

2860
02:44:57,662 --> 02:45:00,335
Oh! Okay, thank you.

2861
02:45:00,422 --> 02:45:01,935
- All right.
- Brilliant.

2862
02:45:02,022 --> 02:45:04,661
So, are you happy with the way
things have gone so far?

2863
02:45:04,742 --> 02:45:06,778
- Definitely.
- You happy working with Damon?

2864
02:45:06,862 --> 02:45:10,218
- Definitely.
- No problems with the working relationship?

2865
02:45:10,302 --> 02:45:12,941
- Nothing you want to discuss?
- No.

2866
02:45:13,022 --> 02:45:14,421
Okay.

2867
02:45:14,502 --> 02:45:16,777
- I'm not too gay for you, then?
- Damon.

2868
02:45:16,862 --> 02:45:20,013
I'm sorry. I said I wasn't going to say
anything but he's lying through his teeth.

2869
02:45:20,102 --> 02:45:21,854
Excuse me.

2870
02:45:24,382 --> 02:45:27,533
Your friend, Maggie, is it?
She told him what you said about him.

2871
02:45:27,622 --> 02:45:30,090
- What did I say about him?
- That he's too gay.

2872
02:45:30,182 --> 02:45:35,097
- Oh! No. She's an idiot. She's an idiot.
- So you didn't say that?

2873
02:45:35,902 --> 02:45:39,019
Yes, but he wasn't meant to hear it.

2874
02:45:39,782 --> 02:45:43,741
It concerns me if you're so homophobic,
you couldn't work with a gay person...

2875
02:45:43,822 --> 02:45:46,097
No, no, no, no, I'm not homophobic.

2876
02:45:46,182 --> 02:45:48,457
In fact, I actually said to her,

2877
02:45:48,582 --> 02:45:52,621
I said,
"I don't care how much arse sex he has...

2878
02:45:52,702 --> 02:45:56,741
"he's just too..." What was it?
I can't remember what I said.

2879
02:45:57,502 --> 02:45:59,970
You're aware that I'm gay?

2880
02:46:02,062 --> 02:46:03,381
Didn't...

2881
02:46:03,462 --> 02:46:06,295
Well, no, you didn't... And you don't make
a song and dance. You don't go,

2882
02:46:06,382 --> 02:46:08,293
"Ooh, hello! I'm..."

2883
02:46:08,382 --> 02:46:10,498
- No, I didn't.
- I'll stop you there.

2884
02:46:10,582 --> 02:46:11,731
Go on.

2885
02:46:11,822 --> 02:46:14,211
What concerns me is
we've all got to work together

2886
02:46:14,302 --> 02:46:16,133
and if this is where we are
when we've only just started,

2887
02:46:16,222 --> 02:46:18,258
where the hell are we going to be
a month or so down the line?

2888
02:46:18,342 --> 02:46:21,140
It won't be a problem
because I'll just apologise to Damo.

2889
02:46:21,222 --> 02:46:24,612
Everyone gets wound up with
the people they work in close proximity with.

2890
02:46:24,702 --> 02:46:26,579
Little things wind you up,
so it doesn't matter.

2891
02:46:26,662 --> 02:46:30,371
It's not a case of being straight or gay.
It's my neuroses and I'll just, you know...

2892
02:46:30,462 --> 02:46:33,181
Do you think you could put your
hang-ups and your neuroses on hold?

2893
02:46:33,262 --> 02:46:35,332
- Yes.
- He won't be around for long.

2894
02:46:36,502 --> 02:46:38,891
- What, AIDS?
- Sorry?

2895
02:46:39,822 --> 02:46:42,017
Is it AIDS?

2896
02:46:42,142 --> 02:46:44,975
No. I mean the pilot
will only take a couple of months.

2897
02:46:45,062 --> 02:46:46,575
Oh, yeah.

2898
02:46:46,662 --> 02:46:49,859
Right. Listen, talk to Damo, I'll talk to him.

2899
02:46:49,982 --> 02:46:54,021
We'll see where we are and if we feel
we can go forward with this project or not.

2900
02:46:54,102 --> 02:46:57,299
We can... Okay, I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him now.

2901
02:46:57,382 --> 02:46:59,213
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

2902
02:47:00,382 --> 02:47:02,850
- Okay, I'll go and talk to him.
- All right, bye.

2903
02:47:02,942 --> 02:47:05,297
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

2904
02:47:05,382 --> 02:47:07,657
- Hello.
- Hi. Do me a favour. Stay out of my business.

2905
02:47:07,742 --> 02:47:10,336
- Andy, what? Come in.
- I may have lost the pilot thanks to you.

2906
02:47:10,422 --> 02:47:11,571
- Why?
- Why?

2907
02:47:11,662 --> 02:47:13,539
Because you stuck your nose in
where it wasn't needed.

2908
02:47:13,622 --> 02:47:16,056
Telling Damo I thought he was too gay.
What were you thinking?

2909
02:47:16,142 --> 02:47:18,861
I was thinking that you were stressed
and I just wanted to help you.

2910
02:47:18,942 --> 02:47:22,776
That's helping me, is it?
I just can't believe your stupidity sometimes.

2911
02:47:22,862 --> 02:47:25,695
Andy, don't be like this, I can't cope.
I'm having a bad time at the moment.

2912
02:47:25,782 --> 02:47:27,693
Sorry. What's a bad time for you?

2913
02:47:27,782 --> 02:47:30,091
Tie-dyed the wrong T-shirt?
You lost a kooky broach?

2914
02:47:30,182 --> 02:47:33,413
I was just about getting to where I wanted
to be and you may have fucked it up.

2915
02:47:33,502 --> 02:47:35,458
- I've been grovelling all day at the BBC.
- What do you mean?

2916
02:47:35,542 --> 02:47:38,056
I've got a meeting there at 4:00,
they may pull the plug.

2917
02:47:38,142 --> 02:47:40,610
Imagine if they pull the plug, how am I going
to look you in the face again?

2918
02:47:40,702 --> 02:47:42,374
- Do you want me to say something?
- You're not listening.

2919
02:47:42,462 --> 02:47:45,295
I'm sorry, Andy.
I don't know what you want me to say.

2920
02:47:45,382 --> 02:47:47,896
- I was just trying to help you.
- I don't want you to help me anymore.

2921
02:47:47,982 --> 02:47:51,736
I want you to stop living like a child,
floating through life like everything's okay

2922
02:47:51,822 --> 02:47:53,574
until it actually affects someone, okay?

2923
02:47:53,662 --> 02:47:57,496
So really, my advice to you is,
you've got to grow up.

2924
02:47:58,982 --> 02:48:03,260
Clean up, just sort your own mess out
before you get involved in my life, really.

2925
02:48:36,222 --> 02:48:38,497
- Do you want to follow me?
- Yeah.

2926
02:48:43,902 --> 02:48:46,655
It's unfortunate we've ended up
in this position, Andy.

2927
02:48:46,742 --> 02:48:48,937
I'm not going to speak for Damon.

2928
02:48:49,022 --> 02:48:51,058
Damon, come on.

2929
02:48:51,142 --> 02:48:53,975
- Well, things were said that were very hurtful.
- Yeah.

2930
02:48:54,902 --> 02:48:56,858
But your apology means a lot to me.

2931
02:48:56,942 --> 02:49:01,333
So, if you're happy to work with me,
then I'd like to carry on working with you.

2932
02:49:01,422 --> 02:49:03,333
Definitely. Definitely. Yeah.

2933
02:49:03,422 --> 02:49:05,378
I'm such a huge fan of this project.

2934
02:49:05,462 --> 02:49:07,976
- I'm a big fan of yours, so...
- Great.

2935
02:49:08,062 --> 02:49:09,495
- Happy?
- Definitely.

2936
02:49:09,582 --> 02:49:11,937
- Water under the bridge.
- Wonderful.

2937
02:49:12,422 --> 02:49:15,892
Okay, let's get some dates sorted
and get the ball rolling on his project.

2938
02:49:15,982 --> 02:49:18,860
- Yeah.
- Come on, silly. Huggy Bears.

2939
02:49:21,782 --> 02:49:23,181
DAMON: Now.

2940
02:49:23,262 --> 02:49:24,377
Okay?

2941
02:49:24,462 --> 02:49:25,656
- Do you want one?
- No.

2942
02:49:25,742 --> 02:49:28,495
- Just normal? Okay, brilliant. Okay, thanks.
- Yes.

2943
02:49:31,422 --> 02:49:32,935
Cheers.

2944
02:50:10,022 --> 02:50:11,455
Cut. Great.

2945
02:50:11,542 --> 02:50:13,100
Thank you.

2946
02:50:21,862 --> 02:50:23,773
- See you.
- See you. That's me done.

2947
02:50:23,862 --> 02:50:25,659
- Oh, I'll see you soon.
- Yeah, bye.

2948
02:50:26,662 --> 02:50:27,856
Maggie.

2949
02:50:30,382 --> 02:50:31,781
- Hi.
- You all right?

2950
02:50:31,862 --> 02:50:33,420
Yeah.

2951
02:50:33,502 --> 02:50:35,333
- And you?
- Yeah.

2952
02:50:36,102 --> 02:50:38,013
Here, look.

2953
02:50:40,102 --> 02:50:41,421
Okay, now.

2954
02:50:42,382 --> 02:50:43,781
PATRICK: Hello, Maggie.

2955
02:50:43,862 --> 02:50:46,296
- Hello.
- This is Patrick Stewart here.

2956
02:50:46,382 --> 02:50:49,180
And the reason you're hearing
my rich, sexy voice

2957
02:50:49,262 --> 02:50:52,493
is that Andy is not man enough
to apologise himself,

2958
02:50:52,582 --> 02:50:54,493
even though he knows he's in the wrong.

2959
02:50:54,582 --> 02:50:56,777
That's why he's asked me to do it for him.

2960
02:50:57,462 --> 02:51:02,252
Please, look at his fat, expressionless face.
He doesn't mean any of the things he said

2961
02:51:02,342 --> 02:51:05,095
and he knows you don't have
a malicious bone in your body

2962
02:51:05,182 --> 02:51:07,616
- and were just trying to help.
- Thank you.

2963
02:51:08,662 --> 02:51:11,051
If you can find it in your heart to forgive him,

2964
02:51:11,142 --> 02:51:14,976
then please... make it so.

2965
02:51:17,702 --> 02:51:19,932
Have you seen
Star Trek: The Next Generation?

2966
02:51:20,062 --> 02:51:22,781
Er, no, I haven't, actually.

2967
02:51:22,862 --> 02:51:26,093
Never mind.
Incidentally, Maggie, are you an actress?

2968
02:51:26,182 --> 02:51:28,571
Because I'm writing a film
and I'd love you to be in it.

2969
02:51:28,662 --> 02:51:30,971
Okay. No, she can't. Okay, thanks.

2970
02:51:31,502 --> 02:51:32,696
Cheers.

2971
02:51:32,782 --> 02:51:36,172
- What was that about a film?
- You don't want any part of it, trust me.

2972
02:51:39,102 --> 02:51:41,013
- Your hair looks really nice.
- Shut your face.

2973
02:51:41,102 --> 02:51:43,662
- What? It does.
- Well, thanks.

2974
02:51:43,742 --> 02:51:46,256
- The pilot's fine, by the way.
- Thank God for that.

2975
02:51:47,062 --> 02:51:49,451
I just wanted to let you know
that I have taken on board

2976
02:51:49,542 --> 02:51:52,659
all that stuff that you were saying
about growing up.

2977
02:51:52,742 --> 02:51:55,097
- Oh, don't please, shut up.
- Well, I have.

2978
02:51:55,182 --> 02:51:57,252
- Oh, don't.
- Well, you know what I mean.

2979
02:51:57,342 --> 02:51:59,492
- Well, I'm mortified.
- No, I know, but you were right.

2980
02:51:59,582 --> 02:52:02,494
I wasn't right. You're about the most
grown-up person I know.

2981
02:52:02,582 --> 02:52:05,779
- I'm sort of the only person you know.
- You win by default.

2982
02:52:06,662 --> 02:52:08,300
Correct.

2983
02:52:09,542 --> 02:52:11,180
I'm really sorry.

2984
02:52:11,862 --> 02:52:14,092
Can you let go of my hand, please?

2985
02:52:17,502 --> 02:52:21,734
Of course. Aren't my hands lucky? 'Cause
that would ruin everything, wouldn't it?

2986
02:52:21,822 --> 02:52:24,655
- He's quite a nice one, though, isn't he?
- He's fine.

2987
02:52:24,742 --> 02:52:27,973
I've been working up to saying hello to him
for the last couple of days.

2988
02:52:28,062 --> 02:52:29,814
- Sure.
- What do you think?

2989
02:52:29,902 --> 02:52:31,255
- You know what I think.
- What?

2990
02:52:31,342 --> 02:52:33,253
I think you're a tart.

2991
02:52:33,342 --> 02:52:35,014
Go on, then.

2992
02:52:35,502 --> 02:52:37,220
- Work your magic.
- Yeah, I will.

2993
02:52:37,302 --> 02:52:38,530
I'll see you later, yeah?

2994
02:52:38,622 --> 02:52:40,294
- See you.
- See you.

2995
02:52:49,142 --> 02:52:50,700
ANDY: That was quick.

2996
02:52:50,782 --> 02:52:54,138
I couldn't think of anything witty to say.
He was on the phone anyway.

2997
02:52:55,262 --> 02:52:57,014
ANDY: What would you rather do...

2998
02:52:57,102 --> 02:52:59,696
(MAGGIE LAUGHS) Go on, then.

Wake up and your teeth
have sort of fallen out,

3000
02:53:01,902 --> 02:53:04,336
wake up and your hair's fallen out,

3001
02:53:04,422 --> 02:53:08,301
or wake up and your toes have fallen off?
