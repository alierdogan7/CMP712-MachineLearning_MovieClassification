00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,224
That is hardcore.

342
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,189
Are you doing a Big Year?

343
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,127
No. You?

344
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,165
KENNY: Come on, let's speed it up!

345
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,601
The lad inside says there's a suitable hotel
on the 101, halfway to Mount Shasta.

346
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,611
Hotel? What, you think a snowy owl's
just gonna wait for us? Uh-uh.

347
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,944
Only reason why I invited you was so
we can drive straight through. Chop, chop!

(TIRES SCREECH)

349
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,352
BRENDA: I can get you
70% off the hotel in Sa vannah,

350
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,548
And I can put you on a direct flight,
but it's $100 more.

351
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,358
Better stay with the two layovers then.

352
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,253
And your dad wants to talk to you.

353
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,327
- No. No, Mom. Mom, no.
- BRENDA: Yeah. Oh!

354
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,489
He's grabbing the phone!

355
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,067
- Yeah. He's grabbing the phone!
- No, no, no, Don't hand it to him,

356
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,034
- Mom? Mom, I don't Want to talk to him,
- Yeah!

357
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,936
Yeah!

358
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,603
Where is our world traveler today?

359
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,136
Oregon. Looking for seabirds.

360
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,112
Oregon.
I guess everybody needs a vacation.

361
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,347
It's not a vacation, Dad.

362
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,849
It's not work.

363
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,387
Unless somebody's paying you
to stay in hotels and look at birds.

364
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,253
- D a d!
- Okay, akay, akay, you're right, I'm sorry,

365
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,118
I guess I'm just kind of confused about
what a vacation is.

366
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,188
Okay, Dad, you know what? I gotta run.

367
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,863
Hey. Hey. Brad?

368
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,729

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,350

another cup of coffee.

BRAD: In birding terms,
what Bastick and Fuchs sa W that day

378
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,073
was nothing short of a miracle.

379
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,343
Unbelievable.

380
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,578
This is the rarest bird I've ever seen.

381
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,613
It's like we were meant to crash here.

382
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,850
We were.

383
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,858
BRAD: They had survived
a near-fatal crash,

384
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,953
only to stumble upon
a great spotted Woodpecker.

385
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,131
Do you realize how rare that is?

386
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,030
Statistically, in the Pa cifff: North West,

387
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,569
they had a greater chance
of seeing a unicorn.

388
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,772
All of a sudden your arm
doesn't feel so broke, does it?

389
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,398
You could chop my arm off.

390
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,672
How's the conference?

391
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,141
How bad could it be?

392
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,244
It's Paris. How's it going there?

393
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,753
Glorious! Dawn just broke.
Tamaulipas crows'll be here any minute.

394

I'm happy for you.
But I wish you were here.

Mmm. Green.

397
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,057
What was that?

398
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,362
I'm renovating.

399
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,639
Again? I thought we just got done
redoing the whole house.

400
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,471
Uh-huh.
But not the upstairs and the kitchen.

Whoa, the kitchen?

402
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,679
I thought we had an agreement that
we were gonna wait on doing the kitchen.

403
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,249
I thought you agreed to wait
to do another Big Year.

404
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,252
Jess, I've told you,
the birds wait for no man.

405
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,377
And neither do I.

406
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,157
Sol had to hire Frank Falucci,
seeing as you're so busy.

407
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,590
You hired my competitor?
That's gonna drag on forever.

408
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,220
Na, 'cause I said to Frank

409
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,162
that I'd give him a bonus
if he was done by April.

410
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,289
A bonus?

411
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,131
All right, but, jeez, babe, please,
you've got to keep an eye on this.

412
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,704
You cannot trust contractors.

413
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,469
I'm well aware, honey.

414
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,604
Okay, so is it old man Frank
in charge of the job,

415
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,078
or is it his kind of good-looking' son
who's doing' it?

416
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,445
He's not that good-looking.
Where are you, anyway?

- Is it beautiful there?
- No.

and it's in trouble.

wandered into the street.

- Your baby needs you, Stu.

- Two days. Two.
- That's all we're asking.

437
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,562
- Just till the deal's closed.
- And you'll never hear from us again.

438
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,728
Two days. Then I'm done.

439
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,005
- You got it.
- Two days in New York

440
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,610
- and then you migrate.
- Migrate!

441
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,235
See, you're not the only one
with a sense of humor.

442
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,805
Yes, I am.

Long time no see, Bostick.
You remember my kid Frank Jr.

445
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,707
it's a beautiful place you got here, sir.

446
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,974
Yeah, it was.

447
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,673
All right, Falucci, I'm gonna be going over
your time sheets like a hawk,

448
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,912
so you might want to
ease up on the snack breaks.

449
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,019
Your wife wasn't exaggerating.
Everything with you is birds, Bostick!

450
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,949
Yeah, it is.

- Hello, stranger. This is a rare sighting.
- Hi.

456
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,370
Yeah. What have you done to our house?

457
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,378
- Do you like it so far?
- So far?

458
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,014
Please don't tell me there's more to come!
This is crazy!

459
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,980
Are you trying to get my attention?
It worked.

460
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,349
Is that the point of all this?

461
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,922
I don't know. I don't know, Kenny.
What is the point?

462
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,851
I'm surprised to still see
this room standing,

463
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,622
that you didn't take
a sledgehammer to this.

464
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,493
I'm supposed to put
my life on hold for a year?

465
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,490
Like a pathetic golf widow?

466
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:27,331
You're not a golf widow.
You can't compare golf to this.

467
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,802
Golf's just like a hobby.

468
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,101
And the birding is what exactly?

469
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,636
I don't know, it's like a calling.
This is like my calling.

470
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,002
Like Gandhi?

471
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:41,676
No, come on.
I'm not comparing myself to Gandhi, okay?

472
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,650
That's ridiculous. Okay?
It's more like I'm Mozart, I guess.

473
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,157
Okay, fine. You got a calling.
I got a calling, too.

474
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,786
- It's known as a baby.
- Yeah.

475
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,833
I know. I like to think that that's like
another one of my callings, too.

476
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,904
And you're gonna have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.

477
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,198
- I realize.
- In person.

478
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,274
Yes. In person.
I wouldn't want it any other way.

479
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,402
Really? 'Cause I ain't so sure, Wolfgang.

480
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,209
Maybe I can convince you.

481
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,643
I didn't mean now.

482
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,983
Come on. What's the matter with now?

483
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,217
'Cause we have a house full of men.

484
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,793

that they're there.

If you Te planning to be
anywhere in the Gulf taday,

496
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,374
better batten dawn the hatches.

497
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,386
We are talking about a storm
that may last for 72 hours.

498

- Kenny! Kenny!

I'll call you!

I'm getting on a plane right now.

506
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,951
Texas? You just got back.

507
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,322
Bill! There is going to be
major fallout in a few hours.

508
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,922
- Nuclear fallout?
- Bird fallout.

509
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,200
What are you talking about?

510
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,295
I'm talking about a major storm
hitting the Gulf of Mexico

511
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,633
in the middle of migration season.

512
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,035
I'm talking about headwinds
and downpours

513
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,837
and a hundred thousand birds
literally dropping from the sky!

514
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,078
I'll put it down as a sick day.

515
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,537
- Stu.
- Hey.

516
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,139
- Where you going?
- Texas.

517
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,914
Texas? Now? What about Mclntire?
How do we explain this?

518
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,081
Act of God.

519
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:04,019
Act of God? No! That's not gonna work!
Stop this car! Stop this car!

520
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,358
Those damn birds!

521
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,364
BRAD: Stu arrived on the outskirts of
Houston

522
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,368
feeling liberated after skipping out an
his meeting in New York.

523
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,529
I really believe I can win this thing.

524
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,904
Bastick, not surprisingly,
was supremely confident.

525
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,409
Yes! Yes!
I really think I've got this thing locked up.

526
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,205
And I get to admit, I was feeling
that luck was an my side for a change.

527
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,409
I'm starting to think I have a chance.

528
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,548
I had done the math.
I knew what spring fallout meant.

529
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,854
A World record was Within my grasp.

530
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,427
(CLAMORING)

531
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,370
Whoa!

532
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,205
Unbelievable.

533
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,938
Oh, my God.

534
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,383
REPORTER: Faced with that headwind,

535
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,483
they have to come down
at the first land they see,

536
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,824
and that's right here.

537
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,124
One thing's for sure,

538
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,168
today's happening is strictly
for the birds. Gretchen.

539
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,232
Come on, guys, get... Keep it moving!
Come on, we got a lot of birds to see.

540
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,333
Bloody ass. Only Americans can
turn birding into a competition!

541
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,038
That's right.
You don't want to miss this one!

542
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,205
What?

543
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,995
- Brad!
- Stu!

544
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,563
I knew you'd be here. I was looking for you.

545
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,131
- Me, too.
- This is incredible, isn't it?

546
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,198
I know. Where do we even start?

547
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,363
There's the best birder in the world.
Maybe we should...

548
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,408
Follow him.

549
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,341
(LET IT SHIIVEPLAYING)

550
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:07,916
(INAUDIBLE)

551
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,087
- STU: Prothonotary Warbler.
- (EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY)

552
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,696
Gotcha.

553
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,426
Oh! Blue grosbeak.

554
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,731
It's a buffet.

555
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,168
Sa I play what the kids Wanna hear

556
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,173
While I spange on Broadway

557
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,744
Shine, let it shine

558
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,906
Even if it bums your eyes

559
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,176
This fight of mine is mine

560
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,616
And I'm gonna let it shine...

561
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,851
Ever get the feeling you're being followed?

562
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,650
- Hello, master.
- How you doing, Stu?

563
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,724
Still filling those weekends, I see.

564
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,817
Unless you and your son here
are doing a Big Year.

565
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:58,296
(CHUCKLES) Oh! Kenny Bostick,
this is my friend Brad Harris.

566
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,891
Who's also not doing a Big Year.

567
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,671
That's funny how
nobody's doing a Big Year.

568
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,001
Yeah. With all this fallout and El Nino.

569
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,202
Yeah, I know, you'd think
the conditions are just set up perfect

570
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,279
for someone to have a real shot at
breaking my record.

571
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,747
- Not that record.
- Pink-footed goose!

572
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,913
Pink-footed goose,
other end of the boardwalk.

573
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,584
- What the hell's that doing here?
- MAN: Be careful!

574
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,785
Hey, put her down!

575
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,531
Hey, hey, please, let the explorers through!

576
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,930
- Of course.
- Let's go, ladies. Jeesh.

577
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,226
After you, kids.

578
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,731
Get those badges.

579
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,064
Chop, chop, chop, chop!
Step it up! Stepping lively!

580
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,941
Move it along!

581
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,344
Thank you.

582
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,546
She took off. Headed north.
Probably be in Iceland by Friday.

583
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,591
Boy, she was a beaut, too!

584
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,355
Hey, is that a Calliope?

585
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,450
Nah.

586
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,258
Sorry to disappoint you boys again.

587
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,934
Good evening. Tonight's special is quail.
I highly recommend it.

588
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,273
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, not tonight.

589
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,474
I'll have the halibut.

590
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,608
And a bottle of this Montrachet.

591
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,777
Of course.

592
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,981
And I will have the soup. Thank you.

593
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,721
Really? After being outside all day
in the wind and rain?

594
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,825
Kind of a light eater.

595
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,121
And the truth is

596
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,167
the prices here are
a little steeper than I'm used to.

597
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,105
- Brad, I invited you to dinner.
- I know, but...

598
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,072
No, it's my pleasure.

599
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,805
Look, when I'm birding,
I don't fly first class or hire guides.

600
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,007
It's too much like corked bats
and steroids to me.

601
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,014
But tonight we're celebrating.

602
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,783
We saw 136 species!

603
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,325
Brad, 136!

604
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,449
Here's to them.

605
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,056
And to the one who got away.

606
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,252
Pink-footed goose.

607
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,725
The Montrachet.

608
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,597
Good. And my friend would like to
see the menu again, please.

609
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,194
WAITER: Of course.

610
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,368
Cool.

611
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,377
That shrimp scampi was calling my name,
if you must know.

612
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,242
- That's a little too much.
- Okay.

613
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,673
BRAD: By the end of the meal
I felt like I 'd known Stu for years.

614
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,809
It was rare to meet a birder
as absessed as I Was.

615
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,923
And even rarer to meet one
who could pa y for dinner.

616
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,654
I mean, I'm 36.

617
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,521
I'm divorced.

618
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,921
I have a job I hate.

619
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,663
I just want to do something big, you know?
Make my mark.

620
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,262
So what are you gonna do?

621
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,237
I'm working on something.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)

622
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,039
My dad doesn't get it.

623
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,771
He's had the same boring job for 40 years.

624
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,038
"That's what people do," he says.

625
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,810
He's right.

626
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,752
Most people just stay on the beaten path,
then one day,

627
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,516
they wake up and realize they didn't do
everything they wanted to do.

628
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,526
Look at me. I was so afraid to retire,

629
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,652
I had to do it twice
before I finally got out here.

630
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,155
Why'd you wait so long?

631
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,129
'Cause I'm an idiot.

632
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,065
Okay, I gotta tell you.

633
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,766
I'm doing a Big Year.

634
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,567
Wow.

635
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,272
I know.

636
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,476
BRAD: I don't know
what ma de me blurt it out like that.

637
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,711
Confidence? Innocence? Alcohol?

638
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,946
If just never occurred to me
that Stu might be doing' his own Big' Year,

639
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,386
Don't tell anybody, okay?

640
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,892
I guess I just assumed he'd be honest,

641
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,589
Iguess I just assumed
honor and decency Wauld prevail.

642
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,361
I guess I just assumed We were friends.

643
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,729
Mum's the word.

644
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,799
- We won't have to eat for a week.
- I'm hurting.

645
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,498
Great dinner.

646
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,706
Good luck.

647
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,315
Thanks again.

648
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,084
Hey, it's me,

649
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,876
Mozart.

650
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,720
The fallout's over and now I'm calling
to deal with the fallout from the fallout.

651
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,555
Look, babe, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna make it up to you, you 'll see,

652
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,224
I'm going ta...

653
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,958
Where are you, anyway? It's late there.

654
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,126
- I hope you Te aka y, babe.
- Oh! Where am I?

655
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,502
I'm shooting hormones into my butt
so I can have your baby, Kenny.

656
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,702
Okay, I'm going to hit the sack here,
but I Will try you in the morning,

657
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,040
and I'm gonna be launching a new thing
called Operation Sweep Her Off Her Feet.

658
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,114
Sa, you might Want to get ready,
'cause it 's gonna be pretty spectacular.

659
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,520
Okay? All right. Talk to you tam arrow.

660
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:46,211


661
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,462
Pomarine jaeger, nine o'clock!

662
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,573
Brad.

663
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,542
- Brad!
- No.

664
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,077
- Oh! Sorry.
- Sorry.

665
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,770
CRANE: 'Met a dapper White-haired _quy

STU: I still feel like a heel.
Feel like I led him an.

672

But I'm afraid
if he knew about my Big Year,

673
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,824
Bostick'd get it out of him eventually.

674
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,065
And why is it so important to
keep this secret from Bostick?

675
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,565
Less competition he thinks he has,

676
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,228
the more he's likely to throttle back,
not try so hard.

677
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,172
Not grind for the extra birds.
Maybe I could sneak past him.

678
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,668
Do whatever it takes

682

I could get us a room in Saint Paul,
not far from the Sax Zim Bog.

683
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:30,256
Really! Not far from the bog.

Hey, Jim.

Yeah, listen, talks broke down.

Total acrimony, On the Way out the door,

693
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,210
we agreed to a do-or-die session, May 14th,

694
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,986
here in New York in our offfce.

695
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,520
I can't. Impossible.

696
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,184
- I'm #ying to Attu an the 14th.
- To where?

697
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,253
Attu, Alaska. And I can't miss the flight.
There's not another one for a week.

698
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,327
Stu, you're not involved, the deal dies.

699
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,762
Look, you gave these people their jobs.

If you don't do something,
they're gonna lose them!

701
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,526
And that means a hell of a latmare
than some birds an A ttu.

702

BRAD: Attu. The Westernmast island
of the Aleutian chain.

703
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,673
Sa far West, it's closer to Tokyo
than to Anchorage.

704
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,310
There are no hotels, no phones,
no restaurants, no toilets.

705

Not the kind that Hush, anyway,

706

But for birders, A ttu was para diss.

Are you upset because
you think you can't win,

- or because he lied to you?
- Both. And what about Bostick?

715

Who?

716
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,550
Kenny Bostick, the best birder in the world.
I think he might be doing another Big Year.

717
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,850
What chance do I have?

718
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:12,291
Oh, Brad, you have 486 birds.
You're on a record pace.

719

You can't quit now!

- No. No. No. No.

Even if I go to Alaska,
there's no way I can complete the year!

This has a $6,000 limit.

Bring me back some Alaska pictures.

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,300
- No, Mom, I can't.
- No, no, no, no.

Get dressed. Your plane leaves in an hour.

726

Don't piss off your travel agent.

727

there's not another one for a week.

730

- Thank you.

Thanks for being here, Stu.

734
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,069
STU: I can give you four hours, that's it.
Then I've got to catch my flight to Alaska.

BARRY: No problem.
JIM: How was your trip?

736
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,845
- Louisiana was spectacular.
- Lot of birds in the bayou.

737
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,246
And saw a loggerhead shrike
from my hotel room in Natchitoches.

738
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,510
Adorable!

739
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,746
It imitates the songs of other birds
to lure them in close.

740
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:12,820
Uh-huh.

741
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,288
Then it impales them on thorns,
breaks their necks and eats them.

742
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,719
Yeesh!

743
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,294
STU: We'll assume the cost of
retrofitting the plants,

744
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,021
but that still leaves
the non-compete clause.

745
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,426
Barry says you have an issue with it.

746
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,658
No. it's not a big issue,
but I'm not like you, Stu.

spend the rest of my life bird watching.

Four hours ago, you said
that everything was negotiable.

What, was this just so you could
lure me in to finish me off?

The shrike.

00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,524
It's 11:15.

756
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,363
I should have left for the airport
15 minutes ago.

Just wait, one second, please. One second.
