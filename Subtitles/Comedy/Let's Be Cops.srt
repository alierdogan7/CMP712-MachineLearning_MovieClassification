00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,255
you ditched us with
the other night, am I right?

1057
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,415
That's right, yeah.
No.

1058
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,566
Good to see you guys again.
Come on back.

1059
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,935
We're gonna go back.

1060
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,255
This guy is a rascal.

1061
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,850
No, I'm being serious.
We're really not cops.

1062
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,246
That's not funny.

1063
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,775
George Segars, he said
don't worry about it.

1064
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,165
Help me. Please!

1065
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,367
See you, Angie.

1066
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,095
JUSTIN: We're not cops.
It's not funny.

1067
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,531
SEGARS: His name's
Mossi Kasic.

1068
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,841
He's top of the shitlist.

1069
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,047
I'm surprised you guys
haven't heard of him.

1070
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,090
I deal with guys like this
on a daily basis, Segars.

1071
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,561
I hear you, Sarge
but this guy is different.

1072
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,291
He runs a crew,
preys on local shop owners...

1073
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,646
and immigrants like himself.

1074
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,606
He muscles in...

1075
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,280
takes Co-ownership
of the businesses...

1076
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
and then uses it for money
laundering and whatnot.

1077
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,886
He's an animal.

1078
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,206
MOSSI: <i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

1079
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,841
SEGARS: <i>You can't reason
with him, can't talk to him.</i>

1080
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,327
He loves to fight.
He lives for it.

1081

(MEN SHOUTING)

1082
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,369
He's got this crazy temper.

1083
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,760
He can snap, just like that.

1084
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,285
It's all right.

1085
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,041
(GRUNTS)

1086
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,160
SEGARS: He's taken down
some big scores.

1087
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,761
Everytime we raid his place, though...
nothing.

1088
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,410
We can't find
anything on the inside.

1089
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,841
I gotta say,
I want this guy bad.

1090
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,651
It's good to hear.
I want him bad, too.

1091
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,925
I think about it every night.
Me, too.

1092
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,605
I just lay awake,
staring at the ceiling...

1093
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,842
just thinking about
different ways to nail him.

1094
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,570
I'm obsessed with
nailing this dude.

1095
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,530
I wanna put him up on the wall,
you know, and just... (GRUNTS)

1096
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,967
"What's my name?"
That's right.

1097
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,804
Anyways, that's probably
never gonna happen.

1098
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,202
What's going on, guys?

1099
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,488
Nothing. We were just
talking about Mossi.

1100
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,215
Nobody in the community's
gonna testify against him...

1101
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,880
and without hard evidence,
we got nothing.

1102
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,730
So why don't we do surveillance?

1103
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,935
Believe me, I'd love to do that, but
it's a little bit above my pay grade.

1104
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,255
Right.

1105
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,645
However...

1106
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,967
between you and me, Sarge...
Everything is.

1107
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,202
SEGARS: This station has
a shitload of equipment.

1108
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,335
I'm talking about wiretaps,
pinhole cameras,

1109
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,203
anything you want,
I can get for you.

1110
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,535
(WHISPERING) I want all of it.

1111
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,815

Let's do it. Yeah!

1113
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,040
Hey, Sarge, <i>Brothers in
Blue,</i> should we sing it?

1114
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,003
Sing what?
It's the academy song. Come on.

1115
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,804
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fire it up.

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,410
That's good. This guy
never stops, does he?

1118
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,721
There's a police song?

1119
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,615
I gotta learn that.
You're a fucking idiot.

to turn ourselves in

1122
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,488
and now your
checking out equipment?

1123
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,685
Dude, you heard the cop.
It's up to us to get this guy.

1124

He is the devil's nephew.

1125

We're not going near that guy!

1126
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,611
So let me get this straight.

1127
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,410
You finally meet
a girl that you like...

1128
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,285
and she likes you, and then
some douchebag comes around...

1129
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,370
and says that you
can't be with her...

1130
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,568
and your first
thought is to run away?

1131
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,410
Yes. He said
he would kill me.

1132
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,295
I'm not gonna let
you run away, man.

What?

1136
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,655
You wanna know
what people say about you?

1137
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,808
I know what they say.

1138
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,730
But I haven't felt like
this in a long time.

1139

believe in me, man.

wanna talk about it.

they're doing in there?

shady, that's for sure.

inside and open those doors.

to be doing this together.

no "we" in this situation.

to meet a more stable guy.

we take our job seriously.

1241
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,126
I don't know.

1242

JUSTIN: What's this?

1243
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,080
This is the shipment.
This is our evidence.

JUSTIN: How do you know that?

1245
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,809
Because it's a cargo van,
and these are all bad guys.

1246
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,928
JUSTIN: These guys are
terrible-looking people.

1247

00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,535
So?

1250
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,450
They tell me their badge
numbers don't match up.

1251
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,571
Which tells me one thing.
They're not LAPD.

Oh, we're dead.

1253
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,121
So, what are they?

1254
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,001
Feds, ATF, maybe a special unit.

1255
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,841
What?

1256
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,328
Yeah, we're black ops, dude.

1257
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,251

00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,046

would be going on right now.

RYAN: Boom, we got them.

1268
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,771
Now what's in those crates?

1269
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,241
I'm seeing it the same time you're
seeing it. How would I know that?

1270
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,641
I need to narrate it, because that's
what you do in these situations.

1271
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,643
You see something and one of
the guys says it out loud.

1272
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,724
And the other guy, you, is
supposed to go, "Yeah."

1273
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,287
RYAN: Oh, shit, dude. We gotta
know what's inside those crates.

1275

Relax, I'm just
gonna go talk to him.

I will not relax.
You're an idiot.

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,924

You have the right
to an attorney.

one will be appointed...

an interrogation.

1396
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,250
How do we get into that party?

1397
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,495
When I'm speaking English but it still
sounds like... (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

1398
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,885
Like that, I don't
what you're saying.

00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,280
PUPA: You didn't get
any of that?

1400
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,015
<i>Qué?</i>

1401
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,166
PUPA: You didn't get any...

1402
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,645
<i>Qué?</i>
Holy shit.

1403
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,121
What?
What?

1404
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,083
This is gonna sound
a little bit weird...

1405
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,208
But you two could
pass as brothers.

1406
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,970
Ew! No,
this guy's gross!

1407
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,081
No offense.

1408
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,851
No offense?
You just said, "Ew."

1409
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,164
The last person who said,
"Ew" to me, was my mother.

1410
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,415
Hmm.

1411

where she is right now?

You got it.

1413
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,001
Heaven.

1414
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,246
Hopefully from natural causes?

1415
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,689
If me getting angry and doing something
foolish is natural causes...

1416
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,001
then yes.

1417
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,615
You look handsome.
Thank you.

1418
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,041
A great-looking guy.
Now I'm here to play war.

1419
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,601
Hey, Chang.
How do I make you...

1420
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,527
look like him?

1422
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,401
Shit.

1424
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,127
Uh...
Shut up.

1425
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,927
I need a water, three bowls and a lemon
peel. Come on, people, let's go!

1426
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,127
That's my girl.

1427
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,726
She said she'd done a three-way
with a couple of paramedics.

1428
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,081
Mmm-hmm I think this
the marrying type.

1429
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,321
Sounds like it to me.

1430
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,642
All right.
Are you ready?

1431
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,165

1433
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,443
That's handsome.
Well...

1434
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,922
I look like someone hit me
in the face with Lil Wayne.

1435

1436

Lil Wayne!

1437
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,650
He made a joke about Lil Wayne!

1438
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,331
Oh, shit! That's funny.

1439
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,682
Hey, Josie, I gotta say
you're one heck of an artist.

1440
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,602
Thank you.
PUPA: You're fine, too, girl.

1441
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,921
Yeah, she's pretty.

1442
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,003
Josie, Josie,
look at me. Look at me.

1443
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,162
Don't do intense right now.
Okay.

1444
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,004
You're crazy fine,
that's all I'm saying.

1445
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,361
RYAN: That's a compliment,
now let it go.

1446
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,641
(WHISPERS) Just gonna
say one more thing.

1447
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,450
I wouldn't, though,
is what I'm saying.

1448
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,204
I promise it's going to be okay.

1449
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,840
I mean, I would like
to take off your dress...

1450
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,255
and put my penis inside of you.

1451
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,487
I'd really like to
get all up in that shit.

1452
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,449
No, like in her vagina, though.

1453
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,250
RYAN: I know, but you can't say that.
Appreciate it.

1454
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,615
I wouldn't put it in your butt.

1455
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,800
JOSIE: I gotta go.
PUPA: And a good day to you, <i>madame.</i>

1456
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,720
Do you think I could put "Undercover sting
operation for the LAPD" on my resume?

1457
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,881
Absolutely.

1458
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,603
Did you see when I said
<i>"madame?"</i> That's French.

1459
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,761
That was sweet.

1460
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,446
Here you go, buddy.

1461
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,011
What if I start sweating, dude?

1462
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,655
These tattoos are
gonna run down my face.

1463
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,681
Then don't sweat.

1464
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,444
What do you mean, "Don't
sweat?" I'm not doing this.

1465
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,125
Why you got to be such a bitch?

1466
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,249
Pupa, don't call me a bitch.

1467
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,200
You made such a cool game. If you
make it, then you got to play it.

1468
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,646
I've been saying
that this whole time.

1469
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,889
You made such a cool game, (CHANGES
ACCENT) now you gotta play it.

1470

What are you doing
with your accent?

1471
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,250
What are you
doing with your voice?

1472
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,575
I was agreeing with you.

1473
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,726
But you have an accent.

1474
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,809
I know you are agreeing with me,
but you're saying it like I was.

1475
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,885
What I'm saying is, you made a
great game and I believe in you.

1476
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,361
So, now, you just gotta
(CHANGES ACCENT) play it.

All right, dude.
Feel free to rob him.

Oh, boy. He can't hear you. I'm just
going to ignore him from now on.

What does that mean?

1486

It means, "Suck my balls
and cock, you cocksucker."

1487

Yeah, just say that.
Okay.

recognize that you're not me...

cut your face off!

01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,295
You listen to me, all right?

1563
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,288
I'm having a heart
attack right here!

1564
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,886

just open up that window.</i>

1565
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,015
Okay. Okay.

(SCREAMING)

1567
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,485
RYAN: Why'd you hit me in the face for?
It's me!

1568
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,000
Move! I've got an
awesome entrance.

1569
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,930
Fuck, yeah!

1570
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,081
That wasn't cool.

1571
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,920
What the fuck are you wearing?
Here's where we're at.

1572
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,535
I did some intel, and that's
their safehouse down there.

1573
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,215
As the leader in our situation,

1574
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,844
I'm gonna check that out first.

1575
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,407
You're gonna hang out in the
hallway and stand guard, okay?

1576
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,688
What? No, dude,
I'm on crystal meth!

1577
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,928
I know, it's awesome.
I'm very jealous of that.

1578
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,481
How fun is it? I've done it 11 times.
Eleven?

1579
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,291
And I smoked crack once.

1580
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,726
Let's go!
No, please.

1581
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,281
Don't leave me alone here.
Please, I'm itching.

1582
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,055
I've got this post-nasal

Don't do that!
You're gonna make me...

1585
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,526
Don't... Hey!
Think about something else.

1586
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,170
Think about apple pie.
(RETCHING)

1587
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,975
I've got to take my teeth out.

1588
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,001
I gotta take the hat off.

1589
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,165
I gotta take this thing off my ear.
Wig off.

I can't stop twitching.

1596
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,330
Okay, just don't think about it.
It's a mind thing.

1597
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,481
Okay.

Come on, J.

1599
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,690
I'm so scared.
Hold my hand.

1600
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,445
I'm not holding your hand.

1601
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,122
Dude, I think I'm
addicted to crystal meth.

1602
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,281
You just smoked it once.

1603
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,490
Oh, my God. I would suck
dick for this high.

1604
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,641
You've got to be kidding.

1605
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,255
I wouldn't, but what if I do?

1606
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,691
I don't want to suck dick.

1607
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,880
Because I know I'm
gonna get good at it.

1608

Oh!
(LAUGHING)

1609

Shit!

1610
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,481
Look at all these lights!

1611
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,768
Not the lights. We're excited
about the guns, right?

1612
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,008
Right. Right.

1613

Justin, it's the crates.

1614
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,321

Jackpot, dude.

Yeah, man.

You know what these are?

1618
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,728
These were confiscated
by the police.

1619
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,927
Yeah.

1620
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,209
They were supposed to destroy this shit.
He stole all this.

1621

I feel real good right now.

1622

We should build a porch!

1623
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,885
Right now! That'd be great.
Right.

1624
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,281
I don't even know if I'm good
at woodwork or anything...

1625
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,091
but I feel like I can do that.

1626
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,362
Mmm.
Dude, look at me.

1627
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,855

No.

Neither do I.

1632
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,530
Thank you. That makes
me feel like a leader.

1633
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,091
Holy shit.
You know what this is?

Clothes.

1635

This is actual SWAT gear, man.

1636

Let's be real. We're never
gonna build a porch.

1637
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,450
We're just lying
to ourselves, man.

1638

on with you, man?

It hurts.

Let's go, meth head, now.
I'm sorry.

1642
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,281
Now!
I'm sorry, man.

getting so scary.

are you going? Wait up.

the original General Zod.

put this guy away for years.

Oh.

1682
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,761
That's why he
wants Georgie's so bad.

have some self-worth for once?

Where is this coming from, man?

1707
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,807
I didn't do this for my
self-worth or whatever!

1708
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,731
I did it to get a guy like
Mossi off the streets...

1709

in your life gets tough!

you're still nowhere.

That's why I didn't go pro."
