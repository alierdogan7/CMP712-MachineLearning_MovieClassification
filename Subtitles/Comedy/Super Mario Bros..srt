<i>[Narrator] A long, long time ago,</i>
<i>the earth was ruled by dinosaurs.</i>

2
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,366
<i>They were big, so not a lot of people</i>
<i>went around hassling 'em.</i>

3
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,961
<i>Actually, no people</i>
<i>went around hassling 'em</i>
<i>because there weren't any people yet.</i>

no better'n this.
- Yeah.

<i>Then somethin'happened.</i>
<i>A giant meteorite struck the earth.</i>

8

<i>Good-bye, dinosaurs.</i>

9
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>But what if the dinosaurs</i>
<i>weren't all destroyed?</i>

10
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:32,096
<i>What if the impact of that meteorite</i>
<i>created a parallel dimension...</i>

11
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:35,630
<i>where the dinosaurs continue to thrive</i>
<i>and evolve into intelligent...</i>

12
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>vicious, aggressive beings, just like us?</i>

13
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,671

She was quite an inspiration...

When Koopa took over, she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side.
