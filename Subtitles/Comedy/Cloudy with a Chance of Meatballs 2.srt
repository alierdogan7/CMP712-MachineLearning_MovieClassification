1
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,193
My name is Flint Lockwood.

2
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,969
My whole life I always wanted
to be a great inventor.

3
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,890
Just like my hero.

4
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:51,402
The Scientifically
Wonderful World of Science.

5
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:54,026
With your host, Chester V.

6
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,265
Welcome back, science friends.

7
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,436
You know, I have devoted my life
to inventing the future.

8
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:01,835
But every dream
has a beginning.

9
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:04,587
I still remember
my first invention:

10
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,700
The humble Food Bar.

11
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,500
Whoa!

12
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,857
It was like Chester V

13
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:12,416
was speaking directly to me
using the language of science.

14
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,615
Now look at us.

15
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,102
Our new Food Bar XL
with flavor crystals.

16
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:20,290
Still making people happy
after all these years.

17
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,375
Now, kids, you'll almost
certainly never be me.

18
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:27,150
But, remember, there's no
such thing as small science.

19
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,815
Only small scientists!

20
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:30,958
We love you, Chester V!

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,513
Speaking of small scientists,
say goodbye, Barb.

22
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,527
Goodbye, Barb.
Ha, ha, ha!

23
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:40,207
Can your ideas change the world?
Yes.

24
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,511
Just like Chester V,

25
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:45,489
my dream was to make the world
a better place.

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,433
Spray-On Shoes! Voila!

27
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,098
How you gonna get them off?

28
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,795
<i>Unfortunately, a lot of
people didn't believe in me.</i>

29
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,603
<i>But I never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:57,679
<i>- And eventually,</i>-

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,821
A machine that could turn water

32
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,884
into food.

33
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,707
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

34
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,244
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super Mutating

35
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,508
Dynamic Food Replicator.

36
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,548
The FLDSMDFR.

37
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,919
<i>Because of my
invention's food weather,</i>

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,355
<i>I finally made the world
a better place.</i>

39
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:16,955
Yeah!

40
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,885
I love it!
Or so I thought.

41
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:24,694
When the weather evolved into
a disaster of epic portions,

42
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,314
and the machine
started creating

43
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,619
dangerous living food

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,243
I had to face the truth:

45
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,510
It was time to put an end

46
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,951
to my FLDSMDFR.

47
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,519
Chee... Chee... Chee... Chee...

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Cheese.

49
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,190
By destroying
my greatest invention,

50
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,674
I made something even better:

51
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,212
Friends!

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,890
Wow. Wow.

53
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,292
You made me very proud, son.

54
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,238
Unh! Thank you, Dad. Sorry.

55
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,760
Sam Sparks, in the eight minutes
since we saved the world,

56
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,359
I've had time to reflect.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,611
And I think you and I
should have a place together.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,733
A place?

59
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,430
A place where we work.

60
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,525
You think we work together?
I do.

61
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:25,373
Awesome!
Yes!

62
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,960
We could build a lab.

63
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,986
With cool weather
forecasting devices!

64
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,863
We can invent fantastic machines
like the FLDSMDFR.

65
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:32,894
Yeah!

66
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,363
But not that one.
No.

67
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:37,279
Not ever.
Never, ever, ever!

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,136
What shall we call our lab?

69
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,655
Oh! How about Sparkswood?

70
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,570
Ooh! Sparkswood.

71
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,573
Sparkswood is gonna need
some security.

72
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,698
And I can be your mascot!

73
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,925
And I can be your dad.

74
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,925
There are many ways
in which I can help.

75
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:55,534
Ho, ho! Can't forget you,
lab partner.

76
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,579
Steve!

77
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,460
Where'd he get
the brown crayon?

78
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,465
This could be our future.

79
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:05,870
Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!

80
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,643
Greetings, friends.

81
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,765
And namaste.

82
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,389
Whoa. Is that...?
Chester V?

83
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,637
Mustache.

84
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,006
Please have
some humanitarian aid

85
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,374
as a gesture of our goodwill.

86
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,167
Chester V! Whoa!

87
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,438
Your lab vest looks
even cooler in person!

88
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,952
Thank you. The lack of sleeves
frees up my arms to do this.

89
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,455
Whoa!

90
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,537
Ah! Hand,
what did you do?

91
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,742
There's nothing wrong
with your hand, young Lockwood.

92
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:54,120
You see, I am merely a hologram
of the real Chester V.

93
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:57,374
The United Nations has asked
me and my Thinkquanauts

94
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,954
to assist in the cleanup
and containment

95
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:02,085
of the leftovers
all over the world.

96
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:06,218
Including your Swallow Falls.

97
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,188
We'll get started
on the cleanup

98
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,515
right away.

99
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:11,498
As soon as you all leave.

100
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,412
What?
You need us to leave?

101
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,615
Listen up, ghost man,

102
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,745
you expect us to skedaddle
from our homes

103
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,550
because of some nasty
leftovers?

104
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,164
Yes. Yes, I do.

105
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,959
Son, you can't argue
with yellow police tape.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,487
Everybody back up!
Listen to ghost man.

107
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,886
But do not fret.

108
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,535
All of you will be
temporarily relocated

109
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:35,024
to sunny San Franjose,

110
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,718
California!

111
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,289
The home of Live Corp!
The home of Live Corp!

112
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,168
On my word as a hologram,

113
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,977
you shall all return home
before you know it.

114
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,180
Except for you, Flint Lockwood.

115
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,144
Me? Why?

116
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,057
Oh, heh, heh.
You are going...

117
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,336
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Where am I going?

118
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,712
Oh, please tell me!

119
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,651
Just give it a second.
He's buffering.

120
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:59,367
You are going to join me
at Live Corp

121
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,504
and help us make the world
a better place.

122
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,928
Sir, that's all
I've ever wanted.

123
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,719
But I can't.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,623
On account of making
a promise two minutes ago

125
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,192
to build a lab
with my friends, sir.

126
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,914
I understand, Lockwood.

127
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,793
But if you become
a Thinkquanaut like me,

128
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,196
then all your dreams
will come true.

129
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,762
You have to do this!

130
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,809
What about our dream?

131
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,148
Flint, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

132
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,051
We're all behind you.

133
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,939
Are you guys sure?

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,731
Sure.

135
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,248
This is the best day ever!

136
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,885
Sir, I've taken care
of everything.

137
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,331
The locals have been evacuated.

138
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,830
Splendid. And the inventor?

139
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,004
Oh, he took the job.
Outstanding!

140
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,643
Now we can keep an eye on him.

141
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,838
He has no idea
of our real plan.

142
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,287
Contact me as soon as Operation
Capture the Invention succeeds.

143
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,657
Live Corp.

144
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,514
Cheeseburger.

145
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,871
Oh, big day, big day!
Big day, big day,

146
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,427
big day! Yes!

147
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,700
Wake up, Steve!
Steve.

148
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:39,636
Do I look
like a future Thinkquanaut?

149
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:42,039
Morning there, skipper.
You want a sardine scramble?

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,818
No, thanks! Can't be late!

151
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,402
Flint! Ask that Chester V when
he thinks we can go home again.

152
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:51,285
Morning, Sam!

153
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,223
Morning, Flint! Are you ready
for your first day?

154
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,150
Yeah! Are you?

155
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,186
Whoa!

156
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,420
Sam?

157
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,902
Well, this is me. Good luck
with your new jobs, guys.

158
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:03,709
Good luck, Flint!

159
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,609
Break a leg, Flint!

160
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,571
Bye!

161
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,519
Adios.

Good morning, Flint Lockwood
and lab partner.

170
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,704
I'm Barb.

171
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:41,172
Eeh! I know, I'm a huge fan.

172
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,154
Monkey.

173
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,164
Excuse me,

174
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:47,103
I'm an ape. One of Chester V's
most brilliant innovations.

175
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,661
An orangutan with a human brain

176
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,157
within my ape brain.

177
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,566
Like a turducken.

178
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,370
I'll be your welcome ambassador.
Soy latte?

179
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,494
Okay.

180
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,830
Coffee and milk?

181
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,958
Are you ready to live?

182
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,775
Oh, am I!

183
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:09,044
Monkey.

184
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,512
Ape. Follow me, boys.

185
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,000
Welcome to Live Corp.

186
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,803
Wow.

187
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:22,488
There are caffeine stations
every 10 feet.

188
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,771
Soy-free soy latte?

189
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,339
Thanks!

190
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,682
Hot.

191
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,202
Not too bad yourself, monkey.

192
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,590
Caffeine patches
are available 24 hours.

193
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,265
And our mocha-yoga classes are
offered in beginner or grande.

194
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,839
Over here, indoor sports.
Those are encouraged.

195
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,590
Oh, cool!
I've never played volleyball.

196
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,260
Well, neither have they.
You'll fit right in!

197
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,963
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

198
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:48,645
Behold, the motivation pod.

199
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:49,781
<i>Can your ideas...?</i>

200
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,205
I know, right?

201
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,741
Quinoa latte?

202
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,229
Absolutely! Ha, ha, ha!

203
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,518
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

204
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,792
Yes, Chester V poster,
they can!

205
00:09:58,793 --> 00:09:59,411
Mine too!

206
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:00,050
So can mine!

207
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:00,871
I have great ideas.

208
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:04,042
Absolutely!
I've got my idea pants on.

209
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:07,781
Thinkquanauts! Awesome!

210
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,351
Hey! Excuse me,

211
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,887
I'm so looking forward
to working with you guy...

212
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:13,626
Uh! Aww!

213
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,407
That's where we belong, Steve.

214
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,203
Anxious!

215
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,035
Oh, heh, heh.

216
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,920
That's not even a possibility
until our next vesting ceremony.

217
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,045
What's that?

218
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,297
That's where Chester V

219
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,210
handpicks a great inventor

220
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,846
and makes him
into a Thinkquanaut.

221
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:29,800
When? When?

222
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,922
Next one's in six months,
so submit your ideas

223
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,944
and who knows?
He might choose you.

224
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,427
Really?

225
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,664
Hot chocolate with
double-whipped whipped cream?

226
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,589
Thanks.

227
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,573
Happy inventing!

228
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,887
We're gonna have to get used
to that landing.

229
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,790
Okay, Steve, we have six months
until the vesting ceremony.

230
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,189
Let's do this thing.

231
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,375
Can.

232
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,229
That's the spirit, Steve!

233
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,783
<i>Say goodbye</i>

234
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:17,552
<i>to ice cubes
with the Re-Freeze-a-Fan!</i>

235
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:21,657
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

236
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,590
The Forkenknifenspooninator!

237
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,010
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

238
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,813
The Grocery Deliverator!

239
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:32,497
Whoa!

240
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,929
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

241
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,626
Invisible coffee table!

242
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,262
Ah! Flint.

243
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,154
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

244
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:43,767
Flint!

245
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,389
The Celebrationator!

246
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,299
A party in a box
for any occasion.

247
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,372
Okay, Steve, time to celebrate!

248
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:57,241
Celebrate!

249
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,830
Flint!

250
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,644
Happy birthday, Tim Lockwood!

251
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,567
Here you go, Dad.
Hope you like it.

252
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:04,877
Steve picked it out.

253
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,677
Steve!

254
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:19,223
Yeah. Yeah!

255
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:20,548
Okay, like we practiced.

256
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,121
When I'm up on stage
getting my vest,

257
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:25,007
you hit the red button
when I say "celebrate."

258
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,273
Celebrate!

259
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,544
Whoa. Careful, Steve!

260
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,780
This is a loaded
party-in-a-box.

261
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,930
Hello, Team Live Corp!

262
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,337
It's a pleasure to welcome you

263
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:38,362
to our annual Thinkquanaut
vesting ceremony!

264
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,332
Whoo! Chester V!
Ha, ha, ha.

265
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:45,289
I have built the coolest,
hippest company in the world.

266
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:47,258
As you all know,

267
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,760
the Food Bar is the lifeblood
of this company.

268
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,994
And this year,
I've challenged myself

269
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,627
to reinvent taste. Ooh.

270
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,772
So in two short weeks,

271
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,861
we shall release the new
Live Corp Food Bar!

272
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,364
Version 8.0!

273
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,060
Yes!

274
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,996
And now, without further ado,

275
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,869
who will be this year's

276
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,440
newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut?

277
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,190
Oh, ho, ho! Yeah!

278
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,761
We have received thousands
of invention submissions

279
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,913
and today, one of them
will be deemed

280
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,672
Thinkquanaut-worthy.

281
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,875
Thank you, Barb.

282
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,007
Whoo!

283
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,344
This person comes
from an island.

284
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,336
Ohh. Uh-huh!

285
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:33,409
He's got a memorable mop
of unruly hair.

286
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,695
Hair. Hair!

287
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:35,979
Ha, ha, ha! That's me!

288
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,946
Our newest Live Corp
Thinkquanaut is:

289
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:41,985
Flint...

290
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,554
Yeah!

291
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:44,723
Ly McCallahan!

292
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,825
No.

293
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,586
Crikey blikey! Yes!

294
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:50,051
For inventing
a zero-emission car

295
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,720
that runs on cute.

296
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,844
This is the
greatest day of my life!

297
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:01,401
Didgeridoo!
I'm finally a real inventor!

298
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,540
Sorry, Steve.
No reason to celebrate.

299
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,010
Celebrate!

300
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,678
Wait, Steve, no, no, no. No!

301
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,870
<i>♪ He's a real baboon ♪</i>

302
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:15,341
<i>♪ He's a real baboon ♪</i>

303
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,657

307
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,810
Hi, Sam, it's Flint.

308
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:57,260
I see you're live on TV
with a tornado.

309
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,230
Probably why you're not
answering the phone.

310
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,645
<i>Thinkquanaut? I think not.</i>

311
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:04,685
Ugh. Please call me back.

312
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:09,091
Okay. Bye!

313
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:18,543
Bad news!
Sir, we lost contact

314
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,326
with Search Teams X and Y.

315
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:20,888
What?

316
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:21,454
Yeah!

317
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,374
The situation is grim, sir.

318
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,486
Still no sign of the FLDSMDFR.

319
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,455
Should I send in Team Z?

320
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:30,096
Are you mad, Barb?
We'll be all out of alphabet.

321
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,233
Look, we're running low
on Thinkquanauts.

322
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:36,400
We need someone expendable.

323
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:39,633
Someone who knows the island
inside and out.

324
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:43,346
Someone who's smart,
but still naive.

325
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,840
Someone who idolizes me,

326
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,179
has recently hit rock bottom

327
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,218
and will now do
just about anything I ask.

328
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:55,424
Where are we gonna find
someone so desperate?

329
00:15:57,812 --> 00:16:00,947
I think we already have.

330
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,113
Sprinkles!

331
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,005
Fire!

332
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,853
Flint, who's number one? Oh.

333
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,166
Ta-da!

334
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,168
Hey, Flint, I got your message.

335
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,325
Oh, no, what happened to you?

336
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:35,448
Flint, everyone gets humiliated
on national television.

337
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:36,652
It's not that big a deal.

338
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:39,384
Yeah, but not everyone
gets humiliated

339
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,618
in front of
their childhood hero.

340
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,286
I'll never be a real inventor

341
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,393
in Chester's eyes.

342
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,029
Mom gave me this lab coat

343
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,091
because she always dreamed
I'd do great things.

344
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,531
Now I guess I won't.

345
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,575
Now that's a big bucket
of chum.

346
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,310
Flint, you don't need
Chester's approval.

347
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,870
You can still make
the world a better place

348
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:02,491
without an orange vest.

349
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,187
I don't get vests.

350
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:07,725
Is it winter on your torso
and summer on your arms?

351
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,245
For what it's worth,

352
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,175
the people who really
care about you

353
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:15,067
think you look great
in your lab coat.

354
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,238
Good night, Mr. Lockwood.

355
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,886
Good night, my dear.

356
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,398
Hey, look, son.

357
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,765
This Chester V guy.

358
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:28,804
He promised us we'd be home
before we know it. Well,

359
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,906
we darn sure know it
and we're not home.

360
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:36,927
So I say you,
me and your friends,

361
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,625
we take the boat.
We can go fishing every day.

362
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,530
And if there's still a mess
on the island,

363
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:43,041
we can go clean it up
ourselves.

364
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,017
Dad, please.
I'm not into fishing.

365
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:50,434
And cleanup? You're way too old
to be doing that kind of work.

366
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,027
I'm only 49.

367
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,885
Flint Lockwood, please.

368
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,547
Oh, Flint. Um...

369
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:08,324
There's, um... Could you
come to the door, please?

370
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:09,992
I think it's that monkey
in your poster.

371
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:12,675
What? No! Ahh!

372
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,212
Barb?

373
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:15,749
Shh.

374
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,436
<i>Good day.</i>

375
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,073
<i>I'm afraid I have something
very important</i>

376
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,822
<i>to discuss with you.</i>

377
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:24,224
<i>Live Corp.</i>

378
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:27,014
Chester V wants to see me?

379
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,350
Follow me.

380
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:36,555
Whoa.

381
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,296
Ah. Young Lockwood.

382
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,505
Chester V. Sir.

383
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,680
I can explain everything.

384
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,617
I thought I was gonna meet
the real Chester V.

385
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,785
You are.

386
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,769
Oh, not me. Him.

387
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,139
Yes, it's me.

388
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,034
Sorry about that.

389
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:01,419
My holograms and I were having
an urgent brainstorming session.

390
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,418
Aah! Mr. V! You're real!
I'm so excited

391
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,388
to get this opportunity
to show you my inventions.

392
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:11,045
Hold on. Hold on. That's not
why I brought you here tonight.

393
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,086
Our cleanup operation
back on Swallow Falls

394
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,132
has met with
unexpected complications.

395
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,501
This is a photograph

396
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:21,037
before we began our cleanup.

397
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,808
And this was three days ago.

398
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,342
It gets worse, Flint.

399
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:29,746
<i>There's only two of us left.
We need help.</i>

400
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:35,982
What is that thing?

401
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,105
Cheesy.

402
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,951
It appears to be
a living cheeseburger

403
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:43,440
with french fry legs
and sesame seed eyes.

404
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,008
Living food?

405
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,746
Oh, no. This could
only mean one thing.

406
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:50,736
The FLDSMDFR
survived the explosion,

407
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,978
and it's still operating.

408
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,149
This is what worries me most.

409
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,821
They're trying to learn
to swim.

410
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,481
If they succeed

411
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,970
and get to the mainland,

412
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:11,012
they will destroy monuments
all around the world,

413
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,366
including the one monument

414
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,741
your food storm didn't destroy.

415
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,083
Not Lady Liberty!

416
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,287
I've gotta destroy the FLDSMDFR.
But how?

417
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:22,101
Well, my Thinkquanauts
have invented this.

418
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:26,102
The BS-USB.
Or BSUSB.

419
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,340
A Bifurcating Systematic
Universal Stop Button!

420
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,118
Precisely. It would
destroy the machine

421
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,900
and everything it created.

422
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,238
But we cannot find
your FLDSMDFR.

423
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,741
We've searched everywhere
and failed.

424
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:44,077
Chester, I'll find the machine.
I invented it. I can fix this!

425
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,271
Brilliant!

426
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:48,067
But are you sure you want
to take this on alone?

427
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,794
Yes!
Wait, did you say "alone"?

428
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,225
Alone it is, then.

429
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:55,738
If you succeed, you'll be more
than just a Thinkquanaut.

430
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,081
You'll be my hero.

431
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,617
Your hero?

432
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,634
Yes, my hero.

433
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,710
Your mission
must be kept a secret.

434
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,216
We don't wanna create
a worldwide panic.

435
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:06,405
You mustn't tell anyone,

436
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:08,932
not even your closest friends
and family.

437
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,413
Sir, I won't tell a soul.

438
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,882
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam!

439
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,306
I gotta tell you a secret! Sam!

440
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,806
Big news. I'm going to Swallow
Falls to destroy the FLDSMDFR,

441
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,603
which is creating
deadly food monsters,

442
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:21,973
which are trying
to learn to swim

443
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:24,421
so they can attack
Lady Liberty!

444
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:26,717
Sam?

445
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,500
Wait, you're doing this alone?

446
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:30,325
Yeah. Please don't tell Dad.

447
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,405
If he finds out I'm going back
to Swallow Falls,

448
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,364
he's gonna wanna come too.

449
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,997
Well, I'm coming.

450
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:39,969
What? No! I promised Chester V
I would go alone.

451
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,627
There's no talking you
out of this?

452
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,169
Nope.

453
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,735
Wait.

454
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,582
Sam, it's gonna be
deadly dangerous

455
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,916
with a good chance of death.

456
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,507
And that's why we'll need help.

457
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,057
Triple decaf
mochaccino-boba-latte

458
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,479
with skim soy
and nutmeg sprinkle?

459
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,935
I'd like to order
something strong.

460
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,843
Wait your turn, fancy pants.

461
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,410
Flint Lockwood and Sam Sparks!

462
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:03,202
And Steve too!

463
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:04,188
Juicy!

464
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,172
Earl, we need your help.

465
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,561
Swallow Falls is overrun
with deadly food monsters.

466
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,339
Hey, where's my coffee?

467
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,668
Coffee? I'm not a barista,
I'm a polista!

468
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,482
Let's ride!

469
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,986
Can I come too, Dad?

470
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:21,860
Son, you are my beautiful,
precious little angel.

471
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:24,002
But I cannot let you
come with me.

472
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,444
Not until you get
your first chest hair.

473
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,291
I have chest hair.

474
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,181
It's just like mine.

475
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,420
Wait a minute.

476
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,470
That's not a chest hair.

477
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,697
That's cupcake frosting.

478
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:38,358
Tell your mom
I'm getting our home back.

479
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,693
What's up?

480
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,326
Sponge.

481
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,480
Forceps.

482
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:46,823
A swab.

483
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,031
Manny. We need your help.

484
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,233
I can drop everything.

485
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,602

Swallow Falls is in trouble.
Will you help us?

492
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,450
You bet I will.

493
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,201
I just need someone
to cover my shift.

494
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,122

<i>Okay, gang.</i>

We'll be traveling to the island
using my Grocery Deliverator!

497
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:33,057
All right,
who wants to go first?

498
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,316
Hungry.

499
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,173
Yes, Steve,

500
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,902
hungry for adventure.

501
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:40,073
See you on the island,
my brave lab partner.

502
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:41,133
Afraid!

503
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:43,408
It worked!

504
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,418
Banana! Banana! Banana!
Steve!

505
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,295
I guess it only works on food.
I gotta fix that.

506
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,548
Ahoy there, skipper, my boy.

507
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:56,423
Dad.

508
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,320
Mr. Lockwood?

509
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,505
Dad, no. How did
you know we were here?

510
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,277
I could see you
from the apartment.

511
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,433
Flint, if you're going home,
so am I.

512
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,003
The island's gonna be
very dangerous...

513
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:13,009
I was born on the island,
and I wanna die on that island,

514
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,545
just like your mom.

515
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:17,350
Besides, I know that place
like the inside of a tackle box.

516
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,251
I wanna help.

517
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:19,186
No!

518
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,205
Flint, let him help.

519
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,223
The man does have a boat.

520
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:23,508
Which is twice as many boats
as we have.

521
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,373
Fine.
But we'll get there faster

522
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:27,925
if we use
the Grocery Deliverator.

523
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:28,916
Steve!

524
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,087
Aah! Okay, okay,
we'll take the boat!

525
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:34,741

534
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,548
Okay, when we land
at Swallow Falls,

535
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,916
our first objective
is to get to my lab.

536
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,401
I can use my old computer

537
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,068
to pinpoint
the FLDSMDFR's location.

538
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:07,484
Once we find it,
we can shut it down

539
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,621
with the utterly
irreplaceable BS-USB.

540
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,740
What if you don't find it?

541
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:18,778
I have to.
It's my machine.

542
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,616
If the world gets destroyed
by these, it's my fault.

543
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:23,578
I can't let that happen.

544
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,699
Land ho!

545
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,100
Land ho!

546
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,669
If we work together,
this should be easy as...

547
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,725
Pie.

548
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:36,636
Oh, no! We're...

549
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,724
Toast!

550
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,228
French toast!

551
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:40,481
This is totally...

552
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,661
Bananas!

553
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:45,132
I was gonna say "nuts,"
but now I'm afraid to.

554
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,424
Uh-oh.

555
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,320
Whoa, whoa!

556
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:23,532
Home!

557
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,509
No! Steve, wait!

558
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,687
The jungle's no place
for a monkey.

559
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,700
Home, home, home!

560
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,536
Manny, are you getting this?

561
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:32,511
I certainly am.

562
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:33,475
Flint.

563
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,781
Look! The climate
has shifted dramatically

564
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:37,986
to allow this much vegetation
to grow!

565
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,550
Aah! Sam! Ratbirds!

566
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,697
Okay, then. All ashore
that's going ashore.

567
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,122
Dad, this place
is really dangerous.

568
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,890
I'd feel better
if you stayed here on the boat

569
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:57,990
where it's safe.

570
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,680
Safe? I wanna help.

571
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:04,418
I'd never forgive myself if you
got eaten by a cheespider.

572
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,248
He's right, Tim Lockwood.

573
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,719
Don't worry,
we'll get your home back.

574
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,463
Well, fine.

575
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,489
Thanks, Dad.

576
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,850
We'll try to be back
before suppertime, okay?

577
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,121
Sure.

578
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,709
Whoa. Look what's happened
to our town.

579
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:44,717
Look. There's my angel son
Cal's old preschool.

580
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,577
My old van.

581
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:56,432
Look! An old thing
that I've never seen before!

582
00:27:57,872 --> 00:28:02,010
That's where the Thinkquanauts
were attacked by a cheespider.

583
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,268
It's like a cheesy spider web,

584
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,849
made of cheese.
Let's get out of here!

585
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,887
No, wait. What if there's
a survivor in there?

586
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,680
Stand back, everybody.

587
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,657
I'm gonna cut the cheese.

588
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:22,316
Uh... That was the cheese.

589
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:26,769
Hello? Anybody in here?

590
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:33,812
Shh!

591
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,380
Sorry.

592
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,285
Ha!

593
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,653
Wow.

594
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,524
That is the biggest strawberry
I've ever seen in my life.

595
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,008
Is it heavy?

596
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,528
Yeah. But other than that

597
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,348
it looks
like a perfectly normal,

598
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,607
fresh, delicious strawberry.

599
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,152
N-woo?

600
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,385
N-woo?

601
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,593
It's moving!

602
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,898
Heh, heh.
Oh, that was a close one.

603
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,135
You got a little someone
stuck to your pants.

604
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,273
Ah! Get it off! Get it off me!
Sam! Sam!

605
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,775
Hey, wait, wait. Stop!

606
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:30,426
Sam, don't touch it!
Put it down! Put it down!

607
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:31,611
Look at him.

608
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,306
Seriously?

609
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:43,804
Aww. I think
I'll name him Barry!

610
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:46,698
Okay, Sam, could you please
put "Barry" down?

611
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,761
Look, we have to get
to the FLDSMDFR

612
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,221
so we can shut it down

613
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,909
with this utterly irreplaceable
BS-USB.

614
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,973
Hey! That's not for you!

615
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:57,086
I need that. Please?

616
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,856
That BS-USB
is really important.

617
00:29:58,857 --> 00:29:59,934
N-woo?

618
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:00,936
N-woo. Yes.

619
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:01,887
N-woo?

620
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:05,025
Hi, N-woo. Hey, you wanna
hand it to me, buddy?

621
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:05,528
I beg you.

622
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,110
Huh?

623
00:30:06,111 --> 00:30:07,163
Please?

624
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,160
Oh, oh.

625
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,312
Please?

626
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,399
N-woo.

627
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,870
N-woo, N-woo. Yes. Yes.
There you go.

628
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,338
No!

629
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,395
Don't let him get away!

630
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:28,064
Stop! Stop!

631
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,166
Gotcha.

632
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,210
N-woo?

633
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,156
Aah! Here, you take it,
you take it.

634
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:36,069
You're gonna have to carry him
until he passes the BS-USB.

635
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,466
And by "pass," you mean...

636
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,445
Yes. Look,
we better get a move on

637
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,790
before we run into any more
of these creatures.

638
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:16,328
Oh! It's so beautiful.

639
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,888
It's enough
to make a grown man cry.

640
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,199
But not this man.

641
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,368
Get back in there, tear.

642
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,939
Wow, I can't believe
the FLDSMDFR created

643
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,703
all of this.

644
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,370
Ah! Where's Barry?

645
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,322
Whee. Ha, ha, ha!

646
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:34,108
Uh-oh.

647
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,092
Ah! Ah!

648
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,664
Just a little bit closer.
I can get him.

649
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,896
Come on, Earl, faster.

650
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,377
Look at the mangos.

651
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,788
You mean flamingos.

652
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,003
Flamangos!

653
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,539
There's a bunch of shrimp!

654
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,378
They look like chimpanzees.

655
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,151
Shrimpanzees!

656
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:49,951
Shrimpanzees!

657
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,140
Those are some
tasty-looking jellyfish!

658
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:53,645
Oh!
What's that one over there?

659
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:54,932
That's just a tomato.

660
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,358
Barry!

661
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,605
Come on!

662
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,375
Chester gave me that BS-USB.

663
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,317
It's really important.

664
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:03,220
Shrimpanzee.

665
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,078
Steve.

666
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,646
Shrimpanzee.

667
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:05,197
Steve.

668
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:06,233
Shrimpanzee.

669
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,215
Shove.

670
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,558
Steve.

671
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,844
There's a leek in the boat!

672
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,975
Hold on, everyone.

673
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:15,311
This ain't gonna be no picnic.

674
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:17,519
Stop! Get back here!

675
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,175
Keep it steady, Earl.

676
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:21,936
Watermelophants!

677
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,974
Barry, grab my hand!

678
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,766
Barry!

679
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,456
Freeze, berry man.

680
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:44,795
Thanks, Earl. Ugh.

681
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,068
Okay, come here.

682
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,267
You have caused enough trouble
for one day.

683
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,336
Susheep!

684
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,377
Cantalopes.

685
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,228
I can't believe your machine

686
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,706
reprogrammed itself to create

687
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,941
this entire ecosystem
of living food.

688
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,565
How is that even possible?

689
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:01,908
I have no idea.

690
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:03,560
Best we don't think about it.

691
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,444
The world should know
about this.

692
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:09,045
Manny, is your camera
still working?

693
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:12,168
<i>Of course. I've been
rolling since we landed.</i>

694
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,888
So much for keeping this
a secret.

695
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:17,560
We can't let these friends
tell the world anything.

696
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,671
What we need to do is go there

697
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:22,076
and separate Flint
from his friends

698
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,078
so we can manage the situation.

699
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,775
Champion!

700
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:25,526
Brilliant idea.

701
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:26,449
Way to go, Chester.

702
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,352
Thank you.

703
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,322
Barb, you take care
of that weather girl.

704
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:32,344
But, sir, I'm a scientist.

705
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,616
That's why I need you.

706
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,763
I want the same brilliant mind

707
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,833
that solved
the unified field theory

708
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,595
to help me help Live Corp.

709
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:42,998
Consider it done, sir.

710
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,122
Good monkey.

711
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,693
To the Helpicopter.

712
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,963
Oh, Earl.

713
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:50,700
Pull over there.

714
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:51,420
Duck!

715
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:54,724
Duck? I love... Ba-gawk! Ah!

716
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,797
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

717
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:06,612
You guys, that wasn't so bad.

718
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,093
Yeah, well, be thankful
we didn't run into a...

719
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,686
Cheespider!

720
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,736
Run!

721
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,552
Cheesy. Cheesy. Cheesy.

722
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,388
Manny!

723
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,394
Wait for me!

724
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,091
Ba-gawk-oh!

725
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:43,118
I'm glad you still wearing
that diaper.

726
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,611
I wish I brought a fresh one!

727
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,307
Hey, guys! Down this alley!

728
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:52,227
Oh, no! Dead end.

729
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,953
Ghost man?

730
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,790
<i>Greetings, and namaste.</i>

731
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,827
Chester V! You're here!

732
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,796
That's right, young Lockwood.

733
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,902
And by the looks of things,
just in time.

734
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:28,254
One minute later, and we would
have been food for that food.

735
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:29,523
Flint, I thought you said

736
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:32,405
you were going to complete
this mission alone.

737
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:33,530
Can I say something?

738
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,984
Apparently you can.

739
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:36,820
This is Barb, my number two.

740
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:38,759
Why are you carrying

741
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,185
a strawberry
in your backpack, miss?

742
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:43,626
Stand back, everyone!

743
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:45,728
Hey, hey, hey, stop.
You're scaring him.

744
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,594
Scaring him?
Oh, please,

745
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:50,538
it's probably
got a mouth full of fangs.

746
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,291
Now you're scaring me.

747
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,362
I've been carrying him
and he hasn't hurt anyone.

748
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,084
I'm sorry.
Are you a scientist?

749
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:00,203
Matter of fact, I am.

750
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:01,320
She's a meteorologist.

751
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:03,405
Meteorology.
Oh, I love it.

752
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,199
The science of smiling
and having pretty hair

753
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,659
while you point at a map.

754
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:07,630
It's a very important job...

755
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,613
Meteorology is

756
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,366
a comprehensive analysis...

757
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,005
Ladies, ladies. Please.

758
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,134
I'm sure we can all agree
that one of you is a scientist.

759
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,439
Young Lockwood,

760
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,417
why was your lady friend
carrying this rabid

761
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:23,400
little strawberry
in her backpack?

762
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,811
Why is the strawberry guy
in the backpack?

763
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,812
Well, um, that's funny.
Um... It's...

764
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,130
Uh... You know
what he did? Um...

765
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:35,408
He, uh...
He ate the BS-USB.

766
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,879
Not the BSUSB.

767
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,099
I'm on it.

768
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,284
She's got a knife!

769
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,423
If you touch a leaf
on his head...

770
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:42,828
Step away
from the berry, madam.

771
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,539
That orange hairy lady
scared the jam out of him!

772
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,510
N-woo?

773
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,985
Oh, no, it's jammed.

774
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,121
Lick. Lick. Lick.

775
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:54,255
Oh, thanks, Steve.

776
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,570
Young Lockwood.

777
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:57,140
The world could've
been destroyed

778
00:36:57,141 --> 00:37:00,692
because of the actions
of one sinister strawberry.

779
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:03,924
We cannot allow any more
mistakes like this.

780
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,427
Oh...

781
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:08,333
It won't be long before
those malicious melons,

782
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,613
pernicious pickles,

783
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:12,166
and belligerent burgers
learn to swim

784
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,351
and make their way
to the mainland.

785
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:17,653
What is your plan?

786
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,254
I need to get back to my lab
so I can

787
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:22,084
make contact with the FLDSMDFR.

788
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:22,973
Brilliant!

789
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,108
I'll lead the way.

790
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,214
No, we'll lead the way.

791
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,451
Safe, safe, safe.

792
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:32,247
I believe
my Sentinels of Safety

793
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:36,153
are better equipped to lead us
in their robo-suits.

794
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,027
N-woo?

795
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:47,930
"I'll be back before supper."

796
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,581
What a bunch of baloney.

797
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:52,390
Just leave me on the boat
without any food.

798
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:55,451
I know a place where
I can get something to eat.

799
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:58,074
There she is.
Home sweet home.

800
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:09,819
What?

801
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,591
There's no sardines?
Had to be looters.

802
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,662
Ah.
Vintage Baby Brent.

803
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,476
Ah.

804
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:34,698
Oh, chum.

805
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:45,196
No, no!

806
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:51,074
Uh-huh. Yeah. Heh.

807
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,051
I like them too. I do.
I love them.

808
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:55,586
Mine. No, no. Mine.

809
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:57,186
Off. Off. Mine.

810
00:38:57,187 --> 00:39:00,657
No, no, mine. Mine. Off.

811
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:10,278
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, you guys.
Come on, you could lose an eye.

812
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,817
Look, I tell you what.
You want more sardines?

813
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,953
I can get you more sardines.

814
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:26,390
Hey, thanks for loaning me
these skinny jeans, Flint.

815
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:27,481
Those aren't skinny jeans.

816
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,614
Nope.

817
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,783
My feet are turning purple.
Is that bad?

818
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,283
Uh-oh.

819
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,640
Bananostrich! Ah!

820
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:44,648
Go, go, go! Come on, Brent!

821
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,952
Banana! Banana! Banana!

822
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:53,704
That bunch of bananostriches
nearly split us.

823
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,645
Are you okay?

824
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,422
Oh, my gosh.

825
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:02,410
My house!

826
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,983
Home, home, home!

827
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,987
Oh, my gosh.

828
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,790
Your lab!

829
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:15,660
Oh, crap balls.

830
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:18,162
We can't go up there,
Flint Lockwood.

831
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:20,332
That dangly, upsy-downsy lab's
not to code.

832
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,344
I've got to, if I'm gonna find
the FLDSMDFR.

833
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:24,525
We can do it.
Those load-bearing vines

834
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:25,996
will be able to support
a small team.

835
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:27,758
Onwards and upwards!

836
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,606
Right, sir. To the lab!

837
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,767
Sentinels, keep the locals safe.

838
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,176
I'll keep them safe.

839
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,679
Hey, guys! Where you going?
Guys! Hey,

840
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
wait for me!

841
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,959
Uh-oh.

842
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,196
A little help?

843
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,618
STEVE Spooky.

844
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,054
Spooky is right, Steve.

845
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:01,618
I say,

846
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,715
this laboratory of yours
is a wonder of engineering.

847
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,123
Really?

848
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,468
Thank you, sir.

849
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,704
Initiating backup power.

850
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:15,476
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>

851
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,180
Whoa, my computer's dead.

852
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:20,246
The fate of the world
is depending on us.

853
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,620
Think, Lockwood.

854
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:23,700
Well, if I could pull

855
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,804
the hard drive, there's enough
equipment in this lab

856
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,254
that I could build
a tracking device.

857
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:28,867
Whoa!

858
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:29,526
Flint!

859
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,734
I say, young Lockwood,

860
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:34,390
what extraordinary underpants.

861
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,327
Thank you, sir. They're
my wedgie-proof underwear.

862
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,379
I invented them when I was 6.

863
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,296
I had no idea we were so alike.

864
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:44,247
Except I invented mine

865
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,071
when I was 3.

866
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:49,113
You guys have been wearing
the same underwear

867
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:50,648
since you were kids?

868
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:51,217
Yes!

869
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:51,769
Yes!

870
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,240
Excuse me.

871
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,444
How do you expect us
to get the hard drive

872
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:58,423
with all that
electrified water?

873
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,811
We dangle!

874
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,248
Come, Lockwood, give the monkey
your underpants.

875
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,099
What?

876
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,843
Lay on, young Lockwood.

877
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,187
Whoa!

878
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:18,591
Whoa!

879
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:21,115
Yes! Heh, heh.

880
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,654
Whoa!

881
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:25,905
You know, hanging from
my underpants in this space

882
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:27,789
brings back so many memories.

883
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,269
I too built my lab up high

884
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,124
to keep the bullies out!

885
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,470
You were...

886
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,333
You were bullied too?

887
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:39,703
Absolutely.

888
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,662
People like us

889
00:42:41,663 --> 00:42:43,519
are always bullied.

890
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,789
Sometimes I wish I'd kept
my bullies around.

891
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,103
Really?

892
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:49,311
So I could crush them
with my success.

893
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:51,450
Just like you did
with that man-baby.

894
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:52,961
You mean Brent?

895
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:55,831
Sure, he used to be a bully,
but he's my friend now.

896
00:42:55,832 --> 00:42:59,746
Friend? A bully can
never be your friend.

897
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,548
Never?

898
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:01,313
Remember

899
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:03,682
the ancient Chinese proverb:

900
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,258
Huh?

901
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,491
"Stew offered by a bully
is poisoned broth."

902
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:12,898
Wow, stew.

903
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,756
I have so much to learn.

904
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:17,058
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

905
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:21,732
Mission accomplished!

906
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:25,444
Indeed, young Lockwood.
Indeed.

907
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,636
Help!

908
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,059
Help! Come on, guys.
Get me ou...!

909
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,302
You okay, Earl?

910
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:41,967
My chest hairs
have been tingling all day.

911
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:43,996
Don't worry.
Live Corp Sentinels

912
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:47,947
have danger-sensing fibers
built into their chest plates.

913
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:49,511
Bravo, Lockwood.

914
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:51,781
With luck,
we'll survive the night.

915
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:07,755
Hm. Sounds
like midnight snacks.

916
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:10,504
Dr. Manny!
This is delicious!

917
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,682
I call it Manny's Gorilla Stew.

918
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,628
So how do you make
a gorilla stew?

919
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:16,873
You keep it waiting
for two hours.

920
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,295
Hey, guys.
Oh, that smells good.

921
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:21,744
Hey, Flint! Wanna try
some of this special stew?

922
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:25,547
I saved you a bowl.
It's killer.

923
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:27,916
Killer stew.

924
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,988
No!

925
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:35,725
Thank you,

926
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:37,903
Brent.

927
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:39,672
Ever since that ghost man
showed up,

928
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:39,630
Flint Lockwood's been acting...

929
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,902
Jerky.

930
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:43,407
He rejected my stew.

931
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:46,031
No one has ever
rejected my stew.

932
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:49,203
I'm gonna go talk to him.

933
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,421
Flint, wait up.

934
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,431
Yeah, Sam?

935
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,064
Is something wrong?

936
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:55,333
Yeah, we blew a fuse.

937
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,040
You blew a fuse.

938
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:59,640
Why are you being so weird
to your friends?

939
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,436
What?
I haven't been weird.

940
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,441
You karate-chopped

941
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:06,225
Manny's stew
out of Brent's hands.

942
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:07,713
You hurt their feelings.

943
00:45:07,714 --> 00:45:09,634
Sam, you wouldn't understand.

944
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,322
I do understand,

945
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:15,792
but you're forgetting that:

946
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,352
Huh?

947
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:22,620
"A bully turned friend

948
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:25,044
will be friend to the end."

949
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:28,660
Listen, Brent came here
to help you.

950
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:29,845
We all did.

951
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,981
And you're acting like
we're just in your way.

952
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:40,757
Remember, we work together.

953
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,318
That weather girl
is ruining our plan.

954
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,930
I just need more time, sir.

955
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,563
We don't have more time.

956
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:58,339
If we don't get the FLDSMDFR
in the next 48 hours,

957
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,484
we'll miss our deadline
to release Food Bar 8.0.

958
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:02,869
I'll be a laughingstock!

959
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,015
Sir, let me handle this.

960
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:08,280
Never send a monkey
to do Chester work.

961
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,201
I'll take care of it.

962
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,635
Okay, guys, we're here.
Hey, hey, hey!

963
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:23,100
That is not for you.

964
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,603
All right, let's get to it.

965
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,813
Okay.
You got this, right?

966
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:36,799
Okay. Then you wanna put one
of these on there, like that.

967
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,440
No, no, no.
No, don't eat that.

968
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,359
That's bad.
You'll hurt yourself.

969
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,162
Hey, hey, easy! Stop picking
on your brother, will you?

970
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:47,588
How would you like it
if he was shoving you?

971
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:49,022
Okay, now watch.

972
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:52,766
Are you watching?
One and two and three!

973
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,137
Catch the big one!

974
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,743
Yeah, good, huh?

975
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:01,012
It's called fishing.

976
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,233
♪ Out on my boat ♪

977
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:13,537

♪ That's my crazy world ♪

984
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,603
I tell you, if only Flint liked
fishing as much as you guys.

985
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:37,462
Why am I talking to a pickle?

986
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:44,610
Dangerous food creatures
detected.

987
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,854
Stay put.
We'll find and destroy them.

988
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,366
Barry!

989
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:52,970
You can't be here.

990
00:47:54,215 --> 00:47:55,622
You better hide him.

991
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,647
Okay, gang! Today's the day
we find the FLDSMDFR.

992
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:01,603
Sam, I was thinking about
what you said last night...

993
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:02,920
N-woo?

994
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,972
What?

995
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:04,967
Me too.

996
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:07,817
Right. Listen, I have
been acting weird,

997
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,887
but it's only because
I'm under a lot of pressure.

998
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:10,417
N-woo?

999
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:10,984
What?

1000
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,456
So true!

1001
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,426
But I'm also doing this for us.

1002
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:18,666
You see, I still want Sparkswood
to happen, but it can't.

1003
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,265
Not until I become
a great inventor like Chester V.

1004
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,462
Flint, you don't have
to prove anything...

1005
00:48:23,463 --> 00:48:26,955
Ha, ha. Lockwood!
How goes the inventing?

1006
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:30,012
Very good, sir. I was
up all night making this.

1007
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:32,596
I call it the Flint Lockwood
Food Jungle

1008
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:34,592
Topographical Pointing Machine.

1009
00:48:34,593 --> 00:48:35,741
Or...

1010
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:36,910
The FLFJTPM! Brilliant!

1011
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,071
Oh, thank you, sir.

1012
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:39,764
Follow the beam,
find the machine.

1013
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,649
All I have to do now
is cut the leg holes.

1014
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,421
Ooh.

1015
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,669
Huh. Well,

1016
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,909
maybe it's better

1017
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,542
here.

1018
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:51,867
Great idea, Sam.

1019
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,423
And, guys,
you can help me by...

1020
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:54,831
Excuse us.

1021
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,933
Your friends are distracting
you from our mission.

1022
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,298
Distracting?

1023
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:02,557
My chest hairs just
don't trust that Chester.

1024
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:04,747
We should be hunting
the FLDSMDFR, not chitchatting.

1025
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:06,041
But, sir, I...

1026
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,353
You're heading into the deepest,

1027
00:49:07,354 --> 00:49:08,847
darkest part of the jungle.

1028
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,552
You need to focus
on saving the world.

1029
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:16,391
Be a hero.

1030
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:18,767
Okay. You're right, sir.

1031
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:21,976
Excellent! Let's go!

1032
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,962
Okay, Barry,
time to go home now.

1033
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:29,458
Okay. Okay.
Okay, one more hug, Barry.

1034
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:30,612
Barry?

1035
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:32,657
Right! Barry.

1036
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,110
You Barry.

1037
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:35,475
Barry.

1038
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:38,836
And I'm Sam Sparks.

1039
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:40,846
Saspa.

1040
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:41,447
Right! Sam...

1041
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,431
Come on, Sam!

1042
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:43,380
Coming!

1043
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:46,581
Okay, Barry,
time to go home now. Now go.

1044
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:47,926
Now you go on home.

1045
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,814
Buh.

1046
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:51,183
Bye.

1047
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,470
Huh?

1048
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:57,495
Saspa?

I got this, bro!

1062
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,503
I'm okay!

1063
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:12,446
Up there! Hurry, Sam!

1064
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:19,913
Barb!

1065
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,072
You okay?

1066
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:30,756
Uh-huh.

1067
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,379
Freeze!

1068
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:41,415
Come on, let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1069
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:45,194
Bravo, young Lockwood, bravo!

1070
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:09,606
A mother?

1071
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:11,109
Sam!

1072
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,389
Saspa!

1073
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,859
Butter.

1074
00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:23,560
Parkay.

1075
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:26,088
Almost there.

1076
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:28,592
The FLDSMDFR should be
just across this syrup bog.

1077
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:32,587
This is syrup?
Syrup is my favorite.

1078
00:52:32,588 --> 00:52:34,762
Darn mosquitoasts!

1079
00:52:34,763 --> 00:52:36,972
Don't worry, man-baby.

1080
00:52:36,973 --> 00:52:40,076
They, like all the other
abominable food monsters

1081
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,771
will soon be no more.

1082
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,180
Wait, Flint!

1083
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:46,220
What if we're making
a big mistake?

1084
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:47,692
Mistake?

1085
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:49,964
About shutting off
the FLDSMDFR.

1086
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:53,259
Some of these creatures,
they're incredible.

1087
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,893
Incredibly dangerous.

1088
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:56,838
We were just attacked
by a giant tacodile.

1089
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,001
He's right, Sam. I mean, we were
almost eaten by a cheespider.

1090
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:02,920
It doesn't mean we have
to destroy all of them.

1091
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:05,854
Some of the food's
actually been friendly.

1092
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:09,343
It is true. The dessert
creatures are especially sweet.

1093
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:12,015
Okay. Maybe we... Ah!

1094
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,959
Mosquitoast!
Was gonna bite you.

1095
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,494
See? Even the tiniest creatures
are attacking us.

1096
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,859
The only reason they're biting
is because of the drop

1097
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,587
in barometric pressure.
Bugs do that before a storm.

1098
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:24,481
And by the look
of those nimbostratus clouds...

1099
00:53:25,905 --> 00:53:28,008
Miss Sparks, we are
not talking about the weather.

1100
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:30,642
We are talking about food here.

1101
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:34,483
Dangerous food that does not
have human emotion.

1102
00:53:34,484 --> 00:53:36,529
Food that is not friendly.

1103
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,155
Food that cannot love!

1104
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:42,193
Flint, we should be
studying the food animals,

1105
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:43,634
not killing them.

1106
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:45,266
What if he's wrong?

1107
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:48,082
The choice is yours, son.

1108
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,886
Live up to your full potential,

1109
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:52,659
or walk away
and let the food monsters

1110
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,397
destroy Lady Liberty.

1111
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,643
Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR

1112
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,502
and saving the world,

1113
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,940
that's what matters.

1114
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:04,854
Really?
Our opinion doesn't matter?

1115
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:06,167
Of course it does!

1116
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:08,214
Yes! Yes, it matters.

1117
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,647
But just not right now.

1118
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,699
Uh-oh.

1119
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,695
Wrong answer.

1120
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:13,347
Toast.

1121
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:13,975
Yeah?

1122
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:16,679
Well, I guess
this doesn't matter either,

1123
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,670
young Lockwood.

1124
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,781
I'll just
see you back on the boat.

1125
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,585
Wait! Sam!

1126
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:27,992
Wait, please!

1127
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:30,392
No! No. Sam! Come back!

1128
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,217
Come back, Sam, no!

1129
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:33,913
No, Sam!

1130
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:36,088
Sam! Sam!

1131
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:36,589
Sam!

1132
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:45,824
Hey, Earl,
would you talk to her?

1133
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,163
You bet I will.

1134
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,699
Hey, Sam! Wait for me!

1135
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,075
<i>Adiós. Sayonara.</i>

1136
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,804
Goodbye, Señor Lockwood.

1137
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,117
Bye, Flint.

1138
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:54,953
Steve!

1139
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,244
<i>Et tu, Steve?</i>

1140
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:04,889
Oh. What just happened?

1141
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,767
You've made
the right choice, son.

1142
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:11,715
Sentinels! Keep them safe.

1143
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,122
Butter.

1144
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:22,975
Ah, Young Lockwood,

1145
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:26,078
we're getting close.
I feel it in my beard!

1146
00:55:33,282 --> 00:55:35,184
Water goes in the top

1147
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:37,952
and food comes out the bottom.

1148
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:39,989
It's gotta be inside that
big rock candy mountain!

1149
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,393
This is exactly why I wanted
you on this mission.

1150
00:55:43,394 --> 00:55:46,064
Sally forth, Lockwood.

1151
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,430
I can't believe Flint is
still listening to that guy!

1152
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:55,248
Flint is naive. It appears
he is being manipulated

1153
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:56,841
for some nefarious purpose.

1154
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:58,787
Of course he is!

1155
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,260
Sam! Freeze!

1156
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:01,061
What?

1157
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:04,324
Stay calm and walk toward me

1158
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:06,437
slowly.

1159
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,765
Very slowly.

1160
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,933
Oh, come on.
Now you're acting weird.

1161
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,103
I'm in no mood for this.

1162
00:56:21,384 --> 00:56:23,253
Stop right there,
cheese monster!

1163
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,928
Nobody eats my friends
on my watch!

1164
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:33,124
No, wait!
Chester's been lying to us

1165
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,266
about these creatures,
and I am going to prove it.

1166
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,162
Sam, don't do it!

1167
00:56:37,163 --> 00:56:39,732
It's foodicide!

1168
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:43,306
Danger! Danger! Danger!

1169
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:44,910
Nice cheespider.

1170
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:50,922
Ohh. Ugh.

1171
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:51,674
Yellow.

1172
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,395
Dude!

1173
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:55,052
You got special-sauced!

1174
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:59,148
It's okay, guys. See?

1175
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,930
She's not mean. She's just

1176
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,643
a little beefy.

1177
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:08,205
Whoa. What's it doing?

1178
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:10,609
I think she wants you
to scratch her buns.

1179
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,428
Aw. I like that too.

1180
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,478
Who's a good cheespider?

1181
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:15,918
She's cute!

1182
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:17,521
But why did she attack us
before?

1183
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:21,156
Because we were dressed
like them.

1184
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:23,605
She doesn't like backpacks?

1185
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,702
No. It appears
she doesn't like Live Corp.

1186
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:29,295
The food creatures
know something

1187
00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:31,696
we do not.

1188
00:57:31,697 --> 00:57:33,132
Gasp!

1189
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,481
Who's Evel?

1190
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:36,624
Not "Evel." Evil.

1191
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,986
I knew it! Chester's
up to something terrible.

1192
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,205
We have to warn Flint!

1193
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,353
Let's ride!

1194
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:44,081
Run!

1195
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,882
You're not warning
anyone about anything.

1196
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,507
Oh, crap balls.

1197
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,845
Magnificent.

1198
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,672
The FLDSMDFR must be up there.

1199
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:30,379
A very unpleasant fall.

1200
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:33,912
Finish the job, Lockwood.

1201
00:58:33,913 --> 00:58:35,815
Yes, sir.

1202
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:39,719
Whoa. Ahh!

1203
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,488
Whoa! Oh!

1204
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:01,007
Made it!

1205
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:11,265
FLDSMDFR.

1206
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:19,038
Look, I'm sorry
I have to do this to you...

1207
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:19,901
again.

1208
00:59:19,902 --> 00:59:21,904
But I can't let
your swimming cheespiders

1209
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,726
destroy Lady Liberty
or the world.

1210
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:33,448
Whoa.

1211
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:37,056
<i>Marshmallow.</i>

1212
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:58,842
They're like a family.

1213
01:00:08,388 --> 01:00:10,245
Sam was right.

1214
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,982
This is a mistake.

1215
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:25,639
Oh, dear!

1216
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,642
Sir! Uh, sir?

1217
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:27,591
There it is.

1218
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:28,760
Wait.

1219
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:29,928
In all its glory.

1220
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:32,838
Chester, look, I can't do this.

1221
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:34,058
Oh, okay. I will.

1222
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,207
What? Wait.

1223
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,510
Chester, wait.
We can't destroy it.

1224
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:38,967
Ah!

1225
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,438
Let go of me, Lockwood.

1226
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:42,694
No, sir,
I can't let you do this.

1227
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,650
No! No! No!

1228
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:58,672
<i>Live Corp.</i>

1229
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:01,770
The BS-USB
reprogrammed it?

1230
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:03,939
It was never gonna
turn off the machine.

1231
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,435
A BS-USB? Hello.

1232
01:01:07,436 --> 01:01:10,763
Your machine is what
I wanted all along.

1233
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:13,613
You lied to me.

1234
01:01:13,614 --> 01:01:15,373
Of course I lied to you.

1235
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:18,578
I knew you'd eventually fall
for these pathetic creatures.

1236
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:21,036
But you were my idol.

1237
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:23,629
My whole life,
I looked up to you.

1238
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,454
I wanted to be you!

1239
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:28,462
Oh, Lockwood.
I was just using you

1240
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,866
to get your invention.

1241
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:31,213
We're ready.

1242
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:33,483
Launch Operation
Slice and Dice.

1243
01:01:43,024 --> 01:01:45,360
And now that I've got
what I want,

1244
01:01:45,361 --> 01:01:46,784
I no longer need you.

1245
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,648
I'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

1246
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:51,050
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, please.

1247
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,292
Whoa.

1248
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,955
That's not natural.

1249
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:12,948
No, no, no.

1250
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:15,507
Easy, easy, you guys.
Don't cry.

1251
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,770
Huh?

1252
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:01,683
Okay, Steve.
If me and you put

1253
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,094
our two brilliant minds
together,

1254
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,921
we will get out of here.

1255
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:05,907
Steve?

1256
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:06,867
Brent, do you ever get

1257
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:10,346
the feeling that maybe
Steve Lockwood is just a monkey?

1258
01:03:10,347 --> 01:03:13,073
Why would you say that
about him, Earl?

1259
01:03:13,074 --> 01:03:15,451
Why would you ever say that?

1260
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:19,356
Of course he's just a monkey.
How stupid are you people?

1261
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:22,908
No one should ever put
any trust in a monkey.

1262
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:24,945
Chester thinks you're a monkey.

1263
01:03:24,946 --> 01:03:27,868
Well, I'm an ape.
Chester knows that.

1264
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,852
But he calls you a monkey.

1265
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,677
Ooh!

1266
01:03:31,678 --> 01:03:32,879
It is true, he does.

1267
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,749
He's just joking around.

1268
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,278
Chester's my best friend.

1269
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:41,023
If Chester
was really your friend,

1270
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:43,358
would he still call you
a monkey?

1271
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:09,057
N-woo! N-woo!

1272
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,178
Flint.

1273
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:25,572
Dad.

1274
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:29,029
What's happening, son?
You look terrible.

1275
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,665
What's with all of them?

1276
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,500
They saved my life.

1277
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,256
I let Chester steal the machine

1278
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:38,009
and now he's starting
Operation Slice and Dice.

1279
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,408
Come on, son. You're really
not making any sense.

1280
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:44,456
Look, Chester's gonna wipe out
all the foodimals.

1281
01:04:45,671 --> 01:04:48,107
My friends tried to
tell me they were good,

1282
01:04:48,108 --> 01:04:49,364
but I didn't listen.

1283
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:51,722
Everything I touch
just gets ruined.

1284
01:04:51,723 --> 01:04:53,223
N-woo!

1285
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,792
Barry?

1286
01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:56,425
N-woo!

1287
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,656
Barry. I'm so sorry
I misjudged you.

1288
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:01,092
I should have listened to Sam.

1289
01:05:01,093 --> 01:05:02,504
Saspa. Sam.

1290
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:05,008
What is it?
What are you trying to say?

1291
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,737
Saspa, Saspa.

1292
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,170
Sa... Saspa.

1293
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,089
Sassy pants.

1294
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:13,962
Dad.

1295
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:15,114
Saspa, Saspa!

1296
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:16,554
Sam and the gang?

1297
01:05:16,555 --> 01:05:18,523
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1298
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,453
It looks like
a Sentinel of Safety.

1299
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:27,885
Aha! Sassy pants.

1300
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,421
Sassy pants? No, Dad.

1301
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:31,824
He's saying Sentinels captured
Sam and the gang.

1302
01:05:36,143 --> 01:05:38,186
And they're being held
in the factory?

1303
01:05:38,187 --> 01:05:39,662
We gotta get them out of there.

1304
01:05:39,663 --> 01:05:43,759
But how?
There's just two of us.

1305
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,231
N-woo!

1306
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:58,672
N-woo!

1307
01:05:58,673 --> 01:06:00,113
N-woo! N-woo!

1308
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:01,733
N-woo!

1309
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:03,247
N-woo!

1310
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:03,748
N-woo!

1311
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:09,994
Hey, what's with all
the "N-woos"?

1312
01:06:10,643 --> 01:06:12,078
Why do they have my TV?

1313
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:19,348
<i>Water goes in the top
and food comes out the bottom.</i>

1314
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:23,346
<i>N-woo! N-woo!</i>

1315
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:25,517
What's it, broken or something?
What's it doing?

1316
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:28,211
N-woo!

1317
01:06:28,212 --> 01:06:30,965
Here, you take it, you take it.

1318
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:32,309
N-woo.

1319
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,324
It's saying that I'm N-woo.

1320
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:35,733
N-woo.

1321
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:38,229
N-woo. N-woo.

1322
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,501
N-woo.

1323
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:42,505
Look, Flint,
they came here to help.

1324
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:44,789
We all did.
It's time to let us.

1325
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,592
Uh-huh.

1326
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,711
Okay, I don't know
if you can understand me.

1327
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,414
I know you think I'm N-woo.

1328
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:56,093
I know you think I'm N-woo.

1329
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:59,255
But the truth
is I'm no N-woo,

1330
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,496
I'm just a man.

1331
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,232
A man who's made
a lot of mistakes

1332
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,081
in the last couple of days.

1333
01:07:05,082 --> 01:07:08,465
And now my friends are in
a lot of trouble, thanks to me.

1334
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:12,547
Someone once told me
that I didn't need friends.

1335
01:07:12,548 --> 01:07:15,211
That I could accomplish more
by myself.

1336
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:17,051
I know now more than ever

1337
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:18,842
that he was wrong.

1338
01:07:18,843 --> 01:07:21,247
We need all the friends
we can get.

1339
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:24,668
And I need your help.
All of you. Fruits,

1340
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:27,835
vegetables and meat!

1341
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:31,141
I need you to help me
to get into that factory,

1342
01:07:31,142 --> 01:07:34,589
save our friends
and get our home back!

1343
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:42,781
Okay, now I just
gotta figure out

1344
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:44,254
how to get in there.

1345
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,376
With the right rod and tackle,
I could cast you up

1346
01:07:47,377 --> 01:07:49,173
into that unfinished part
of the factory.

1347
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:50,953
Should be a piece of cake.

1348
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:52,061
Hm?

1349
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:55,327

01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:02,968

You're going
to turn them into Food Bars?

1417
01:12:35,825 --> 01:12:39,650
Yes, Food Bars.
The lifeblood of my company.

1418
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,572
I learned your FLDSMDFR food

1419
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:43,681
is far more delicious
than "food" food.

1420
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:45,924
So using your foodimals
as ingredients

1421
01:12:45,925 --> 01:12:48,197
would make my products
super-delicious!

1422
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,200
I had to have your invention.

1423
01:12:50,201 --> 01:12:52,997
Unfortunately,
I couldn't find it.

1424
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:55,460
Until you helped me.

1425
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,372
FLDSMDFR!

<i>Watermelon!</i>

1427
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:08,039
You're a monster!
Those are living creatures.

1428
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,442
Yes, that's the problem.

1429
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:12,551
Food with legs
is much harder to catch.

1430
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:16,584
They hide, they fight back,
they want to live. Ugh.

1431
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:19,183
But now that I control
your FLDSMDFR,

1432
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:23,208
I can pave your island
and work in complete secrecy.

1433
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:24,745
Live Corp will remain

1434
01:13:24,746 --> 01:13:27,658

1436
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:32,352
I should've believed in you.

1437
01:13:32,353 --> 01:13:34,506
Yes, that was quite foolish.

1438
01:13:34,507 --> 01:13:36,321
Now if you want
your friends back,

1439
01:13:36,322 --> 01:13:38,235
I suggest you drop your cans.

1440
01:13:38,236 --> 01:13:41,003
Don't do it, Flint!
Save the island!

1441
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,020
But you are my island.

1442
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:46,060
Ew. Okay, first, shut up.

1443
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:49,259
Then drop the cans
or I drop your friends.

1444
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,571
Okay, okay. There.

1445
01:13:50,572 --> 01:13:51,755
Oh, no, Flint.

1446
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:54,572
This is embarrassing.
I changed my mind.

1447
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:56,909
Please understand
I can't leave any witnesses.

1448
01:13:58,191 --> 01:13:59,468
Barb, grind them.

1449
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,306
But, sir, I didn't think
we were going to...

1450
01:14:01,307 --> 01:14:03,149
This is why I work alone.

1451
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,521
Monkey! You are dismissed.

1452
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:10,160
And now, without further ado.

1453
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:12,814
Flint, hurry!

1454
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,575
Why won't this go faster?

1455
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:15,945
Give me that controller!

1456
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:19,057
Sure, come and get it.

1457
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:22,923
But which one of us has it?

1458
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,215
Is it me?

1459
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:25,457
Or me?

1460
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,056
Oh!

1461
01:14:27,057 --> 01:14:29,328
Earl, can't you break us
out of here?

1462
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:33,008
Yellow police tape!
The one thing I can't break.

1463
01:14:36,627 --> 01:14:38,162
Forkenknifenspooninator!

1464
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:40,626
Sam, guys, listen.

1465
01:14:40,627 --> 01:14:42,546
Invisible coffee table!

1466
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:44,082
I'm sorry I was such an idiot.

1467
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,779
Flint, that's true,

1468
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,691
but now may not be the time!

1469
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,659
Please let me finish.
I took you all for granted.

1470
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,048
I should have listened to you.

1471
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:54,324
Okay, go on. But hurry!

1472
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:57,479
The truth is I need each
and every one of you guys.

1473
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,767
You're more than my friends.
You're my family. Oh!

1474
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:02,645
How sweet. Note to self:

1475
01:15:02,646 --> 01:15:04,248
Put that on their tombstones.

1476
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,781
Good one, Chester!

1477
01:15:05,782 --> 01:15:07,727
Don't you see, young Lockwood?

1478
01:15:07,728 --> 01:15:10,399
These friends are the reason
you keep losing.

1479
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,661
Well, it's better than ending up
alone like you.

1480
01:15:12,662 --> 01:15:14,166
Ha, ha, I'm not alone!

1481
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,236
I've got holograms!

1482
01:15:18,232 --> 01:15:22,232
Flint! Why don't you throw him
a party?

1483
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:23,435
We love parties.

1484
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,207
Party?

1485
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,678
Party!

1486
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:29,401
Party's over, Lockwood.

1487
01:15:29,402 --> 01:15:33,006
No!

1488
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,312
Not yet.

1489
01:15:36,313 --> 01:15:39,383
I think it's time to celebrate!

1490
01:15:42,428 --> 01:15:44,187
No!

1491
01:15:44,188 --> 01:15:47,131
Celebrate!

1492
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:48,933
Yes!

1496
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:58,689
Thanks, lab partner.

1497
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,757

Guys, I'm so sorry
for being such a...

1500
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:09,213
- Chester!
- Okay, I guess I deserve that.

1501
01:16:09,214 --> 01:16:11,254
No, Flint! Chester!

1502
01:16:18,623 --> 01:16:22,270
I've got what I want.
Enjoy your friends, Lockwood.

1503
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:23,774
No! No!

1504
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:25,696
Don't do this!

1505
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:28,479
Ha, ha. Oh!

1506
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,200
Heh, heh. Uh-uh.

1507
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:33,136
Food!

1508
01:16:40,035 --> 01:16:42,905
Anybody gonna be keeping folks
safe in this town, it's me.

1509
01:16:42,906 --> 01:16:45,284
Ba-gawk-oh!

1510
01:16:45,285 --> 01:16:47,522
Tacodile supreme.

1511
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:52,123
It's over, Chester.

1512
01:16:52,124 --> 01:16:52,994
Mustache!

1513
01:16:52,995 --> 01:16:55,428
Now hand over the FLDSMDFR.

1514
01:16:55,429 --> 01:16:57,028
No! Never!

1515
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:00,266
Chester, there's nowhere to go.

1516
01:17:01,062 --> 01:17:02,916
That's what you think.

1517
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:04,517
Save me, monkey!

1518
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:06,565
I'm an ape!

1519
01:17:06,566 --> 01:17:11,621
Bad monkey! Give that back!
Bad monk...!

1520
01:17:13,735 --> 01:17:15,333
My holograms! Save me!

1521
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:16,678
We're here for you.

1522
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,147
You're going to be fine.

1523
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:19,521
We'll save you.

1524
01:17:19,522 --> 01:17:22,999
You see, Flint?
With my holograms...

1525
01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:25,937
Oh, fudge.

1526
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,889
I saved myself.

1527
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,881
Ugh.

1528
01:17:43,882 --> 01:17:46,086
That will leave a bad taste
in your mouth.

1529
01:17:46,087 --> 01:17:47,403
Ugh.

1530
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:52,176
Ahem. Uh, I believe
this belongs to you.

1531
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:08,461
Here you go, pal.

1532
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:11,966
Gosh, I hope this works.

1533
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:30,961
<i>Pickle. Cheeseburger.</i>

1534
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:33,359
<i>Leek. Strawberry. Lemon.</i>

1535
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,261
Yes! Ha, ha!

1536
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:35,120
<i>Banana.</i>

1537
01:18:51,348 --> 01:18:54,577
It's enough
to make a grown man cry.

1538
01:18:54,578 --> 01:18:56,563
And that's okay.

1539
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:59,334
You go right ahead, tear.

1540
01:19:06,933 --> 01:19:08,628
Guys,

1541
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:11,924
do you think we could still
work together?

1542
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:16,597
I think we will work
great together.

1543
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:21,336
Come on, bring it on in, Barb.

1544
01:19:36,889 --> 01:19:39,640
Aw, this is nice.

1545
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:42,233
Ape!

1546
01:19:42,234 --> 01:19:44,474
Monkey.

1547
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,425
I'm proud of you, son.

1548
01:19:46,426 --> 01:19:47,897
Thanks, Dad.

1549
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:50,936
But there's one last thing
I need to do.

1550
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:55,449
Okay, now, son. Now,
once you put it on like that,

1551
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,419
all you have to do is cast it.

1552
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,898
So like this? Ehh.

1553
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:03,355
No, no, no.
Here, let me show you how.

1554
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:05,258
See, it's all in the wrist.
Like this.

1555
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:08,124
Whoo!
Catch the big one, boy.

1556
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,127
Am I fishing?

1557
01:20:09,128 --> 01:20:10,077
Yup.

1558
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:11,932
I'm fishing!

1559
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,621
Whoa, whoa!
You've got a live one.

1560
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:16,732
Now reel him in, Flint.

1561
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:21,105
That's it. Steady, steady.
Oh. He's a fighter!

1562
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,383
Ah! I got one!

1563
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:25,419
I got one, Dad!

1564
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,398
Okay.

1565
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,337
Can we do this again?
Like all the time?

1566
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,279
You betcha, skipper.

1567
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,123
Sam, guys,
I caught my first fish!

1568
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,425
Yay!

1569
01:20:38,426 --> 01:20:39,793
Whoo! Way to go, Flint!

1570
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:42,975
Flint Lockwood,
you are a fisherman.

1571
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:44,610
