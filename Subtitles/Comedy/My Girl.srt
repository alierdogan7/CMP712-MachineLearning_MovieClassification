MY GIRL
English subtitles by Pippi Longstocking
January 1, 2009

2
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,700
I was born jaundiced.

3
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,900
Once I sat on a toilet seat
at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids.

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,700
I've learned to live with a chicken bone
lodged in my throat for three years.

5
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,900
So I knew dad would be devastated
when he learned my latest affliction.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Dad, I don't want
to upset you...

7
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,400
but my left breast is developing
significantly faster than my right.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,400
It can only mean one thing,
cancer. I'm dying.

9
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise
out of the fridge.

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Who's in?
Raise your hand.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,100
Are you coming or not,
Thomas J.?

12
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,400
- I don't think so.
- I knew he wouldn't come.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
I have to go home.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
To play with his dolls.

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,900
Leave him alone.
Come on. Let's go.

16
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,400
You didn't pay me.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,600
How do I know
you'll show us one?

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,300
You're such a baby.

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
All right. Here.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,900
Follow me
and don't say a word.

21
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,700
You ready?

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
You sure you want to see it?
Or are you yellow?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm not chicken.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,300
Lean forward.

25
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,400
It's empty!

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
- You're so weird.
- I want my money back.

27
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,000
- I was afraid of this.
- Of what?

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,400
Sometimes
when we get them...

29
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
they're not
completely dead.

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Like when they cut
a chicken's head off -

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,900
- and they still run around.
- You're full of shit.

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,300
I bet she's roaming
around this house somewhere.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,100
There she is
in the rocking chair.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,500
Hi, Gramoo.

35
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,000
Vada, would you bring down
my cigarettes?

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
See you later.

37
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,800
- Did you know he was my wood shop teacher?

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
- You took wood shop?

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,200
I made a tie rack.

40
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,600
- The fluid's mixed?
- Yes.

41
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,900
Put them on the stool.

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Guess what?
I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
The rack holds six ties.

44
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,200
I still have mine.

45
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,700
- Arthur!
- Vada!

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,700
- I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.
- Good for you.

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Once you put hotels on Boardwalk
and Park Place, you're a shoo-in.

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
- I like to buy railroads.

49
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,200
- Vada, we're trying to work here.

50
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Cruella De Vil
stole all the puppies.

51
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Hand me the cannula.

52
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,500
<i>There he was
just-a walkin' down the street</i>

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,700
- Vada!
- Dad?

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm embalming my high school teacher.

55
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,600
Don't sing.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, Arthur.
Slide him to me a little bit.

57
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
Alright, that's good.

58
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
CANCER OF PROSTATE

59
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Let's put him in a nice model C-501
bronze stainless "Eternal Journey".

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,500
He'll look like a champion.

61
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
SULTENFUSS PARLOR

62
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

63
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
Sure. Come on in.

64
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Have you had the unfortunate experience
of recently losing a loved one?

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
Could I see your dad for a second?

66
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,200
Dad! Somebody's here!

67
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton.
Prostate cancer.

68
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,900
Once it hits your prostate,
you're a goner.

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
- How may I help you?
- I'm Shelly DeVoto.

70
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,200
We spoke the other day
regarding the makeup artist job.

71
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,700
It's still available, I hope?

72
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,300
I think it's still available.

73
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm a licensed cosmetologist.

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I worked for two years
at the Dino Raphael Salon.

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,200
My customers cried
when I said I was leaving.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,700
- Miss DeVoto...
- I have a wonderful disposition.

77
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,300
I put people at ease.

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
These people
are already at ease.

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is not a beauty parlor.
It's a funeral parlor.

80
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
- They're dead?
- They are.

81
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,900
Stiffs?

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,700
Deceased.

83
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,600
The ad just said
"makeup artist."

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,500
Excuse me a second,
will you?

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,900
Sure.

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Hi, George.
This is a 1258.

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I didn't want
the burnished handles.

88
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,800
- Is that your camper?
- Yes. It is.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
That's really cool.

90
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,100
Hello.

91
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,200
She's shy.

92
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Put it back
in the display room.

93
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Daddy, how come
that coffin's so small?

94
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,500
They come in all sizes,
just like shoes.

95
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
- Is it for a child?

96
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
- Of course not.

97
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
- Then who's it for?
- Short people. Very short people.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Excuse me.
What about the job?

99
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Pardon?

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
I need the job.

101
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,200
You still want it?
Even though...

102
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Sure. It's no big deal.

103
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
You see, all my former clients
will eventually die -

104
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,500
- and all your clients
used to be alive.

105
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,500
So they have something
in common.

106
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,600
You'd do hair and makeup
and answer the phone.

107
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
OK, mr Sultenfuss. 

108
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
You've got a deal..

109
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,400
You can start right away.

110
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,100
Call me Harry.

111
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Is this what you'd normally
wear for work?

112
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't get me wrong.
I like it very much.

113
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,600
I promise I'll take good
care of these people.

114
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,200
They deserve it.
They're dead.

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
All they've got left
is their looks.

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
Hey, look at this.
No feet.

117
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,900
Wow.
A real Evel Knievel.

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,700
ONLY PICK UP TRUCKS ALLOWED
NO BICYCLES

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
What are you doing in my garage?!
Get out of here!

120
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
Hi, Veda.
What's wrong today?

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm very sick.

122
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
OK, take a seat.
I'll check if the doctor can see you.

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Vada's here.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,300
She says she's sick.

125
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
She looks all right.

126
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
OK, he'll see you.

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Why don't you go in?

128
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Well, what is it?
I can handle it.

129
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
You are perfectly healthy.

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
That can't be.
I have all the classic symptoms.

131
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Did they bring
Mr. Layton to your house today?

132
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Yes.

133
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
You've got to stop this. There's
absolutely nothing wrong with you.

134
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,100
I'll just have to get
a second opinion.

135
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
What did he say
is wrong with you?

136
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,000
The whole medical profession
is a crock.

137
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,800
Hey, wait up for me!

138
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Look!

139
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
At what?

140
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,800
That's Mr. Bixler.
Let's go talk to him.

141
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
I don't want to talk
to no teacher, it's summer!

142
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,300
Hi, mr. Bixler!

143
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,600
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss
and the amazing Dr. J.

144
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
- How's the summer treating you?
- It's OK.

145
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books
for summer reading.

146
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,300
Really? Already?
The summer's just begun.

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes. Now I'm reading
"War and Peace" for fun.

148
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,200
No wonder you're
my prize pupil.

149
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
What about you, Thomas J.?

150
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,400
I haven't started.

151
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,900
Better get on his case, Vada.

152
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,400
How come you're painting
this house?

153
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,500
Well, I just bought it.
Now I'm fixing it up.

154
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,600
This is one big house
for one single person.

155
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Well -

156
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,400
- you never can tell.

157
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,400
I might get a pet.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How are you going to pay
for this house if you're not working?

159
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Well, I'm going to teach
creative writing this summer.

160
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm doing some work.

161
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,300
- How much does it cost?
- 35 dollars.

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
What do you get for that?

163
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Me. Two hours a week
talking about poetry.

164
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Is this an interrogation, Vada?

165
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,900
No. Well, I guess I'll go home
and finish off "War and Peace."

166
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,300
It's summer.
You're kids. Go play.

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Want to go to Gray's Orchard
and pick some peaches?

168
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
No. I'm going home.

169
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Why? It's not dinner time yet.

170
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You're just like a dog.
You just go home to eat.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,300
Don't pee on the hydrant!

172
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,500
<i>Bill</i>

173
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
<i>I love you so
I always will</i>

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
<i>I look at you
and see the passion</i>

175
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>Oh, but am I ever gonna see my
wedding day?</i>

176
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Trooper Gwynn called.
There was a big accident on PA34.

177
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,600
They're bringing
in two tomorrow.

178
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Excuse me, Harry. I finished
Mr. Layton's hair, I think...

179
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
What's wrong with her?

180
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
She's pretending.
Vada, get up and eat your broccoli.

181
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
I think it's my prostate.

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
How many removals did you say...?

183
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
We have to do a V section tomorrow,
will you give me a hand?

184
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
I guess so.

185
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,700
Now, this isn't gonna be a repeat of that
snooker accident a few years ago?

186
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,600
Don't knock that up, it's how
we got that new Cadillac.

187
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I know that, except I had a body in my
bedroom, you had a body in your bedroom.

188
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,800
We were littered with people's bodies.

189
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
- Who's winning?
- I am.

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,000
Look! Vada and her
little boyfriend.

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
He's not my boyfriend.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
I bet she kisses him
on the lips.

193
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
You think I'd kiss that ugly thing?

194
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,700
Yeah, anyway.

195
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,100
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,400
Judy's father
owns the Bijou theater.

197
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
We see all the movies
we want for free.

198
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Maybe you can come sometime?

199
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Eew, don't invite her.
She'll bring her boyfriend.

200
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
<i>Vada and Thomas
Sittin' in a tree</i>

201
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

202
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>First comes love</i>

203
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,500
<i>Then comes marriage</i>

204
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
<i>Then comes Thomas J.
in the baby carriage</i>

205
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,000
You know Vada, you shouldn't
let those girls upset you.

206
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
I'm not upset.
I would never play with those girls.

207
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I surround myself with people
I find intellectually stimulating.

208
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,100
Want a piece of chocolate?

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,300
- Thomas J.?
- I'm allergic to it.

210
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,900
- To chocolate?
- He's allergic to everything.

211
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Chocolate?

212
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
To everything.

213
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,000
That's a pretty ring you're wearing.

214
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,500
It's a mood ring.

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,700
It doesn't work. 
It's always black.

216
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
It's only black when you're around
because you put me in a bad mood.

217
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,200
Maybe black
means you're happy.

218
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't think so.

219
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,800
Shelly,
how can I get $35?

220
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,900
She's crazy. She wants to go
to school over the summer.

221
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,400
It's not a real school.
It's a writing class.

222
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,800
I want to be a writer.

223
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,600
She only wants to go cause her
sweetie pie's the teacher.

224
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,800
Shut your
big, fat mouth!

225
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I think you'd make
a fine writer.

226
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
Did you ask your dad?

227
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,700
He won't give it to me.

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
You don't know that.

229
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Ask him.

230
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,700
<i>Edith, what channel
is Cronkite on?</i>

231
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
<i>Channel two, Archie.</i>

232
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,800
<i>The one we don't watch
because you always say -</i>

233
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
<i>- Walter Cronkite
is a communist.</i>

234
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,300
<i>I never said that, Edith.</i>

235
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,100
<i>The man ain't all red.</i>

236
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,300
<i>What's wrong with this?
Nothing's coming on.</i>

237
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
Daddy, can I have $35?

238
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,200
That's a lot
for a little girl.

239
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,000
It's for school.
A summer writing class.

240
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Any more soda left?

241
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,700
Shelly thinks I'd be
a good writer.

242
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,800
Last month you wanted to play violin.

243
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,300
Then you wanted to be
a ventriloquist.

244
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,300
Dad?

245
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
I love this guy.

246
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,700
What?

247
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
The money?

248
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Maybe next summer.

249
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>He forgot about the time
I wanted to be a magician.</i>

250
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,100
<i>I was really great
at making myself disappear.</i>

251
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,000
Want to play?

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, I've got to go
to a cemetery.

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Keep your head up.

254
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't look at the ball,
look at me.

255
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,700
See? You were lookin'
at the ball.

256
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
All right?
Keep your head up.

257
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Please!
Open the door, please!

258
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,200
Someone open the door!
Please!

259
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,100
Vada.

260
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
What happened?

261
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,400
My ball.
I lost my ball.

262
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,300
Come on.

263
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
Excuse me, Harry?

264
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,500
Could you take a look
at Mrs. Porter?

265
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Didn't I give you a picture
of what she looked like?

266
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,300
You don't like it?

267
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,300
This was
the Reverend Porter's wife.

268
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
You have her looking
like a two-dollar hooker.

269
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
I think she looks nice.

270
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Her lips are very thin.

271
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I used the gloss
to give them a sensual quality.

272
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And her eyes
just needed a little definition.

273
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
And her hair...
Nobody wears this hairdo in 1972.

274
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
She did.

275
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,700
This photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive.

276
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,700
I wanted to get past
the schoolmarm image.

277
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
That wasn't an image.
She was an old schoolmarm.

278
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Fix it.

279
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
Harry?

280
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,100
I was just wondering...

281
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
...if there's anything wrong with Vada.

282
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,900
What do you mean?

283
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
- The other night...
- Oh, that. She likes to play.

284
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,900
I don't think so.

285
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,000
I think she's confused
about death.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She was raised in a funeral home.
She knows a little about it.

287
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
But Harry, I really think...

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
She's a happy eleven-year-old girl.
Look...

289
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
...don't give me any advice
about my daughter, okay?

290
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
There's Shelly!

291
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,400
Hi!

292
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Can we look around
in your camper?

293
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,900
Sure. I'll give you
the royal tour.

294
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
This is the coolest thing. You
can really eat and sleep here?

295
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,700
I'm going to drive us
to Liverpool.

296
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Liverpool?

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,500
Big Ringo fan.

298
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
- Would you like a soda?
- I would.

299
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,700
- Thomas?
- Yes please.

300
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,500
What are you reading?

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You shouldn't be looking at that.
It's too old for you.

302
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,300
Did you read all these books?

303
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
What are they about?

304
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
Mostly love
and romance.

305
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,700
Eew, gross!

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,900
They're just fun to read.

307
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,200
Here. Cheers.

308
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Are you married?

309
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,400
No, I'm divorced.

310
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,000
Daddy says it's bad
when people get divorced.

311
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I know. Sometimes married people find out
they can't live with each other.

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,500
The Meyers are divorced.

313
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,800
Shelly, can I have a cookie?

314
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
Hey, where are all the cookies?

315
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,500
Well, I guess you found
my secret hiding place.

316
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,900
What are you saving for?

317
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Nothing in particular.

318
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,700
Just putting it away for a rainy day.

319
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm supposed to be home at
noon for lunch. Thanks, Shelly!

320
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Bye.

321
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,900
Well, miss Vada, what do you say we head back?

322
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
- Can I use your bathroom first?
- Sure.

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You don't have to wait. Daddy will
be mad if you're late.

324
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
"The great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences.

325
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,900
With the absence of both love and hate,
everything becomes clear -

326
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,900
and undisguised."

327
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,100
That was written by a Chinese
philosopher in the year 600.

328
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Why would I bring that up
in a creative writing class?

329
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Because the absence of judgement
helps us to appreciate reality.

330
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,000
In other words -

331
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,900
- I want you to listen
to your classmates' writing -

332
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,400
- with a clear and open heart.

333
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,900
OK, so who's gonna go first?

334
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,400
I got one.

335
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,800
"I sang a song for you to hear -

336
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,700
I painted a picture for you to see -

337
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,100
I picked a rose for you to smell -

338
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,700
I planted grass for you to touch -

339
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,100
But you didn't hear my song.

340
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,300
You did not see my picture.

341
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
You did not smell my rose and 
you did not touch my grass!"

342
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,700
Maybe she was outta town?

343
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,500
That's not funny!

344
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
His poem is about futility!

345
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,300
We toil in unrewarded obscurity.

346
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,000
Now, I hear judgement.

347
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Don't forget the part about the 
open heart! Vada?

348
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Is there something I can do for you?

349
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,100
I paid the money.

350
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,300
For this class?

351
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
I wanna be a writer.

352
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
But Vada, this is an
adult writing class!

353
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Hey, I think it's beautiful! She
wants to be a writer!

354
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,900
More power to you, little sister!

355
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Vada?

356
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,900
You sure you wanna do this?

357
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,000
OK, welcome to the class!

358
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Go find a seat.

359
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,600
OK, who's next?

360
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,800
I experienced something with my
boyfriend the other day -

361
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,700
- and I wrote a few words down.

362
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,800
The floor is yours, Ronda!

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,600
"He covers me like a blanket -

364
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,700
from the cold dark night.

365
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
As I look into his eyes I know it's right.

366
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,500
To touch, to feel.

367
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,600
I know he's real.

368
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Flesh all a-mesh.

369
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,800
I can't fight it.

370
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,100
There's no point.

371
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,800
I wake up and light a joint."

372
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
I wrote a poem, too.

373
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,700
Please.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,300
"Ode to Ice Cream"
by Vada Sultenfuss.

375
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
"I like ice cream a whole lot.
It tastes good when days are hot.

376
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
On a cone or in a dish,
this would be my only wish.

377
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Vanilla, chocolate, rocky road,
even with pie a la mode.''

378
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
That's all I've got so far.

379
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,400
I hear that, Vada.

380
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,000
"Flesh all a-mesh" or "rocky road",
it's about desire.

381
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Vada, that's very sweet and itrhymes,
and that's all good, but...

382
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
You're not expressing to
me what's in your soul.

383
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,100
I want you to show me how you see the world,
your fears or desires.

384
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,800
Your innermost secrets.

385
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
<i>My fears and secrets?</i>

386
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
<i>I'm afraid I killed my mother.</i>

387
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,800
<i>Can not do without Harry's wild about me!</i>

388
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,000
Excuse me, Harry?

389
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
I just wanted to let you know that flower's
were delievered.

390
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
And the room is all setup.

391
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Thanks.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Listen, I want to apologize for the other day
downstairs about Vada.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,300
I was a little harsh.

394
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
I shouldn't stick my nose in
other people's business.

395
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,600
It's just that I like
Vada very much.

396
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,600
After my wife died grandma moved in here
to help us take care of Vada.

397
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,000
They were very close.

398
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,600
But lately as her mind's been wandering...

399
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,900
Vada has been acting kinda crazy.

400
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.

401
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,400
I'm sure she will.

402
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,300
Nothing's biting today.

403
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,700
Maybe they had a big breakfast.

404
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,300
I'm gonna be an acrobat
when I grow up.

405
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,400
Big deal, I can do that too!
Thomas J., you got something!

406
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,500
Hurry!

407
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm trying.

408
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,500
Reel it in!

409
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,600
It's a sunny, throw it back.

410
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I don't like touching fish. I'll
pull the hook out without touching it.

411
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,700
You're hurting him, don't kill him!

412
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,600
Darn hook.

413
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,900
I'm bleeding.
Did it get away?

414
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,500
Go look.

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,300
Yeah, it got away.
Come on, let's go.

416
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Hey, we can become blood brothers!

417
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,000
No, I don't wanna.

418
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,000
You could pick that
scab on your arm.

419
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
It's a mosquito bite.

420
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,300
It'll bleed.

421
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,900
If I do it, can we go?

422
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,200
OK, rub them together.

423
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Now we're blood brothers for life.

424
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,800
DEATH NOTICE

425
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Hi.

426
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Hi, what can I do for you?

427
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Nothing, I was just wondering
what you were doing.

428
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Nothing, I'm just typing
up a funeral notice.

429
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,900
When someone dies,
we put one in the paper.

430
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,400
It's a service
we provide for the family.

431
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,600
"Bader, Lorenzo. Died June 22, 1972.

432
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,700
Devoted husband to Nicolette.

433
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Cherished father
of Fabrizio and Heidi.

434
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In lieu of flowers, please send
donations to the Holy Name Society."

435
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,900
I wrote that.

436
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,200
No kidding?

437
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,300
It's good! "In lieu of."

438
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,900
I love that word, "lieu".

439
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I prefer it to "instead", it
has  more dignity

440
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,400
"In lieu", "instead".

441
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,100
No contest.

442
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,300
It's no big deal

443
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,400
Harry...

444
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,400
You have to learn
how to take a compliment.

445
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Movies! Movies...

446
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,500
"Love Story" at the drive-in! Cried
my eyes out! Did you see it?

447
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
I haven't been to the movies in ages!

448
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
I love to see movies.

449
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
Especially at the drive-in.

450
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,700
I don't think there's anything
more romantic than going to the drive-in.

451
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I'll let you back to work.

452
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,200
I do enjoy playing bingo.

453
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,400
If you'd like to join me
tomorrow night, you're welcome to.

454
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,800
Hi Vada.

455
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
- Are you going out somewhere?
- No.

456
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,800
So how come you're
putting lipstick on?

457
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
A girl's always gotta look her best.

458
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,100
I think lipstick looks fake.

459
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
No one's lips are like that color.

460
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,000
- Have you ever tried any?
- No.

461
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Come here, sit down.

462
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,200
Go like this.
A little less.

463
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Now first we blot.

464
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Take a look.

465
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
It looks real nice on you.

466
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

467
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,000
Yes Vada, I think you are very pretty.

468
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,700
You got these great, big -

469
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,800
sparkling eyes.

470
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
The cutest little nose.

471
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,600
And amazing mouth.

472
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,500
The boys at school
don't think I am.

473
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,000
They'll come around.

474
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,000
Close your eyes. I want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them.

475
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
Now, the first rule in
applying eye make-up -

476
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
- is you can never wear enough
blue eye shadow.

477
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Do you like putting make-up on people?

478
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,700
I've been trying to get to Hollywood
to do make-up for the movie stars -

479
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
- but I haven't gotten there yet.

480
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,700
Open your eyes.

481
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Shelly, I would definitely hold off
on that Hollywood thing.

482
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,800
Your lip bleeding?

483
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,500
What's wrong with your eyes?

484
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,600
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow!

485
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,300
Where's your bike?

486
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
In the garage. Walk me over.

487
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,400
It's only a garage, come on!

488
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,500
One of my streamers is gone.

489
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,000
It probably fell off in here.

490
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,200
Hey, look at this!

491
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,200
That was Gramoo's.

492
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,000
It's a phrenology chart.

493
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,700
They used to study the bones in your head
to see if you had a good personality or not.

494
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Come here, I'll diagnose your head.

495
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,200
I don't wanna.

496
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,900
Come on, it's fun.

497
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,100
- Interesting.
- What?

498
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,800
You have no personality.

499
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,400
-Where does it say that?
-Never mind.

500
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,500
Is that your dad?

501
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Yes.

502
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,600
Who's that with your dad?

503
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,000
It's my mother.

504
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,900
Do you remember her?

505
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,500
Gramoo said she's in heaven.

506
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
What do you think it's like?

507
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,300
- What?
- Heaven!

508
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,400
I think...

509
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,800
... everybody gets
their own white horse.

510
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And all they do is ride them and
eat marshmallows all day.

511
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,600
And everybody's best friends
with everybody else.

512
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,000
When you play sports...

513
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,300
...there's no teams,
so nobody gets picked last.

514
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,400
But what if you're afraid
to ride horses?

515
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Doesn't matter, cause
they're not regular horses.

516
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,300
They've got wings.

517
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,400
And it's no big deal if you fall.
You just land in a cloud.

518
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,000
That doesn't sound so bad!
Come on.

519
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,800
We're gonna find
that streamer.

520
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,100
Well well well, whats'
going on in here?

521
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Nothing.
I'm dressing.

522
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,700
Oh, you're dressing, huh?

523
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Don't you know it's not nice
to lie to your big brother?

524
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,900
Hey, watch the hair!
The shirt!

525
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,100
- Give!
- All right!

526
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm going out with Shelly.

527
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Oh yes, that's great!

528
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm very nervous!

529
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
- Why?
- Last date I had was 20 years ago!

530
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,300
That's true.
Harry, sit down.

531
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,700
Let me fill you in 
on today's women.

532
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Since the last time you
dated something happened.

533
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,700
The sexual revolution.

534
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Before, you had to hold a door
for a woman...

535
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,200
...pull her chair out,
pick up the check.

536
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,100
You wanna know what else is missing?

537
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,200
Bras.

538
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,100
Oh, come on!

539
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,900
Harry, I'm serious!

540
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Trust me, Harry!
This women's lib thing is in!

541
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,600
You gotta treat her like
every Tom, Dick and Harry.

542
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,000
Are you sure about all this?

543
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,400
Did you not tell Vada
I'm a womanizer?

544
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,900
I'm running late.

545
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Shelly will be here any minute.

546
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,700
She's picking you up, good!
You're on the right track!

547
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,700
No, she's just driving over here.
Then we're taking my car.

548
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
How do I look?

549
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
Like a Sultenfuss!

550
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,300
Go get her!

551
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Night, Vada.

552
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,200
Dad?

553
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,500
Why are you dressed
up to play bingo?

554
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,400
I just wanna look nice.

555
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
You never cared before!

556
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,000
Well, Shelly's coming over,
we're gonna go together.

557
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,000
Why?

558
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
She likes to play bingo.

559
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,600
Can I go too?

560
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
No, I think you better stay
here and keep Gramoo company.

561
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,900
<i>I've got to admit, I'd as soon
not have any more bounty prisoners</i> -

562
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>coming through Dodge any time soon.</i>

563
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
<i>It's a bit wearin'
on the nerves.</i>

564
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,300
<i>This day was starting off just fine</i> -

565
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,800
- <i>and I'm gonna keep it that way.</i>

566
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>Doc, you never
answered my question.</i>

567
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Vada?

568
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,000
- Where are you?
- Here!

569
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
Don't do that!

570
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,900
Sorry!

571
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,500
What do you want?

572
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
My mom will skin me alive
if she finds out I'm out here.

573
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,400
Let's go to the church.
They're playing bingo tonight.

574
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,300
I told you I'd get in trouble!

575
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Pacifist!

576
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Am not!

577
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
Bed wetter!

578
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
I stopped that!

579
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,800
N-38!
Under the "N"...

580
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,600
Don't laugh.
There's a strategy to bingo.

581
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,200
For instance, on a given night,
anybody can win. But I play the odds.

582
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,400
When choosing bingo cards I use
the laws of probabilities -

583
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
- to avoid duplicate number systems.

584
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,300
This way, you get much more activity.

585
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Does it make it easier to win?

586
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
No. Just more activity.

587
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
I-17.
Under the "I", 1-7.

588
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,200
They won't let us in, Vada!
We're kids.

589
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,900
We're not going to bet.
We're just gonna watch.

590
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,700
Watch bingo? I don't even
like to play bingo!

591
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Duck.

592
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,900
N-42.

593
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
- Under the "N", 4-2.
- Oh, great!

594
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,800
There's your dad
and Shelly!

595
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,400
I don't want them
to see me.

596
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,400
3-7.

597
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,500
B-4.

598
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,600
Under the "B", 4.

599
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,400
O-69.
Under the "O", 6-9.

600
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,400
I just had a terrible thought.

601
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,900
What's that?

602
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm gonna be putting makeup
on some of these people very soon.

603
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Why do you think
these seats were empty?

604
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
B-6.
Under the "B", 6.

605
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,200
Can we go yet?

606
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,700
Go!

607
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,500
You know, I'm not allowed
out by myself after dark.

608
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,500
O-67.
Under the "O", 6-7.

609
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm just not lucky, Harry!

610
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
Look, it's not always luck.

611
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,900
Depending on the placement
of the numbers -

612
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,900
- a guy with 10 cards can win just
as easily as a guy with a 100.

613
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
Kinda like men.

614
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,900
How do you mean?

615
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Well, you can be in a
room with a hundred men -

616
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,700
- and not like any of them.

617
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,100
Or you can be in a room
with just one man.

618
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,200
And he's exactly
the one you want.

619
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,000
Bingo!

620
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,000
We have a winner!

621
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,400
Will the winner raise their hand?

622
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
There was no bingo, it
came from outside!

623
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,700
How can someone outside get a bingo?

624
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,400
Someone outside
didn't get a bingo.

625
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Someone outside yelled "bingo,"
you moron!

626
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,700
- Who you calling a moron?
- Put a lid on it, Vern!

627
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,800
Put a lid on it?

628
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
If you weren't 200 years old,
I'd kick your wrinkled ass!

629
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,900
Hey fellas, it's
just a bingo game!

630
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,100
We can go.

631
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,800
I had a good time tonight.

632
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,300
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

633
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,700
You'd like to come inside to see
my house? Just for a minute.

634
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,800
Sure.

635
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Home, sweet home.

636
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,100
It's nice.

637
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,200
I did it myself.

638
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I read a magazine article about
how to maximize small spaces.

639
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,900
Well, it certainly looks
bigger than it seems.

640
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,700
You can look in the
bathroom if you want.

641
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,900
People are always
curious about that.

642
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,500
Like what happens
when you flush.

643
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,000
Are you mad at me?

644
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,100
No, why?

645
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,100
I don't know, tonight you
just seemed a little cool.

646
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,600
Not opening car doors...

647
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,100
That was Phil, trying to give
me advice on dating 70s women.

648
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Look, I'm so out of touch, I
haven't dated a woman in ages.

649
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,900
Not since my wife died.

650
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,100
What happened to her?

651
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,500
Complications during child birth.

652
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,200
She died two days
after Vada was born.

653
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,800
Did she ever see Vada?

654
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I brought the baby into
the room a couple of times.

655
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
She opened her eyes.

656
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Yeah, I think she saw Vada.

657
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,300
It was...

658
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,200
Did I ruin this?

659
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,300
Dance with me?

660
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Here?

661
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,500
This is where we are.

662
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,000
Is there enough room?

663
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
- I haven't danced...
- ... in ages. I know. Me neither.

664
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,600
Bra?

665
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,300
See! You're not that
out of touch!

666
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,500
Phil, he's...

667
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,600
You're good.

668
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
At Woodman High, I was
considered a hot date.

669
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,900
I did a killer Trug.

670
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,500
What are you wearing?

671
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
"Old Spice". Phil says
it's a timeless classic.

672
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,800
So do you want to?

673
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,400
Want to what?

674
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
- Kiss me?
- Yes.

675
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,600
Good.

676
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,700
Good at kissing and dancing.
I'm very optimistic.

677
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,400
I better go...

678
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,800
It's only a clock.

679
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,300
Good night, Shelly.

680
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,500
Good night.

681
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,800
I guess it's official.
We had a date.

682
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,600
Maybe we can play bingo
again sometime?

683
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,100
I'm tired of bingo.

684
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,800
Maybe we should try
that drive-in of yours.

685
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,200
Good night.

686
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,900
Before class started -

687
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,800
- Ronda and Justin wanted to lead
the class in a group meditation.

688
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,400
That's really cool!

689
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What we're going to do is
send our vibes out into the group.

690
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Everybody hold hands
and close your eyes.

691
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,900
Relax your muscles
and take deep breaths.

692
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,100
Now, try to feel what the
other person is feeling -

693
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
- without speaking any words.

694
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,900
Send out your vibe and receive the
vibes from around you at the same time.

695
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,600
Can you feel it?

696
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,200
OK, open your eyes.

697
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,800
What did everybody feel?

698
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,900
I felt mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

699
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,100
I can feel that Ronda
is one with the earth.

700
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
She's so cosmically in tune!

701
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,900
So right on!

702
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,400
That's exactly what I sent out.

703
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,400
And I felt like you were full
of inner peace and harmony.

704
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,600
Vada, what did you feel?

705
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
I felt Justin's hangnail.

706
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,800
No Vada, that's not what
we're looking for.

707
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,100
A hangnail is insignificant.

708
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
What's in my soul?

709
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,500
Feel my aura.

710
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,300
I don't think I'm allowed to.

711
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,600
Tell you what, let's try
it again. Hold hands.

712
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,300
<i>Gramoo once had a hangnail
on her big toe.</i>

713
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,100
<i>It got infected and traveled
to her vocal chords.</i>

714
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,800
<i>Ruined her singing voice.</i>

715
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,700
<i>I don't think Gramoo
thought it was insignificant.</i>

716
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,800
And some lettuce.

717
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,300
Watch out for the rust
when you get lettuce.

718
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,200
Hey, I thought I
recognized you two.

719
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
- Hi Vada!
- Hi.

720
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,100
- We're just picking things up
for the barbecue.
- Me too.

721
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Mind if I tag along?

722
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,600
Not at all.

723
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,300
Lot of potatoes!

724
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
It's for Shelly's
famouse potato sallad.

725
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Looking forward to that!

726
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Damn it!

727
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,400
Watch what you're doing, Vada!

728
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,600
Sorry.

729
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
This'll be my first July 4th
picnic in a long time.

730
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Dad, didn't you say you
needed prunes real bad?

731
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Vada, just put anything you
want in the cart. Anything at all.

732
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,700
I don't know what's
gotten in to her today.

733
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,600
I need olives.

734
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,400
<i>I used to like to play
with my Ken and Barbie dolls.</i>

735
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,800
<i>Ken was my favorite.</i>

736
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,700
<i>Then one Christmas,
I got them a camper.</i>

737
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,400
<i>All they wanted to do
was hang out by themselves.</i>

738
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
<i>So I wasn't too upset when they took
that wrong turn and went over the cliff.</i>

739
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,200
I told you, use fewer briquettes.
Now look what you've done.p

740
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,100
You've cremated them.

741
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,900
That's what I do.

742
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,700
Do you want to do it?

743
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Why don't you pre-measure the briquettes
in little packages?

744
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,000
Put out a product.
Support me a while.

745
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,100
How's it going, chef?

746
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,400
I love your apron.

747
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,500
Thanks.

748
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,300
- Is it ready yet?
- No, sweetie. Not yet.

749
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
When?

750
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,200
Soon, honey, soon.

751
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,400
When?

752
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,400
In a minute. Look, honey, it's hot.

753
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
You'll burn your nose. Look out.

754
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,300
<i>Rub-a-dub-dub...</i>

755
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
<i>Thanks for the grub, Yeah, God.</i>

756
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,700
I'll second that.

757
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,700
Shelly, you like seafood?

758
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,700
Aha, what?

759
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,200
"See food."

760
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,600
That's attractive.

761
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,200
Shit!

762
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,300
Excuse me.

763
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,400
Hey, who lives here?
The Addams family?

764
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,300
- Danny, what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

765
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,100
Hi, Ralph!

766
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,800
Danny, how'd you find me?

767
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,900
You told everybody where you were going.
I'm here for the motor home.

768
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,200
- No, I bought it. I paid for it.
- These two people do not have a good relationship.

769
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,300
I've been living in it.
The camper is mine!

770
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,100
Excuse me, "mutual asset."
That's what the lawyer said.

771
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,100
Not Shelly's recreational vehicle.

772
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,600
Keep your voice down!
My boss is watching us.

773
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,100
I'm impressed!

774
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh God, I guess I have
to introduce you now.

775
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,000
This is Harry, Phil,
Gramoo and Vada Sultenfuss.

776
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,600
Vada Sultenfuss?
Tough break!

777
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,100
I like my name.

778
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,000
This is Danny and Ralph.

779
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,600
They own the Dino Raphael
Salon in Detroit.

780
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,100
We just to be married.

781
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,200
Are you here to take Shelly back?

782
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,500
It's nice to meet you.

783
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We've got burgers and hot dogs
here if you'd like to join us.

784
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,200
Can't stay. I'm here because my wife...

785
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,700
Ex!

786
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
My ex-wife seems to have
ripped off my camper.

787
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,300
Honestly Harry, he got the Mustang.
I promise.

788
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,200
I don't think so, I've got a copy
of the property settlement here.

789
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,200
Shit! This is my lease.

790
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,200
Damn it. I keep forgetting
things. Getting senile.

791
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,600
What?

792
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,300
I know you've suffered
a terrible loss...

793
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,100
and there's nothing
anyone can do to comfort you.

794
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,200
I urge you to focus on the times
you had with the camper...

795
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,000
The trips you took,
the sights you saw...

796
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,100
Those days are gone, but they'll
live on in your heart forever.

797
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,100
Is he boinking you?

798
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,300
That's a real bonehead thing to say!

799
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,400
Look, you're not gonna
take Shelly's camper.

800
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,300
- Oh, no?
- It's her home. It's where she lives.

801
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,600
Oh really!

802
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,200
Really? Fine. Go cook.
Give me the goddamn keys!

803
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,800
- Come on!
- That hurts!

804
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,100
What you do that for?

805
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,300
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

806
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Then you'll be visiting us quite often.

807
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,700
Why?

808
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,300
Because if he ever tries to take
Shelly's camper again -

809
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,700
- I'm gonna bury him in my front yard.

810
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,800
Your father's a savage!

811
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,400
Well, you were pretty great!

812
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,600
Is it really your camper?

813
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,800
Can we see them from the back yard?

814
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,700
You can get the general idea.

815
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,700
There they are.

816
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,900
They always look the same every year.

817
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,500
Look!

818
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,500
Did you -

819
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,300
- love him?

820
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,600
I would never marry anybody
I didn't love.

821
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,200
He must like Shelly.

822
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,400
I never saw him hit
anyone in his life.

823
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,300
He likes her.

824
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,800
Does he love her?

825
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,900
Probably.

826
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,800
Do you like her?

827
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Yes I do -

828
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,200
- and I think she's very
good for your father.

829
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,200
Why?

830
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,500
After your mother died,
he was sad all the time.

831
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,600
But before that,
he was pretty funny.

832
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,900
Really?

833
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,500
Now when I see him with Shelly -

834
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,800
- sometimes he seems
like the old Harry.

835
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,700
My dad was funny?

836
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,400
He wasn't one of the Marx
Brothers but made me laugh.

837
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,700
<i>My uncle fought in the Korean War.</i>

838
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,400
<i>He had a steel plate put in his head.
Daddy said he didn't come back the same.</i>

839
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,300
<i>One night, we picked up a radio
station from Oklahoma in his teeth.</i>

840
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,700
<i>It was really neat.</i>

841
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,500
- Can't you see it?
- What?

842
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,000
Can't you see it?

843
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,100
It's there.

844
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,000
Vada there is no chicken
bone stuck in your throat.

845
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,800
Dr. Welty, are you
sure those are yours?

846
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So you fill it with water, like
this. And you've got a water gun!

847
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Cool! Can I get one for Vada?

848
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,700
Oh yes, yes.

849
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,700
Thomas, let me ask you a question.

850
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,500
Does Vada ever tell you why
she comes here so much?

851
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,800
She's dying.

852
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,000
Do you think she is?

853
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:36,601
No.

854
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,800
And why do you think she says that?

855
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,400
Because she gets scared of all
those dead people in her house.

856
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,500
You know that saying, " If you can't
beat them, join them''?

857
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,300
If she's one of them,
she won't be as scared.

858
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,700
You know what I think?

859
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,700
I think Vada's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

860
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,000
She's my best friend.

861
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

862
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,300
As good as can be expected.

863
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,200
- Hey Vada, guess what we've got?
- What?

864
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
This!

865
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,800
Hey, you! I'm gonna get you!

866
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,100
I'll get you!

867
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,500
Give me that, you creep!

868
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,800
I just got you!

869
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,400
No, you didn't!

870
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,100
What?

871
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,300
- There's a bee hive.
- So?

872
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,100
Stand back.

873
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,200
Are you crazy?

874
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,800
You'll get stung!

875
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,500
You're right. Let's knock it down.

876
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,200
What do you want if for, anyway?

877
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,000
Cause they're neat.

878
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,500
Got it!

879
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,700
My mood ring fell off!
I gotta find it!

880
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,100
They're alive!
Run for your life!

881
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,900
Run faster! They're after us!

882
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,500
I am running faster.

883
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,100
- Hurry!
- Jump in the water!

884
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,700
I have my clothes on!

885
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,900
Do it!

886
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,600
Vada, is that you?

887
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,700
Yes.

888
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,300
Guess what? We're going
to the carnival tonight.

889
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,200
Be ready to go in 10 minutes.

890
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,900
Shelly's coming with us.

891
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Vada, what's your favorite ride?

892
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,500
I like the freak show.

893
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,300
I know, I know.

894
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
I know. Let's go on the
"sit on the bench and rest ride."

895
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,600
I don't think that roller coaster
agreed with your dad's stomach.

896
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,100
You know Vada, you have to
watch what you eat here.

897
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,100
Once I went to a carnival
with my cousins, David and Frank.

898
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,600
They ate hot dogs -

899
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,800
- and the next day
came down with nephritis.

900
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,600
Nephritis is a kidney disease.

901
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,300
- You don't get it from hot dogs.
- I'm not a doctor!

902
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,100
All I know is, the next day
they had high fevers -

903
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,400
- and their faces got very fat.

904
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,800
It baffled medical science.
They were in a magazine.

905
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,100
They were! "Popular Mechanics"!

906
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,900
No, "Popular Science".

907
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,100
I don't know, it was "Popular".

908
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,100
They're trying to hit that poor thing!

909
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,900
Watch you don't knock out a fish.

910
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,400
Just arc it.

911
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,400
I don't know which ball's mine.

912
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,400
I won! I won!

913
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,800
Great!

914
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,400
We have a winner!
There you go, little girl.

915
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,900
See how easy it is, folks?

916
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,800
Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

917
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,400
Where'd you get that ring?

918
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,500
Did you win it?

919
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,500
Vada, we have something to tell you.

920
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,900
Vada, we have some good news.

921
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,700
Shelly and I are getting married.

922
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh, my fish!

923
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,500
We're having the wedding sometime
near the end of the summer.

924
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,700
You'll be OK, little fish.

925
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,600
Vada, would you like us
to get another goldfish?

926
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,200
No, he's fine.

927
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,000
Fish are very resilient animals.

928
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,400
Don't worry, I won't
get another fish.

929
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,100
The bumper car! The bumper car!

930
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,700
For just 50 cents... a half dollar...
five dimes... ten nickels...

931
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,600
We have a ride guaranteed to rearrange
all of your internal organs.

932
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,700
Don't pass me by!

933
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,000
That's the bumper car ride!

934
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,800
Bumper cars! You can't go to a carnival
and not ride the bumper cars!

935
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,400
I fall asleep at the wheel!

936
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
I'll ride the bumper cars with you.

937
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,600
Great, Vada! Come on.

938
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,800
Two. I got the blue one!

939
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,400
I'm gonna come get you.

940
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,100
Vada, keep your
hands on the wheel!

941
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,700
Careful, Vada, careful!

942
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,900
Shelly, look out!

943
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,700
- Hi, Vada!
- Hi, is Thomas J. home?

944
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,400
Sure, come on in.

945
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,300
Hi, Vada.

946
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,600
- Hi, wanna ride bikes?
- Sure.

947
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,700
- Did you make your bed?
- Yes.

948
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,800
- Are you sure?
- It's made.

949
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,800
Come here.

950
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,200
You've got a milk moustache.

951
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,100
Come on, let's go.

952
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,900
Bye, Mrs. Sennett.

953
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
- Bye, mum.
- Have fun, kids.

954
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,800
I'm running away!

955
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,900
Where are you running to?

956
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,200
To California. I'm going to Hollywood
to live with the Brady bunch.

957
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,000
I wanna live with them too!

958
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,800
You can't, they have enough kids.

959
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,100
You'll have to live with
the Partridge Family.

960
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,100
Really?

961
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,100
That's it.

962
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,600
- Get up!
- I'm tired of running away.

963
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,800
Besides, we passed this place
two times already. 

964
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,000
We're not getting nowhere.

965
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,600
So why are you running away?

966
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,000
My dad gave Shelly a ring.

967
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,600
Wow, was it a decoder ring?

968
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,900
You're such a retard!

969
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,600
It was an engagement ring.

970
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,400
They're getting married?

971
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,300
So now you have a mother.

972
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,800
I don't like her.

973
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,900
I do. She's real funny.

974
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,100
She likes you better than me.

975
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,300
I'm hungry. I can't last any longer.

976
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,600
Then go home, baby!

977
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,800
I have to anyway, my
mum will be worried.

978
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,400
Leave then! Some friend you are!

979
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,900
You can come to my house for dinner.

980
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,000
No, I'm hiding out.

981
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,200
OK, see you.

982
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,600
<i>Perhaps you didn't hear
what I said, Mr. Deeds.</i>

983
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,300
<i>The whole Circle
fortune goes to you.</i>

984
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,300
<i>I heard you, all right.</i>

985
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,300
<i>20 million, that's
quite a lot, isn't it?</i>

986
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,000
<i>It'll do in a pinch.</i>

987
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
<i>I wonder why he left me
all that money. I don't need it.</i>

988
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,400
<i>In social studies we learned some
people stole the Lindbergh baby</i> -

989
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,900
- <i>right out of his house.</i>

990
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,900
<i>I think I'll sleep
with my window open tonight.</i>

991
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,500
Oh, my God!

992
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,300
Daddy!

993
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,000
Vada, what's the matter?

994
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,000
Where's daddy?

995
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,300
- He just left, what's wrong?
- I'm hemorrhaging.

996
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,500
What do you mean, you're hemorrhaging?

997
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,300
I don't want or need your help!

998
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,900
Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

999
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,000
- How old are you?
- I'm eleven and a half.

1000
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,800
It's okay. Come upstairs.
We have to have a little talk.

1001
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,300
My mummy and daddy did that?

1002
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,100
Actually, it's a very beautiful thing.

1003
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,100
And look, there wouldn't have been a Vada!

1004
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,200
I think it should be outlawed.

1005
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,200
Believe me, some day you'll feel differently.

1006
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,700
That's probably Thomas J.
I don't wanna see him.

1007
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,900
It's not fair.

1008
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,100
Nothing happens to boys!

1009
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
Hi, Vada.

1010
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,200
Can you come out?

1011
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,200
I don't know...

1012
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,300
Please, it's real hot.
Maybe we can go swimming?

1013
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,600
No! Get out of here!

1014
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,900
And don't come back for 5 to 7 days!

1015
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,600
Gramoo, I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

1016
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,400
Stay here.

1017
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,500
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1018
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,900
<i>It's quarter to three</i>

1019
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,900
<i>There's no one in the place,
but just you and me.</i>


1020
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,000
<i>So set them up, Joe</i>

1021
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,900
<i>I've got a little story
you ought to know</i>

1022
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,600
<i>We're coming, my friend</i>

1023
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,000
<i>To the end of a brief episode.</i>

1024
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,400
I'm so sorry.

1025
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,000
It's OK, ma.

1026
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,100
<i>So make it one for my baby.</i>

1027
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,600
<i>And one more for the road.</i>

1028
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,000
Very very sorry.

1029
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,600
What were you thinking?

1030
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,700
It's your responsibility
to watch her!

1031
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,900
Do you have any idea how
upset those people are in there?

1032
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,200
Why do you think people
want to get married?

1033
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,300
When you get older,
you just have to.

1034
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm going to marry Mr. Bixler.

1035
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,900
You can't marry a teacher.
It's against the law.

1036
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,800
- Is not!
- Yes, it is.

1037
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,800
'Cause then he'll give you all A's,
and it won't be fair.

1038
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,500
Not true.

1039
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,500
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1040
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,900
Like they do on TV?

1041
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Maybe we should, just to see
what's the big deal.

1042
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,500
But, I don't know how!

1043
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,400
Here, practice on your arm like this.

1044
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,500
Like this?

1045
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,400
OK, enough practice.

1046
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,000
Close your eyes.

1047
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
But then I won't be
able to see anything!

1048
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,400
Just do it!

1049
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,600
On the count of three.

1050
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,600
One...

1051
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
two... two and a half...

1052
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,400
three!

1053
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,400
Say something, it's too quiet!

1054
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,000
Just hurry!

1055
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,200
"I pledge allegiance
to the flag -"

1056
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
- "of the United
States of America -"

1057
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,900
- "and to the republic 
for which it stands -"

1058
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:31,500
- "one nation under God, indivisible
with liberty and justice for all."

1059
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,600
You better not tell anyone!

1060
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,300
You better not either.

1061
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,900
Let's spit on it.

1062
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,300
See you tomorrow.

1063
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,300
Vada?

1064
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,100
What?

1065
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,400
Would you think of me?

1066
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,400
What?

1067
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,500
If you don't marry Mr. Bixler.

1068
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,900
I guess.

1069
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,000
Yes!

1070
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
God, no!

1071
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,100
Get away!

1072
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,700
What are you doing?

1073
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,300
Feeding my fish.

1074
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,700
- Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
- Yes.

1075
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,200
He's getting big.

1076
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,100
Vada, come here and
sit down for a minute.

1077
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,900
Vada, something happened to
Thomas J. last night.

1078
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
He stepped on a beehive.

1079
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,500
I told him not to
tease those bees.

1080
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,200
Did he get stung?

1081
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,200
Maybe I should go over
and yell at him?

1082
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,800
No, sweetheart,
you can't

1083
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,900
Why not?

1084
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,700
He was allergic to bees.

1085
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,000
He's OK, isn't he?

1086
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,400
There were just too many of them.

1087
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,500
Dr. Welty!

1088
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,300
Vada, what's wrong, sweety?

1089
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,300
I can't breathe,
I'm suffocating!

1090
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,100
Relax, let me look.

1091
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,600
Come up here,
let me have a look.

1092
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,300
It hurts, it hurts so bad!

1093
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,300
What hurts Vada?

1094
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,600
The bee stings!
I can't breathe!

1095
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,300
I'll leave some food for you
at the door in case you get hungry.

1096
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,200
Hi. Is Vada home?

1097
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,500
Yes, but she's very upset
and she's not seeing anyone.

1098
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
I'm Judy, I go to
school with her

1099
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,700
I wanted to tell her
I'm sorry about Thomas J.

1100
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,600
Maybe she'll feel better in
a couple of days.

1101
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,000
Will you tell her
I came by?

1102
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,800
Sure.

1103
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,800
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, reverend Moss.

1104
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
The Sennetts want to thank you for
taking care of things so quickly.

1105
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,100
Vada, I see you took
your tray in.

1106
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,700
Maybe you should come
down to the funeral?

1107
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,800
Sometimes it helps.

1108
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,600
She won't come out.

1109
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,100
It's been a whole day.

1110
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,700
You'll have to
do something, Harry.

1111
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,800
The funeral's starting.

1112
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,700
Open your eyes,
she's 11 years old!

1113
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,200
Her only friend in the
world is dead!

1114
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,600
I know that but what do
you want from me?

1115
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,400
Stop hiding, Harry!

1116
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,300
You run Harry.
When I first came here -

1117
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,100
- the idea of working with dead
people didn't exactly thrill me.

1118
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,400
When I saw a family lived here -

1119
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,500
- I thought -

1120
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,000
- "If I'm living
without a family" -

1121
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
- "at least I can work
with one." -

1122
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,100
"And maybe once in while get
invited in for supper."

1123
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,200
Yeah, but when those suppers
are disrupted -

1124
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,100
- because there's a car crash or there's a
fire or a little boy steps on a beehive?

1125
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,800
- I'm not asking you to stop
feeling for those people.

1126
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But life isn't just death, Harry.

1127
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,100
Don't ignore the living -

1128
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,300
- especially your daughter.

1129
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,200
Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the
minister's about to begin.

1130
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,600
Thank you, Arthur.

1131
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,200
We are here to honour
Thomas J. Sennett.

1132
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:12,200
He was born May 7, 1961,
in Madison, Pennsylvania.

1133
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,200
He's survived by his loving parents
Charles and Susan Sennett, -

1134
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,500
- his grandparents,
William and Gloria Sennett-

1135
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,000
- and Gerald and Marjory Finn and
many relatives, friends and schoolmates.

1136
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,000
The internment will follow
at Madison Memorial Park.

1137
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,800
The family has asked me
to say a few words before we proceed.

1138
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,800
No words I could say
would begin to express -

1139
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,600
- the loss and grief.

1140
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,500
One word that keeps
ringing in my ear -

1141
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,500
- is "why?"

1142
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,700
Why would God choose to take
this little boy from us?

1143
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,400
Why? I cant give you an
answer to that question.

1144
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,500
I can tell you -

1145
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,600
God has chosen Thomas J.
for some very -

1146
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,700
- special reason.

1147
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,500
We must find solace in knowing
that Thomas J is in God's care.

1148
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
In that place, there is
no sorrow or suffering.

1149
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,000
The lion lies with the lamb.

1150
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,300
The day is not divided.

1151
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,800
I'd like to read a passage
from the Bible.

1152
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,000
This is Matthew 19.

1153
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,600
"At one point, children were
brought to Him -

1154
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,600
- that He might lay his
hands on them in prayer.

1155
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,400
Disciples began to chastise Him.

1156
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,100
But Jesus said,
"Let the children come to me.

1157
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,300
Do not hinder them.

1158
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,100
The kingdom of God -

1159
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,600
- belongs to such as these."

1160
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,700
He laid his hands on their heads -

1161
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,000
- before he left that place."

1162
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,200
Let us pray in silence.

1163
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,900
Wanna go tree climbing, Thomas J?

1164
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,400
His face hurts!

1165
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,400
And where are his glasses?
He can't see without his glasses!

1166
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,600
Put his glasses on!

1167
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,900
Put on his glasses!

1168
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,700
He was going to be an acrobat.

1169
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,400
He's gone, sweetheart.

1170
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,200
Vada, wait!

1171
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,100
Vada!

1172
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,700
Vada, I was just on
my way to your house.

1173
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,700
You all right?
I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

1174
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,900
OK, we don't have to
talk about him!

1175
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,900
It's okay.
We won't talk about him.

1176
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,900
We won't talk about him.

1177
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,900
Justin and Ronda say that I should
tell people what I feel.

1178
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,600
Come here.
Sit down over here.

1179
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,100
Mr. Bixler...

1180
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,200
I love you.

1181
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,800
I love you like my dad loves Shelly.

1182
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,100
And I wanna live here.

1183
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,300
I think your dad would miss you.

1184
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,400
No, he wouldn't.
I can't go home.

1185
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,300
Hank, I'll be ready in a second.

1186
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,400
I can't find my other earring.

1187
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,700
Suzanne, this is Vada.

1188
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,500
Vada, hi!

1189
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,100
I'm really sorry!

1190
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,700
Could you give us a minute?

1191
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,400
Who's that?

1192
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,000
That's Suzanne.

1193
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,100
She and I are gonna be
married this fall.

1194
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,400
I was gonna bring her to class
next week.

1195
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,700
I want her to hear your poem.

1196
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,300
Please, honey.
I cared for him too.

1197
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,400
Get away from me!

1198
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,500
Vada!

1199
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,600
Vada, sweetheart, don't...

1200
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,500
<i>Why do you think people
want to get married?</i>

1201
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,500
<i>When you get old,
you just have to.</i>

1202
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,200
<i>Who's that with your dad?</i>

1203
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,900
<i>That's my mother.</i>

1204
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,500
<i>I'm gonna be an acrobat
when I grow up.</i>

1205
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,300
<i>Vada?</i>

1206
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,300
<i>Would you think of me?</i>

1207
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,200
<i>If you don't get to marry
Mr. Bixler.</i>

1208
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,100
<i>Now we're blood
brothers for life.</i>

1209
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,900
Shelly, I'm sorry but we
haven't found her yet.

1210
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,400
She can't be alone in the dark!

1211
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,600
- We'll keep looking.
- We've been looking since this morning.

1212
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,400
- Her teacher called...
- I know. You told us.

1213
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Vada?

1214
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,800
Are you OK?

1215
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,600
Oh, God!.

1216
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,400
I should have told Thomas J.
he was my best friend.

1217
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,000
I'm sure he knew.

1218
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,200
Shelly, I stole some money
from your cookie jar -

1219
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,900
- to pay for the writing class.
- It's okay.

1220
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I'll pay you back. Besides, I don't
think I'll ever go to class again.

1221
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Tell you what. You dedicate
your first book to me, -

1222
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,200
- I'll forget the whole thing.

1223
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,400
I will. I promise.

1224
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,300
OK, get into bed.

1225
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,700
- Good night.
- Good night.

1226
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,500
She's here.

1227
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,900
Did I kill my mother?

1228
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,200
What?

1229
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,400
The bees killed Thomas J.,
and I killed my mother.

1230
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,600
Sweety, that wasn't your fault.

1231
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,700
Things like that aren't
anybody's fault.

1232
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,900
It just happened.

1233
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,000
I found this.

1234
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,500
I forgot about that picture.
Where'd you find it?

1235
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,500
In the garage.

1236
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,800
That little Chevy was your
mother's favorite car.

1237
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,500
What was my mama like?

1238
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,400
She was pretty and kind.

1239
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,500
She had your eyes.

1240
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,000
Boy, did she love to laugh!

1241
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,100
Sometimes when you laugh,
you sound just like her.

1242
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,400
Really?

1243
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,400
Know what she did when she found
out she was going to have you?

1244
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,200
She came home and painted
this whole room pink.

1245
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,700
She was so sure she was
going to have a little girl.

1246
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,800
Do you miss her?

1247
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,800
Yes, I did.

1248
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,100
Very much, for a long time.

1249
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,200
Even now, I get a little sad
when I think about a pretty flower -

1250
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,200
- or a beautiful sunset
she would have liked.

1251
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,900
I think every time I see a climbing
tree, I'll think of Thomas J.

1252
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,700
That's good.

1253
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,300
Memories are good, sweetheart.

1254
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,500
Vada, I'm sorry.

1255
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I was trying to keep it from you.

1256
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,700
I just couldn't.

1257
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,300
You're a good girl.

1258
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
I want you to be happy.

1259
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,600
Don't be an old grump like me.

1260
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,800
See you in the morning.

1261
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,000
Daddy?

1262
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,300
It's not so bad to be like you.

1263
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,700
Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

1264
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,100
Some days I think I'll be okay -

1265
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,900
- others I have to force myself -

1266
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,800
- even to get out of bed.

1267
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:44,500
I know it's crazy, but sometimes
I think he's just away at summer camp.

1268
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,000
How's Veda?

1269
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,200
She's doing much better.
She's just inside.

1270
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,100
Vada?

1271
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,500
Mrs. Sennett.

1272
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,100
Vada!

1273
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,000
I've been wanting to
come over to you.

1274
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,600
Thomas J. had this on him.

1275
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,100
I thought you might
like to have it.

1276
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,800
You were such a good friend to him.

1277
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,200
I hope you'll still come by
and visit me.

1278
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,800
I will.
I promise.

1279
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,200
Mrs. Sennett?

1280
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,500
Thomas J. will be all right.
My mother will take care of him.

1281
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,600
Thank you, Vada.

1282
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,400
"Encased in talent,
like a uniform -

1283
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,000
- the rank of every poet
is well known.

1284
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,200
They can amaze us
like a thunderstorm -

1285
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:17,800
- or die so young
or live for years alone."

1286
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,400
My advice to you
on our last class:

1287
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,100
Be a thunderstorm!

1288
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,500
What exactly do you mean by that?

1289
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,200
I mean -

1290
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,500
- be dangerous -

1291
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:40,800
- and unpredictable.

1292
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,300
And make a lot of noise.

1293
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,300
Vada?

1294
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,500
We missed you, man!
Give me a hug.

1295
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,200
I was hoping you'd
stop by today.

1296
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,200
Can't stay.

1297
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,600
I just came to read my poem.

1298
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,900
We'd love to hear it.

1299
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,300
"Weeping willow with your tears
running down -

1300
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,300
why do you always weep and frown?

1301
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,600
Is it because he left you one day?

1302
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,000
Is it because he could not stay?

1303
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,700
On your branches he would swing.

1304
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,800
Do you long for the happiness
that day would bring?

1305
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,900
He found shelter in your shade.

1306
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,400
You thought his laughter
would never fade.

1307
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,900
Weeping willow, stop your tears.

1308
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,100
There is something
to calm your fears.

1309
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,900
You think death has ripped you
forever apart.

1310
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,400
But I know he'll always
be in your heart."

1311
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,600
- Hi, Judy.
- Vada.

1312
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,700
<i>Things are a little better these days.</i>

1313
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,700
<i>I finally swallowed that chicken bone.</i>

1314
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,300
<i>Judy and I are going to be
in the same homeroom.</i>

1315
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,600
<i>And the Republican Party
just renominated Mr. Nixon.</i>

1316
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:32,000
