confidence whatsoever.

686

Makes me sick
sometimes to think...

687
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,534
And I'm always
telling the man,

00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,954
"Sherman, no matter what,
you've got to strut.

"You got to suck in
your gut and strut."

Now, me, personally,
I don't have that problem.

you need to hook up.

respective stuff together.

Officer Dagg,
I'm glad you came up.

701
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,693

please thank your wife Claire

702
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,570
for bringing that
upside-down cake for him.

703
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,530
He ate every crumb of it.
Thank you so much.

704
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,698

can you have someone

want to rush into things.

(IN REGULAR VOICE) What I'm
trying to say, Miss Purty,

00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,527
is that there's a right time
and place for everything.

720
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,989

I'll see you tonight

It was my idea to
go to The Scream.

Oh, did he? Well, I know
you're new in town.

Did you find him
attractive?

talking to you about that.

anything. I want you to.

go out with Buddy Love.

You do?
Absolutely.

00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,900
(LAUGHING) Whoo! Oh,
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.

1022
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,027
In the end, we know so
little of each other.

1023
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,237
No, my friend,
I've got bigger fish to fry.

1024
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,490
I spoke to Harlan Hartley.
You remember him.

1025
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,284
He's offering that tiny trinket that
could save your entire research program.

1026
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,494
Oh, yes.
Absolutely, yes, yes.

1027
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,745
I set up a meeting
with him.

1028
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,706
He wants to hear your grant
proposal personally.

1029
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,083
Friday, the Ritz,
dinner, 8:00 sharp.

1030
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,378
Well, sir, I think that's a
wonderful idea, sir. Absolutely.

1031
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,339
And I promise you,
I will not let you down.

1032
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,341
You won't.
I know you won't.

1033
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,301
I know you're going to be there,
and you're going to be great.

1034
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,261
In fact, I know
you're going to be perfect.

1035
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,679
(LAUGHING)

1036
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:08,972
Do you know howl
know all these things?

1037
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,015
How's that?

1038
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,392
I know them because
if you're not perfect,

1039
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,311
never mind the yelling and the
screaming and the firing.

1040
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:18,106
If anything goes wrong for any
reason, I'm going to kill you.

1041
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,692
I don't mean
that as a euphemism.

1042
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,694
I'm going to
literally kill you.

1043
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:27,366
I'm going to strangle you
and choke off your air supply

1044
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,243
until you pass away.

1045
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,871
(EXCLAIMS) Okay.

1046
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,873
Till Friday, then.

1047
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,585
It's a date.

1048
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,297
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

1049
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,970
Sir, this is incredible.

1050
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,222
It's a complete
metabolic transformation.

1051
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,766
How did it happen?
Was it an accident?

1052
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,435
No, I did it
to myself, Jason.

1053
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,646
You did? Why?

1054
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,692
If it was for the grant, the data with
Shelley was already so compelling.

1055
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,404
Well, I have compelling
reasons of my own, Jason.

1056
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,532
I have a case of infatuation
of sorts with Miss Purty.

1057
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,870
Professor, if you feel this way about
Carla, why don't you just tell her?

1058
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,830
It'd be a lot simpler
than transforming into...

1059
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,875
This guy's testosterone levels
are right off the charts.

1060
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,128
He was mean last night.
It was so unlike you.

1061
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,713
You know, I did feel that.

1062
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,381
Sir, you can't
control him.

1063
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,843
Jason, you have no idea what it
feels like to be Buddy Love.

1064
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,804
It's indescribable.
It's just wonderful!

1065
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,308
The way people talk to him and treat
him, and the way she looks at him.

1066
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,935
But he's dangerous. He
almost killed us last night.

1067
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,353
I mean, we should
be concentrating on

1068
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,606
getting the grant
proposal to Harlan Hartley.

1069
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,524
This is nuts!

1070
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:49,197
I guess you're right, Jason. I never
have behaved like this before.

1071
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,868
But on the other hand,

1072
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,205
I've never been
in love before.

1073
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,374
Even

1074
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,062
Afternoon, Carla.

1075
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,313
Hi, Sherman.

1076
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,773
How are you doing today?

1077
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,274
Pretty good.

1078
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,444
Come over to see how things
were going with you and Buddy.

1079
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,112
I wish I knew.

1080
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:33,033
We went out last night. It was great.
We had such a wonderful time.

1081
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,494
And then all of a sudden,
he runs out of the club.

1082
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,287
He has some
allergic reaction.

1083
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,747
And I don't even
know if he's all right.

1084
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,832
He's fine. I spoke
to him this morning.

1085
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,084
He told me that his
lip swelled up,

1086
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,794
he put a little ice on it
and the swelling came down.

1087
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,878
Kind of strange, huh?

1088
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,339
Well, did he even
ask about me?

1089
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,882
Did he say why
he didn't call me

1090
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,842
and let me know
he was all right?

1091
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,511
Carla, Buddy's kind of
unreliable.

1092
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,473
He's kind of what you call a "here
today, gone tomorrow" kind of fellow.

1093
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,225
Oh, I see.
Mmm-hmm.

1094
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,354
So he had you talk to me because
he's not interested anymore.

1095
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,439
No, it's nothing quite like that.
Look.

1096
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,732
Sherman,
I know what it feels like

1097
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,693
to be brushed off,
and it's okay.

1098
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,987
Carla, I feel like
this is all my fault.

1099
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,656
I feel like I should've never
encouraged you to go out with Buddy.

1100
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,117
Sherman,
you have been so sweet.

1101
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,287
I'll just have to forget about him.
I'll see you later.

1102
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,540
Carla.

1103
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,419
I was wondering if

1104
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,380
I could talk to you about
you and I, for a second.

1105
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,424
I was...

1106
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,219
I was wondering what
you were doing later,

1107
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,222
'cause the family
gonna get together.

1108
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,307
She made a meal

1109
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,144
and we gonna be eating,
so I figured if

1110
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,812
you not doing
anything for dinner,

1111
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,649
I know we'd love to have you, if
you want to come over for dinner.

1112
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,485
We'd love to have
you over for dinner.

1113
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,405
I'd love to.

1114
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,823
Would you, now?

1115
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,033
Yes, I would.

1116
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,160
Should we call and make sure
there's going to be enough food?

1117
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,496
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

1118
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:02,748
(ALL CHATTERING)

1119
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,916
MAMA: Oh, this is fabulous. There's
nothing like being with family!

1120
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,210
GRANDMA: I am hungry.
Come on, now.

1121
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,504
So,Carla, where are you from?
Chicago.

1122
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,381
Oh, Chicago!
We have family there.

1123
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,341
PAPA: Chicago.
Windy city, huh?

1124
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,719
I was working on a skyscraper
in Chicago once,

1125
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,679
and my lunch blew
off the 27th floor.

1126
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,432
Yeah, I figure your
fat ass would remember

1127
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,768
somebody's sandwich
flying off a building.

1128
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,852
(LOUD BELCH)

1129
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,395
Oh, baby, eat some bread.

1130
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,856
Miss Purty, are you and
Sherman having relations?

1131
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,691
TOGETHER:
That's a good question.

1132
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,318
No, Grandma.

1133
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,570
It's not like that.
We're colleagues.

1134
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,405
PROFESSOR: We just work together.
Oh. Colleagues.

1135
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,324
Yeah, that's how it
start out, colleagues.

1136
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,284
Me and your grandfather
was colleagues.

1137
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,952
Next thing you know,
he's on top of me

1138
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,704
in the shed,
pumping and a-sweating.

1139
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,039
Grandma,
it's not like that.

1140
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,207
PAPA: Sherman,
will you hush up?

1141
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,541
He's never
brought a girl home.

1142
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,876
The least you can do
is let us talk to her.

1143
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,420
Yeah, I'd like to get to know
her a little better myself.

1144
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,256
Ain't nothing wrong with having relations.
Don't be ashamed of that.

1145
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,841
Relations is beautiful.

1146
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,344
When I was young, I used
to always have relations.

1147
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,973
Every night, if a nice gentleman
bring me flowers and candy,

1148
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,894
take me to a movie,
show me a lovely evening,

1149
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:10,065
then I would take him home and
give him hot, lovely relations.

1150
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,984
Relations is a beautiful thing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1151
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,403
Especially two young people.

1152
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,989
That's your ho-ass, Mama.
Cletus!

1153
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,242
Sometimes when I'm alone,
I relate to myself.

1154
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,077
I can relate.

1155
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,703
Oh, Mama.

1156
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,956
I don't wanna hear this
shit while I'm eating.

1157
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,040
MAMA: Cletus! Stop talking!

1158
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,208
(WHISPERING)
I'm gonna kill you later.

1159
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,210
So,Carla, do you like children?
Yes.

1160
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,670
Oh, that's wonderful.

1161
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,339
I can't wait for Sherman to
bring me home some grandbabies.

1162
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,299
ERNIE: Yeah, I know you're gonna
enjoy making them babies.

1163
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,218
Got those childbearing hips.

1164
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,803
(CLEARS THROAT)
Baby'll pop right out.

1165
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,887
(MAKES POPPING SOUND)

1166
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,723
Your family got any money? I ain't
paying for no big-ass wedding.

1167
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,767
Oh, Carla,
I know a wonderful minister.

1168
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,018
What religious
background are you?

1169
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,770
GRANDMA: Yeah, I still got
my wedding dress.

1170
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,522
If you want it,
I'll take it in.

1171
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:54,860
You'd look so lovely in it.
It's white though.

1172
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,237
Can you wear a white
wedding dress, young lady?

1173
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,448
Now, Sherman,
you can wear a white tuxedo.

1174
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:05,078
'Cause you know Sherman. (WHISPERING)
Sherman has never had relations.

1175
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,205
Mama, you gonna
embarrass my baby.

1176
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,415
GRANDMA: I hope you got
a strong back.

1177
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,624
MAMA: Oh, look
at my baby blushing.

1178
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,837
When you get all that man and release
all that that's been built up

1179
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,464
for 35 years.

1180
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,926
Just wanting and
wanting and wanting!

1181
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,596
(EXCLAIMS) Might make
your head blow off.

1182
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,931
Pop goes the weasel!

1183
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,392
I got my own self hot
telling that story.

1184

01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,071
do you realize that
there's a gene in your DNA

1348
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,948
that routes this
straight to your fat cells,

1349
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,284
and it causes all sorts
of unsightly conditions?

1350
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,161
Case in point,
this woman is suffering

1351
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,121
from what I like to
call "Jell-O arms."

1352
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,624

the arm is taking on

1353
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,168
a gelatin sort of vibe.
And it's quite nasty.

1359

is suffering from

1360
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,513
what I like to
call "Tank ass."

there's a will, there's a way.

we can turn these genes off.

using exercise or diet.

1512
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,561
<i>You need to go down
to the laboratory</i>

1513
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,563
<i>and mix you up another
batch of this blue stuff.</i>

1514
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,064
<i>Come on back to the party,
Sherman,</i>

1515
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,482
<i>because Carla
doesn't want you.</i>

1516
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,985
<i>She wants me.
Me, not you.</i>

1517
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,654
<i>So come join me
because you can't beat me.</i>

1518
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:37,700
<i>You can't beat me.
You can't beat me!</i>

1519
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,161
Yes, I can!

1520
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,662
(BUDDY LAUGHS)
Yes, I can.

1521
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,461
Professor, I got your message.
What's up?

1522
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,255
Jason, I'm going to that alumni ball
tonight, and I'm gonna reclaim my life.

1523
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,924
Yes! I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

1524
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,801
Get things straight
with Miss Purty,

1525
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,386
and I'm gonna get that grant
from Harlan Hartley.

1526
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,637
Excellent

1527
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:02,349
Jason, we have seen
the last of Buddy Love.

(BIG BAND JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

1529
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,661
Horace, good to see you. The
jitterbug contest just started.

1530
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,872
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Your table's upstairs.

1531
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,874
That's another joke.

1532
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,794
When did you
marry Sharon Stone?

1533
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,337
Keep those legs crossed.

1534
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,841
Hartley. Damn it. And where
the hell is Buddy Love?

1535
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,218
No sign of him yet, sir.

1536
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,594
Here's an idea.

1537
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,637
Find him!

1538
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,930
Yes, sir.

1539
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,556
Harlan.
Well, Richmond.

1540
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,766
Where's your
Professor Buddy Love?

1541
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,017
With you,
it's always business.

1542
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,020
Let's get to know each other man-to-man.
Now, if our files are correct,

1543
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,397
you and your fabulous wife
have a terrific daughter.

1544
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,650
I'm divorced, and my
daughter is in rehab.

1545
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,819
So you're saying our
files are not correct.

1546
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,987
Listen,
you pompous butt-kisser.

1547
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,156
I have a check in my
pocket for $10 million.

1548
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,076
And your Buddy Love has till midnight
to prove that formula works.

1549
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,620
He'll be here, the formula
works and you have the check.

1550
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,039
Really? On you now? Because on behalf of...
Which pocket?

1551
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,667
No, don't tell me.
Let me smell it. Punch?

1552
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,169
Oh, come on, now.
Look at this.

1553
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,380
I can't eat this.
This stuff is too tiny.

1554
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,756
I can't get
full off this mess!

1555
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,551
I think it's wonderful, all the
precious little finger foods.

1556
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,094
Finger food?
I got a finger for them.

1557
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,971
I ain't paid no $100
ticket for no finger food.

1558
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,431
I could go down to Subway,
get me a sandwich for $3.

1559
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,976
I gotta pay a $100 ticket for
some finger food? Hungry as I am?

1560
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,644
You must be crazy
to think I'm gonna eat this...

1561
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,895
Please. You're getting
on my damn nerves!

she's seen Sherman. Carla!

1564
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,609
Carla.

Thank you, Mrs. Klump.

1568
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,202
Have you seen Sherman? PAPA:
Yeah, where's Sherman at?

1569
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,663
I ain't come to pay no $100 ticket
to have to suffer this alone.

1570
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:48,914
Cletus, shut up, please!

1571
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,333
Hey! That's strike two.

1572
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,170
I don't think Sherman
will be coming tonight.

1573
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,380
Yes, he is. Sherman called me and
told me to make sure we was here,

1574
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,923
'cause he got a big announcement
to make or something.

1575
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,551
Something about getting
it all off his chest.

1576
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,886
Have you noticed
that Sherman's

1577
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,220
been acting kind
of strange lately?

1578
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,806
Sherman has definitely
been acting strange lately.

1579
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,100
I knew it!
See, Cletus? I told you.

1580
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,978
You really think I be listening to you.
I ain't listening to you!

1581
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,647
Well, Mrs. Klump, I hope you
have a wonderful evening.

1582
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,234
Oh, you do the same. Thank you so much.
So precious.

1583
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,320

They gonna think we twins.

1585
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,907
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1586
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,950
Fabulous.

1587
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,202
You know, Cletus,
I think something's

1588
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,828
going on between
her and Sherman.

1589
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,206
You don't go get up in Sherman's business.
That's Sherman's business.

1590
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,875
Sherman's business? That's my business.
Sherman is my baby.

1591
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,085
Sherman's 35 years old! What you
talking about he's your baby?

1592
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,879
Cletus, I don't wanna hear it.
Shut up, please!

1593
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,547
Carla! That's strike
three, damn it!

1594
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,633
Don't you walk away
from me, God damn it!

Hey, this is
the last of it, Professor.

1597
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,387
I'll tell you this,
Jason,

1598
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,432
if I'm gonna change my life, it's not
gonna come from some magic: drink.

1599
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,559
Gotta come from
a lot of hard work,

1600
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,770
and exercise and
plenty of these.

1601
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:55,522
Good bye, Buddy Love.
Hello, Megashake.

01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,741
Professor?

1605
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:09,662
Oh!

1606
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:13,290
I lost 300 pounds
in 30 seconds!

1607
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:14,667
Thanks, Megashake!

1608
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,126
You tricked him!

1609
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,837
You damn right, hamster boy. I knew
Sherman was gonna go soft on me.

1610
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:21,215
That can wreak havoc
on a man's sex life.

1611
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,800
(LAUGHING)

1612
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,426
See, I've done some
calculations of my own.

1613
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,136
If I drink 500
milliliters of formula,

1614
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,388
I'll have enough
cellular stability

1615
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,639
to be rid of
Sherman's ass forever!

1616
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,141
No, you drink that much formula at
one time, and it will kill you!

1617
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,893
If I drink it all at once,
yes. If I drink half now

1618
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,687
and half later,
that's completely safe.

1619
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,771
At midnight,
I don't have to worry

1620
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,855
about turning
into no Klumpkin.

1621
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,191
Now if you don't mind, I have
a date at the alumni ball,

1622
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,317
and you have
a date with linoleum.

1623
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,443
Who?

1624
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,780
(MAMA KLUMP LAUGHS)

1625
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,786
No, no, no, child. Not a wild party.
Not Sherman.

1626
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,871
He's too shy for something like that.
He hates parties.

1627
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,125
In fact, we tried to have a party for
Sherman when he was 18 years old,

1628
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,419
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

1629
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,047
Well, I must admit, it didn't
seem like the Sherman I know.

1630
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,215
Oh, no, not my baby.

1631
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,800
Maybe he loaned his house
out to somebody or something,

1632
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,176
or one of his buddies
was throwing a party.

1633
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,469
BUDDY: Yeah!

1634
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,431
Is that a test tube in my pocket
or am I just happy to see you?

1635
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,474
Oh! How dare you!
Oh, you know you loved it.

1636
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,726
I felt you percolating.

Y'all gotta get y'all some
peach cobbler up in here!

the hell have you been?

1645
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,288
I've been nursemaiding Hartley
for three hours,

1646
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,706
and if I didn't
need that money...

1647
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:36,749
Shut up!

1648
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,709
Who you think you're
talking to, Sherman Klump?

1649
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,878
Man, if you ever talk to me
like that again, I'll kill you!

1650
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,046
I don't mean
that as a euphemism.

1651
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,380
I mean, I'm gonna
literally kill you.

1652
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,715
I'm gonna strangle you

1653
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,384
and cut off your air supply
until you pass away!

1654
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,763

It's showtime.

1655
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,973
It's showtime, everybody!

1656
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,767

because of y'all! It's showtime!

1666

me like y'all don't know me?

Y'all know me!

I don't know that fool.

1669

How about now?
You recognize me?

I don't know that fool.

1671

weighed 400 pounds!
