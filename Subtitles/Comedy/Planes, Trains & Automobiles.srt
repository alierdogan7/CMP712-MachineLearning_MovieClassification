00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,894
We took off
from New York,

189
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,523
they closed Chicago,
we landed here.

190
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,900
Neal.

191
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,566
Trouble on the home front?

192
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,941
I really don't think that's
any of your concern.

193
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,845
The finest line
a man will walk

194
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,850
is between success at work
and success at home.

195
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,513
I got a motto...
like your work, love your wife.

196
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,852
Well, I'll remember that.

197

198
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,852
Simple.

199
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,863
No way we'll get out
of here tonight.

200
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,364

with our butt cheeks.

202
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,369
We'll find out soon enough.

203
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,497
By the time the airline
cancels this flight,

204
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,007
which they will eventually,

205
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,772
you'd have a better chance finding
a three-legged ballerina

206
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,370
than a hotel room.

207
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,642

if you had any rooms
available for tonight?

218

Anything.
Anything will do.

Did you book a room yet?

227
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,020
I, uh, couldn't
get in anywhere.

When we arrived,
you called home.

229

I called
the Braidwood Inn.

230
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,130
I missed that one.

231
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,691

the cab fare,

I'll make sure
you get a room.

Is this your trunk?

241
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,556
Yeah. You should try
lugging this thing

242
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,623

take the interstate?

to look around.

I told my friend you'd
give him a room tonight.

Do you have
a major credit card?

Do you still honor those discount
credit cards?

269
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,120
I'll have to charge you
for a double,

270

it'll come out even.

00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,863
Your stories
have none of that.

370
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,464
They're not even
amusing accidentally.

371
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,974
Honey, meet Del Griffith.

372
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,977
He's got some
amusing anecdotes.

373
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,573
Here's a gun so you can
blow your brains out.

374
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,617
You'll thank me for it.

375
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,416
I could tolerate
any insurance seminar.

376
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,892
For days,
I could listen to them go on and on.

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,054
They'd say,
"How can you stand it?"

378
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,963
And I'd say,
"'Cause I've been with Del Griffith.

379
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,830
I can take anything."

380
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,836
You know what they'd say?

381
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,838
"I know what you mean.

382
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,897
The shower curtain
ring guy."

383
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,206
It's like going on a date

384
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,212
with a Chatty Cathy doll.

385
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,249
There should be
a string on your chest

386
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,749
that I pull out.

387
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,787
Except I wouldn't
pull it out, you would.

388
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,344
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

389
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,889
By the way,

390
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,017
when you're telling
these little stories,

391
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,755
here's a good idea.

392
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,262
Have a point.

393
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,265
It makes it more interesting
for the listener.

394
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,148
You want to hurt me?

395
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,151
Go ahead if it
makes you feel better.

396
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,846
I'm an easy target.

397
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,952
Yeah, you're right.

398
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,788
I talk too much.

399
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,090
I also listen too much.

400
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,758
I could be a cold-hearted
cynic like you,

401
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,825
but I don't like to
hurt people's feelings.

402
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,100
Well, you think
what you want about me.

403
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm not changing.

404
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,676
I like... I like me.

405
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,802
My wife likes me.

406
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,006
My customers like me.

407
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,140
'Cause I'm the real article.

408
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,344
What you see
is what you get.

409
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:20,430
# I'm back
in baby's arms #

410
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,958
# How I miss
those lovin' arms #

411
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,200
# I am back
where I belong #

412
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:34,337
# Back in baby's arms #

413
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,973
# Don't know
why we quarreled #

414
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,576
# We never did before #

415
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,920
# Since we found out
how it hurts... ##

416
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,117
Del.

417
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,922
Hmm? Yeah.

418
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,428
Why did you kiss my ear?

419
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,660
Why are you holding my hand?

420
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,269
Where's your other hand?

421
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,169
Between two pillows.

422
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,274
Those aren't pillows!

423
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,537
Aah!

424
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,578
Oh, no!

425
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,580
Ooh!

426
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,615
Oh!

427
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,514
Oh! Oh!

428
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,329
See that Bears' game
last week?

429
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,955
Hell of a game.

430
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,227
They're going all the way.

431
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,134
Ohh, yeow.

432
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,965
Neal, take my socks
out of the sink

433
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,524
if you're going
to brush your teeth.

434
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,041
Where are you?

435
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,543
I'm in Wichita.

436
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,169
I'm at a motel

437
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,511
with this guy
I met on the plane.

438
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,484
You shared a motel room
with a stranger?

439
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,850
Are you crazy?

440
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,149
I'm getting there.

441
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,156
Did you call the airline?

442
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,591
I have a good chance
of getting on standby.

443
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,094
If they told you

444
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,027
wolverines make
good house pets,

445
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,394
would you believe them?

446
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,899
I'm not spending
Thanksgiving in Wichita.

447
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,458
I'll get home.

448
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,935
Mmm.

449
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,437
Not by airplane.

450
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,942
They got 18 hours of air traffic
backed up.

451
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,944
We're going to be having
our turkey roll

452
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,775
right here.

453
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,282
If we wait
for the flight.

454
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,716
How else can we get home?

455
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,721
Burt Dingman.
He works for the railroad.

456
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,724
I sold them all their
shower curtain rings.

457
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,487
He owes me a favor.

458
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,864
I'll get that.
I paid for everything else.

459
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,399
Why break precedent?

460
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,061
You're making me feel
like a freeloader.

461
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,071
Get me on the train,
we're square.

462
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,869
You got it.
That's the easy part.

463
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,848
What?

464
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,748
You know goddamn well what.

465
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,150
I'm sorry. I don't.

466
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,519
I had over
$ 700 in here.

467
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,526
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a thief.

468
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,563
You went into my stuff
last night, right?

469
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,565
I didn't take your money.

470
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,066
I had over $ 700.

471
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,103
You went into
my wallet for pizza.

472
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,071
Just maybe
when you went into...

473
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,232
Count it!

474
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,742
Like you'd keep it
in there.

475
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,243
There's $263 in there.

476
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,770
If there's more,
you can call me a thief.

477
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,146
Count it!

478
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,185
263, right?

479
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,515
Empty.

480
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,557
What?

481
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,689
We were robbed.

482
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,791
Do you think so?

483
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,562
I've been thinking.

484
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,069
What we're dealing with

485
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,867
is a smalltime crook.

486
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,374
He didn't take
the credit cards,

487
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,376
so we charge
our way home.

488
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,242
I've got a Visa
and a gasoline card.

489
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,248
Oh, and a Neiman-Marcus card

490
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,183
in case we want
to buy a gift.

491
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,617
What have you got?

492
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,087
Chalmer's Big and Tall
Men's Shoppe,

493
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,784
a seven-outlet chain in
the Pacific Northwest.

494
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,452
Unfortunately,
it does us no good here.

495
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,962
Get me to the train station,

496
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,624
and I'll take care
of everything else.

497
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,066
Gus' son is picking us up.

498
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,872
This is not him, is it?

499
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,739
Gee, I hope not.

500
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,845
Are you Gus' son?

501
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,505
I'm Owen.

You the shower
curtain fella?

00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,812
Yeah. Yeah.
Del Griffith.

505
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,413
How are you?

506
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,857
This is Neal Page
from Chicago.

507
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:49,893
Hi.

508
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,020
Pleased to meet you both.

509

[Grunts]

510
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,737
I'm to drive you to Wichita
to catch a train?

511
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,365
Yeah, we'd appreciate it.

512
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,309
Train don't run
out of Wichita.

513
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,176
'Lessen you're a hog
or cattle.

[Grunts]

515
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,219
People train
runs out of Stubbville.

516
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,755
That'll be fine.

517
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,381
That'll be just fine.

518
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,394
Leave it be.

519
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,896
Get your lazy behind out here

520
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,898
and put that in back.

521
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,399
No. We've got it.

522
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,799
It's very heavy.

523
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,097
She don't mind.

524
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,435
She's short and skinny,

525
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,996
but she's strong.

526
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,543
Her first baby...

527
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,703
come out sideways.

528
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,043
She didn't scream
or nothing.

529
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,208
Isn't that something?

530
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,979
You're a real trooper.

531
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,646
We've got it already.
It's done.

532
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,226
You know, Stubbville's
a little further than Wichita.

533
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,922
How much further?

534
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,190
30 miles.

535
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,999
Maybe 40.

536
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,659
No more
than 45 though,

537
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,671
depending
on how he goes.

538
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,537
It could be anywhere
up to 70 miles.

539
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,270
Woof! Woof!

540
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,005
[Growling]

541
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,013
Give me the glove.

542
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,141
Ow! Just nipped.
Little part. Ooh!

543
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,719
Give him the goddamn glove!

544
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,414
Are we there yet?

545
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,424
No, a little way to go yet.

00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,827
Beautiful country though,
isn't it?

What do you figure
the temperature is?

549
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,530

those miniature marshmallows.

751
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,481
You can start by wiping
that fucking dumb-ass smile

752
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,754

fucking cheeks.

a fucking automobile.

00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,878
Yes, I do.

782
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,178
The airlines are faster,

783
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,515
and you get
a free meal.

784
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,952

785
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,422

798
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,897

that when we parted ways,

804
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,854
somehow, someday,

805
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,686
our paths
would cross again.

806
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,090

807
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,651
I've never seen
anyone get lifted

808
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,162
by his testicles before.

809
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,664

810
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,962
that cop came when he did.

811
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,265
Otherwise,
you'd be lifting your schnutz

812
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,599
to tie your shoes.

813
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,698
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

814
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,505
You know,
I'm glad I didn't kill you.

815
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,376

816
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,574
Oh, you don't mean that.

817
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,516
Remember what I said?
Go with the flow.

818
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,521
How can I when
the rental car agency

819
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,854
leaves me keys
to a car that isn't there,

820
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,258
then I find out they
don't have any more cars?

821
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,093
I got a car,
no sweat at all.

822
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,565
Well, Del,
you're a charmed man.

823
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,964
Nope.

824
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,593
Oh, I know.

825
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,104
You just go
with the flow.

with these,

839

a couple good positions.

but I'm decent enough
not to bring them up.

bothers you?

860

There's lots of things.

861
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,892
Name one.

00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,166
You want me to name one?

Fine, um...

your balls a lot.

with my balls.

and an extra set of fingers?

873

Oh, that's humor.

874
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,869
Oh, that's real humor.

your mouth.

You're welcome.

881
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,553
You broke the seat.

882
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,988
You broke the goddamn seat.
I don't believe it.

883
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,652
It wasn't broken
when I got out.

884
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,058
You broke it.

885
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,222
It's impossible
to break them.

886
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,458
Impossible?

01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:56,249
Yeah.

1272
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:02,489
It's been great meeting you.

1273
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:05,492
I'm sorry if I caused
you any trouble.

1274
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,959
You got me home,

1275
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,053
and, uh...
a little late.

1276
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,757
A couple days.

1277
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,265
But, uh...

1278
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,427
I'm a little wiser, too.

1279
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,231
Me, too.

1280
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,772
Happy holidays.

1281
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,102
Same to you.

1282
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,768
Happy Thanksgiving, Neal.

1283
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,279
Give my love to the family.

1284
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,407
Maybe I'll meet them someday.

1285
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,781
Say hello to Marie for me.

1286
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,149
Yeah.

1287
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,289
So... OK.

1288
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:37,655
And you have
a happy Thanksgiving.

1289
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,785
Hey, you know it.

1290
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:41,522
So long.

1291
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,740
<i>I like...</i>
<i>I like me.</i>

1292
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,340
<i>My wife likes me.</i>

1293
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,247
<i>At the very least,</i>
<i>the absolute minimum,</i>

1294
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,757
<i>you've got</i>
<i>a woman you love</i>

1295
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,760
<i>to grow old with, right?</i>

1296
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,424
<i>I'm spending</i>
<i>too much time away.</i>

1297
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,766
<i>I haven't been home</i>
<i>in years.</i>

1298
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,272
<i>I haven't been home</i>
<i>in years.</i>

1299
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,774
<i>I haven't been home</i>
<i>in years.</i>

1300
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,728
Del, what are you
doing here?

1301
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,241
You said you were going home.

1302
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,300
What are you doing here?

1303
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,246
I, uh...

1304
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,182
I don't have a home.

1305
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:27,260
Marie's been dead
for eight years.

1306
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:06,800
Boy, you are
one lucky guy, Neal.

1307
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,063
I know.

1308
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:10,798
I won't stay long.

1309
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,806
Maybe I'll just say hi,

1310
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:14,808
then be on my way.

1311
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,275
Just come on.

1312
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:29,481
[Doorbell Rings]

1313
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:35,760
Hiya, kiddo.

1314
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,297
Daddy!

1315
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,333
Hey!
Hey!

1316
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,765
Neal's home!

1317
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:43,497
Del Griffith,
meet my father-in-law Walt,

1318
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,334
my mother-in-law Peg,

1319
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,273
my mother Joy,
and my dad Martin.

1320
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:49,275
Welcome, Del.

1321
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,278
This little guy's
Neal Jr.,

1322
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,779
my little gem Marti,

1323
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:56,544
and somewhere around here
is my baby boy Seth.

1324
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:13,027
Honey, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

1325
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,204
Hello, Mr. Griffith.

1326
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,367
Hello, Mrs. Page.

1327
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,843
# Every time you go away #

1328
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:40,053
# You take
a piece of me with you #

1329
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,621
# Every time you go away #

1330
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:51,336
# You take
a piece of me with you #

1331
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,874
# Ooh-hoo #

1332
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,313
# Go on and go free #

1333
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:14,793
# Maybe you're
too close to see #

1334
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:20,530
# I can feel
your body move #

1335
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:25,164
# Yeah, it doesn't
mean that much to me #

1336
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:32,306
# Can't go on
sayin' the same thing #

1337
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:37,246
# Can't you see
we've got everything #

1338
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:40,412
# Even though, you know,
you know, yeah #

1339
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,151
# Every time you go away #

1340
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,052
# You take
a piece of me #

1341
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,655
# Take a piece
of me with you ##

1342
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,338
[Neal] You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1343
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,548
I can take anything.

1344
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,094
Who's that?

1345
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,098
You're no saint.

1346
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:26,724
[Del] I never did
introduce myself.

1347
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:27,733
Del Griffith.

1348
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,727
Del Griffith.

1349
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,736
Del Griffith.

1350
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,738
Del Griffith.

1351
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,172
I can take anything.

1352
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:39,804
Wow! Ha ha ha!

1353
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,679
Ha ha ha!

1354
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,308
I mean, that was close.

1355
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:47,879
You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1356
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,286
We can laugh
about it now.

1357
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,884
We're all right.
Ha ha ha!

1358
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:57,126
Del Griffith. Del Griffith.
D-D-D-Del...

1359
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:01,634
Who's that?

1360
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:03,861
You're no saint.

1361
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,208
Del Griffith.

1362
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,209
Who's that?

1363
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:13,937
I can take anything.

1364
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:27,791
We can laugh about it.

1365
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:32,288
How can you stand it?

1366
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:36,395
How can you stand it?

1367
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:38,904
Del Griffith.

1368
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:44,878
Who's that?

1369
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,450
Wow!

1370
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,290
How can you stand it?

1371
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:01,886
Del Griffith.

1372
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,260
How can you stand it?

1373
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,595
Ha ha ha!

1374
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,361
I mean, that was close.

1375
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,795
You're messing
with the wrong guy!

1376
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,237
We can laugh
about it now.

1377
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:15,366
We're all right.
Ha ha ha!

1378
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,108
Del Griffith. Del Griffith.
D-D-D-Del...

1379
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:24,550
Who's that?

1380
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,952
No saint.

1381
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:31,790
Del Griffith.

1382
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:32,791
Who's that?

1383
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,053
I can take anything.

1384
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,256
Here's two.

1385
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,268
You're three.
