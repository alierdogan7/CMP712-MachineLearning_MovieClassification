877
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,380
Oh!

878
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,786
Damn!

879
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,900
- Amber, get the first-aid kit.
- OK.

880
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,220
But it's just a cut. I got lots of 'em.

881
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,620
ROG: Here, here.

882
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,180
Man, you're bleeding all over the bar.

883
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,860
That's fine. Kid's got to do homework.

884
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,346
Come on, let's go.

885
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,140
- Hi, Mom.
- Where were you?

886
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,860
Where the hell is your car, Vin?

887
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,860
- It broke down.
- Broke down.

888
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,903
Oh, it broke down? Really?

889
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,942
I don't appreciate you
taking him anywhere without asking me.

890
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,900
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

891
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,140
Could you not be a smart-ass,
just for once? OK?

892
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,540
I want to know where my son is
at all times, OK?

893
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,180
- We just went to... eat.
- He should starve?

894
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,860
Go in the house, Oliver.

895
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,740
- Mom...
- Go in the house, Oliver.

896
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,540
Good night, Vin.

897
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,742
Yeah, we'll see about that.

898
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,420
You know, he's getting in fights
at school. Did you know that?

899
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,060
Yeah, he mentioned something like that.

900
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,100
Yeah? Well, he didn't mention
anything to me about it.

901
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,900
Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed,
but you haven't been home much.

902
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,980
It's difficult to have a conversation
with someone that's not here.

903
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,341
Oh, we're gonna do that?

904
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,980
God, I love when somebody like you
tells somebody like me advice,

905
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,180
especially on parenting.

906
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,940
I didn't sign on for the hormones,
dearie,

907
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,260
so that's gonna cost you
15 bucks an hour.

908
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,980
You know why you never had kids?

909
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,540
Because you don't want to think
about anybody other than yourself.

910
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,630
What do you know about me, really?

911
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,190
Tell me. I'd love it.

912
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,140
Nothing. I don't know a thing about you,
just the way you want it.

913
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,150
Then you can act like a prick
and it keeps everybody away.

914
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,980
If it ain't broken...

915
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,180
it is broken, Vin. Take a look at it.

916
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,660
All right, I'm at 40 hours
for this week.

917
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,147
At 41, I go to time and a half.

918
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,308
Excuse me, is someone gonna pay me?

919
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,984
You've got to be kidding me.

920
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,100
I can't even say these words.

921
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,745
They're creative.

922
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,380
- Yes.
- That's one way to put it.

Well, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
...adjusting to a new school

924

- is tough on children at this age.
- Yep.

925
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,380
At any age, really,
and I don't want to minimize that.

926
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,340
But is there anything else going on
that we should be aware of?

927
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,220
Oh, I wouldn't even know where to start.

928
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,340
- How about his father?
- Well,

929
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,860
I don't want to take up all your time.

930
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,940
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

931
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,869
- We have loads of time.
- (ABRUPTLY STOPS LAUGHING)

932
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,420
We're in the middle of a divorce.

933
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,940
Oliver's father was having
an affair with his assistant,

934
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,580
and our accountant,

935
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,100
and my hairdresser,
while she was still doing my hair,

936
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,820
so that was fun.

937
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,260
And now he's filed for custody
of Oliver,

938
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,180
full custody.

939
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,740
And he won't pay any support
until he gets what he wants.

940
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,980
- Plus, he's a lawyer.
- Shit.

941
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,900
So I just had to get out of there
as fast as I could,

942
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,420
and I took Oliver with me,

943
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,100
and I got a job at Mission Hills.

944
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm a CAT scan tech.

945
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,620
So I just see... really rough stuff
(VOICE BREAKING) all day.

946
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,060
You know, cancer and tumors

947
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,380
and cysts and clots,
and I see what I'm looking at,

948
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,900
but I can't tell, you know, the people

949
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,420
that are laying there,
so that's... miserable all day.

950
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,780
And I work really late,

951
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,668
because I'm trying
to get our act together.

952
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,940
(SOBBING) That's why he's here,
so he can have a good education,

953
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,060
and I'm trying to just give him
a semi-normal life,

954
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,980
and I'm dealing with this shit
from David and... custody.

955
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,182

I know he didn't even want kids.

958
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,220
He didn't want them.

959
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,740
He's just doing this so I'm not happy.

960
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,700
You know Oliver's adopted.

961
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,500
- Did you know that?
- BROTHER GERAGHTY: I didn't.

962
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,980
I don't know how you would, but he is.

963
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,220
And... I cannot have... kids.

964
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,060
You know, something about
my fallopian tubes being twisted.

965
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,500
I think, what I really think,

966
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,909
is that they were just recoiling
from David's sperm.

967
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,860
Can I... Can I just have one?

968
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,740
Thank you. Thank you for that.

has kind of permeated, you know,

I mean, it has to.

Ocinski's my last name.

People call me that ever since Geraghty
called me that last year.

976
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,820
Now everyone calls me that.

977

It's not like I can
go around and tell them,

I don't really know him,
'cause he left when I was a baby.

Yeah, my dad's not around, either.

01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,860
fighting, cursing and gambling.

1567
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,860
In 1965, as a member of the
United States Army's Fifth Regiment,

1568
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,900
Vincent was among the 450 soldiers

1569
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,220
dropped into the La Drang Valley
and immediately ambushed

1570
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,020
by 2,000 enemy troops.

1571
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,860
There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers

1572
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,780
pinned down by enemy fire
and carried them to safety.

1573
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,540
He was awarded the Bronze Star
for his bravery.

1574
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,420
I imagine the best way I can tell you

1575
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,260
who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is

1576
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,500
is to tell you what he's done for me.

1577
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,700
When me and my mom first moved here,
we knew no one,

1578
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,460
and Mr. MacKenna took me in
when he didn't have to,

1579
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,300
and most likely didn't want to.

1580
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,231
But he did it anyhow,
'cause that's what saints do.

1581
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,980
We visited his wife, Sandy,
of 40 years, who recently passed away.

1582
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,420
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years,

1583
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,380
long after she no longer recognized him.

1584
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,340
Because saints never give up.

1585
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,980
He taught me how to fight,

1586
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,060
how to stand my ground and be brave,

1587
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,180
how to speak up and be bold.

1588
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,780
Because saints fight
for themselves and others,

1589
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,780
so that they might be heard.

1590
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,540
He taught me how to gamble,
horse racing,

1591
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,620
Keno, the over and under,

1592
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,740
which is a big reason
why I'm grounded till I'm 18.

1593
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,740
(ALL LAUGHING)

1594
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,660
But in that, I learned how to take risks

1595
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,940
and go for broke.

1596
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,700
Because in life,
the odds can be stacked against you.

1597
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,540
This is Vin's cat, Felix,

1598
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,580
who eats gourmet cat food
while Vin eats sardines.

1599
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,260
'Cause saints make sacrifices.

1600
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,620
Yes, Mr. Vincent MacKenna is flawed,

1601
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,220
seriously flawed, but just like
all the other saints we studied.

1602
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,420
Because after all,
saints are human beings,

1603
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,380
very human beings.

1604
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,300
Courage, sacrifice,
compassion, humanity.

1605
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,460
These are the markings of a saint,

1606
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,620
and what makes Mr. Vincent MacKenna
not so far removed

1607
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,580
from Saint William of Rochester.

1608
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,820
And with that, I'd like to present
my friend and babysitter,

1609
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,580
Mr. Vincent MacKenna, for sainthood,

1610
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,540
and hereby proclaim him

I owe you money anyhow.

1617
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,191

1620
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,300
you can end up with...
