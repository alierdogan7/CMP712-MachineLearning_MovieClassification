1
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,177
l believe in
the Church of Baseball.

2
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,681
l've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

3
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,946
l've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu...

4
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,420
Siva, trees, mushrooms
and lsadora Duncan.

5
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,689
l know things.

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,955
For instance, there are 108 beads
in a Catholic rosary...

7
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,088
and there are 108 stitches
in a baseball.

8
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,655
When l learned that,
l gaveJesus a chance.

9
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,132
But it just didn't work out
between us.

10
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,638
The Lord laid
too much guilt on me.

11
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,037
l prefer metaphysics
to theology.

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,169
You see, there's no guilt
in baseball...

13
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,906
and it's never boring...

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,005
which makes it like sex.

15
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,110
There's never been a ballplayer
who slept with me...

16
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,483
who didn't have
the best year of his career.

17
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,283
Making love
is like hitting a baseball--

18
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,690
you just gotta relax
and concentrate.

19
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,996
Besides, l'd never sleep
with a player hitting under 250...

20
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,058
unless he had a lot of RBl's or was
a great glove man up the middle.

21
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,502
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom l give these boys.

22
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,839
l can expand their minds.

23
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,845
Sometimes when l've got
a ballplayer alone...

24
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,212
l'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

25
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,047
And the guys are so sweet,
they always stay and listen.

26
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,981
Of course, a guy will listen
to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

27
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,454
l make them feel confident,
and they make me feel safe...

28
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,222
and pretty.

29
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,062
Of course, what l give them
lasts a lifetime.

30
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,262
What they give me
lasts 142 games.

31
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,431
Sometimes it seems
like a bad trade...

32
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,702
but bad trades
is a part of baseball.

33
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,872
Who can forget Frank Robinson
for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?

34
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,007
lt's a long season,
and you gotta trust it.

35
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,017
l've tried 'em all,
l really have.

36
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,815
And the only church
that truly feeds the soul--

37
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,449
day in, day out--
is the Church of Baseball.

38
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,027
Hey, Skip, that Max,
hell of a guy.

39
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,793
Where's Ebby?

40
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,925
Ain't he warming up yet?

41
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,460
No. His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

42
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,734
Better find our "bonus baby."

43
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,633
Have you seen Ebby?

44
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,337
No.

45
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,448
Ebby!

46
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,684
Jesus.

47
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,251
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

48
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,194
l am warm.

49
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,733
Jesus, this is your
professional debut tonight.

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,894
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes.

51
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,905
You're leaving your fastball in
the locker room for some piece of ass.

52
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,134
Skip, it is me.

53
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,270
l am not some, quote,
piece of ass, unquote.

54
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,206
Oh, Millie.

55
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,013
Jeez, sorry.
Didn't recognize you.

56
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,488
Don't take this personally, Millie,
but if l catch you in here again...

57
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,319
you're banned from the ballpark.

58
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,383
You can't ban me
from the ballpark...

59
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,519
'cause my daddy
donated that scoreboard.

60
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,827
And if you ban me, he just might
take that scoreboard away.

61
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,129
What do we need
a scoreboard for?

62
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,396
We ain't scored any runs
all year.

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,836
Now you get your ass out there!

64
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,533
Hey, boss, l got a question.

65
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,269
What?

66
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,811
You think l need a nickname?
l think l need a nickname.

67
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,972
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

68
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,346
Like "Oil Can," "Catfish."
What was the one you were--

69
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,543
"Pokey."

70
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,415
What do you think of"Pokey"?

71
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,080
You got three minutes.

72
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,920
Goddamn, son of a bitchin',
motherfuckin' shithead!

73
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,051
Time for another quickie.

74
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,324
Jesus, you got
a game to pitch.

75
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,456
We got three minutes.

76
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,438
Come on, folks.
Let's hear it for Max Patkin--

77
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,606
the clown prince of baseball.

78
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,707
You gonna sit there all day?

79
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,945
And now
"The Greatest Show on Dirt"...

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,989
your own Durham Bulls!

81
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,627
l'm there. l'm ready.

82
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,263
And now WRDU radio presents...

83
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,828
the voice of the Durham Bulls,
Teddy Garland.

84
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,670
The Bulls off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games.

85
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,473
But hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut...

86
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,413
of heralded young pitcher,
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

87
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,354
Millie, you gotta stay out
of the clubhouse.

88
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,945
You're gonna get everybody
in trouble.

89
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,887
l got lured.

90
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,085
You did not get lured.
Women do not get lured.

91
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,287
They are too strong and powerful
for that. Now say it...

92
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,331
"l did not get lured. l accept
full responsibility for my actions."

93
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,766
"l did not get lured. l accept
full responsibility for my actions."

94
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,601
That's better.
You got your radar ready?

95
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,537
- Ready.
- Go to it.

96
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,803
Steppin' in
for the Peninsula White Sox...

97
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,846
is leadoff hitter Willie Foster.

98
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,006
Word on LaLoosh is that
the good-looking, young pitcher...

99
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,711
has a major-league fastball, but
sometimes has problems with control.

100
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,567
Damn.

101
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,400
One ball, no strikes
to Willie Foster.

102
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,502
No problem!

103
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,672
Go get 'em, one, two, three, babe.
Get 'em, big guy.

104
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,581
Ninety-five miles an hour.

105
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,177
That's great.
He looks just great.

106
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,996
Stepping in
for the Peninsula White Sox...

107
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,363
second baseman Allen Powley.

108
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,662
What's it say?

109
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,227
lt says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

110
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,106
Scotty, baby, take this
to Ebby Calvin.

111
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,639
All right, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

112
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,207
Well, he fucks
like he pitches.

113
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,947
Sort of all over the place.

114
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,742
My!

115
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,754
He walked 18.

116
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,919
A new league record.

117
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,159
- Struck out 18.
- Another new league record.

118
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,462
ln addition, he hit
the sportswriter...

119
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,800
the public address announcer,
the Bull mascot twice.

120
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,601
Also, new league records.

121
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,443
But,Joe...

122
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,708
this guy's got
some serious shit.

123
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,841
Yeah, serious shit.

124
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,791
Who are you?
Who's he?

125
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,351
l'm "the player
to be named later."

126
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,626
Crash Davis?
l'm Joe Riggins.

127
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,198
And you, Larry Hockett,
should recognize me...

128
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,363
'cause five years ago
in the Texas League...

129
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,374
you were pitching for El Paso,
l was hitting cleanup for Shreveport.

130
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,878
You hung a curveball
on an 0-2 pitch in a 3-2 game...

131
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,076
in the bottom of the eighth,
and l tattooed it...

132
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,778
over the Michelin Tire sign,
beat you 4-3.

133
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,786
l remember. l should have
thrown a slider.

134
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,446
Damn, Crash, how ya doin?

135
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,821
l'm too old for this shit.

136
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,127
Why in the hell
am l back in A ball?

137
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,596
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

138
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,428
Big club's got
a hundred grand in him.

139
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,162
He's got a million-dollar arm
with a five-cent head.

140
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,904
Had a gun on him tonight.

141
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,965
Last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

142
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,006
He's got the best young arm
l've seen in 30 years.

143
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,775
You've been around.

144
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,180
You're smart.
You're a professional.

145
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,185
We want you to mature the kid.

146
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,154
We want you to room with him
on the road.

147
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,750
Stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.

148
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,325
Yeah? Where can l go?

149
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,921
You can keep going
to the ballpark...

150
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,729
keep getting paid to do it.

151
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,666
Beats the hell out of
working at Sears.

152
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,106
Sears sucks. l once worked there.
Sold Lady Kenmores.

153
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,903
Nasty work.

154
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,945
Even if it is
the Carolina League...

155
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,878
this is a chance
to play every day.

156
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,212
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

157
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,181
No.

158
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,185
My triple A contract
gets bought out...

159
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,687
so l can hold the flavor
of the month's dick.

160
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,623
ls that it?
Fuck this fucking game!

161
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,062
l fuckin' quit, all right?

162
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,822
Who we play tomorrow?

163
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,224
Winston-Salem.
Batting practice, 11:30.

164
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,760
How's it feel to get
your first professional win?

165
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,395
lt feels out there.
lt's a major rush.

166
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,601
lt doesn't just feel out there,
it feels out there.

167
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,508
Kind of radical
in a kind of tubular way.

168
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,341
But most of all,
it's out there.

169
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:59,077
This is hopeless.
This is utterly, fucking hopeless.

170
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,164
Hey, l'm Millie.

171
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,264
l'm Tony.
l play second base.

172
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,427
l know.

173
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,569
How do you just keep
coming back every year?

174
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,872
'Cause l love the game, Annie.
l love it.

175
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,038
- Here you go.
- We didn't order these.

176
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,945
- He did.
- Who?

177
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,880
The guy in the booth.

178
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,513
Who's that?

179
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,158
That's Crash Davis.
Hey, Crash, come here.

180
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,694
Get over here.

181
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,498
He's kinda cute.

182
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,125
He's played in more ballparks
than l have.

183
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,566
Hell of a guy.

184
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,661
He's really different.

185
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,832
l actually saw him read a book
without pictures once.

186
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,039
- Hi, Max.
- How you doing?

187
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,673
Come over and sit down.

188
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,683
l'm Crash.

189
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,914
Annie Savoy.
Wanna dance?

190
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,478
l don't dance.

191
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,751
How embarrassing.

192
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,091
What is that?

193
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,740
Who's he dancing with?

194
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,042
All of them, l think.

195
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,657
You Annie Savoy?

196
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,720
Thanks for your note. You're right.
l wasn't bending my back.

197
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,561
You have a live arm there.

198
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,533
Thanks.

199
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,036
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

200
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,765
You need a nickname, honey.

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,865
l've been telling
everybody that.

202
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,644
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

203
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,577
She's dancing with me.

204
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,808
'Fraid not, pal.

205
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,716
You boys gonna fight
over little ol' me?

206
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,619
- No.
- Let's go.

207
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,659
Step outside and party, man.

208
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,987
Don't be such guys.

209
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,930
Max, let's dance.

210
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,775
You comin' or not, homeboy?

211
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,516
Let's go. Come on.
We're waitin'.

212
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,153
- Let's go, homeboy.
- Come on, Ebby. There he is.

213
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,104
l don't believe in fighting.
Let's just--

214
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,341
That's really sweet.
Fuck you, you pussy.

215
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,483
All right.
Take the first shot at me.

216
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,021
No way.
l don't hit no man first.

217
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,193
All right, then.

218
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,788
Hit me in the chest
with that.

219
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,628
l'd kill you.

220
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,263
From what l hear,
you couldn't hit water...

221
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,398
if you fell out of
a fuckin' boat.

222
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,374
Go ahead, man.

223
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,245
Go ahead, come on.
Right in the chest.

224
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,581
- No way.
- Come on, Meat.

225
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,485
You're not gonna hit me 'cause
you're thinking about it already.

226
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,024
Starting to think
how embarrassing it would be...

227
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,061
to miss in front of these people,
how somebody might laugh.

228
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,827
Come on, Rook.
Show us that million-dollar arm...

229
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,563
'cause l got a good idea
about that five-cent head of yours.

230
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,070
Hit 'im, man!

231
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,000
Fuck!

232
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,340
Ball four.

233
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,746
Who the fuck are you?

234
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,853
Good punch.

235
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,858
l'm Crash Davis.
l'm your new catcher...

236
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,793
and you just got
lesson number one:

237
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,954
Don't think.

238
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,055
lt can only hurt the ball club.

239
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,472
Come inside,
l'll buy you a drink.

240
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,279
He's my new catcher.

241
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,560
We fight, she gets the clown.
How's that happen?

242
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,662
God, l like this song.

243
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,672
Did you boys stop fightin'?

244
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,306
Pals now?

245
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,510
That's good.

246
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,884
l love a little
macho male bonding.

247
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,923
l think it's sweet.
l do.

248
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,960
Even if it probably is latent
homosexuality being rechanneled.

249
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,325
l'm all for rechanneling,
so who cares, right?

250
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,762
Okay, shall we go to my place?

251
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,540
Which one of us?

252
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,632
Both of you, of course.

253
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,214
These are the ground rules.

254
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,908
l hook up with one guy a season.

255
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,451
Usually takes me a couple weeks
to pick the guy.

256
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,714
Kind of my own spring training.

257
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,452
You two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

258
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,924
l just thought we should kinda
get to know each other.

259
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,399
Time-out.
Why do you get to choose?

260
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,765
- Why?
- Why do you get to choose?

261
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,828
Why don't l get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

262
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:05,036
Actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

263
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,408
lt's all a question
of quantum physics...

264
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,413
molecular attraction
and timing.

265
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,348
Laws we don't understand that
bring us together and tear us apart.

266
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,576
lt's like pheromones.

267
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,418
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

268
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,051
You get 300 million of them,
they can build a cathedral.

269
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,531
ls somebody gonna go to bed
with somebody?

270
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,965
Honey, you are a regular
nuclear meltdown.

271
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,764
You better cool off.

272
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,835
Where you going?

273
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,969
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
l don't try out.

274
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,774
Besides...

275
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,975
l don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

276
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,449
What do you believe in, then?

277
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,148
l believe in the soul...

278
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,851
the cock, the pussy...

279
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,985
the small of a woman's back...

280
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,962
the hanging curveball,
high-fiver, good scotch...

281
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,558
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

282
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,727
l believe Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone.

283
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,033
l believe there oughta be
a constitutional amendment...

284
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,403
outlawing Astroturf
and the designated hitter.

285
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,443
l believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography...

286
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,139
open your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve...

287
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,274
and l believe in long, slow,
deep, soft, wet kisses...

288
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,942
that last three days.

289
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,817
Good night.

290
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,186
Oh, my.

291
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,120
Hey, what's all
this molecule stuff?

292
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,857
Crash, wait!

293
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,490
All's l want is a date.

294
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,831
l'm not gonna fall in love
with you or nothing.

295
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,464
l'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in that boy.

296
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,700
Good night.

297
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,174
- l'm not interested yet.
- Who you calling a boy?

298
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,871
See you at the yard, Meat.

299
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,472
Damn, nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

300
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,380
He's crazy.

301
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,009
l want you bad.

302
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,827
Honey, hold on.
Slow down.

303
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,126
l wanna watch.

304
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,395
Go ahead.
Put it back on.

305
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,071
Jesus, what kind
of chick are you?

306
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,510
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

307
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,877
l know how to pitch.

308
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,407
Good.

309
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,717
Now take it off slowly.

310
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,865
That's nice.

311
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,912
Oh, my, what a nice back.

312
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,413
Honey. Sweetheart.

313
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,079
Try taking off
your shoes and socks first.

314
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,715
My socks?
lt's cold in here.

315
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,517
What?

316
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,857
You think Dwight Gooden
leaves his socks on?

317
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,827
Ebby, honey.

318
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,900
Have you ever been
tied up in bed?

319
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,591
Bring it on, baby!

320
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,760
l heard about shit like this.

321
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,804
You ever heard
about Walt Whitman?

322
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,032
Who's he play for?

323
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,540
He sort of pitches
for the Cosmic All-Stars.

324
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,873
- Never heard of him.
- Oh, good.

325
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,206
Listen to this.

326
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,680
"l sing the body electric.

327
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,619
The armies of those l love
engirth me and l engirth them.

328
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,316
They will not let me off
till l go with them...

329
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,382
respond to them
and discorrupt them...

330
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,520
and charge them full
with the charge of the soul.

331
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,430
But the expression of a well-made man
appears not only in his face...

332
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,234
it is in his limbs
and joints also."

333
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:07,301
Excuse me.
Are we gonna fuck or what?

334
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,651
"lt is curiously in the joints
of his hips and wrists.

335
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,211
Love flesh swelling
and deliciously aching.

336
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,660
Limitless limpid jets of love,
hot and enormous."

337
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,067
Listen up, guys.
Can l have your attention a minute?

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,403
l'm gonna be leading a daily chapel
service here in the locker room...

339
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,841
- at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- Amen, brother!

340
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,209
Y'all are invited to stop on by
and worship before batting practice.

341
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,113
Jimmy, goddamn it.
Loosen up and get laid.

342
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,786
l know y'all think
l'm pretty square, but...

343
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,448
l believe what l believe.

344
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,157
Jesus, Ebby, you look like
a truck ran over you.

345
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,967
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

346
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,831
Annie says
it's my new nickname.

347
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,533
Okay, Nuke. Go get 'em.

348
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,405
Annie nailed you?
Annie did?

349
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,740
That's great. That means
you're gonna have a great year.

350
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,181
ls she as good as they say?

351
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,085
No, man, we didn't fuck.

352
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,588
No, she read poetry
to me all night.

353
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,922
lt's more tiring than fucking.

354
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,360
"Limpid jets of love."

355
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:42,296
Hey, Crash. Does that mean
what l think it means?

356
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,137
"Limpid jets of love."

357
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,643
Your shower shoes
have fungus on them.

358
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,943
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

359
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,712
Think classy,
you'll be classy.

360
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,446
lf you win 20 in the Show...

361
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,988
you can let the fungus
grow back on your shower shoes...

362
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,081
and the press will think
you're colorful.

363
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,025
Until you win 20
in the Show, however...

364
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,824
means you're a slob.

365
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,465
Y'all don't forget
Saturday is Bull Day...

366
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,301
down at the Northgate Mall.

367
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,568
Strike!

368
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,610
Whoa, too bad, Butch.

369
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,947
Charge!

370
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,912
Not getting that cheese
by me, Meat.

371
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:32,184
And now batting for the Bulls,
number eight, Crash Davis.

372
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,832
Foul ball!

373
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,496
God, stupid fuck, Crash.

374
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,505
What'd you swing
at a breaking ball for?

375
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,699
Fuck me.

376
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,945
You usually start me off
with a hammer.

377
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,883
You're thinking too much, Crash.
Get out of your fuckin'head.

378
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,886
Don't let him in your kitchen.

379
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,651
Come on, Crash.Just relax.
You got it, honey.

380
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,660
All right, here we go.
Stay back. Relax.

381
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,161
Quick bat.

382
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,491
Foul ball!

383
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,666
Throw that shit again, Meat.
Throw that weak-ass shit again.

384
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,372
Okay, get close.
You got it. One more, baby.

385
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,942
He's gonna throw the deuce now.

386
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,676
He's gotta waste one.

387
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,345
Stay back and wipe that
silly grin off his face.

388
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,048
Come on. Bring it.

389
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,883
Jesus Christ!

390
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,892
What the hell was that?

391
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,757
What goes around,
comes around.

392
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,693
Son of a bitch throws hard.

393
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,429
lt's okay, Crash.
You take it easy, honey.

394
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,940
All right, one and two.
You can eat this shit. Relax.

395
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,738
Annie.

396
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,642
Who's this Annie?

397
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,443
Jesus, get out of the box, idiot.
Where's your head?

398
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,450
Get the broad
outta your head!

399
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,644
Time-out!

400
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,980
Give me a rag.

401
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,090
Get a hit, Crash.

402
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,223
Shut up.

403
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,665
All right, you've seen
all his pitches.

404
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,470
You've seen them all.

405
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,877
Shorten up, Crash.
Bring me the gas, kid.

406
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,452
Quick bat.

407
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,649
Strike!

408
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,695
Scotty, baby,
take this to Crash.

409
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,265
Folks, we have
a little lost girl up here.

410
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:01,066
Says her name is Lana Ann Baker.

411
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,073
- She'll be waiting...
- lt's for Crash.

412
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,302
at the ticket box
for her daddy, Cedar Baker.

413
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,469
Cedar, come get
your little girl.

414
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,070
- What?
- From Annie.

415
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,274
Read it.

416
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,748
"Dear Crash, you have
a lovely swing...

417
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,450
but you're pulling
your hips out too early.

418
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,222
l'd be happy to meet you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it.

419
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,887
Signed, Annie."

420
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,456
lf there's one chick who'd know
you were pulling your hips out early...

421
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,796
it'd be Annie.

422
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,444
lt's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

423
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,572
There you go.

424
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,358
Here, Millie.

425
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,915
What's it say?

426
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:01,227
lt says, "l wanna make love
to you. Crash."

427
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,025
Oh, my.

428
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,240
See my hips?

429
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,403
Yep.

430
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,916
And l think Susan Sontag
is brilliant.

431
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,545
ls this gonna happen? Us?

432
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,354
l'm committed to Nuke
for the season.

433
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,552
Oh.

434
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,392
You had your chance
the other day.

435
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,523
What is it you see in this guy?

436
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,559
He's a young, wild...

437
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,434
dim, pretty boy.

438
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,669
Young men are uncomplicated.

439
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,701
And he's not dim.
He's just inexperienced.

440
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,448
lt's my job
to give him life wisdom...

441
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,610
and help him get on
to the major leagues.

442
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,086
That's funny,
that's my job too.

443
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,623
Damn!

444
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,620
You're pulling your hips.

445
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,630
l know,
but they're nice hips.

446
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,529
l looked up your records.

447
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,624
You what?

448
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,329
You hit 22 7 home runs
in the minors.

449
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,098
That's not bad.

450
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,833
Don't tell anybody.

451
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,875
Why not?
You hit 20 more this year...

452
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,876
you're gonna be the all-time
minor-league champ.

453
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,070
The record's 246.

454
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,080
Well, 24 7 home runs
in the minor leagues...

455
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,276
would be a kind of
dubious honor.

456
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,344
l think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know it.

457
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,822
No.Just no. Please.

458
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,651
Okay.

459
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,697
Last chance,
your place or mine?

460
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,667
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics...

461
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,763
l am, within the framework
of the baseball season, monogamous.

462
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,536
- Gimme a break.
- lt's true.

463
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,702
Stop it.

464
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,978
Jeez, the fact is...

465
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,518
you're afraid of meeting a guy
like me, 'cause it might be real...

466
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,352
so you sabotage it with some,
what is it...

467
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,358
bullshit about commitment
to a young boy you can boss around.

468
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,326
That's a great deal.

469
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,521
Nice.

470
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,325
l know women like you.

471
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,498
You're a regular
patron saint.

472
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,800
Stray cats, lost causes...

473
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,741
or 6'3" homeless studs.

474
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,643
Oh, Crash,
you do make speeches.

475
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,323
Crash, that was fabulous.

476
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,224
Crash?

477
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,635
You mean Nuke.
You said Crash.

478
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,971
No, l said Nuke.

479
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,511
You said Crash.

480
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,103
Oh, no.

481
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,149
Sweetie, you shouldn't listen
to what a woman says...

482
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,413
when she's in the throes
of passion.

483
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,716
They say the darndest things.

484
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,585
Yeah, you said Crash.

485
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,025
Honey...

486
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,562
would you rather l'd be making love
to him using your name...

487
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,757
or making love to you
using his name?

488
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,463
Yeah, maybe you're right.

489
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,275
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers...

490
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,407
City Council Little League
Cash Drop Day.

491
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,921
These young fellas-- young men,
l should say-- over here to my left.

492
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,014
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

493
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,558
Hey, Dino.

494
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,756
Hey, Millie.

495
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,865
Hey. l'm Millie.

496
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,105
l'm married.

497
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,982
What is that?

498
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,211
Chicken bone cross.

499
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,617
Takes the curse off the bat
that brings me hits.

500
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,115
What are you,
a goddamn witch?

501
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,183
Yes, a switch-hitting witch.

502
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,353
Will that work for me?

503
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,456
lf you believe in voodoo.

504
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,434
Jose, l am zero for 16.

505
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,527
A big fucking
doughnut hole for 16.

506
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,198
l can't remember the last time
l had a base hit.

507
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,105
Let me have
some of that stuff.

508
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,804
That is not belief.
That's desperation.

509
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,109
Jose, come on.
Just touch my bat once.

510
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,949
Come on, just once. l won't
bother you the rest of the day.

511
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,953
l swear to God.
Just touch the bat once.

512
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
five, four...

513
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,654
three, two, one.

514
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,288
Let it go!

515
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,026
One thousand big ones!

516
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,012
That batter ain't nothin'.
Come on, Nuke.

517
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,386
Cut it!

518
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,887
Time-out.

519
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,127
Let's play ball!

520
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,996
Stay there.
Give me the ball.

521
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,071
Hey.

522
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,439
Relax, all right?

523
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,035
Don't try to strike
everybody out.

524
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,479
Strikeouts are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

525
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,847
Throw some ground balls.

526
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,284
More democratic.

527
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,413
What's this guy know, anyway?

528
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,481
lf he's so great, how come he's
been in the minors for ten years?

529
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,790
lf he's so hot, how come Annie
wants me instead of him?

530
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,298
And another thing, Meat,
you don't know shit.

531
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,527
You wanna make it to the Show,
you'll listen to me.

532
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,365
Annie only wants you 'cause
she can boss you around. Got it?

533
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,869
Relax. Let's have
some fun out here.

534
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,068
This game's fun.

535
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,270
Fun, goddamn it.

536
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,836
And don't hold the ball so hard.

537
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,884
lt's an egg.
Hold it like an egg.

538
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,455
What's he know about fun?
l'm young. l know about fun.

539
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,255
Old man, he don't know
nothin' about fun.

540
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,558
Nobody's goin' out there.

541
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,528
Why's he calling
for a curveball?

542
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,228
l wanna bring heat.

543
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,733
Shake him off.
Throw what you want.

544
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,144
Goddamn it. Time-out.

545
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,674
Hey, why you shaking me off?

546
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,647
l wanna bring the heater.
Announce my presence with authority.

547
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,123
- To announce what?
- Announce my presence with authority.

548
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,126
"Announce your presence
with authority"?

549
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,321
This guy's a fastball hitter,
looking for heat.

550
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,330
So what.
He ain't seen my heat.

551
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,262
All right, Meat.
Give him your heat.

552
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,165
Why does he always call me Meat?

553
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,177
l'm the guy driving a Porsche.

554
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,441
Fastball.

555
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,847
Come on, Nuke. Settle down.
Take your time.

556
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,527
Home run for Bud Shelton
of the Fayetteville Generals.

557
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,537
What are you doing standing here?
l gave you a gift.

558
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,631
You stand here showing up
my pitcher? Run, dummy!

559
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,472
Give me the ball.

560
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,382
He really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

561
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,518
Held it like an egg.

562
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,317
And he scrambled the son of a bitch.
He hit the fuckin' bull.

563
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,585
Guy gets a free steak.

564
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,626
You havin' fun yet?

565
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,287
Oh, yeah,
l've havin' a blast.

566
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,489
Good.

567
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,692
Sucker teed off on that like he knew
l was gonna throw a fastball.

568
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,602
- He did know.
- How?

569
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,934
l told him.

570
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,732
One down now!

571
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,007
Come on, Nuke. You're the man.
No batter. Chuck hard, baby.

572
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,571
Don't think, just throw.

573
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,627
Strike!

574
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,760
God, that was beautiful.
What did l do?

575
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,472
Hang on, Millie.
Here we go again.

576
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:32,424
That's the first home run
of the year for Crash Davis.

577
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,906
That brings the score to
Fayetteville 14, Durham 2.

578
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,571
Hell of a shot.

579
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,579
Sorry it got wasted.

580
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,807
l don't know what to do
with these guys.

581
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,582
l beg. l plead.
l try to be a nice guy.

582
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,714
l'm a nice guy.

583
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,690
They're kids. Scare 'em.

584
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,757
That's what l'd do.

585
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,492
Yeah.

586
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,302
Everybody into the shower!

587
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,210
Anybody ain't in this shower
in ten seconds gonna get fined $100.

588
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,214
- Larry.
- One Mississippi...

589
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,182
two Mississippi,
three Mississippi...

590
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,049
- four Mississippi.
- Get in there! Hurry it up!

591
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,953
seven Mississippi,
eight Mississippi...

592
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,786
nine Mississippi,
ten Mississippi.

593
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:33,091
You guys, you lollygag the ball
around the infield.

594
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,724
You lollygag your way
down to first.

595
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,395
You lollygag
in and out of the dugout.

596
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,337
You know what that
makes you? Larry.

597
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,306
Lollygaggers.

598
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,742
- What's our record, Larry?
- Eight and sixteen.

599
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,781
Eight and sixteen.

600
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,176
How'd we ever win eight?

601
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,309
lt's a miracle.

602
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,248
This is a simple game.

603
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,559
You throw the ball.

604
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,390
You hit the ball.

605
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,732
You catch the ball.

606
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,596
You got it!

607
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,199
We have got a 12-day road trip...

608
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,264
starting tomorrow.

609
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,970
Bus leaves 6:00 in the morning.

610
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,881
Goddamn, son of a bitchin',
motherfuckin' shithead. Goddamn it!

611
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,221
Yeah, Skipper,
you wanted to see me?

612
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,747
Yeah, Bobby.
Shut the door.

613
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,234
This the toughest job
a manager has.

614
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:54,005
But the organization
has decided to make a change.

615
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,239
They're releasing you
from your contract.

616
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,079
Skip, l know l'm in a goddamn slump,
but l hit the ball hard today.

617
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,051
Couple flares drop in for me,
l'm right back in the groove.

618
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,650
Sorry.

619
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,027
Let's go. Come on.

620
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,263
Nuke, honey!

621
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,506
Let's go.
We got five hours.

622
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,804
Honey, l want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

623
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,746
- What are they?
- They're garters.

624
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,011
They're gonna hug your waist
and snuggle...

625
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,280
and dangle off your thighs
and buns in such a wonderful way.

626
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,015
lt'll help you see things
differently.

627
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,421
Plus, it'll remind you of me,
which is a lot nicer...

628
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,858
than thinking about
all those nasty hitters.

629
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,761
Jesus, Annie, l don't know.

630
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,764
You've been pitching
on the wrong side of your brain.

631
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,925
This will help put things
on the right side.

632
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,697
Big-league pitchers
don't use these.

633
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,239
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

634
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,743
Nuke, excuse me.
Time to go to work.

635
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,902
All right.

636
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,213
Bye, y'all.

637
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,549
Gimme a break.

638
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,289
Go get 'em, boys!
Hit 'em where they ain't.

639
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,542
She may get woolly

640
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,619
Young girls
they do get woolly

641
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:46,247
'Cause of all the stress

642
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,518
Yeah

643
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,323
When they get woolly

644
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:57,629
Try a little tenderness

645
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,566
Stop it.

646
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,571
Thank you.

647
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,663
What?

648
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,731
lt's not "woolly."

649
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,969
Nobody gets "woolly."
Women get "weary."

650
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,239
They don't get "woolly."

651
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,645
Nobody's got "stress,"
they're wearing a "dress."

652
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,945
Damn, l hate people
that get the words wrong.

653
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,447
How come you don't like me?

654
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,582
You don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

655
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,425
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

656
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,398
- You got a gift.
- What do l got?

657
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,934
You got a gift. When you were
a baby, the gods reached down...

658
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,197
and turned your right arm
into a thunderbolt.

659
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,001
You got a Hall-of-Fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

660
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,702
l ain't pissing nothing away.
l got a Porsche already.

661
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,905
l got a 9-11,
with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

662
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,971
You don't need
a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

663
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,983
What you need is a curveball.

664
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,281
ln the Show, everybody
can hit a fastball.

665
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,344
How would you know?

666
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,253
You've been in the majors?

667
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,625
Yeah, l've been in the majors.

668
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,994
You were?

669
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,090
You've been in the Show?

670
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,101
Yeah, l was in the Show.

671
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,230
l was in the Show
for 21 days once.

672
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,070
Twenty-one greatest days
of my life.

673
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,242
You never handle your luggage
in the Show.

674
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,009
Somebody else
carries your bags.

675
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,948
lt's great.

676
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,578
You hit white balls
for batting practice.

677
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,814
Ballparks are like cathedrals.

678
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,621
The hotels
all have room service.

679
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,957
The women all have
long legs and brains.

680
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,598
They're really hot?

681
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,366
Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

682
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,907
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the Show.

683
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,670
Exploding sliders.

684
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,547
You could be one of those guys.

685
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,615
Nuke could be one of those guys,
but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

686
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,144
l am sick and fuckin' tired of you
calling me Meat.

687
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,684
You wanna step outside?

688
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,228
Yeah, l'll step outside.

689
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,030
What's the problem?
What's happening?

690
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:19,041
l was just gonna ask Crash to show me
how to throw a breaking ball.

691
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,704
Good idea.
Did anybody bring a ball?

692
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,815
Double off the wall by Higgins.

693
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,786
Once again, Durham pitchers are unable
to get the first out of the inning.

694
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,005
The Bulls will attempt to end
a six-game losing streak...

695
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,139
against the Greensboro Hornets
with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.

696
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,921
Base hit to center field
off LaLoosh.

697
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,662
That closes the book
on LaLoosh today.

698
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,297
Five earned runs,
five hits, five strikeouts...

699
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,671
five walks
and five wild pitches.

700
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,040
lt's time to tell it
like it is, sports fans.

701
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,342
This is the most wretched
road trip l've seen in 20 years.

702
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,508
And possibly the worst Durham team
in half a century.

703
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,712
ls the modern-day athlete a pale
imitation of the great warriors?

704
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,778
Only Crash Davis
stands out this year.

705
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,222
Begging the question, what are
these boys thinking about?

706
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,055
'Cause it sure ain't baseball.

707
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,438
Hey, Mr. Hormone,
check out this.

708
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,780
lce-skaters.
God, look at 'em.

709
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,150
Hey, fellas,
that's what we need, man.

710
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,781
One night with these skaters,
we can get right back on track.

711
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:47,789
Yeah, right.

712
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,418
Just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

713
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,621
What we need is a rain-out.

714
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,391
l can get us a rain-out.

715
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,898
There ain't been a cloud
in the sky in weeks.

716
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,296
Hundred bucks says l can get us
a rain-out for tomorrow.

717
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,909
You're on.

718
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,448
l ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

719
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,821
Shut up. You're gonna
wake everybody up.

720
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,951
Let the bonus baby
pay for it.

721
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,987
Jesus, man.

722
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,375
Crash, what are you doing?

723
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,751
Oh, my goodness!

724
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,530
We got ourselves
a natural disaster.

725
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,468
Wake up.

726
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,567
You're awake.

727
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,702
You're okay.

728
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:58,712
You were dreaming.

729
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,410
You're okay.

730
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,887
l was playing damn near naked.

731
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,823
- What?
- l was naked.

732
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,984
Playing naked.

733
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,120
l know.

734
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,631
l know. l had that dream
all the time too.

735
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,230
We're almost home.

736
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,545
Watch your head.

737
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,104
Here you go.
Let me get that back there.

738
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,810
- l'm not your slave.
- No, that one over there.

739
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,253
Hi.

740
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,042
God, l'm tired.

741
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,718
What a trip.

742
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,257
l was lousy.
l was worse than lousy.

743
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:20,888
But every time l pitched, it was
like throwing gasoline on a fire.

744
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,634
l mean--

745
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,866
What is all this l, l, l?
What about me?

746
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,931
Aren't you glad to see me?

747
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,067
Don't l look nice?

748
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,577
You look great.
l'm sorry.

749
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,013
l'm just totally exhausted.

750
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,348
Good. Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

751
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,753
What you need
is a good game of catch.

752
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:47,915
Catch?

753
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,022
Baby, come on.
Fire one in here.

754
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,427
This is ridiculous.
l'm a professional.

755
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:57,125
Will you just give it a try
and lean in?

756
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,795
Thank you.

757
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,301
l want you to breathe
through your eyelids.

758
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,307
My eyelids?

759
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,640
Like the lava lizards
of the Galapagos lslands.

760
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,840
Some have a parietal eye behind their
heads so they can see backwards.

761
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,213
Haven't you ever noticed
how Fernando Valenzuela...

762
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,378
he just doesn't even look
when he pitches?

763
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,513
He's a Mayan lndian.

764
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,682
Or an Aztec. l forget which one.
l get 'em confused.

765
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,022
- So do l.
- Stand up for a second.

766
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,028
l want you to be aware
of the chakra connection...

767
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,030
between your feet
and your testicles.

768
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,067
- Chakra.
- Your right leg and left testicle...

769
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,726
and your left leg
and your right testicle.

770
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,133
l like that.

771
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,501
l bet you do.

772
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,699
Give me the ball.
l'm tired of hearing this.

773
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,708
Fire one in there.
Come on.

774
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,306
Okay.

775
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:47,414
You're patronizing me,
and l will not be patronized.

776
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,544
lf l throw too hard,
l'm gonna hurt the girl.

777
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,713
This girl has handled
a lot of pitchers...

778
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,724
whose records
are a lot better than 1-7.

779
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,818
1-6. Give me
the goddamn ball.

780
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,234
- How do you like that?
- That was much better.

781
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,433
You see that? Because your delivery
was fully integrated...

782
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,306
'cause you weren't thinking about it
'cause you were pissed off at me.

783
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,902
That's progress.
Get your butt up here.

784
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,914
Let's bend over,
and l'm gonna show you--

785
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,214
l give up. Let's go inside
and make love and fall asleep...

786
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,413
until it's time
to go to the ballpark.

787
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:31,318
Or we could just take
all that sexual energy...

788
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,522
and kind of hold
onto it for a few hours...

789
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,998
and then rechannel it
into your pitching tonight.

790
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,165
You're a powerful young thing,
Ebby Calvin.

791
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,042
You want something
for that sore shoulder?

792
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,944
l want that shit
that don't smell bad.

793
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,949
- lt's on back order.
- Give him some of that shit.

794
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,295
That's hot.

795
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,231
l mean it,
that's very hot.

796
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,700
Annie says it'll keep
one side of my brain...

797
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,832
occupied while l'm on the mound,
keeping my brain slightly off center...

798
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,376
which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers.

799
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,371
Okay.

800
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:30,714
She also said l should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

801
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,089
Annie's a very smart lady.

802
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,486
What?

803
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,996
The rose goes in the front,
big guy.

804
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,740
Now batting
for the Salem Buffs...

805
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,241
center fielder, Joe McCorkle.

806
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,209
This underwear
feels kinda sexy.

807
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,680
That don't make me
queer, right? Right.

808
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,823
Breaking ball.

809
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,352
Yeah!

810
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,558
All right!
Way to start, baby.

811
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,761
l ain't queer.
No, l ain't.

812
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,534
Fastball.

813
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,813
Strike!

814
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,916
Ninety-six miles an hour.
He looks good...

815
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,851
but why is he all
twisting up like that?

816
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,584
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

817
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,922
That was a humdinger.

818
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,394
Yeah.

819
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,095
Fastball again?
Why's he want the heat?

820
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,568
l just threw heat.
Don't think, Meat.

821
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,662
Just give 'em the gas.

822
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,602
Strike!

823
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,009
Jesus, what's got into Nuke?

824
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,447
He's wearing garters...

825
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,782
and he's breathing out of his eyelids
like a lava lizard.

826
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,446
lt's an old Mayan deal.

827
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,387
- Aztec.
- Aztec deal.

828
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,457
Got it!

829
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,590
l got it!

830
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,070
Way to go. Hustle in!

831
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,332
Have my mojo working.

832
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,502
You know what a mojo is?

833
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:37,136
- Sure.
- No, you don't.

834
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,306
l was great, huh?

835
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,146
Your fastball was up.
Your curveball was hanging.

836
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,017
ln the Show,
they would have ripped you.

837
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,290
Can't you even let me
enjoy the moment?

838
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,917
The moment's over.

839
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,928
Come on, Crash.

840
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,229
This guy starts me off
with a breaking ball...

841
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,229
l'm taking him downtown.

842
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,735
l dare you
to throw me the hammer.

843
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,078
You ain't that stupid.

844
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,174
Stepping up to the plate
for Durham, our own Crash Davis.

845
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,845
Come on. Put your hands
together for Crash.

846
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,081
Let's hear it!

847
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,884
Let's go.

848
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,861
Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit.

849
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,363
Bring it.

850
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,397
Oh, my.

851
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,776
Two-nothing
Bulls in the second.

852
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,749
First time the Bulls have been
ahead in weeks, eh, Whitey?

853
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:49,842
Mm-hmm.

854
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,944
Let's see if the real
Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

855
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,456
There you go!
Dig in there!

856
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:06,801
Back!

857
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,530
Crash, you got room!

858
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,115
What are you doing out here?
l'm cruising.

859
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,146
l want you to throw
the next one at the mascot.

860
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,313
l'm finally throwing it
where l want to throw it.

861
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,448
Just throw it at the bull,
all right?

862
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,616
Trust me.

863
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,329
He's the boss.

864
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,664
A staggering start by LaLoosh.

865
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,832
He's thrown five outs
on nine pitches, all of'em strikes.

866
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,569
He's got pinpoint control
here tonight, Bull fans.

867
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,838
Here's the pitch.

868
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,086
This guy's crazy.

869
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,023
Yep. l wouldn't dig in there
if l was you.

870
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,026
Next one might be
at your head.

871
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,659
l don't know
where it's gonna go.

872
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,062
Swear to God.

873
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,276
You're the man!
Easy game!

874
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,688
Top of the ninth.
Two outs.

875
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:37,283
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

876
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,186
Bring it on, Meat.
Don't let up.

877
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,891
You own these guys.

878
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,491
Dad would love a shutout.

879
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,204
No.

880
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:58,441
No, he's looking for heat.

881
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,879
Let me give him the deuce.

882
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,714
Play ball!

883
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,982
Oh, no, he's shaking off
the signs.

884
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,181
Big mistake.

885
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,884
This son of a bitch
is throwing a two-hit shutout.

886
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,257
He's shaking me off.
You believe that shit?

887
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:17,690
Charlie,
here comes the deuce.

888
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,758
And when you speak of me,
speak well.

889
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,102
No, serve it up.

890
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,268
Yeah.

891
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,421
Home run.

892
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:41,818
Give me the ball.

893
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,524
You told him l was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

894
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,532
Yep.

895
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,564
That ball got out of here
in a hurry.

896
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:00,198
Anything that travels that far
oughta have a damn stewardess on it.

897
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,538
Don't you think?

898
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:42,082
When Nuke started listening to Crash,
everything fell into place.

899
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,348
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

900
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,753
But Nuke was still confused.

901
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,758
He was so encouraged
by his victory...

902
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,590
that he vowed not to have sex
until he lost.

903
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,653
Unfortunately, however,
he kept on winning...

904
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,221
and for one extraordinary
June and July...

905
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,131
the Durham Bulls
began playing baseball...

906
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,638
with joy and verve and poetry.

907
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,272
The two sides of my own brain
werejumbled up and cross-wired.

908
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,039
While one side
was being neglected...

909
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,875
the other was in paradise
watching our Bulls play...

910
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,540
like big leaguers.

911
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,846
We swept a four-game series
at Kinston...

912
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,476
two games at Winston-Salem...

913
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,716
and kicked the holy shit
out of Greensboro in a three-game set.

914
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,382
And Crash,
who kept hitting dingers...

915
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,552
was approaching
the minor-league record...

916
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,061
though l told nobody.

917
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,695
After sweeping
theJuly 4 doubleheader...

918
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,530
the Durham Bulls
were tied for first.

919
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:38,097
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
l was getting damn lonely.

920
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,199
Something had to be done.

921
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,073
l needed a man.

922
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,083
l love winning, man.

923
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,590
l fuckin' love winning.

924
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:00,026
You know what l'm saying?
lt's like better than losing.

925
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,265
Teach me something new.
l need to learn.

926
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,927
Teach me something.

927
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,561
You got something
to write with?

928
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,629
Good. lt's time to work on
your interviews.

929
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,004
My interviews?
What do l gotta do?

930
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,134
You have to learn
your cliches.

931
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,647
You're gonna have to study them,
gonna have to know them.

932
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,444
They're your friends.
Write this down.

933
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,347
"We gotta play 'em
one day at a time."

934
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,390
"Got to play--"

935
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,118
- lt's pretty boring.
- Of course it's boring.

936
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,819
That's the point.
Write it down.

937
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:35,125
"One day at a time."

938
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,291
"l'm just happy to be here.

939
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,426
Hope l can help the ball club."

940
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,538
l know.
Write it down.

941
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:48,569
"l just wanna give it
my best shot.

942
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:52,876
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out."

943
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,116
"Good Lord willing...

944
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,051
things will work out."

945
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,387
How's Annie?

946
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,627
She's getting
pretty steamed, actually...

947
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,666
'cause l'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

948
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,828
l'm figurin' l'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her.

949
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,999
You know, calm her down.

950
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,906
Are you out of your mind?

951
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,241
l'm just--
Talking about one time.

952
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,145
lf you give in now,
you might start losing.

953
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,915
Never fuck
with a winning streak.

954
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,228
Hi, boys.

955
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,662
Hi, darlin'.
Get in here.

956
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,599
Hey,Jimmy!

957
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,966
Want a ride?

958
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:53,035
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

959
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,341
No.

960
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,879
Can l give you my testimony?

961
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,108
You can do anything you want.

962
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,182
Hop in.

963
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,961
l am so proud of you guys.

964
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,794
You want
some more soup, honey?

965
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,996
No, thanks.
That was great.

966
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,405
How about a little back rub?

967
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,275
No, l'm okay.

968
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,212
l think l'll just take
a little nap.

969
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,711
You want me to tuck you in?

970
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,117
Annie, you can't seduce me.

971
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,720
Sweetie, l'm not gonna
try to seduce you.

972
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,786
What's that?

973
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,489
That's my leg.

974
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,758
l know what it is.

975
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,164
l thought maybe we could work on
some fundamentals...

976
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:56,728
since we're not gonna make love and
improve your hand-eye coordination.

977
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,239
My hand-eye coordination?

978
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:00,400
Unsnap my stocking.

979
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,207
The other day, Crash called
a woman's pu--

980
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:07,340
pussy--

981
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,586
You know how the hair
is kind of in a V-shape?

982
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,544
Yes, l do.

983
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,250
He called it
the Bermuda Triangle.

984
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:19,658
He said a man could get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

985
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,889
What a nasty thing to say.

986
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,397
He didn't mean it nasty.

987
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:29,070
He said getting lost and disappearing
from the face of the earth...

988
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:32,972
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

989
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,670
But, he also said
that there were times...

990
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:39,145
for discipline and self-control.

991
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,376
And l think this is
one of those times.

992
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,010
Crash is a very smart man.

993
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,486
Honey, let's give it a try.

994
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,728
Here, wait. Watch.

995
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,225
You try. Go ahead.

996
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,512
Yep.

997
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,482
You're playing with my mind.

998
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,182
l'm trying to play
with your body.

999
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:22,781
You're trying to seduce me.

1000
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,917
Of course
l'm trying to seduce you.

1001
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,462
l'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't l pretty?

1002
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,964
God, l think you're real cute.

1003
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,592
Cute?
Baby ducks are cute.

1004
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,465
l hate cute.

1005
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,472
l wanna be exotic
and mysterious.

1006
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,340
You're exotic
and mysterious and cute.

1007
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,707
That's why l better leave.

1008
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,714
Nuke, you got it all wrong.

1009
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,444
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball.

1010
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,110
- Ask Crash.
- l did.

1011
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,677
What did he say?

1012
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,280
lf l give into you,
l'll start losing again.

1013
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,291
He did?

1014
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,792
Yeah.

1015
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,329
l'll be back when we lose.

1016
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,397
Damn it!

1017
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,286
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed.

1018
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,448
You are messin'
with my private life!

1019
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,617
Knock-knock, you know?
Come in.

1020
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,752
- You're confusing him.
- Like, thank you.

1021
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,591
You're bending his mind
all out of shape.

1022
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,290
- l'm what?
- You're confusing him!

1023
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:39,801
l'm confusing him? You got him
breathing out of the wrong eyelid.

1024
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,200
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

1025
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,968
That is a religious ritual
and happens to be working.

1026
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,771
Wait a second.
Who dresses you?

1027
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,937
- What?
- Who dresses you?

1028
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,447
You think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

1029
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,451
"The road of excess leads to
the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

1030
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,680
William Blake?

1031
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,925
- What do you mean "William Blake"?
- l mean "William Blake."

1032
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,358
Who are you?

1033
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,227
Do you have a job?

1034
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,427
l teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College--

1035
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,266
English 101
and Beginning Composition.

1036
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:20,365
Having a conversation
with you is like--

1037
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:23,036
is like a martian
talking to a fungo.

1038
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,843
That's really cute.Just because
sometimes you manage to be clever...

1039
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,440
and have a nice smile,
does not mean you are not full of shit.

1040
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,486
l'm full of shit?

1041
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,020
You are full of shit.

1042
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,886
- Chastity was your idea.
- l know!

1043
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,687
- Keep your hands out of this.
- l never told him...

1044
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,751
- to stay out of your bed.
- You certainly did.

1045
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,420
l never told him
to stay out of your bed.

1046
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,989
l told him a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

1047
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,035
- Fine.
- You know why?

1048
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,626
They don't happen
very often.

1049
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,831
lf you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid...

1050
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,273
or you're not getting laid,
or you wear women's underwear...

1051
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,335
then you are,
and you should know that.

1052
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:05,211
Come on. Think of something
clever to say.

1053
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:11,354
Something full of magic
and religion bullshit.

1054
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,289
Come on. Dazzle me.

1055
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,967
l want you.

1056
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,763
What?

1057
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,736
l said, "l want you."

1058
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,705
Stop it.

1059
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,737
You're scared.

1060
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,510
Maybe l am.

1061
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,889
But l still think
you should leave.

1062
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:47,487
Okay. Well...

1063
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,396
this is the damnedest season
l've ever seen.

1064
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:53,526
The Durham Bulls can't lose,
and l can't get laid.

1065
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,734
Come on. Show 'em what you got,
Super Nuke!

1066
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,641
Show 'em there, Super Nuke!

1067
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,078
LaLoosh. L.A. Loosh!

1068
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,149
Just relax out there.
Don't aim the ball.

1069
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,187
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

1070
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,421
Anything bothering him?

1071
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,225
He says his chakras are jammed.

1072
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,561
He's having trouble breathing
out of his left eye.

1073
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,793
- Left eye?
- Right eyelid.

1074
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:26,994
Right eyelid.

1075
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,538
Give me the ball.

1076
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:34,871
Fuck!

1077
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,002
Time-out!

1078
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,549
Up to the plate,
Junior Chavley.

1079
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,982
What's wrong?

1080
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,144
l'm a little nervous.
My old man's here.

1081
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,484
Your dad's here?
Where's he at?

1082
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,184
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look.

1083
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,029
Look, he's waving,
and he's just your old man.

1084
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,929
He's as full of shit
as anybody.

1085
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,024
What's going on?

1086
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,399
You breathing through
the wrong fucking eyelid again?

1087
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,836
- Shut up.
- You hear about Jimmy and Millie?

1088
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,534
They got engaged.
Can you believe that?

1089
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,600
Yeah? Wait till l tell him she's gone
down on half the Carolina League.

1090
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,977
Anybody says anything bad
about Millie, l break his neck.

1091
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,573
Excuse me. l've got
a game to pitch here.

1092
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,454
Hey, you guys.
Don't throw me anything.

1093
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:22,149
My girlfriend put a curse
on my glove.

1094
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,590
l'll take the hex off.
Give me the glove.

1095
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,491
You gotta cut the head off
a live rooster.

1096
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,689
Play ball!

1097
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,866
What the hell's
going on out there?

1098
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,768
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they're gonna call roll.

1099
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,473
Get your ass out there
and check it out.

1100
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,633
You bet.

1101
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,172
Let's play some baseball!

1102
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,681
Hurry up!

1103
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:51,448
Excuse me. What the hell's
going on out here?

1104
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,249
Well, Nuke's scared...

1105
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,120
'cause his eyelids are jammed
and his old man's here.

1106
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,659
We need a live--
ls it a live rooster?

1107
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,161
We need a live rooster to take
the curse off Jose's glove...

1108
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,892
and nobody seems to know
what to get Millie or Jimmy...

1109
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,593
for their wedding present.

1110
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,465
That about right?
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

1111
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,932
Okay, well, candlesticks
always make a nice gift.

1112
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,101
And maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

1113
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,668
Maybe a place setting
or a silverware pattern's good.

1114
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,078
Let's get to it.
Go get 'em.

1115
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,378
Come on.
Get your ass in gear.

1116
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,014
LaLoosh looks in for the sign.
Here's the pitch.

1117
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,925
Ball hit deep in the right field,
off the wall.

1118
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:34,963
You should be
at the game, Annie.

1119
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,497
No, l'm fine.

1120
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:38,999
Beautiful night for baseball
here in Durham.

1121
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,864
And as the batter steps in--

1122
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:44,702
How much time did you and Jimmy
spend together...

1123
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,003
before he proposed?

1124
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,202
About five hours, l guess.

1125
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,768
We both just knew.

1126
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,939
Once again,
he goes to the resin bag.

1127
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,142
Annie...

1128
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,583
do you think l deserve
to wear white?

1129
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,517
Honey, we all deserve
to wear white.

1130
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,749
Ball two, in the dirt.

1131
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,752
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

1132
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,330
Bring it!

1133
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,367
Come on!

1134
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:13,924
He's coming. Go home!

1135
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,936
We got 'im!

1136
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,072
- Safe!
- No, l got him!

1137
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,076
- You missed him!
- l didn't miss him!

1138
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,636
- Don't bump me.
- He still hasn't touched the plate!

1139
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,579
He still ain't
touched the plate!

1140
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:32,211
Fuck it!
lt's a cocksucking call!

1141
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,721
Did you call me a cocksucker?

1142
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,350
l said it was a cocksucking call!
You can't throw me for that.

1143
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,553
You missed the tag!

1144
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,688
- You just spit on me!
- l did not spit on you!

1145
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,824
You're in the wrong business!
You're Sears & Roebuck material!

1146
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,392
You're pushing it, buddy!
You want me to run you out?

1147
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,303
- You want me to call you a cocksucker?
- Go ahead. Try it.

1148
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:54,467
Beg me!
Pretty please, beg!

1149
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,977
Call me a cocksucker,
and you're outta here!

1150
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,979
You're a cocksucker.

1151
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,537
- You're outta here!
- Shit!

1152
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,211
- What the fuck is that?
- Holy shit!

1153
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:12,126
He called me a cocksucker!
He missed the tag!

1154
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,594
l've never seen Crash so angry.

1155
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,927
And frankly, sports fans,
he used a certain word...

1156
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,933
that's a no-no with umpires.

1157
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,535
Crash must have called
the guy a cocksucker.

1158
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:26,837
God, he's so romantic.

1159
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,337
When Crash got thrown out,
the game got out of hand.

1160
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,515
Jose made three errors
with his cursed mitt...

1161
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:40,043
Nuke never quite got in the groove,
though he didn't pitch bad...

1162
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:43,751
and the winning streak
came to an end with a 3-2 loss.

1163
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:47,158
The good news was that a man
was about to come calling.

1164
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:50,890
Bad news was
it was the wrong guy.

1165
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,836
Annie.

1166
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,605
Annie.

1167
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:40,111
l know you're in there.
l can hear that crazy Mexican singer.

1168
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,421
We lost.

1169
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,654
lt's okay.

1170
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,127
Oh, Annie, l'd like you
to meet my father.

1171
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,527
Oh, my!

1172
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,157
Ebby's told me
a lot about you.

1173
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:02,602
Ebby tells me you taught him a lot
about discipline and self-control.

1174
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,265
We were worried that he might
get involved in the wrong crowd.

1175
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,570
We're so pleased
he met a Christian woman.

1176
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:08,836
Praise the Lord.

1177
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,140
Praise the Lord.

1178
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,612
Excuse me.

1179
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,978
Excuse me, Dad.

1180
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,512
What?

1181
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,583
- We got a lot of catching up to do.
- Your father is right there.

1182
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,593
Crash tells me l gotta quit
worrying about him...

1183
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:29,152
so l think it's a good opportunity
to go for a quickie.

1184
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,597
We gotta talk.

1185
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,156
Hello?

1186
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,938
Yes, he most certainly is here.

1187
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,472
lt's for you.

1188
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,265
Hey, Skip, it's me.

1189
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,173
What?

1190
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,844
My God.

1191
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,249
Okay.

1192
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,125
Yeah. All right.

1193
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,024
What?

1194
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,687
l'm going to the Show.

1195
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,402
Dad!

1196
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,463
They're sending me up to the majors.
l leave first thing in the morning.

1197
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,202
Can you believe it?

1198
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,211
Let's have a quick word
of prayer.

1199
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,770
Oh, let's not.

1200
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,510
l gotta find Crash.
Come on. l'll dump you off.

1201
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:23,516
Wait.

1202
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,912
Not so fast.
He'll be right with you.

1203
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:31,447
Come on, sweetie. l just want to
have you alone for a second...

1204
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,994
so we can say good-bye.

1205
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,529
l'll be back.

1206
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:38,088
When somebody leaves Durham,
they don't come back.

1207
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,758
l mean later.

1208
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:44,630
Oh.

1209
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,080
Oh, God, Annie.

1210
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,244
Jeez.

1211
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,247
What do you have in there?

1212
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,758
Nothing.

1213
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,624
You're not going to
be needing these anymore.

1214
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,665
- l'd better take them.
- No, you're ready.

1215
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,064
You think l'm ready for this?

1216
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,629
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

1217
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,143
Don't think too much.

1218
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,911
l won't.

1219
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,552
You know something, Annie.

1220
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,152
You can't breathe
through your eyelids.

1221
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,159
Of course you can't breathe
through your eyelids.

1222
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,321
Whoever told you
such a ridiculous thing?

1223
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,976
Now, get. Come on.

1224
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:04,051
Drive careful.

1225
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,179
Oh, my.

1226
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,003
Hey, there you are.

1227
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,738
Crash.

1228
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,904
Hey, Crash...

1229
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,106
guess what.

1230
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,581
l'm going to the Show.

1231
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,955
Big club's expanding its roster
to finish out the season.

1232
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:45,253
Nice shot.

1233
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,386
And l am going to the Show.

1234
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,564
So why don't you go then?

1235
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,532
Let's celebrate!

1236
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,763
Congratulations.

1237
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:59,470
Hope you end up on the cover
of Sports lllustrated...

1238
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,133
or maybe a cereal box.

1239
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,770
What's your problem, man?

1240
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,477
l'm trying to thank you.
Let's get out of this dump.

1241
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,278
- l'll buy you a beer.
- Hey.

1242
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,148
You callin' my place a dump?

1243
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,084
No, he's not.

1244
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:15,445
He's not. Are you?

1245
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:16,990
- No.
- He's not.

1246
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,424
All right?

1247
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,893
Do you know who this is?

1248
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,564
This is Sandy Grimes.

1249
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,964
Sandy Grimes hit 371
in Louisville in 1967.

1250
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:29,162
376.

1251
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,172
l'm sorry.
He hit 376.

1252
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,435
That's a career, man.

1253
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:38,579
- ln any league.
- Got that right.

1254
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:42,446
Did you hear what l said?
l'm going to the Show.

1255
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:47,043
You know what the difference
between hitting 250 and 300 is?

1256
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,349
lt's 25 hits.

1257
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:54,794
Twenty-five hits
in 500 at-bats is 500 points.

1258
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:58,026
There's six months in a season.
That's about 25 weeks.

1259
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:01,296
That means if you get
one extra flare a week.

1260
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,803
A gork. You get a ground ball.

1261
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,170
You get a ground ball
with eyes.

1262
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,505
You get a dying quail.

1263
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,708
Just one more dying quail a week...

1264
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,476
and you're in Yankee Stadium.

1265
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,683
You still don't know
what l'm talking about.

1266
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,687
Get the hell outta here.

1267
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,985
All right.

1268
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,685
Fuck.

1269
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,727
Send you a postcard.

1270
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,660
Send me a postcard?
Hey, l made it.

1271
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,425
You made it.
You made shit.

1272
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,489
Hey!

1273
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,034
You crazy?

1274
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:38,732
What the hell's
wrong with you?

1275
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,776
- l'll be all right.
- l'm talking about my mirror.

1276
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,678
Shit, l'm sorry. Hey!

1277
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,408
l'm not gonna fight you.

1278
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,677
What do you mean you're not gonna
fight me, you fuck?

1279
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,015
Why am l a fuck?

1280
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,349
Because you got talent.

1281
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:56,185
l got brains,
but you got talent.

1282
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:01,061
See this right arm?
Worth a million bucks a year.

1283
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,825
All my limbs put together
aren't worth seven cents a pound.

1284
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,798
What are you talking about?
You're a great catcher.

1285
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,802
l'm a great catcher?

1286
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,963
- Forget it.
- Hey.

1287
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,529
- Fucking forget it.
- Hey, Meat.

1288
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,406
Damn!

1289
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,311
l didn't mean to hit you.

1290
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,780
You hurt my eye!

1291
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,582
Sorry.

1292
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:32,558
Did you hit me with
your right or left?

1293
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:37,195
Did you hit me with your right hand
or with your left?

1294
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:38,254
My left.

1295
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,198
That's good.

1296
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:43,567
You get in a fight with a drunk,
you don't hit with your pitching hand.

1297
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,770
l can't keep giving you
these free lessons.

1298
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,470
Quit screwing around
and help me up.

1299
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,675
You look great, man.

1300
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,599
Be careful with those now.

1301
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,601
We got a boy going to the Show.

1302
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,233
Sorry about last night.

1303
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,903
Forget it.

1304
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:58,073
l have been known
on occasion to...

1305
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,909
howl at the moon.

1306
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,940
You understand?

1307
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,546
No.

1308
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,717
Well, you will.

1309
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,927
Look, Nuke...

1310
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:19,057
these big-league hitters are going to
light you up like a pinball machine...

1311
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,761
for a while, all right?

1312
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,599
Don't worry about it.

1313
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:27,505
You be cocky and arrogant,
even when you're getting beat.

1314
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,700
That's the secret.

1315
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:36,941
You gotta play this game
with fear and arrogance.

1316
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,478
Fear and ignorance.

1317
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:46,689
No, fear and arrogance,
you hayseed, not ignorance.

1318
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,229
l know.

1319
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,697
l just like seeing you
get all worked up.

1320
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,231
Listen.

1321
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,305
Thanks.

1322
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:22,756
Hey, Nuke.

1323
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,957
Good luck.

1324
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,595
You too...

1325
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:30,933
Meat.

1326
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:53,016
l now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1327
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:54,686
You may kiss the bride.

1328
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:32,324
Jimmy, we all pitched in,
and we got you a little gift.

1329
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,389
Tony.

1330
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,369
Kind of a special wedding cake
from the Durham Bulls.

1331
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,400
Oh, my Lord!

1332
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:49,681
Yeah, Skip?

1333
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,685
You wanted to see me?

1334
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:55,878
Crash, shut the door.

1335
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:02,087
l wanna thank everyone!

1336
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:03,926
Gimme a piece of that!

1337
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:19,279
This is the toughest job
a manager has.

1338
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:23,709
But...

1339
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,345
the organization
wants to make a change.

1340
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:35,425
Now that Nuke's gone, they wanna
bring up some young catcher.

1341
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:38,090
Some kid hitting 300
in Bluefield.

1342
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,566
He's probably a bust.

1343
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:43,866
l put in a word for you
with the organization.

1344
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:48,272
Told them l thought you might make
a fine minor-league manager someday.

1345
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:55,372
There might be an opening
at Visalia next year.

1346
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,445
You had a hell
of a year, Crash.

1347
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,217
But...

1348
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:06,326
you know how it is.

1349
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,578
l got released.

1350
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,337
l heard already.

1351
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:52,726
Oh, my.

1352
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,353
l think probably with my love
for four-legged creatures...

1353
01:34:53,421 --> 01:34:56,288
and hooves and everything,
that in another lifetime...

1354
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,121
l was probably Catherine the Great
or Francis of Assisi.

1355
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,127
l'm not sure which one.

1356
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,057
What do you think, honey?

1357
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:08,633
How come in former lifetimes...

1358
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,694
everybody is somebody famous?

1359
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:23,440
How come nobody ever says
they were "Joe Schmoe"?

1360
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:26,816
Because it doesn't work
that way, you fool.

1361
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:36,991
God, you are gorgeous.

1362
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:41,562
You wanna dance?

1363
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,009
Yes.

1364
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:00,820
l guess you do.

1365
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:37,309
Crash took off at dawn.

1366
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:39,471
Said he heard there might be
an opening for a catcher...

1367
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:41,537
in Asheville
on the South Atlantic League.

1368
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:47,517
A woman should be so strong
that she's not affected by such things.

1369
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,113
lt wasn't the first time
l went to bed with a guy...

1370
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,556
and woke up with a note.

1371
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:55,322
At least the son of a bitch
left me breakfast.

1372
01:38:57,965 --> 01:39:02,061
You have to respect a ballplayer
who's trying to finish the season.

1373
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:04,400
At least,
that's what l told myself.

1374
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,704
Baseball may be a religion
full of magic cosmic truth...

1375
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:11,870
in the fundamental ontological
riddles of our time...

1376
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,971
but it's also a job.

1377
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:18,808
Come on, Meat.
Throw me that weak-ass shit.

1378
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:22,551
You ain't gettin'
that cheese by me.

1379
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,955
Bring it.

1380
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:32,598
When Crash hit his 2 4 7th home run,
l knew the moment it happened.

1381
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,395
But l'm sure nobody else did.

1382
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:37,904
And The Sporting News
didn't say anything about it.

1383
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:42,938
"Full many a flower is born
to blush unseen.

1384
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:45,672
And waste its sweetness
on the desert air. "

1385
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:47,873
Thomas Gray.

1386
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:49,540
Or William Cullen Bryant.

1387
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,584
l don't know.
l get 'em mixed up.

1388
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:55,520
Anyway, my attempts at housekeeping
were feeble as usual.

1389
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:58,558
l sometimes
get easily distracted.

1390
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,958
Funny thing was
l stopped worrying about Nuke.

1391
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:04,759
Somehow l knew
nothing would stop him.

1392
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:08,928
The world is made for people
who aren't cursed with self-awareness.

1393
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:12,097
Crash was right--
Nuke had a gift.

1394
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:16,131
l'm just happy to be here,
and l hope l can help the ball club.

1395
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,144
You know, l just wanna
give it my best shot...

1396
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:20,442
and good Lord willing,
things will work out.

1397
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,744
You gotta play them
one day at a time, though.

1398
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:24,750
Raye Anne, right?
That's a beautiful name.

1399
01:40:24,818 --> 01:40:28,185
ls that Greek?
lt's a beautiful name.

1400
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:30,723
There's a great song by Motley Crue.
Do you know it?

1401
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:33,225
"Raye Anne, she's a stay in."

1402
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:35,420
Anyway, a good friend of mine
used to say...

1403
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:37,259
"This is a very simple game.

1404
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:39,993
You throw the ball, you catch
the ball, you hit the ball.

1405
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:43,264
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1406
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:46,363
Sometimes it rains."

1407
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,032
Think about that for a while.

1408
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:22,167
What happened?

1409
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:25,029
l quit.

1410
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:29,935
Hit my dinger
and l hung them up.

1411
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:38,884
l'm quittin' too.

1412
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:41,147
l mean boys,
not baseball.

1413
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:47,887
There might be an opening for
a manager in Visalia next spring.

1414
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,867
Think l could make it
to the Show as a manager?

1415
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:59,339
You'd be great.

1416
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:09,207
Because you understand about
nonlinear thinking.

1417
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:13,310
Baseball seems like a linear game
with all those lines and box scores.

1418
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:17,255
But the fact is, it's a spacious
non-time kind of time to it.

1419
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:19,552
What?

1420
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:23,357
l got a lot of time
to hear your theories.

1421
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:26,194
And l wanna hear
every damn one of them, but...

1422
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:31,701
now l'm tired and l don't want to
think about baseball.

1423
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:34,468
And l don't wanna think
about quantum physics.

1424
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:36,475
And l don't wanna
think about nothing.

1425
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:43,416
l just wanna be.

1426
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,986
l can do that too.

1427
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:53,757
Walt Whitman once said,
"l see great things in baseball.

1428
01:43:53,827 --> 01:43:57,058
lt's our game.
The American game.

1429
01:43:57,130 --> 01:44:00,463
lt will repair our losses
and be a blessing to us."

1430
01:44:01,201 --> 01:44:03,192
You could look it up.
