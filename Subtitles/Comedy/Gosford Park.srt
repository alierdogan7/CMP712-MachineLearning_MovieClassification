00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,075
I only cut it out for Garbo.
I prefer the American stars.

165
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,304
I think they've got
more oomph.

166
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,744
Go on!

167
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:10,647
- Is he really sirwilliam's cousin?.
- yep.

168
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,981
Imagine having a film star
in the family.

169
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:16,648
- Ladysylvia must be thrilled.
- Oh, I don't think.

170
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,657
whywouldn't she be?.

171
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,693
'Cause she's a snobbish cow.
'Cause she--

172
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,127
she looks down on anyone who got
to the top with brains and hard work.

173
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:26,927
just like she looks down on her husband,
except when it's time to foot the bills.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,025
And then she's got
her hand out, all right.

175
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:32,162
- what was her family, then?
- what'd you expect, really?.

176
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,571
Toffee-nosed and useless.

177
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,575
Her father was
the Earl of Carton.

178
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,804
sounds good, except
he didn't have a pot to piss in.

179
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,177
what's she like
to work for?.

180
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,775
she's horrible.
But he's--

181
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:47,046
He's okay. Come on.
we better get cracking.

182
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:53,021
- Hello, I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

183
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,857
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

184
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,955
-[Mabel] Howareyou?
- Very well, thankyou.

185
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,297
Oh! I don't smoke.
Thankyou.

186
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,635
[Elsie ] Mrs. Nesbitt's
only got one dress with her.

187
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:09,072
says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

188
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,633
Do you always look after visitors
if they haven't got a maid?.

189
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,645
sometimes Dorothy helps,
though why Mrs. wilson...

190
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,113
makes the still room maid
do it beats me.

191
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:18,207
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

192
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,812
- which one does Dorothy answer to?.
- Both. That's the problem.

193
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:24,049
she's rushed offher feet as it is.
Areyou nearly done there?.

194
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,957
- yes.
- Here she is-- Miss Bossy.

195
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,995
Tell me, what was Greta Garbo
really like?.

196
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:32,657
- Didyou get to knowher?
-[Novello ] yes, I did, actually.

197
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:35,462
she's coming to stay
with me next month.

198
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:38,265
[ Gasps ]

199
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:42,240
Tell me, howmuch longer areyou
going to go on... making films?

200
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:46,211
I suppose that rather depends
on how much longer the public
want to see me in them.

201
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,381
yes, it must be hard
to know...

202
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,043
when it's time
to throw in the towel.

203
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,679
what a pity about
that last one ofyours.

204
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,189
what-what was it called?.

205
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:01,421
- The Dodger.
- The Lodger.

206
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,860
The Lodger.

207
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,495
And it must be
so disappointing...

208
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,400
when something just, you know,
flops like that.

209
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,064
yes, it is...

210
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,573
rather disappointing.

211
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,475
Look at this.
Machine-made lace.

212
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,979
- Hark at her.
- well, I hate cheap clothes.

213
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,982
They're twice the work,
and they never look as good.

214
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,009
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look at that. All over his waistcoat.

215
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,921
what doyou expect from a woman
without her own maid?.

216
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:35,223
Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels
with no maid has lost her self-respect.

217
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:39,129
- she calls it ""giving in."
- I don't have a maid.
I haven't given in.

218
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,463
- [Sarah] That's different.
-[Elsie ] why?

219
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:45,197
- what's your name?.
- I think here I'm called Trentham.

220
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:48,035
No, I meantyour real name.

221
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:51,942
Oh. Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

222
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:55,140
Blimey. what does
Her Ladyship call you?.

223
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:58,616
well, sheshouldcall me Maceachran,
now I'm a lady's maid.

224
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,619
That's what my mother says.

225
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:03,781
But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,
so she calls me Mary.

226
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:05,791
I don't blame her.

227
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:10,061
sylvia.

228
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:14,624
I'm serious.
There mustn't be anymore nonsense.

229
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,669
I don't know what
you're talking about.

230
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:19,170
[ Clock Chiming]

231
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,507
Done much shooting
this year?.

232
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,135
[Stockbridge ]
Quite a lot.

233
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:28,271
- Hello.
- Does Louisa always go out with you?.

234
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:30,782
- Usually.
- It's very good ofher.

235
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,080
- Do you have a minute?.
- Don't do that! That's bad for him!

236
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:35,485
Put him down.

237
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:38,854
- [Pip whimpers ]
- yeah. Bores me stiff.

238
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,859
- All right, Pip.
- I just wondered--

239
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,861
[Sylvia ]
william's such a rotten shot.

240
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,420
I usually try and duck out ofit,
particularly in Scotland.

241
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:47,466
I 'm rather fond
of scotland.

242
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:51,267
All right,
get on with your work. yes?.

243
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:54,465
- Ah, Mr. weissman. There you are.
- I'm dealing with this.

244
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,773
- what is it, Mr. weissman?.
- well, to start with,
my name is Denton.

245
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,746
- Henry Denton.
- you're here as valet to Mr. weissman.

246
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:05,911
That means you'll be known
as Mr. weissman below stairs
for the duration ofyour stay.

247
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:09,716
we stick to the old customs here.
It saves confusion.

248
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,882
- It's about Mr. weissman's diet.
- yes?.

249
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,558
He's a vegetarian.

250
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:18,119
- A what?.
- A vegetarian.

251
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:22,328
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.

252
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:27,128
well, I never!
Doesn't eat meat?.

253
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,971
He's coming for a shooting party,
and he doesn't eat meat.

254
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:32,568
Mr. weissman doesn't
intend to shoot.

255
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:36,172
I think he just wants to walk
out with them, get a bit of air.

256
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,183
Get a bit of air?.

257
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:40,549
yes, thankyou.
we'll make the necessary arrangements.

258
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,147
Now I suggestyou get one of
the servants to takeyou upstairs.

259
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:46,158
Mr. weissman is in
the Green bedroom,

260
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,217
and you'll be sharing with
Lord stockbridge's valet--

261
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:50,228
Robert Parks.

262
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,466
[women Chuckling]

263
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,336
He's very full ofhimself, I must say.
""Doesn't eat meat."

264
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:03,842
Now, now, Mrs. Croft. we don't want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?.

265
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,074
Mr. weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.

266
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:12,284
Good boy, now.
Give Louisa a kiss from me.

267
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,286
[Novello ]
Darling, I'm sorry about that.

268
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,414
- I should have made it clear
that Morrisjust doesn't shoot.
- [ Sylvia ] Don't worry.

269
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,617
wil I iam's just making a fuss.
He has this ridiculous idea...

270
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,956
that Americans all sleep
with guns under their pillows.

271
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:24,861
They do, but they're more for
each otherthan for killing birds.

272
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,628
[ Clears Throat] Remind me.
How areyou related towilliam exactly?.

273
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:32,262
[Novello]
Ourmothers were first cousins.

274
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,272
[Stockbridge ] Don't believe
I ever met william's mother.

275
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,275
Didn't she do something
rather original?.

276
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:40,574
well, she was a teacher.

277
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,115
And so was mine.

278
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:46,346
- That's marvelous, isn't it?.
- [ Constance ]Sylvia is so clever.

279
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,650
She always finds
such wonderful servants.

280
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,781
I don't know how she manages.

281
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,792
I 'm breaking in
a new maid.

282
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,919
I 'm simply worn out
with it.

283
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,759
Actually, there's nothing
more exhausting, is there?.

284
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:02,562
- I don't have a lady's maid.
- Oh. Hello.

285
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,604
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid.

286
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:09,233
Honestly, the amount I have to do
for her, she should be paying me.

287
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,368
she does seem
ratheryoung.

288
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:15,073
well, ofcourse, whatshe is,
my dear, is wonderfully cheap.

289
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,275
you've no right to pull me away
in mid-conversation.

290
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,046
Mabel, where are you going?.
The room's this way.

291
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,212
why the hell did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?.

292
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,984
why would you mention you didn't
have a maid, for God's sake?.

293
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:39,630
you'd find it a lot easier to clean
them ifyou put the trees in first.

294
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:41,640
I was just about
to do that.

295
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,868
Are these
Mr. Novello's shoes?.

296
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,879
yes.

297
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,190
- Doyou really live in Hollywood?.
- I do.

298
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,251
Hmm. How did you get there?.
where did you start from?.

299
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,525
where else doyou think?.
scotland.

300
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,532
wereyou always
in service?.

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,831
Did you ever think oftrying to
get into films whileyou were there?.

302
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,532
I wanted to be an actor once...
when I was little.

303
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,737
I suppose
old MotherTrentham...

304
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:21,371
will have her begging bowl out
while she's here.

305
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,915
she won't be bothering
your employers, that's certain.

306
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,747
- why not?.
- [Elsie ]
Because Lady Lavinia Meredith...

307
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,845
- hasn't got a penny
to bless herselfwith.
- And whose fault is that?.

308
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,890
There's nothing wrong
with the commander.

309
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,051
He's just been a bit
unfortunate.

310
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,857
I'll say.
I think he's pathetic.

311
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,523
Then why don'tyou
hand in your notice?.

312
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,033
well, the other two sisters
fell on their feet.

313
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,035
Of course, it helps
that they're both good-looking.

314
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:46,571
- [Mary] LadySylvia's lovely.
- you think so?.

315
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,540
- She might have done a bit
better for herself, really.
-[Elsie ] I begyourpardon.

316
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,635
Lord Carton was determined to have sir
william for either of the two eldest.

317
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:54,646
I was told he could have
had his pick.

318
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,683
- why was Lord Carton so keen?.
- why do you think?.

319
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,982
who do you suppose pays
for him to swan around Biarritz
for six months of the year?.

320
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:05,616
Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

321
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:09,753
- Old money bags, that's who.
- I think it's disgusting
the way they all use him.

322
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,992
None of the rest of them
have got the brains to make

00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:36,692
Good evening.

486
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:41,491
[All]
For what we are about to receive,

487
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:43,501
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

488
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,696
[Jennings ] Right.
Start whenyou get it.

489
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,705
No time for loitering.

490
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:53,176
I 'm not serving tonight,
Mr. Jennings, am I ?.

491
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,043
Not tonight, Elsie,
but probably tomorrow.

492
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,409
where is Mrs. Croft?.

493
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,419
Always eats
with her own staff.

494
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,923
Does she take her pudding to
Mrs. wilson's room?. Our cook does that.

495
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,016
Fat chance.
They hate each other.

496
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:11,392
- Can I ask a question?.
- Certainly, Mr. weissman.

497
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:13,397
How can we helpyou?.

498
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:17,731
I just wondered, how many people here
had parents in service?.

499
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:20,829
And was that why
they chose to go into it?.

500
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:25,741
what an interesting question,
and one to which, I'm afraid,
I cannot provide the answer.

501
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:30,305
All ofyou whose parents
were in service, raiseyour hand.

502
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:32,976
- My fatherwas.
- Both-- nanny and groom.

503
00:31:33,052 --> 00:31:36,146
- Notyou, Dorothy?
- My fatherwas a farmer, Mr.Jennings.

504
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,815
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

505
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:41,689
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

506
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,092
- And ifyou ask me,
theywere better off.
- [ Chuckles ]

507
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:48,497
what about you,
Mr. stockbridge?.

508
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,626
[ George ]
what's the matter? Don'tyou know?

509
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:52,830
yeah, I know
what they did.

510
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:56,432
But it didn't have any effect
on me or my choice ofwork.

511
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:59,409
- And why's that?.
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

512
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,385
[Jennings ]
Thankyou, Mr. weissman,

513
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:10,149
for giving us all
a little something to think about.

514
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,264
Oh, Her Ladyship.

515
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:30,934
[ Sylvia ]
Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

516
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,911
Please, do sit down
and fi nish your supper.

517
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:36,243
Mrs. wilson, a major crisis has arisen.
I havejust found out...

518
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:39,182
that Mr. weissman won't eat meat,
and I don't know what to do.

519
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,378
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I si m ply don't dare.

520
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:43,387
Everything's under control,
your Ladyship.

521
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,423
Mr. weissman's valet informed us
as soon as he arrived,

522
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,584
so we've prepared
a special version ofthe soup.

523
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:49,650
He can eat the fish
and the hors d'oeuvres,

524
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,662
and we'll have a welsh rarebit
for the game course.

525
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,427
I don't know what we're going
to do about the entree,
but we'll think of something.

526
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,629
Thankyou, Mrs. wilson.
Ten steps ahead as usual.

527
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,332
which one ofyou
is Mr. weissman's valet?.

528
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:03,932
I am, your Ladyship.

529
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,511
Areyou, indeed?.
yes, heavens.

530
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:12,414
Um, thankyou foryour...
efficiency.

531
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,516
- you're all set, then.
- [Jennings ] yes, George?.

532
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:22,526
Nothing, sir.

533
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:25,654
I shouldhope not.
I'm veryhungry.

534
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:27,665
[ Chattering ]

535
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:42,071
I was, uh,
wondering, william,

536
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,775
ifI could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

537
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,784
I can't leave my guests,
can I?.

538
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,254
you'll make that dog sick.

539
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,290
Isobel, didyou know
that william and I...

540
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:54,484
are going into business
together in the sudan?.

541
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,358
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's quite exciting.

542
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,363
what's happenedis
apparently,

543
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:02,025
there are hundreds and hundreds
ofSudanese native soldiers,

544
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:04,535
entire regiments
wandering around the desert,

545
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:07,333
wi I ly-ni I ly, without
anythi ng on thei r feet,

546
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:10,000
which causes some hardship,
I imagine.

547
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:12,873
No, I grew up
in Leicester.

548
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:16,108
- My father had a glove factory.
- Really?.

549
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,173
One thing I do know is
how a glove should fit.

550
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:22,243
Really, darling. you're boring
poor Mr. Novello to death.

551
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,255
[ Mouthing words ]

552
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:27,986
- [Novello ] No!
-[ weissman ] I think he's going
to explain everything to me...

553
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,426
and ki nd of show me
how it all works.

554
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:33,727
There's gonna be a pheasant hunt
in my picture.

555
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:37,200
There's a large market in modernizing
the armies in the sudan...

556
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:39,203
and providing them
with boots.

557
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:42,468
[woman]Andthen the oldbag
justservedit to all the servants.

558
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,475
I couldn't believe it.

559
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,738
Aren't you cold?.

560
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:48,905
It's better
than that kitchen.

561
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:54,884
Here. I thought
you could do with this.

562
00:34:54,953 --> 00:34:57,183
- Oh, that's kind, love.
- [Vehicle Approaching]

563
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:04,428
[Man ]
Elsie, hello.

564
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:07,727
- Good evening, your Lordship.
- we've got bags and guns
and everything and no man.

565
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,733
If I give you the keys,
will you sort it out for me?.

566
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,735
- Of course, your Lordship.
- Thankyou.

567
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,964
- we'll getyour bags, sir.
- Thankyou. That's very kind ofyou.

568
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,973
Good evening.

569
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,076
Right.
In the boot, is it?

570
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,905
sorry, can I trouble you
for a light, please?.

571
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,917
- you got that bag?
- yeah.

572
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:34,825
Thank you.
Good evening.

573
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:39,330
[ Meredith ] you mean you think he's
losing interest in that sort ofthing?

574
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,593
well, not just that.
The whole Empire.

575
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,692
I think he said
the steam's gone out of it.

576
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,966
[ Chuckles ]
william?.

577
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,803
That's not true, is it--
thatyou think the Empire's finished?.

578
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,934
I've been what?.

579
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,944
well, the Empire was
finished after the war.

580
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:56,845
well, because ofthe war.
It changed everything.

581
00:35:56,915 --> 00:36:00,476
- Empire Leicester square?.
- well, I don't care
what's changed ornot changed.

582
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,214
As long as oursons are spared
whatyou all went through.

583
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:06,519
Oh, not all.
you didn't fight, didyou, william ?

584
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,651
I did my bit.

585
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:10,786
[ Sylvia ]
well, you made a lot ofmoney,

586
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:15,162
but it's not quite the same thing as
charging into the cannon's mouth, is it?

587
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:17,168
Thank God for Raymond.
At least the family...

588
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:19,796
had one representative
in the front line.

589
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:24,069
Raymond, tell them how many times
you were mentioned in the despatches.

590
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,508
- I forget.
- No,you don't. Come on.

591
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:29,479
- [ Nesbitt ] Is he being modest?
- yes, he's being very modest.

592
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:33,316
what do you thi nk
you're doi ng here?.

593
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:36,013
Mrs. wilson asked me to tell you
that the others have arrived.

594
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:38,454
[Jennings ]
Good.

595
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,724
Lord Rupert standish
and Mr. Blond are here, milady.

596
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,962
No, they're too late. They can
have a tray in the billiard room.

597
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:54,665
- They can join us later.
- Very good, milady.

598
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,232
- Is Rupert here?.
shall I go and say hello?.
- [Sylvia ] yes.

599
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,972
No, I don't think so.

600

[Blond]
Face it. you're ayoungerson...

601
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:11,212
with the taste ofmarquess
and the income ofa vicar.

602
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,726
Her mother likes you.
she does too.

603
00:37:14,793 --> 00:37:16,852
Now, I know she's not
exactly a show-stopper--

604
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,726
- Her father's not keen on the idea.
- He'll come around.

605
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:24,235
"" Have you met my daughter,
Lady Rupert standish?"

606
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:26,430
He thinks I'm in it
for the money.

607
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:29,668
Ofcourse he does.
Butyou can't let that putyou off.

608
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:32,005
He's much more ofan obstacle
thanyou think.

609
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:35,444
Thenyou must overcome that,
mustn'tyou?

610
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:39,280
Her Ladyship asked ifyou would
join her in the drawing room
when you've finished.

00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:41,285
[ McCordle ]
All right, ladies, offyou go.

Gentlemen.

614
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:47,315
Gents, move down.
Move down.

615
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,190
Louisa, look after Pip
for me, will you?.

616
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:53,663
I wonderifwe couldhave
a word or two later on, william?

617
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,428
Do you think so?.

618
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,867
Ah, good, good.

619
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:01,269
-Jennings, could I--
- Certainly, sir.

620
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,439
[Bertha ] There's more in here.
I'mjust getting them.

621
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:08,706
I need all the knives there.
All the knives.

622
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,146
Come on, Maude.
Let's go and get the fish kettle.

623
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:18,949
Fred? Albert?
Ready?

624
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,960
- There he is.
- who?.

625
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:27,260
Lord stockbridge's valet.
Apparently, he grew up in an orphanage.

626
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:29,823
Arthur said they made him
shout it down the table.

627
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:31,835
Makes you feel
sorry for him, really.

628
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:33,837
[Mrs. Croft] It's nothing to be
ashamed of. It's not his fault.

629
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:37,898
would you like me to ask Lord Rupert
and Mr. Blond to join you, sir?.

630
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:40,308
No, leave them be.
They can entertain the ladies.

631
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,313
Give Mr. Novello a rest.

632
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:44,713
Anthony, did I overhearyou
at dinner saying...

633
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,047
- you were going into business
with sir william?.
- I beg your pardon?.

634
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,087
- Is it very old?.
- Possibly, possibly.

635
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:52,282
Ifyou need an expert
in changing money,

636
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,621
especially Africa,
I'm your man-- expert.

637
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,661
yes, the expert.

638
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:59,959
No, it's not here.

639
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,965
And Mr.Jennings is certain
he hasn't got it?.

640
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:03,967
Oh, so he says.

641
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,595
But ifit's a silver carving knife,
he must have it.

642
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:09,196
It's just gone in the wrong drawer
in the silver pantry.

643
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:12,038
- Itwouldn't have been put in here.
- well, that's what I told him.

644
00:39:13,845 --> 00:39:17,372
How old would you say
that Mr. stockbridge was?.

645
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:21,909

01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:48,948
- I think it's left me deaf.
- They stand around me
simply waiting to be picked

976
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:52,484
you know how you said si r wil I iam
could've had his pick...

977
01:02:52,563 --> 01:02:54,497
between Lady sylvia
and Lady stockbridge?.

978
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:58,001
- Aye.
- well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.

979
01:02:58,068 --> 01:03:00,662
she said
they cut cards for him.

980
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:04,299
- No!
- I know.

981
01:03:04,374 --> 01:03:06,308
I can't believe it
either.

982
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:08,810
Do you suppose
it was a joke?.

983
01:03:08,879 --> 01:03:11,814
well, I wouldn't
be too sure.

984
01:03:11,882 --> 01:03:14,146
you know what I heard?.

985
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:16,152
Oh,just listen to me.

986
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,656
- what?
- why do we spend our lives
living through them?.

987
01:03:20,724 --> 01:03:22,658
I mean,
look at poor old Lewis.

988
01:03:22,726 --> 01:03:25,456
Ifher own mother
had a heart attack,

989
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,464
she'd think it was less important
than one of Lady sylvia's farts.

990
01:03:28,532 --> 01:03:31,592
you must know.
you can't fool me.

991
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:34,501
Ifthere's one thing I don't
look for in a maid, it's discretion.

992
01:03:34,571 --> 01:03:37,005
Except with my own secrets,
of course.

993
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:39,372
well, I don't knowmuch,
milady,

994
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:42,708
but apparently he was counting
on sirwilliam for an investment...

995
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:46,271
and had guaranteed his interest,
whatever that means.

996
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,716
Anyway, Mr. Barnes,
the commander's valet,

997
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:51,219
he said he wanted
to leave at once,

998
01:03:51,288 --> 01:03:55,224
but Lady Lavinia's persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow
to make less of a thing of it.

999
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:57,226
-[Door Opens ]
-[Sylvia ] Oh, thank heavens.

1000
01:03:57,294 --> 01:03:59,558
Lewis told me
you were wearing white.

1001
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,565
white?. she must be mad.
I never wear white.

1002
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:04,567
I thought
it was a little odd.

1003
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,968
By the way, for God's sake,
don't rub him up tonight.

1004
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:10,973
- I don't know what you mean.
- you know exactlywhat I mean.

1005
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,475
He's in a filthy mood
with everyone.

1006
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:15,636
He's talking about
stopping your allowance.

1007
01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:20,483
But it's for life.
That was settled. He can't do that.

1008
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:24,316
Justyou watch him.
He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.

1009
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:27,323
so ifyou'll take my advice,
you won't give him one.

1010
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,325
[Door Closes ]

1011
01:04:29,393 --> 01:04:31,827
Now, thatyou can be
discreet about.

1012
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:38,167
Thankyou.

1013
01:04:40,904 --> 01:04:43,099
[Lavinia ]
Goodness, isn't it prettyhere?

1014
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:46,267
The house has
such lovely position.

1015
01:04:46,343 --> 01:04:48,937
The best view's
from the old water tower.

1016
01:04:49,012 --> 01:04:51,446
you might well
walk up there tomorrow.

1017
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:55,784
Do you really have to
go back to London?.

1018
01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:57,786
I am afraid so,
Raymond.

1019
01:04:57,854 --> 01:05:00,721
when you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

1020
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:04,293
yes, there is,
isn't there?.

1021
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:06,295
Moan, moan, moan.

1022
01:05:06,363 --> 01:05:08,695
[whispering]

1023
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:17,707
would anybody care for
a game ofbridge after dinner?.

1024
01:05:17,774 --> 01:05:19,708
[Nesbitt]
Oh,yes, I wouldn't mind.

1025
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:23,541
who else?.
Louisa, how about you?.

1026
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:28,243
Oh, I don't think so.
I've rather gone off cards.

1027
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:30,548
I've never been very lucky
with them.

1028
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:33,384
Me too.

1029
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:41,090
Mr. weissman, tell us about
the film you're going to make.

1030
01:05:41,164 --> 01:05:44,600
Oh, sure. It's called Charlie Chan
in London. It's a detective story.

1031
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:48,160
- set in London?.
- well, not really.

1032
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:51,503
Most of it takes place at
a shooting party in a country house,

1033
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:54,009
sort of like this one,
actually.

1034
01:05:54,077 --> 01:05:57,308
A murder in the middle ofthe night.
A lot ofguests for the weekend.

1035
01:05:57,381 --> 01:05:59,815
Everyone's a suspect.
That sort of thing.

1036
01:06:00,884 --> 01:06:03,352
How horrid.

1037
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,684
And who turns out
to have done it?

1038
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:08,987
I couldn't tell you that.
It would spoil it foryou.

1039
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:11,994
- Oh, but none of us will see it.
- [ Gasps, Chuckles ]

1040
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,662
Are you thinking of
making it here, Mr. weissman?.

1041
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:19,998
Uh, no, we're going to shoot it
in Hollywood, on the back lot.

1042
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:24,598
Butsince I was in England,
I thought I would do
a little research on country living...

1043
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:29,611
and Ivor was kind enough
to arrange it for me.

1044
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:32,307
Mm m, no.
wil I iam arranged it for you.

1045
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:36,113
- [ weissman ]
Are you interested in films, sir?
- [ scoffs ] Not likely.

1046
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:39,019
why shouldn't I
be interested in films?.

1047
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:40,989
you don't know
what I'm interested in.

1048
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:44,391
well, I know you're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

1049
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:46,395
but when it comes to anything else,
I'm stumped.

1050
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:48,397
That is not fair.
Bill is--

1051
01:06:50,534 --> 01:06:52,468
[ Laughs ]

1052
01:07:38,248 --> 01:07:40,182
Elsie.

1053
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,685
Elsie, what's--

1054
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:49,357
It's not as if
I didn't know.

1055
01:07:49,426 --> 01:07:52,623
- [ Chuckling ]
- so we can all play bridge.

1056
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:57,633
- All playing?.
- who's going to play bridge?.
Are they going to play?.

1057
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,794
where's Rupert?.

1058
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,031
- Rupert!
- [Standish ] Coming.

1059
01:08:02,105 --> 01:08:04,039
[whispering]

1060
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:08,407
- I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out ofturn.
- you didn't actually see?.
