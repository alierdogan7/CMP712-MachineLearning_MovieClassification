PROFESSOR: l'd like to discuss

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,278
the demand for money
by focusing on...

193
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,654
the money multiplier.

194
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,700
Add increases in currency,
deposits, reserves and bank credits.

195
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,743
Then we have the sum of
an infinite series.

196
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,371
Adding these components together,

197
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,958
we find that they add up
to one plus CU over CU plus RE.

198
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,627
That, simply stated,
is the money multiplier.

Now, moving on...

200
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,132
The essential technique of bartending:

201
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,301
Less is more.

202

204

And the customer?

205
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,100
Think of a customer
as a hurdler thinks of a hurdle.

206
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,602
A means to an end.

at something can be your downfall.

705
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,028
Thank you.

706
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,697
I grant you, it's not
an easy concept to grasp.

707
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,782
Now you take our hero, here.

708
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,452
I haven't seen him in a while
and I've never been here before,

709
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,037
but I will bet my bile duct

710
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,874
that he's got some kind
of success manual behind the bar.

711
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,877
Come on, Flanagan.
I know it's here.

712
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,594
- Touché.
- VoiIá.

713
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,721
You see, Flanagan's a believer.

714
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,847
Always will be.

715
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,224
He doesn't realize the doors are shut
to people like us.

716
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,226
Maybe he wants to open them.

717
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,103
Then he has to
steal the keys, sweetheart.

718
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,981
Something Coughlin here
has been unable to do.

719
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,442
I don't have to, not anymore.

720
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,651
I've had my miracle.

721
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,780
Oh, what? Some alky
remember you in his will?

722
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,450
Better.

723
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,202
I am in love.

724
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:06,912
Oh.

725
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,998
There is my miracle.

00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,128
Waiting for everyone to notice her?

728
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,923
How dare you speak that way
about my wife.

730
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,511
Your wife?

731
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,222
- In your dreams.
- For real.

732
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,349
We are here on our honeymoon.

733
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,475
Sweetheart!

734
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,938
Come hither!

735
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,781
You're married?

736
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,992
This is true love, young Flanagan.

737
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,994
True love with a kicker.

738
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,288
She's got millions.

739
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,623
Where were you?

740
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,542
I thought you'd drowned or something.

741
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,876
No such luck.

742
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,837
Brian Flanagan. Kerry Coughlin.

743
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,130
The love of my life.

744
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,882
- BRIAN: Hello.
- Hi.

745
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,009
You see before you
a changed man.

746
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:07,013
The love of a good woman
has made me see the light.

748

Brian's cute.
How long have you known him?

749
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,367
About 10 hours.

750
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,290
Excuse me.

751
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,000
There you go.

752
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,753
I have never seen a club
with such intense dance vibes.

753
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,381
Come on,
let's decimate this dance floor.

754
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,012
I don't get the two of them.

755
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,601
Simple. She's a rich chick,
whose family owns half of Manhattan.

756
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:56,688
Just to piss them off,
she decided to marry a bartender.

757
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,940
True love.

758
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,984
Let's dance.

759
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:30,138
Do you ever have the feeling
that you might meet somebody?

760
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,974
You know when you
walk into some place.

761
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,978
- Star-crossed lovers syndrome?
- Hmm.

762
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,230
No.

763
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,606
No?

764
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,984
I had a premonition
that I was gonna meet somebody

765
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,194
when I came down here.

766
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,820
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

767
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,281
You still got time, you know.

768
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,451
Some woman must have really
done a job on you.

769
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,954
Why does it always
have to be a woman?

770
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,414
It doesn't. Your friend,
what's his name...

771
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,333
Doug could've done it to you.

772

What's this?

773
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,504
Immune to Coughlin's fatal charms?

774
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,965
Give him a minute. You'll love him.
All women do.

I'm not like all women.

I'll give you that.

not to lose my unique status.

So, is this one-night stand time?

783
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,791
It doesn't make you a bad person.

784

Your parents own half of Manhattan?

No.

- Someday it will.

Yes, he is.

But still he gets up in the morning,

816

he kisses his wife and
he goes to his drink-umbrella factory,

817

01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,226
There'll be someone with you
in a moment.

1227
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,561
Thank you.

1228
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:31,331
I'm Richard Mooney.

1229
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,418
- I'm Jordan's father.
- I'm Brian Flanagan.

1230
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,671
- I've come to see her.
- She's not here.

1231
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,757
But come in.

1232
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,634
I'd like to talk to you.

1233
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:48,098
Sit down.

1234
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:56,648
I've certainly heard a lot about you
in the last couple of days.

1235
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,695
I don't know what really happened
between the two of you, but...

1236
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,866
I must say, you've got a lot of nerve

1237
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:09,077
coming up here after
what you did to Jordan.

1238
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,204
I understand that,

1239
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,998
and I realize that Jordan is very upset.

1240
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:16,584
But if I could talk to her, make her see

1241
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,087
that I'm gonna
stick by her through this...

1242
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,714
I hope you're not suggesting
that you'll marry her.

1243
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,844
(SIGHS)

1244
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:29,514
I'm not sure what we're gonna do.
We have a lot to talk about...

1245
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,809
The hell you do!

1246
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:37,105
Look, I know Jordan a lot better
than you do,

1247
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,858
and I've never seen her
as unhappy as she is at this moment.

1248
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:43,486
She is just not very wise
in the ways of the world.

1249
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:47,240
Right now, what she needs around
are people she can trust.

1250
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,452
- She can trust me.
- She doesn't want to see you.

1251
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,329
She doesn't even want to talk to you.

1252
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,792
Just wait here one moment,
will you please?

1253
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,004
(SIGHS)

1254
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,679
- Good afternoon, Miss Mooney.
- Hi.

1255
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,771
- Mr. Mooney, I think I'm just gonna...
- Flanagan, here.

1256
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,774
- What the hell's this?
- That's for you.

1257
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,615
$10,000.

1258
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:34,120
- Is that all your daughter's worth?
- How much will it take?

1259
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,206
I don't want your goddamn money.

1260
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,667
You can't buy me out of Jordan's life!

1261
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,754
You think I'd let some bartender
destroy my daughter's life?

1262
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,465
- That is her choice!
- The hell you say!

1263
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,509
JORDAN: What is going on here?

1264
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:50,011
Jordan, I came here to talk to you.

1265
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,806
- If you don't get out of here...
- Dad, I'll handle this!

1266
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,810
I know the other night
I didn't say the right things.

1267
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,063
God knows I have not done
the right things.

1268
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,733
But I think there's a chance for us.

1269
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,152
Brian, there is no "us."

1270
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,821
There are too many things
about "us" that don't work.

1271
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,740
What about the baby?

1272
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:13,368
A kid, I mean, our kid needs a father.

1273
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,038
Not one that won't be around in a year.

1274
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,874
With your lifestyle,
what kind of father would you be?

1275
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,504
Jordan, I want a second chance.

1276
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,298
No.

1277
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:30,510
- I deserve a second chance.
- No.

1278
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,014
How will I ever know
that you're being honest with me?

1279
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,141
You can barely be honest with yourself.

1280
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,768
Honest?

1281
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,770
Were you so honest?

1282
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,356
Why didn't you tell me
you were the original rich chick?

1283
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,733
Because you're so hung up on money,

1284
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,779
I was afraid I'd never know
how you felt about me.

1285
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,116
Me! How you'd really feel about me.

1286
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,829
See this?

1287
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:03,126
This is your father's idea
of how to get me out of your life.

1288
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:11,134
This is how hung up on money I am.

1289
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,470
As for the way I feel about you,

1290
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,225
I guess you'll never know.

1291
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,778
WOMAN 1: Let me in!

1292
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,363
WOMAN 2: Hey, what about us?

1293
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,115
We've been here for two hours!

1294
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,701
MAN: Let us in, Henry. It's cold out here.

1295
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,910
WOMAN 3: Henry? Remember me?

1296
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,912
WOMAN 4:
I'm Bruce Springsteen's cousin.

1297
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,914
- You look more like his couch.
- MAN: Henry!

1298
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,042
I'm Doug's friend.

1299
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,045
Mr. Coughlin doesn't have any friends
on a Saturday night.

1300
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,505
- BRIAN: Good evening, Henry.
- Hey!

1301
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,507
(POP SONG PLAYING)

1302
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,681
- Where's Doug Coughlin?
- Over there.

1303
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,351
Hey, you!

1304
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,852
Doug!

1305
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,480
- Coughlin! Doug!
- Flanagan!

1306
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,941
My best friend in the world!
My only friend!

1307
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,860
Piss off, Henry. It's okay.

1308
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,280
It's great to see you, my only friend.
Sit down.

1309
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:17,033
It looks like you've got
a lot of friends here this evening.

1310
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,868
- Proctologist's dream.
- What?

1311
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,953
- Wall-to-wall assholes.
- (CHUCKLING)

1312
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,832
- Great to see you, Flanagan.
- I've come to pay off my bet.

1313
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,251
- Brian!
- Kerry!

1314
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,089
What are you doing here?

1315
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:34,092
BRIAN: I've come
to beg and plead for a job.

1316
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:37,512
It'd be great to get some talent
behind the bar.

1317
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,569
Let's go somewhere where
we can appreciate this.

1318
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,113
Come on.

1319
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,164
DOUG: Get in there.

1320
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,333
Get in there and spend some money.

1321
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,585
Keep me in the manner
I'm accustomed to.

1322
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,755
Get in there and spend some money,
you two.

1323
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,258
What do you think of my rowboat?

1324
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,761
BRIAN: Jesus Christ!

1325
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:20,346
DOUG: Come aboard, ye landlubber!

1326
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,728
BRIAN: Baccarat crystal.

1327
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,939
Louis XIII. VoiIá.

1328
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,067
Should we let it breathe?

1329
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,779
It hasn't breathed in 50 years.
It's dead.

1330
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:38,573
Let's just drink it.

1331
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,505
- Health and friendship?
- Life and love.

1332
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:08,895
Douglas Coughlin,
your ship has certainly come in!

1333
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:09,979
(LAUGHS)

1334
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:13,816
My ship.

1335
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:19,238
My ship is going down,
and I'm going down with it.

1336
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,657
- How's that?
- All this is an illusion.

1337
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,787
I'm on my ass.
I haven't got a pot to piss in.

1338
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,205
Mmm.

1339
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,333
$100,000 a week. Painful.

1340
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,213
I should've read some of
your sacred books, young Flanagan.

1341
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:40,927
The only thing I know about saloons is
how to pour whiskey and run my mouth.

1342
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,555
I knew nothing about insurance,

1343
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:51,813
or sales tax, or the building code,
or labor costs,

1344
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:55,441
or the power company,
or purchasing, or linens.

1345
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:58,027
Everyone with a hand
stuck it in my pocket.

1346
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,029
You must make enough to cover that.

1347
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:04,534
If I'd stuck to what I know best,
which is almost nothing.

1348
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,789
Instead I put all the cash
into commodities.

1349
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:13,042
And blew the fucking lot.

1350
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,293
(CHUCKLES)

1351
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:18,840
On the margin.
Buy, cover, buy, cover.

1352
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,385
I wanted it fast.

1353
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,682
See the headlines.

1354
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:32,645
"Douglas Coughlin:
From bartender to billionaire."

1355
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,730
(CHUCKLES MIRTHLESSLY)

1356
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,403
Hey, take it easy.

1357
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,571
Relax.

1358
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:46,325
The luck is gone, the brain is shot.

1359
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,995
But the liquor, we still got.

1360
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,542
KERRY: Doug?

1361
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,087
Are you down there?

1362
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:03,092
She knows nothing about this.
She thinks I'm a fucking hero.

1363
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,686
DOUG: My princess. My dream.

1364
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,606
Baby, not again.

1365
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,149
I want to go home.

1366
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,026
Come here.

1367
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:22,820
Toast, Flanagan.

1368
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,533
To the first and last person
I ever cared about.

1369
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,287
My wife.

1370
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,580
Doug?

1371
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,125
Doug, wake up.

1372
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,461
I want to go home.

1373
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:03,945
You know you're the only person
in the world Doug respects?

1374
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,491
We were a good team once.

1375
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,370
Walk me to my apartment.

1376
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,830
I hate going to that place alone.

1377
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,337
- I better check on Doug.
- Please?

1378
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:24,757
I want to talk about Doug.

1379
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,592
About his problems.

1380
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,633
Doug says
you're incredible with women.

1381
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,052
A real lady-killer.

1382
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,971
Is that what he says?

1383
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:15,182
What's your secret weapon?

1384
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:20,229
What you see is what you get.

1385
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,500
- Hold it.
- What'd you do that for?

1386
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,753
(SIGHING)

1387
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:49,967
I can't make it
with my best friend's old lady.

1388
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,138
Am I supposed to
live with the same man,

1389
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,557
day in and day out, forever,

1390
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,559
and have no one else in my life?

1391
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,145
Yes. It's called marriage.

1392
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,272
You wanted this as much as I did.

1393
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,066
That's why you're up here.
