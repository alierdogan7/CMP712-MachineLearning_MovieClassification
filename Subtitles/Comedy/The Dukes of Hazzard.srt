1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,119
I'd give a nickel
to find out why they're chasing us.

2
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:11,952
I say who steals what, from whom,
and where.

3
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,856
- Is this your money?
- It is now.

4
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,732
I don't care who gets hurt,
just as long as I get my money back.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,733
<i>Y'all stick around, you hear?</i>

6
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:41,883
You figured out yet if it's us he's chasing?

7
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,781
Yep, got it all figured out.

8
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,586
- See anybody in front of us?
- No.

9
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:47,679
Then it's us.

10
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:51,323
Enos, you got your ears on? Come on.

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,551
Yes, sir. I read you, Sheriff.

12
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:55,926
I'm at Parkins Road, like you said. Over.

13
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:59,863
I got them heading towards you,
about 3 miles out. Over.

14
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:02,763
Come ahead, Sheriff.
There ain't nobody getting past me.

15
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,714
I'm gonna turn off here,
just to see if he's serious.

16
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:26,221
He's serious.

17
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,995
But we ain't done nothing wrong,
have we?

18
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,167
- We're gonna hit old Slade.
- Hang a right. Come on.

19
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,541
- How's he know it's us if it ain't our car?
- I bet your dazzling driving gave us away.

20
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:47,804
And if you don't step on it,
he'll give us a ticket for illegal parking.

21
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,202
I'd give a nickel
to find out why they're chasing us.

22
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:11,670
- There's Enos. You can ask him.
- All right.

23
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,764
I was kidding!

24
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,122
<i>Rosco?</i>

25
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,631
Sheriff Coltrane here. Over.

26
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,129
You come see me.

27
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:47,138
You see, I'm in hot pursuit,
and I'm just gonna get them...

28
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,709
Now, Rosco. Don't make me tell you twice.

29
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,703
Roger, wilco, and out.

30
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,940
And cut that CB shuck and jive.

31
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,779
Just say goodbye and
hightail your rear end over here pronto.

32
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:03,521
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,595
Enos, how are you doing, boy?

34
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,259
I'm in hot pursuit, Sheriff, and closing.

35
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,191
That's a boy, get them!
Just stay with them, and stay on them.

36
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,601
Over and out.

37
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,600
He sure is good, old Enos is.

38
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,906
He should be.
He's learned from his daddy...

39
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,506
and his daddy ran moonshine
right alongside your daddy and mine.

40
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,982
<i>Seems like everybody's daddy</i>
<i>in Hazzard County...</i>

41
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:33,248
<i>used to run moonshine</i>
<i>at one time or another...</i>

42
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,755
<i>alongside everybody else's daddy.</i>

43
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,886
He sure is good.

44
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,851
You can tell him that.

45
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,830
He's gonna catch us any minute,
the way you're poking along.

46
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,833
I was gonna let you take that bow
and shoot his tires out...

47
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,267
but I'm afraid you'd miss and hit ours.

48
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:54,505
I wish there were some girls around here.
Maybe you'd show off and drive faster.

49
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,804
<i>Now, who in the world would get</i>
<i>chased by the law and not know why?</i>

50
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:28,741
<i>Bo and Luke Duke. The Duke boys.</i>

51
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,010
<i>They fight the system...</i>

52
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,647
<i>when they ain't fighting</i>
<i>among themselves.</i>

53
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,873
Oh, no.

54
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,543
<i>Moonshine.</i>

55
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:39,881
- What is it?
- Moonshine.

56
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,921
You keep her humping
and I'll ditch the evidence.

57
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,128
<i>And who would borrow</i>
<i>the only car in the county...</i>

58
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,430
<i>Ioaded with the very thing</i>
<i>to get their probation revoked?</i>

59
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,496
<i>Getting caught with that moonshine</i>
<i>means two years in prison...</i>

60
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,167
<i>sure as God made little green apples.</i>

61
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:42,709
Who was Cooter running that whiskey for?

62
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,274
Somebody luckier than us.

63
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,980
That somebody
is gonna be awful peeved at Cooter.

64
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,784
We'll write him an excuse.

65
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,944
<i>Now, don't y'all go relaXing too much.</i>
<i>The boys ain't out of trouble yet.</i>

66
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,339
<i>Like my old uncle used to say:</i>

67
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,215
<i>"There's trouble, and then there's trouble."</i>

68
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:22,549
<i>And the trouble with some trouble</i>
<i>is at first it don't look like trouble.</i>

69
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,558
Did you see that?

70
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:31,165
Not unless you mean Mary Kaye Porter.
5'5", 115 pounds...

71
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:35,459
honey-blonde hair, baby blue eyes,
nice smile, and loads of dimples.

72
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,697
What's she doing on a back mountain road
that don't see a car in two or three hours?

73
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,742
We're about to find out.

74
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,514
- Hey there, Mary Kaye.
- Hey there, yourself.

75
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,421
I ain't seen you in these parts in months.

76
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,651
How's about nine?

77
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,962
- Yeah, how about that?
- Thanks for stopping and all.

78
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,632
Every day, it takes a little more
huffing and puffing.

79
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,696
- Where are you headed?
- Florida.

80
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:15,841
- That is south.
- I want to go there and have my baby.

81
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:18,242
I didn't know you had any kin in Florida.

82
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:22,215
No, we don't.
I've always been partial to Florida.

83
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,773
Taking the scenic route?

84
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:28,016
Well, the Sheriff don't allow hitchhiking
on the freeways.

85
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:31,589
Listen, I really appreciate this. I really do.

86
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,496
- How's Uncle Jesse, and Daisy, and them?
- They're fine.

87
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,493
- Right, y'all set back there?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

88
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:52,908
You okay?

89
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:59,514
Either they're after me for hitchhiking,
or Bo's turned into Richard Petty.

90
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:03,785
Sorry. Old Bo here's a leadfoot.
It won't happen again.

91
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:08,823
<i>You ever seen a car chase where</i>
<i>you can't go over 30 miles an hour?</i>

92
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,151
Sheriff Rosco Coltrane here.

93
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,119
<i>Rosco, what in tarnation is keeping you?</i>

94
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,648
Boss...

95
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,919
If you ain't here inside five minutes,
you will be...

96
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,556
- I'm in!
<i>...the night rent-a-cop...</i>

97
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,259
<i>at the drive-in deli...</i>

98
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,531
on Frontage Road.

99
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,996
- Rosco.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:56,100
One of my best customers,
namely Mayor...

101
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:57,704
Erase that.

102
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:01,541
One of my best customers,
who shall remain nameless...

103
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:05,250
has been waiting over two hours
for delivery.

104
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,489
Well, Boss, you know
I'd do anything in the world for you.

105
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:12,993
But you know I can't be hauling
moonshine in a police car.

106
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,162
- Has anybody asked you, jackass?
- No, sir.

107
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,461
All my regular drivers
went to the church fish-fry.

108
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:23,334
I wish I'd gone. They got some girls
down there that's got me...

109
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:26,840
So I hired Cooter Davenport.
He loves my money.

110
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:30,076
Now it looks like
he loves my whiskey, too.

111
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:32,644
He ought to. That's good shine.

112
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:36,241
With those navel oranges,
and you get some apple juice...

113
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:43,253
That wasn't Cooter who's got
your whiskey. It's them Duke boys.

114
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:46,020
Bo and Luke Duke.
In fact, I was after them.

115
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,392
I got them down a dirt road,
got them boxed in...

116
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,863
and they hooked this 180-degreer...

117
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,966
Well, then I want Cooter, or Bo, or Luke...

118
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:57,266
or somebody arrested!

119
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:01,138
- For stealing your moonshine?
- For possession of moonshine.

120
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,609
- It's illegal. Look it up.
- Right.

121
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:07,044
- Damn, I hate a thief.
- Me, too. I hate those guys.

122
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,879
Besides, anybody stealing from me...

123
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,715
- sets a bad example for everybody else.
- Right.

124
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,119
When it comes to stealing
in Hazzard County...

125
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:19,592
I say who steals what, from whom,
and where.

126
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:23,757
<i>In case you're new around here,</i>
<i>Boss Hogg runs things in Hazzard County.</i>

127
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,423
<i>Including the Sheriff.</i>

128
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,163
<i>Now, if he wants somebody arrested,</i>
<i>somebody's gonna get arrested.</i>

129
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:32,834
<i>And Bo and Luke are leading candidates</i>
<i>to be somebody.</i>

130
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,901
Right, I'm gonna get them this time.
I'm gonna get over there.

131
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:40,573
You just better, or else you will be...

132
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:44,345
The night rent-a-cop
at the drive-in deli on Frontage Road.

133
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:48,153
<i>And that's just the first twist</i>
<i>of the few knots in this tale.</i>

134
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,862
- Old Enos is heading home for lunch.
- Well, even deputies get hungry.

135
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:04,636
You know, one thing you can count on
with any car of Cooter Davenport's...

136
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,571
is you can't count on it.

137
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:12,576
You know, Mary Kaye, I never got to meet
this husband of yours...

138
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:17,381
but, if you don't mind my saying so,
he's elevated being a fool to a new level.

139
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:20,919
I was the fool.
See, I thought we could make it work.

140
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,648
But he's out of my life now.

141
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:26,250
And, anyway,
Andy's family is happy it's over.

142
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:29,728
Well, they gotta be nuts.
Not wanting to see their own grandchild?

143
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:32,493
Being country, I wasn't right for their son.

144
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,128
You know, with college, society,
money, and all.

145
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:40,266
What you just said about money and all...

146
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:42,571
It seems to me
what you should have done...

147
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:46,010
is had them send you some
so you could get back to Florida...

148
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:48,747
get that baby of yours born...

149
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,842
and help you out
until you get back on your feet again.

150
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,753
I don't want anything from them,
not even a wedding ring.

151
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,923
Except you got something.

152
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:03,324
Yeah, I thought that way at first, too,
but I don't now.

153
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,991
I mean, I'm glad. 'Cause it's a life.

154
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:10,337
Hey, there may be a president in there.

155
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:14,499
Well, Mr. President, would you
and your mother please get in the car?

156
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,273
Ms. President. She's a girl.

157
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:32,819
Enos, this is Sheriff Rosco.
You got your ears on? Come on.

158
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,590
Here I am, Sheriff.

159
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,090
Are you still in hot pursuit, boy?

160
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,966
More like lukewarm, Sheriff. I lost them.

161
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,272
You lost them?

162
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,841
One thing about you, Enos,
you're consistent.

163
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:07,090
Give me about $2 worth, will you?

164
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:16,733
- We're gonna have to help her out.
- She'd never take a handout.

165
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:20,201
Maybe we could kind of slip the money
into her suitcase...

166
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:23,072
and she'd find it when she got to Florida?

167
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,246
Keeping some back for lunch,
I got about $6.

168
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:30,878
I got $4 and some change.

169
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,882
She sure didn't take much.

170
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,292
<i>Now, what did I say?</i>

171
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:46,527
<i>Didn't I tell you</i>
<i>there's a twist or two to go?</i>

172
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:58,340
Well, I'm surprised
you Duke boys just didn't drive off with it.

173
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,337
You sure had us fooled.

174
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,712
- Is this your money?
- It is now.

175
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,214
You in trouble, Mary Kaye?

176
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:07,049
You see, you've already decided the worst.

177
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,554
No, not us.

178
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,121
- Where did you get it?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

179
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,820
How much is in there?

180
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:18,127
Exactly $118,254.37.

181
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:23,733
$118,254.

182
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,431
And 37 cents.

183
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,732
That is a considerable amount to be lost.

184
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,108
Lost? More like stolen.

185
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:36,615
And you say all that money is down here,
in my county?

186
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:39,448
Yep, and I know just who I'm looking for.

187
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:43,851
But I wouldn't step on to your turf
without touching base with you.

188
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,220
I stay out of Atlanta
and you stay out of Hazzard County.

189
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,894
- Good fences make good neighbors.
- True.

190
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,124
Except for now.

191
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,662
You say you know who.

192
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,266
Mary Kaye Porter.

193
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:03,233
That's Henry Porter's youngest.

194
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:06,538
- She wouldn't.
- She would and she did.

195
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:11,148
Her boyfriend was working for me,
had the money at the house.

196
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,753
When he got arrested, she took it.

197
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,954
Is there something I can do to help?

198
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,288
Leo and me will handle this one.

199
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:25,498
I'm not sure I like the word "handle."

200
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,897
Mr. McQuade
will be a whole lot friendlier...

201
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,404
when he finds
that none of his money is missing.

202
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:34,134
That includes the 37 cents.

203
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:48,511
$118,254.37.

204
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:52,659
- And not one penny of it's for yourself?
- That's what I said.

205
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,558
I know that's what you said, but...

206
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:57,358
Child support at $100 a week
for 18 years...

207
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:00,400
comes to exactly $93,600.

208
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:04,263
And the rest is for medical expenses,
estimated dental costs...

209
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:05,862
and college education.

210
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,001
Plus, enough to cover the rate of inflation
figured at about 10% a year.

211
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,375
I'm sure glad
she didn't get a craving for pickles.

212
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:13,936
- I did, early on.
- So am I.

213
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:17,576
Right now,
I'll die if I don't find some pickled peaches.

214
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,386
I'm sure glad I'm not pregnant.
I think I'd get sick.

215
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:22,888
Don't worry.

216
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:26,718
For a little old country girl,
you've sure got a mind for figures.

217
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:30,628
Little old country girls
can add and multiply, you know. Here.

218
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,528
Anyway, there's one thing more.

219
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:39,303
There aren't any parents.
My husband's, I mean. I made them up.

220
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,807
- Did you make up your husband, too?
- No.

221
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:46,608
Well, we talked about getting married,
but he said there wasn't any rush.

222
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,448
At the time.

223
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:52,308
I loved him and he loved me.

224
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,984
He also said that he was in real estate.
Not true.

225
00:17:56,457 --> 00:18:00,120
He worked for somebody named McQuade,
a gangster in Atlanta.

226
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:03,925
<i>If you're wondering why the boys' eyes</i>
<i>are bugged out like a popeyed mule...</i>

227
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,125
<i>Well, in Chicago, it was Al Capone.</i>

228
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,895
<i>In New York, Dutch Schultz.</i>

229
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:13,037
<i>And, in Atlanta, it's Quirt McQuade,</i>
<i>and most everybody knows it.</i>

230
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,437
My husband was sent to jail...

231
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,707
and Mr. McQuade didn't lift a finger,
or a lawyer, to help.

232
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:23,173
That's Andy's child,
but that's not Andy's money.

233
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,276
Andy was supposed to deliver
that money to McQuade, right?

234
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:27,445
Yeah, I guess.

235
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:31,184
You got any idea what McQuade's
gonna do to you when he finds you?

236
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:33,658
Listen, y'all have been really sweet...

237
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:37,754
but I think I'm gonna leave you here,
'cause I don't want you to get involved.

238
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:46,830
If that ain't indigestion, we're in trouble.

239
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:50,934
<i>You know, there's times when it's hard</i>
<i>for good old boys to be good old boys.</i>

240
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,979
<i>And this is one of them.</i>

241
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,953
How do you keep from cracking up
with that old Boss Hogg?

242
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,285
It wasn't easy.

243
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,588
How about when he says,
he stays out of Atlanta...

244
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,094
if you stay out of Hazzard County?

245
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,493
- Now, that's fair.
- Sure, to us.

246
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:21,904
- Come in.
- Yes, Boss?

247
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:25,002
Tell me something.
Do you know the way to the Porter farm?

248
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,376
Sure do.

249
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:29,482
I went to school with Mary Kaye Porter
since the third grade.

250
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,018
- I ain't seen her lately.
- You'll see her today.

251
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:35,419
- How come?
- She's come into a great sum of money.

252
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,649
And it could be very dangerous for her
to hold on to it.

253
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:41,024
- And you're gonna help her out?
- Right.

254
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,863
By holding on to it yourself?

255
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,630
Something like that. Let's go.

256
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,612
- Here he comes.
- That's the cue.

257
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:20,663
I ask you boys not to haul moonshine.
And what do you do?

258
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:24,067
- You don't listen to me.
- Why did you have to go and do this?

259
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:26,436
Now you're gonna end up going to jail!

260
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:32,170
I've told you time and time again.

261
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:55,193
I was just saying to Daisy,
"I think company's coming."

262
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,930
Listen, I heard voices in here...

263
00:20:57,004 --> 00:21:01,202
We were reminiscing about when the boys
got caught moonshining two years ago.

264
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,708
Bo and Luke ain't here.

265
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:05,870
They're gonna be here, and soon.
I know that.

266
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,436
I doubt that...

267
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:12,277
seeing as how they're driving a car
full of Boss Hogg's whiskey.

268
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,388
Cooter called me
and told me about the mix-up of the cars.

269
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:18,721
Jesse, you don't mind if I stick around
for a little while, do you?

270
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,057
Of course not, Rosco.

271
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,961
You're just a sheriff trying to do your job.

272
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:27,592
- That's right.
- And I'm an uncle trying to do his job.

273
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,869
- What?
- Keeping you from doing your job.

274
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,905
You don't think
those boys are dumb enough...

275
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,967
not to get rid of the whiskey
that's in that car, do you?

276
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:42,482
Yeah, but the question is
did they have time to look into the trunk?

277
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:48,415
It don't make no difference anyway,
because they have been observed...

278
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,356
transporting contraband whiskey
in that vehicle.

279
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,625
That's just gonna
blow the hell out of their probation.

280
00:21:58,432 --> 00:22:01,162
I bet that threw a pucker into you two,
didn't it?

281
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:05,534
<i>Wouldn't you just love to wipe</i>
<i>that egg-sucking grin off of Rosco's face?</i>

282
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,770
<i>As you probably guessed,</i>
<i>these are the two city dudes...</i>

283
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,040
<i>tracking their money,</i>
<i>and a pretty, pregnant woman.</i>

284
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,447
<i>And they ain't doing bad for old city boys.</i>

285
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:20,613
<i>In fact, they're hotter than a pair</i>
<i>of blue tick hounds on their first hunt.</i>

286
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,793
Another 10 miles, we'll be at the farm...

287
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,694
and then there's about 40 miles
of rough road to get to the hospital.

288
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:34,727
We could cut down that old tote road
across the back of Narramore's place...

289
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,703
- and save a couple of miles.
- We do that, rutted like it is...

290
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:41,229
and we'll have us another passenger
before we get there.

291
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:05,164
What do you think it is?

292
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,496
This fan belt's loose, for one thing.

293
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:11,595
This engine's so souped-up, driving it
as slow as we have has given it the colic.

294
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,197
Go grab that tool kit out of the back seat.

295
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:20,711
You just hold on now to everything, okay?

296
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:29,978
Start making like one hell of a mechanic,
or we're gonna become midwives.

297
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:34,393
<i>You reckon it's gonna dawn on them</i>
<i>to wonder why the tools were up front...</i>

298
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:36,952
<i>instead of in the trunk where they belong?</i>

299
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,099
Ever since those boys
were put on probation...

300
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:53,305
they've been thumbing
their nose at the law. Namely, me.

301
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:57,680
Given your kind of law, maybe thumbing
their nose was a gracious gesture.

302
00:24:01,488 --> 00:24:03,786
You were a fair-to-middling lawman, once.

303
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:08,294
- I sure was, for 20 long, underpaid years.
- What happened to your sense of justice?

304
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:12,093
It went with 20 cent bread
and 35 cent gasoline.

305
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,830
Along with my pension, which the people
in Hazzard County vetoed.

306
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:38,149
If it's for you, we'll let you know.

307
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:48,056
Hello.

308
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:51,633
Hello, Daisy?
Is Uncle Mr. Jesse still there?

309
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,130
Yeah. It's Cooter again.

310
00:24:57,511 --> 00:24:58,705
Hey, Cooter.

311
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:02,775
Sir, are Bo and Luke back yet?
They've been gone for an awful long time.

312
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:08,682
Are you still there?

313
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,658
Well, that's good to hear.

314
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:16,960
What's awful good to hear?

315
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,828
We must have a bad connection
or something.

316
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:22,199
That's fine.

317
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:25,128
I'm glad you got your whiskey back.

318
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:31,900
No, he's sitting right here,
waiting for the boys.

319
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,895
Cooter, never mind what I said.

320
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,938
Rosco is on his way over to your place
right now, so stall him.

321
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:03,474
Give the boys time to dump that whiskey.

322
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:05,638
Yes, sir.

323
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:11,212
Some days,
you can't even cram it into second...

324
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:13,116
even if you double-clutch it.

325
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:19,284
What in the world could that
little Porter girl do with all that money?

326
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:25,496
$118,254.37.

327
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,693
- What's that, Boss?
- Nothing.

328
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,937
I just hate to see money
leave Hazzard County.

329
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:34,063
Bad for the economy. Mine.

330
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,574
All right, hit it.

331
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:52,920
Try it again.

332
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:19,813
There she is. Pull on over now.

333
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:28,624
Wait a minute.
We got a lady with a baby back there.

334
00:27:28,695 --> 00:27:32,028
- Where's my money?
- It's my baby's money, Mr. McQuade.

335
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:37,059
Rube, I don't care who gets hurt
just as long as I get my money back.

336
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:39,037
You're gonna have to take it.

337
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:41,472
You want me to handle this,
Mr. McQuade?

338
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:46,935
- I'm very disappointed in you, Mary Kaye.
- Yeah, me, too.

339
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:50,950
<i>I don't know about you, but I'm running</i>
<i>out of things that can go wrong.</i>

340
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:52,746
<i>Stick around.</i>

341
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,650
No quick moves
from either of you two hayseeds.

342
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:04,655
Help Mary Kaye out, Leo.

343
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,164
- No!
- Come on, don't hurt her.

344
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,600
Let go of me.

345
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,434
- Mr. McQuade, I gotta say something.
- Say goodbye.

346
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,303
We'll give you the money back.

347
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,205
Of course you will, my dear.

348
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,515
Come on, let's get them.

349
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:40,827
<i>If I was Mary Kaye's baby, I believe</i>
<i>I'd think twice about being born today.</i>

350
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,045
How're you doing, Mary Kaye?

351
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:58,983
Just dandy.

352
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:30,138
No!

353
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,779
If we throw it out,
they'll stop to pick it up.

354
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,686
No, it's for my baby.

355
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,156
Leave her be. She's got problems enough.

356
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:40,625
<i>Spunky, ain't she?</i>

357
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,129
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>there's one advantage the Dukes have:</i>

358
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,668
<i>They know the country.</i>

359
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:53,433
<i>Maybe taking that advantage</i>
<i>is no way to treat a visitor from the city.</i>

360
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:57,910
<i>But, under the circumstances,</i>
<i>Luke don't mind being called a poor sport.</i>

361
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:04,906
Great.

362
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,421
Now, besides the Sheriff, we got
two hoods from Atlanta following us.

363
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,217
She's running out of time.

364
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,488
If we can make it to Uncle Jesse's,
we'll take you to hospital in his pickup.

365
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,721
I'm willing.

366
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:28,603
Cooter Davenport,
don't you tell me they didn't come back!

367
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:32,909
I heard with my own ears. Those boys
are running moonshine for you.

368
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:35,948
- Ain't that illegal?
- They're running in that blue Plymouth.

369
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:38,849
Sheriff, I wish to report a stolen car.

370
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:41,911
A 1975 blue Plymouth Fury
with Hazzard County...

371
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,651
We know what it looks like. We've been
chasing the dang thing all morning.

372
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:46,953
That's right.

373
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:49,291
Runs good, don't it?

374
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:51,694
She sure does.
What do you run in that thing?

375
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:52,857
I couldn't even catch it.

376
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,868
- What kind of headers are in there?
- Tuned Edelbrocks.

377
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:59,929
- Tuned Edelbrocks?
- I had them put it in last week in Rutledge.

378
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,140
I was running Hookers
on that Chevy that I had.

379
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:07,578
But I totaled the Chevy,
and I was thinking about...

380
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:12,613
- Enos, what are you doing?
- Just a minute.

381
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:15,177
This is what we need on the Sheriff's car.

382
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:16,654
Y'all come by here anytime.

383
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:19,624
I'll give you a good price
on any kind of work that y'all need.

384
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:32,769
Damn and double damn!

385
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:01,956
Howdy.

386
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:06,471
- Hello, McQuade.
- Hello, Boss.

387
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:08,734
Fine day.

388
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:12,005
They're all fine.
Some are just finer than others.

389
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:14,876
That there's the undying truth, ain't it?

390
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,347
We ain't found her, neither.

391
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,376
Well, good hunting.

392
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,410
That's the word.

393
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:47,102
- Hi, Daisy.
- Hi!

394
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,247
The Sheriff was here.

395
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,979
He'll just have to stand in line
and wait his turn.

396
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:56,454
Don't worry about it. We already dumped
the whiskey that was in the car.

397
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:58,684
Including the shine that's in the trunk?

398
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:00,225
- The trunk?
- Yeah.

399
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:01,753
Oh, Lord.

400
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:05,421
We gotta borrow your truck
and take Mary Kaye to the hospital.

401
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:09,229
There ain't gonna be time
to take her anywhere, except in the house.

402
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,736
Now you two boys go boil some water.

403
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:15,332
Daisy, you go turn down the comforter.
We's gonna have us a baby.

404
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,000
You sure you can do it?

405
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:21,275
The only thing we've seen you midwife
is a couple of goats and two mares.

406
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:25,778
My mama was the best midwife
in all of Hazzard County.

407
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,646
Bo, you go tear up some clean sheets.

408
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:31,621
Just go do what I told you.

409
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:35,786
Now, Mary Kaye, don't you be afraid.

410
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:40,692
I can't tell you the number of little babies
I've brought into this world.

411
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:44,730
The very first sight they ever did see
in their whole life...

412
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:47,295
was this handsome face of mine.

413
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,436
Including them two up there.

414
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,741
Now go on. Do what I told you.

415
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,376
Come on, then.

416
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,111
It's okay. I'm all right.

417
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:52,302
It's good for you.

418
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:55,704
Some more.

419
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,990
We's gonna have company real soon.

420
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:07,341
<i>If that baby survives this start,</i>
<i>it deserves to become President.</i>

421
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:13,881
Come on, Mary Kaye. Hold on.

422
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:16,316
Breathe.

423
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,356
Keep breathing.

424
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:36,308
We got enough boiling water here to wash
an elephant and two blue tick hounds.

425
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:38,706
That's supposed to keep
the new father busy.

426
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:41,440
- I ain't the father.
- I ain't, either.

427
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:44,774
But I'll tell you something.

428
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:48,214
With that lady in there,
I wouldn't half mind.

429
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:19,541
Where's my money, son?

430
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,053
With all that happened today
with Mary Kaye's baby...

431
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:25,215
I don't care about the baby.
I care about my money.

432
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,288
Nobody forgets $100,000.

433
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:35,864
It's in the...

434
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:27,978
It's McQuade and Leo.

435
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,360
Keep him covered up.

436
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:48,100
Uncle Jesse,
we're between a rock and a hard place.

437
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:57,046
Uncle Jesse.

438
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:06,748
They're reloading.

439
00:39:10,096 --> 00:39:12,826
Bo, Luke, get out there.

440
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:15,357
- See what you can do.
- All right.

441
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,096
You stay with her.

442
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:44,986
Hold it right there.

443
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,174
I say, McQuade.

444
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:58,556
Would you step over here, please?
I want to talk with you.

445
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:05,828
- What in the hell do you want?
- To begin with, watch your language.

446
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:07,769
Now then, McQuade...

447
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:10,841
Could you please look at me
when I'm talking to you?

448
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,471
You go paging me when there's Indians
out there shooting at me?

449
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:17,543
There's no Indians around here.

450
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,384
I once put in for federal funds...

451
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,048
to help the Indians in Hazzard County.

452
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:26,489
But the federals couldn't find
one single Indian.

453
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,496
No, you're dodging arrows from those
Duke boys because you shot at them.

454
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:35,694
I don't waste no love with them Dukes,
but I won't have shooting in my county.

455
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:37,895
It's bad for business. Mine.

456
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,033
Slot machines, rake-offs, bribing paving
contractors never got nobody killed.

457
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:45,270
But guns, no sirree, Bob!

458
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:49,645
You get back right to Atlanta,
or you're gonna try my patience.

459
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:54,686
Listen, you fat clown,
I'm trying to get my money back.

460
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:57,689
If it takes shooting to get it back,
there's gonna be shooting.

461
00:42:57,757 --> 00:43:00,851
I'm sorry you take that attitude, McQuade.
Real sorry.

462
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:07,062
Hold your fire, boys!
It's me, Boss Hogg, your friend.

463
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,742
If I thought those meanies
would go away and leave us alone...

464
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,606
I'd give them their money back.

465
00:43:18,678 --> 00:43:21,306
- Where is it, Mary Kaye?
- Where's what?

466
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,608
The money.

467
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,950
I don't rightly remember what I did with it.

468
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:30,087
Last thing I remember, I was having
the pains and then the baby came.

469
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,389
First off, it ain't yours to give.

470
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:35,757
- What are you saying?
- It's his.

471
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:39,498
I know he don't have no name yet,
but he's here.

472
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:43,262
And we're all near getting ourselves killed
so he can keep that money.

473
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:45,998
So, you see,
it ain't even yours to give away.

474
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:49,473
- That's true.
- Anyways, you certainly can't give away...

475
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,477
what you can't remember
what you did with, can you?

476
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:56,777
Why am I getting a headache from you?

477
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:01,520
I think we're pretty smart
for a couple of country gals.

478
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:03,612
How come nobody else knows that?

479
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:06,416
Because we keep it a pretty good secret.

480
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:09,123
And let's keep it that way.

481
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:11,524
All three of us.

482
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,467
Now those Dukes have gone too far.

483
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:59,609
My toe! You shot my toe!

484
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:05,047
Do you think I'm a hick sheriff?
I can part your hair anytime.

485
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,455
You won't play football anymore, boy.

486
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:08,408
- Look, let's make a deal.
- No deals. I want my money.

487
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:12,208
- It's yours if you leave us alone.
- You're dead and so are they.

488
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:15,979
All right, shoot.
You'll never see the money.

489
00:46:16,055 --> 00:46:18,250
Freeze! You're under arrest!

490
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:21,659
You have the right to remain silent.

491
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,628
- Anything you say...
- Enos, don't do that now.

492
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:27,598
That constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.

493
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:37,171
- That a boy. Hold him right there.
- Y'all better get out of the way.

494
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:39,837
There's fixing to be a heck of an explosion.

495
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:45,840
- Now, one second.
- You can have the money.

496
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:19,576
Oh, my gosh! All that money is in there.

497
00:47:19,652 --> 00:47:21,210
In there? Oh, no!

498
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:22,879
- My money!
- My evidence!

499
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:25,587
Yep, at least we got rid of that.

500
00:47:25,658 --> 00:47:28,684
<i>End of story. Almost.</i>

501
00:47:30,796 --> 00:47:33,458
Yes, sir,
that could have been a blue sedan.

502
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:34,965
Yep, could have been.

503
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:38,731
And that could have been moonshine
that blew up in the trunk.

504
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:41,136
You guys think you're smart, don't you?

505
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:44,108
<i>The truth is, he ain't really all that mad.</i>

506
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,370
<i>As much as he wants to see</i>
<i>Bo and Luke back in jail...</i>

507
00:47:47,546 --> 00:47:49,537
<i>he don't want to see them dead.</i>

508
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:52,808
<i>Then, there's capturing</i>
<i>them two big city hoods.</i>

509
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:54,683
<i>And that's okay.</i>

510
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:59,053
<i>I mean, everybody should ought to get</i>
<i>a little something out of all this.</i>

511
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:09,297
- Is the Sheriff gone?
- Yeah, he's gone, and Boss Hogg, too.

512
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:10,699
Good.

513
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:14,530
I guess I forgot to tell anybody
that I brought this in.

514
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,068
Brought what?

515
00:48:17,243 --> 00:48:18,335
This!

516
00:48:19,778 --> 00:48:21,370
Would you look at that!

517
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:23,746
This is yours, little fella.

518
00:48:23,816 --> 00:48:26,046
<i>And that's the legend</i>
<i>of how Mary Kaye's baby...</i>

519
00:48:26,118 --> 00:48:28,518
<i>got himself a fine start in life.</i>

520
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:31,320
<i>There ain't nobody would deny him that.</i>

521
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:06,647
English

522
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:14,140
Hey, my name is Daisy.

523
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:16,311
And I want to be a star.

524
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,540
You think Daisy's been took?

525
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:20,479
You're gonna need help, hoss.

526
00:49:21,317 --> 00:49:22,477
He's got it.

527
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,928
<i>Y'all better not go to the refrigerator now.</i>

528
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:52,873
If that had been a wild boar,
you would have missed.

529
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:56,241
If that had been a wild boar,
he wouldn't be in our back yard.

530
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:59,573
That ain't necessarily so.

531
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,715
<i>This is Bo and Luke Duke.</i>

532
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:07,479
<i>They're cousins. They fight the system.</i>
<i>Any system.</i>

533
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:11,021
<i>This is Hazzard County...</i>

534
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:14,255
<i>where you never know</i>
<i>what's gonna happen neXt.</i>

535
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:18,225
Hey, everybody, listen! It's my song!

536
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:20,565
Jessi Colter is singing my song!

537
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:23,999
Come on.

538
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,300
- What are you talking about?
- I wrote this song. I wrote it!

539
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,843
<i>That's Cousin Daisy.</i>

540
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:32,877
<i>She works as a waitress,</i>
<i>but aspires to better things.</i>

541
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,816
<i>Daisy can cause more trouble</i>
<i>than a brand-new baby.</i>

542
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:38,079
<i>Uncle Jesse is the Duke patriarch.</i>

543
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:39,913
<i>His word is law...</i>

544
00:51:40,122 --> 00:51:44,081
<i>usually obeyed out of love,</i>
<i>but always obeyed.</i>

545
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,658
- Who did you say that was singing?
- It's Jessi Colter.

546
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,127
<i>And for all you folks</i>
<i>ignorant of good music...</i>

547
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,929
<i>Jessi Colter</i>
<i>is one of the world's best singers.</i>

548
00:51:53,169 --> 00:51:55,797
<i>Well, I'm partial to June Carter, myself.</i>

549
00:51:56,372 --> 00:52:00,604
<i>And that was Jessi Colter's latest</i>
<i>on the</i> Big 40 Country Hits Album.

550
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:03,239
I just can't believe it.

551
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,480
That sounded real good, Daisy.

552
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:09,148
It took me forever
to write the notes down.

553
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:11,413
And after all these years
of writing songs...

554
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:15,480
I sent it to this music publisher,
and now Jessi Colter is singing it!

555
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:18,057
That's great. How much did they pay you?

556
00:52:18,194 --> 00:52:20,628
- The pay?
- Well, they did pay you.

557
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,422
No, I paid them.

558
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:26,463
That's the sort of business
we ought to have.

559
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:30,561
There was a magazine ad where
you pay $50, and they publish your song.

560
00:52:30,706 --> 00:52:33,300
So I saved up all my tip money
till I had enough...

561
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:37,369
and I sent my song in, and I got
this letter back saying it was published.

562
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,748
Now, Daisy, some of those ads
are for phony operations.

563
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:45,987
You think Daisy's been took?

564
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:49,684
They got Daisy's song.
Jessi Colter got a recording.

565
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,894
And Daisy's got $50 less
than she had before.

566
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:55,029
That's took.

567
00:52:55,331 --> 00:52:58,459
And $50 in nickel tips
ain't easy to come by.

568
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:01,434
When you record a song,
you're supposed to get royalties.

569
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:04,029
Where is this publishing company,
anyway?

570
00:53:04,106 --> 00:53:07,041
It's Lester Starr Music Publishing
in Atlanta.

571
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,811
That place ain't been right
since Sherman burned it.

572
00:53:11,547 --> 00:53:15,916
Come on, I'll bet this Mr. Starr
just made an oversight.

573
00:53:16,419 --> 00:53:19,217
Think we ought to go in to Atlanta
and check it out?

574
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:21,313
Maybe you ought to.

575
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:25,994
But you gotta remember, boys...

576
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:29,429
you gotta give them city people
the benefit of the doubt.

577
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:33,491
It ain't right to take advantage of them
just because they don't know no better.

578
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:35,093
So just keep it simple.

579
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:43,235
<i>General Lee was their racing car.</i>
<i>They built him from the wheels up.</i>

580
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:45,846
<i>Although they had another car...</i>

581
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:48,884
<i>when the boys eXpected trouble,</i>
<i>they drove the General.</i>

582
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:51,351
<i>Which meant they drove him a lot.</i>

583
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,949
Now, why can't I go with you?
It's my song.

584
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,088
- Because Jesse told us to handle it.
- Okay.

585
00:53:58,494 --> 00:54:00,394
But y'all be careful now.

586
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,730
<i>Smell like the law, don't it?</i>

587
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:15,538
Jojo, that stuff
ready for the pressing plant yet?

588
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,885
Is that stuff ready
for the pressing plant yet?

589
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,047
Nearly done.

590
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:29,591
I'm expecting some hot tracks,
ripped off in Nashville.

591
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:32,559
They're coming in today,
and I want them on this run.

592
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:43,833
- Mr. Starr.
- Yeah, what is it?

593
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,307
- There are two boys here to see you.
- Send them in.

594
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,847
Hi, guys.

595
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:56,410
Dodie.

596
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:00,617
Come on in, fellas. Come in.

597
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,791
Good to see you. I guess
you want me to hear your song, right?

598
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,054
Wrong.

599
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:10,024
Sheet music?
You write your own music? Heavy!

600
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:12,362
Our Cousin Daisy wrote it.

601
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:16,665
- This has my company's name on it.
- That's what we came to talk to you about.

602
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:20,165
We heard Jessi Colter
singing it on the radio.

603
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:22,039
No kidding? How about that?

604
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:25,309
We was just wondering
about the royalties.

605
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:27,447
Royalties?

606
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:32,485
Funny.

607
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,883
It was recorded. Wasn't there a contract?

608
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:38,885
Look, guys,
I don't know anything about that.

609
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:42,255
Your cousin sent us $50
to publish her song. We did it.

610
00:55:43,165 --> 00:55:46,931
End of transaction.
Now get out of here. I'm very busy.

611
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:49,470
Look, mister, if you're not gonna be
fair about this...

612
00:55:49,538 --> 00:55:51,699
then we want Daisy's $50 back.

613
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,567
Jojo, did you hear that?
This guy just threatened me.

614
00:55:56,345 --> 00:56:00,213
You guys get out of here before Jojo
mails you back to tobacco road.

615
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:02,544
You're gonna need help, hoss.

616
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,715
- He's got it.
- Yeah.

617
00:56:08,457 --> 00:56:10,049
And you best be going.

618
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,329
Go on, get out of here.

619
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,965
I don't want to see your faces
around here again.

620
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:29,400
Gee, I knew it was tough
to get into show business.

621
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:32,341
But I never heard of them
using guns to keep you out.

622
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:34,678
Those.44 Magnums convinced me.

623
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,241
Why would a music publisher
need a bodyguard?

624
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:38,547
I don't know.

625
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:41,249
I just don't like being sent home
with my tail tucked.

626
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:43,848
We can't go home. Tucked or otherwise.

627
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,659
Now, Jesse said either get the royalties
or Daisy's $50 back.

628
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,158
We ain't got either.

629
00:56:49,231 --> 00:56:52,462
Maybe we could reason with Starr,
if his trained ape wasn't around.

630
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,059
How do you plan to do that?

631
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:56,331
What's the last thing
he expects right now?

632
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:58,896
A fat man in a red suit, driving reindeer.

633
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:01,075
No, us.

634
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:04,012
We'll use Stonewall Jackson's old tactic:

635
00:57:04,146 --> 00:57:06,546
When they think you're running away,
you attack.

636
00:57:06,615 --> 00:57:09,914
Stonewall Jackson
had the Confederate Army. I've got you.

637
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:11,813
And General Lee.

638
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:15,823
I'm going to be in back with the motor
running, in case this doesn't work out.

639
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,222
And it won't.

640
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:20,694
Luke, if you don't believe in this,
how come you're doing it?

641
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:25,062
Because facing a gorilla with two guns
is easier than facing Jesse. Let's go.

642
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:27,568
Now, Daisy, you pay close attention,
all right?

643
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:31,469
<i>See? I told you it was the law.</i>

644
00:57:44,053 --> 00:57:46,385
<i>Ever notice how country boys stick out...</i>

645
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:49,049
<i>when they're trying</i>
<i>to sneak around in town?</i>

646
00:58:02,638 --> 00:58:06,369
<i>Ain't they smooth?</i>
<i>You ought to see them at a shindig.</i>

647
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,706
<i>He's slick on the dance floor, too.</i>

648
00:58:08,877 --> 00:58:10,003
Sorry, Boss.

649
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,310
<i>And who should be the boss,</i>
<i>but old Boss Hogg himself.</i>

650
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,280
<i>The Duke family's old enemy.</i>

651
00:58:32,234 --> 00:58:34,964
Hey, what are you guys... Where's Jojo?

652
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:37,971
Now look, Mr. Starr,
all we want is Daisy's royalty money.

653
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,474
Or her $50 back.
Now, is that too much to ask for?

654
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,476
- You guys are nuts!
- Mr. Starr...

655
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,374
Jojo, are you all right?

656
00:58:44,446 --> 00:58:45,777
- Cops.
- Cops?

657
00:58:45,848 --> 00:58:48,214
- Outside. It's a raid.
- A raid?

658
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,311
What are we going to do?

659
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:00,928
Come on, mister.

660
00:59:06,235 --> 00:59:07,395
Jojo.

661
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:10,967
God, and us on probation.

662
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:13,302
What are we gonna do?

663
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:16,643
- Run.
- Hold them, Jojo!

664
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:30,884
Boss, it's a raid!

665
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:33,291
This is great!

666
00:59:59,288 --> 01:00:01,347
My keys! I forgot my keys.

667
01:00:17,439 --> 01:00:19,907
Wake up, it's a raid!

668
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:30,680
<i>Now don't you worry about old Boss,</i>
<i>because he is a survivor.</i>

669
01:00:42,698 --> 01:00:47,135
<i>While all hell was busting loose behind,</i>
<i>Miss Daisy was writing another hit.</i>

670
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:32,373
Those dummies
are still carrying the evidence.

671
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:35,674
<i>That's our boys.</i>

672
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:44,561
<i>Boss Jefferson Davis Hogg was born</i>
<i>on the dirt floor of a sharecropper's shack.</i>

673
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:49,199
<i>From there, things went downhill.</i>
<i>But everybody has a talent.</i>

674
01:01:49,507 --> 01:01:51,407
<i>And Boss has a gift of graft.</i>

675
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,836
<i>In a dazzling career in Hazzard County...</i>

676
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,903
<i>ranging from moonshine</i>
<i>to political corruption...</i>

677
01:01:57,114 --> 01:02:00,572
<i>Boss has been chased by everything,</i>
<i>from revenuers to bloodhounds...</i>

678
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,118
<i>to irate husbands.</i>

679
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:06,220
<i>Even if the city cops do spot</i>
<i>his license number, it don't matter none.</i>

680
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,516
<i>'Cause Boss changes license plates</i>
<i>like he does his underwear.</i>

681
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,989
<i>Which is every time he goes to town.</i>

682
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,992
<i>When it comes to basic cunning...</i>

683
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,465
<i>old Boss was plumb eat up with it.</i>

684
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,145
Come on, it's left!

685
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,521
I think you did well and lost them.

686
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:58,031
<i>Old Boss Hogg was fit to be tied...</i>

687
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,440
<i>about nearly getting caught</i>
<i>in a police raid.</i>

688
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,741
<i>Of course that can never happen</i>
<i>in Hazzard...</i>

689
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:06,579
<i>since he runs the county,</i>
<i>controls the graft, and owns the sheriff.</i>

690
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:09,741
Me!

691
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,319
Caught like poor trash in a police raid!

692
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,223
Boss, I think the reason that was...

693
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,660
was because they didn't recognize
who you are. You know...

694
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:26,528
That was some close call in Atlanta.

695
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:30,671
I sure don't want
nothing like that happening...

696
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:33,574
to my record-pressing plant
here in Hazzard County.

697
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,011
- What could happen?
- What could happen?

698
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:41,445
One of your dumb deputies could go
blundering into my plant, that's what.

699
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:44,778
With my luck,
it would turn out to be somebody honest.

700
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:48,149
There's nobody in my department honest.
Except Enos.

701
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,955
And I'll make sure
I keep him somewhere else.

702
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:53,920
I got a tin ear for music.

703
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:57,964
The only reason I got into this
was to get me a big syndicate tie-in.

704
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:01,198
After all, if a man don't grow, he dies.

705
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,253
That's what you got in the raid?

706
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:21,519
I've heard all of Waylon Jennings' songs.
I mean I've got them.

707
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:23,787
I've never heard any of those.

708
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,959
Maybe they're not released yet.

709
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,327
Then how did Starr get them?

710
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:30,458
And why did he get rid of it
when the police showed up?

711
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:35,904
You know, if that there was corn whisky
instead of a silly tape...

712
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:37,865
I'd say it was hot.

713
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,909
Wait a minute.

714
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:44,508
If that's a hot tape
of an unreleased record...

715
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:46,875
this could be a piracy operation.

716
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,050
- Gotta be.
- What's that?

717
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:54,314
Music pirates make a fortune stealing
tapes and making illegal recordings.

718
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:55,915
You read about it all the time.

719
01:04:55,993 --> 01:05:00,123
That's all well and good, but this isn't
helping Daisy with her situation.

720
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:04,301
If Starr won't help,
why don't we go right to the top?

721
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:05,858
Can't do that.

722
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:08,798
- The preacher's out of town.
- No.

723
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:13,406
Look, Jessi Colter
recorded Daisy's song, right?

724
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,336
Why don't we go right to her?

725
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,176
She's gonna be in Atlanta
this whole week.

726
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,945
That's a good idea.

727
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,946
And this time, boys, get it right.

728
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,387
<i>So, faster than you could skin a rabbit...</i>

729
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:35,159
<i>they found themselves face to face</i>
<i>with Jessi Colter's manager.</i>

730
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:36,956
<i>True Blue Hearts?</i>

731
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,670
I'm sorry, honey,
but Jessi's never recorded that.

732
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,633
But Lester Starr said that she...

733
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:46,142
Lester Starr finds ambitious singers
who can imitate a name artist...

734
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,734
then fakes a record on them.

735
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,938
Piracy costs the music business millions.

736
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:53,916
Boy, it must!
I just started, and it's just cost me $50.

737
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:57,715
If everybody knows about this guy, Starr,
why hasn't anyone done anything?

738
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,551
You gotta catch him in the act.

739
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:03,491
I hear they just about nailed him
in a raid yesterday, but somebody blew it.

740
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,050
Maybe you folks could help.

741
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:09,589
If those cops blew that raid yesterday,
maybe we can find another way.

742
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,897
Something that would nail him
right to the wall, for everybody.

743
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,597
Sounds great. But what?

744
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,970
Starr makes phony tapes, right?

745
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:21,539
What if we con him
into making another one of Jessi?

746
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,476
Yeah, that'd blow his operation sky high.

747
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,773
But he already knows what we look like.

748
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,445
What if we send in Daisy
as a Jessi Colter sound-alike?

749
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:34,923
Luke, I sound more like Waylon Jennings
than I do Jessi Colter.

750
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,925
But you'd sound a lot like Jessi
if you played him a Jessi Colter tape.

751
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,156
That's terrific.

752
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,256
I'll get on the phone
with Loretta Lynn and Donna Fargo.

753
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,267
They've been stung by pirates.

754
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,895
I'll put together a rehearsal tape
on both of them.

755
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,098
Where can we find this guy, Starr?

756
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:52,506
River Pines. A lot of musicians live there.

757
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,203
Bands, groupies, whatever.

758
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,805
- A sort of Disneyland for the weird.
- We ought to fit right in.

759
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,506
I'll get that tape for you.

760
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:03,485
Looks like you're gonna be a star, after all.

761
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:18,560
<i>Poor little old Daisy,</i>
<i>she's really got the bug, ain't she?</i>

762
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,854
Starr's in the apartment upstairs.

763
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:46,487
We'll be watching the door.
Be sure to holler if you need help.

764
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:54,433
Boss, believe me...

765
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,233
<i>they got nothing on us. Nothing.</i>

766
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,769
Hold on.

767
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,573
Hey, my name is Daisy.

768
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:10,314
And I want to be a star.

769
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,759
- Come in.
- Okay.

770
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,196
I know millions of girls
are always dropping in here...

771
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:28,568
with cheap tricks
to help you get their careers started.

772
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:31,602
Well, I decided to do the same thing.

773
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,543
I think you made the right move.

774
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:42,176
I swear, I'll do anything
to get you to listen to my tape.

775
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:46,079
- Anything?
- About.

776
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:51,020
Now, look,
if you're gonna seduce me or something...

777
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:53,187
shouldn't you be offering me a drink?

778
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:56,494
Of course I really don't know,
you see, I'm so country.

779
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,795
Really?

780
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,401
Baby, I'll make you a singing star
without even hearing you.

781
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:07,201
I'm gonna put on my tape,
and you can listen.

782
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:09,673
My act is very unique.

783
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:13,179
You see, I've got this freak voice.
So I do sound-alikes.

784
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:18,518
And with all these singers getting rich,
imitating people who are dead...

785
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:22,491
I decided to pull a switch
and sound like people who are alive.

786
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,423
- Think it'll catch on?
- Sure.

787
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,791
Now, this is only a rehearsal tape.
Just rhythm behind me.

788
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,833
It's my Jessi Colter.

789
01:09:37,975 --> 01:09:39,408
Is that you?

790
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:44,142
You do sound a little like her.

791
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,375
This is my Loretta Lynn.

792
01:09:56,994 --> 01:09:59,087
And this is my Donna Fargo.

793
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,227
We're gonna make a fortune.

794
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,532
Yeah, I thought we might.
When can we start?

795
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:11,733
Tomorrow. Today. Right now!

796
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:14,142
- Then it's a deal?
- It's a deal.

797
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:17,180
I'll set up a test session
about day after tomorrow.

798
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:19,909
We'll use stolen music tracks behind you.

799
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:22,975
Baby, this is gonna be...
Where are you going?

800
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:27,848
You just set up that recording session,
and I'll call you.

801
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,924
Millions. We'll make millions.

802
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:39,102
It's the least I can do for a man
who didn't try to take advantage of me.

803
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:43,363
<i>I don't know about you, but she'd have</i>
<i>done had my boots and guitar.</i>

804
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:50,602
You know what? Y'all are about as handy
as a left-handed anvil.

805
01:10:50,681 --> 01:10:53,548
While I'm getting attacked
by this lecherous midget...

806
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:56,313
you two are orgying all over that pool.

807
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,518
- Did he go for it?
- Did he take the bait?

808
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,579
He's gonna make me queen of the pirates.

809
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:04,149
- Fantastic.
- And thanks for asking about my virtue...

810
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,162
which you didn't, being intact, which it is.

811
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:15,098
- Do you understand that?
- No.

812
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:24,138
<i>If you're wondering why they</i>
<i>climb in and out of their car windows...</i>

813
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:28,116
<i>the doors of a racing car are welded shut.</i>
<i>Ain't that slick?</i>

814
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:36,852
<i>I tell you, Boss,</i>
<i>we're gonna make millions.</i>

815
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:39,725
This freaky chick can sound like anybody.

816
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:42,258
No, Boss, she doesn't do Kate Smith.

817
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:45,529
If you wanna make it big in piracy,
listen to the radio more.

818
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:48,971
Well, look here,
I've been waiting for something like this...

819
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:52,031
to make that syndicate
sit up and take notice.

820
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:54,774
I sure hope it works.

821
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:58,348
See, I better hear her sing for myself.

822
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:01,275
Okay. I tell you what,
I'll bring her to the plant.

823
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,751
And you can have those biggies
down there, too.

824
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,017
But remember, these dudes
are very nervous about the law.

825
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,421
Set it up. They're protected.
I own this county!

826
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:13,022
Right.

827
01:12:16,867 --> 01:12:18,494
Kind of stick out, don't they?

828
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,934
Anybody that dumb
has got to work for Starr.

829
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,767
Yep. That must be the bodyguard.

830
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:48,087
You gonna follow them in a junkyard?
We'll blow the surveillance.

831
01:12:48,165 --> 01:12:50,531
You want to file a report
saying we lost them?

832
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:28,131
<i>You know, there's a distinct advantage</i>
<i>in never growing up.</i>

833
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:33,037
<i>Since Bo and Luke ain't about to,</i>
<i>sometimes it gives them the edge...</i>

834
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,037
<i>in playing games.</i>

835
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:14,049
<i>Since Bo and Luke</i>
<i>were always messing with cars...</i>

836
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:17,052
<i>they knew every junkyard</i>
<i>like a lover's face.</i>

837
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,681
<i>And following them into one</i>
<i>was like chasing a boar into the bushes.</i>

838
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,929
Didn't Starr hire himself
some rookie hoods?

839
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,696
- That's right.
- Nice driving, brother.

840
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:45,779
This is Unit One. I think we've lost them.

841
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,765
I sure wish there was some other way.

842
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:09,168
Starr's been stealing money hand over fist
from nice people like Jessi Colter.

843
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,230
And lots of other people like you...

844
01:15:11,308 --> 01:15:15,210
who can't afford to be cheated out of $50.
They can't stop him.

845
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:19,849
- Besides, we asked him nice.
- I know that.

846
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:24,083
It's just that tomorrow,
when I go into that studio...

847
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,154
I'm gonna be treated like somebody.

848
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:33,421
For one day, I'll be a star.

849
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:39,429
It sure is gonna put a damper on it
when y'all blow the place apart.

850
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:44,400
Was everything all right
when you called Starr up?

851
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:47,102
He was panting so hard my ear got wet.

852
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:51,704
I'm meeting him tomorrow at his place,
and from there we go to the hidden studio.

853
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,772
We'll be right behind you, all the way.

854
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,977
Won't he spot you driving General Lee?

855
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,782
We'll be in this car,
if I can ever get her tuned up.

856
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,050
Did Starr say anything
about where the studio is?

857
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:03,422
No. Somewhere in the boonies.

858
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:08,293
The studio and the pressing plant
are together. There's gonna be a crowd.

859
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:10,659
Starr said something
about syndicate men.

860
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,065
Syndicate men?

861
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,244
Now, Rosco, I want you to listen good.

862
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:33,150
These are the syndicate boys
I've been trying to hook up with.

863
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:35,992
Yeah, Boss. Now, I understand.

864
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:38,827
These boys get nervous
when the law is around.

865
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,455
So I want you and your deputies
to lay low.

866
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:45,601
<i>I don't care if Bonnie and Clyde</i>
<i>ride through with the Dalton gang...</i>

867
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:47,569
<i>and the bank turns up missing.</i>

868
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:50,302
Tomorrow, the law is out to lunch.

869
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:55,900
Lunch. Right. I'll take care of it, Boss.

870
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,286
So you FBI gentlemen...

871
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:10,349
actually think there's a music
conspiracy ring right here in Hazzard?

872
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,328
- That's right, Sheriff.
- Yeah, this is one of the top pirates.

873
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,198
I don't know him.

874
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:25,105
Lester Starr. We've had him
under surveillance for months.

875
01:17:25,175 --> 01:17:28,269
We almost had him with the goods
in a recent raid.

876
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:31,871
But he dumped some evidence
on these two confederates...

877
01:17:32,182 --> 01:17:34,013
who got away.

878
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:39,455
We think they may live
around here somewhere.

879
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:43,655
I'll tell you something,
if I spot them, I'll just...

880
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:48,096
Just maintain surveillance and notify us.
We'll take it from there.

881
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,656
Right. I'll just let you guys...

882
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:05,113
<i>Now, if you remember,</i>
<i>Sheriff Rosco and Boss...</i>

883
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,514
<i>are thick as thieves.</i>
<i>'Cause they are thieves.</i>

884
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:11,816
I tell you, the FBI had pictures
of the guys they were after.

885
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,413
It was Bo and Luke Duke.
It seems they're tied in...

886
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:16,584
with some big organization just like yours.

887
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:18,752
Just like mine? No way.

888
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,496
Maybe you've gone senile
and hired them by accident.

889
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:26,865
Rosco, this ain't no two-bit operation.
I'm working with pros!

890
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:31,038
I don't know what amateurs
like Bo and Luke Duke are doing.

891
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:35,043
The FBI told me if I was to spot them,
I'm supposed to call them.

892
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:38,012
If you spot them, you nail them, pea brain!

893
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:42,116
Ain't we been trying to get them
on something? Bo, Luke, Daisy.

894
01:18:42,452 --> 01:18:46,320
Well, they're doing something wrong,
or the FBI wouldn't be after them.

895
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,789
That's all we need
to revoke their probation...

896
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,826
and send them back to prison.

897
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,128
- But the FBl...
- Don't run this county!

898
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,687
- You do.
- I do.

899
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:00,700
<i>Early neXt morning,</i>
<i>everybody was ready for a big day.</i>

900
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:03,466
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>Jesse had a few words of instructions.</i>

901
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,802
<i>He always does.</i>

902
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:07,468
Are you two sure
you got everything straight?

903
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:09,307
- Got it.
- I want you...

904
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:12,672
- Not bad.
- Looking good.

905
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:14,148
Nice, Daisy.

906
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:17,313
I was just telling the boys
you've got to make sure...

907
01:19:17,387 --> 01:19:21,050
that everybody is out of that
pressing plant before they blow it up.

908
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:24,184
Because the Dukes revenge on property,
not people.

909
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,284
I will.

910
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:29,764
Remember, when you're with Starr,
don't look for us. We'll be behind you.

911
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,432
Sing pretty.

912
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,744
You all right?

913
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:46,681
It's just that I was so excited
when I thought...

914
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:50,082
something had finally happened
with one of my songs.

915
01:19:55,291 --> 01:20:00,228
I know that them songs
has been a long-time dream of yours.

916
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:04,089
That's why we got to stop this Starr fella.

917
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:08,263
Any man ornery enough to steal
another person's dreams...

918
01:20:08,338 --> 01:20:10,636
deserves everything he gets.

919
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:16,475
Well, at least for one day,
I'm going to be a star.

920
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,472
Even if it isn't for real.

921
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,611
Most people never get that.

922
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,456
Most stars
never get to be as big as you are.

923
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,622
Right now, around here.

924
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:34,826
How did you get to be so wise?

925
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,897
What are old men for?

926
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:46,071
<i>The boys figured if they was going to</i>
<i>take on the pirates and the syndicate...</i>

927
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:48,042
<i>they'd need reinforcements.</i>

928
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:52,841
<i>The most reinforced person in Hazzard</i>
<i>was Ms. Mabel, the Mobile Madame.</i>

929
01:20:53,316 --> 01:20:57,184
<i>Ms. Mabel's party girls</i>
<i>roamed Hazzard in a fancy RV camper.</i>

930
01:20:57,287 --> 01:20:59,812
- Are you sure everything is set?
- Sure, pretty Bo.

931
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:03,347
The beer's cold, the CB's hot,
and the girls are ready.

932
01:21:05,128 --> 01:21:08,586
- They want you on the CB.
- I'll be right back, fellas.

933
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:09,723
Ruby?

934
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:12,131
What in the world are you doing
working here?

935
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:16,035
Honey, after going with you,
this was a step up in the world.

936
01:21:16,673 --> 01:21:18,140
Still bitter?

937
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:21,404
We got to get out of here.
The cops are coming.

938
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:29,846
You were going to move outside
of Hazzard County, anyway.

939
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:34,083
It's a pity. We just had set up here.
Besides, we met a lot of nice folks.

940
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:37,058
Stay where it's safe.
You ought to know better.

941
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:40,921
I'll drive the motor home.
You get the scrap heap.

942
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,387
Come on.

943
01:23:29,906 --> 01:23:33,569
<i>So Daisy and Starr left from his place</i>
<i>right on schedule...</i>

944
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,145
<i>followed by Bo and Luke...</i>

945
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:39,374
<i>and whoever that is.</i>

946
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:43,776
<i>Everybody seemed to be following</i>
<i>everybody, and nobody knew anybody.</i>

947
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,815
<i>And so it turned out,</i>
<i>everybody was following everybody else...</i>

948
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:50,620
<i>for the wrong reason.</i>

949
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,593
<i>That's about up to par.</i>

950
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:11,846
Holy cats!

951
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,646
We're headed back
towards Hazzard County.

952
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,117
I can read.

953
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:22,851
Terrific. We also got us a tail,
hanging way back.

954
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,720
That looks like those same guys
we left in the junkyard.

955
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:28,991
Wait a minute.

956
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:32,034
They can't be Starr's guards
'cause they're in front of us.

957
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:35,537
I ever tell you what a treat it is
working with your keen mind?

958
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:37,266
Then who are they?

959
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:03,088
- Sheriff, what are you doing? All...
- Hush.

960
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:06,067
I'd have Enos read you your rights,
but you ain't got any...

961
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:08,535
- because you broke probation.
- Hi, fellas.

962
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:13,066
- What's the charge?
- Cohorting with known criminals.

963
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:16,539
The only known criminals
we consort with is you.

964
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,341
You got a nasty mouth on you, Duke boy.

965
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:21,315
You didn't know it,
but the FBI was trailing you.

966
01:25:21,384 --> 01:25:25,343
They've got pictures of you two
cohorting with musical pirates.

967
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:30,057
Come on, you'll have to go with us.
Get out of that car!

968
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,218
- Can I bring this with me?
- What?

969
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:34,388
- Dynamite.
- Judas priest on a pony!

970
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:59,481
- We made it.
- Yeah, we also lost Daisy.

971
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:04,623
<i>It seems them boys couldn't get</i>
<i>two things right back-to-back...</i>

972
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:07,162
<i>no matter whose life depended on it.</i>

973
01:26:12,702 --> 01:26:15,296
Hey, lead-foot.
How are you doing, Farrah Fawcett?

974
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:17,134
- Hey, Cooter.
- What's happening?

975
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:20,266
Nothing much.
We've just been chased by the FBI.

976
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:24,109
We just dynamited one of Rosco's cars.
What's up with you?

977
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:29,142
Nothing new. Voltage meter. Slick.
Just like New York City.

978
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,711
What did y'all do to the FBI?

979
01:26:33,089 --> 01:26:36,616
They was chasing us, so we wrecked
one of their cars in the junkyard.

980
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,593
- Did you total it?
- No, just a little body damage.

981
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:43,996
You tell them I'll give them
a real good price on a complete body job.

982
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:46,862
We'll have to send them boys
a note of apology.

983
01:26:46,936 --> 01:26:50,303
I like the FBI. They got a good TV show.

984
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:53,400
Cooter, Daisy's in trouble.

985
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:57,107
Now, we was following her,
and the FBI was following us.

986
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:00,774
The sheriff caught us and we got away,
but we lost Daisy.

987
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:03,347
So the FBI is following Daisy?

988
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:10,058
Why don't y'all follow the FBI?
And then you'll find Daisy.

989
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:14,862
"Out of the mouth of babes,"
as Jesse would say.

990
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,228
That's right. Cooter, you do us a favor.

991
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21,293
Get on your CB and put a spot on them.
They may be monitoring us.

992
01:27:21,437 --> 01:27:23,371
- I got you covered.
- All right.

993
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:31,803
Breaker One, I might be crazy,
but I ain't dumb.

994
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:35,510
Crazy Cooter coming at you.
Anybody home on the Hazzard net?

995
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:40,580
Dreams, that's what it's all about.
And they're hard to come by.

996
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:43,250
You and me, baby,
this is going to be a dream come true.

997
01:27:43,326 --> 01:27:46,420
- I still don't understand the setup here.
- It's very simple.

998
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:49,020
That's the pressing plant,
that's the recording studio.

999
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,498
- What do you think?
- It's not the Grand Ole Opry.

1000
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:53,558
It's not supposed to be.

1001
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:59,107
Jojo, any sign of the boss
and the syndicate?

1002
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:08,276
You're gonna knock them dead.

1003
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:12,518
Excuse me. Do you have
a little girls' room around here?

1004
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:15,415
- Sure, right over there.
- Okay.

1005
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,664
Enos, what's wrong with you?

1006
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:35,477
- The FBI is in there.
- FBI!

1007
01:28:42,184 --> 01:28:43,583
Hi, fellas.

1008
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,521
Your guns were here yesterday.
They've just...

1009
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:50,286
The surveillance team you talked to
has spotted the plant.

1010
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:53,760
They're watching it. We're the raid team,
and we're going in now.

1011
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:54,955
Raid team?

1012
01:28:55,297 --> 01:28:56,855
Let's go, guys.

1013
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:03,362
- Just go, then.
- Sheriff, I just love a good raid.

1014
01:29:04,707 --> 01:29:08,768
<i>General Lee, General Robert E. Lee,</i>
<i>this here is old Crazy Cooter.</i>

1015
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,206
- Come on.
- Come in, old Coot.

1016
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:14,908
<i>You gentlemen are in luck,</i>
<i>because you sure don't live right.</i>

1017
01:29:14,984 --> 01:29:18,647
<i>Deacon Lyle Perkins lives one farm over</i>
<i>from the Morrow place.</i>

1018
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,189
<i>He spotted the limo</i>
<i>and the Uncle Sam Smokey...</i>

1019
01:29:21,257 --> 01:29:24,021
<i>going down the road to the farm</i>
<i>about a half hour ago.</i>

1020
01:29:24,093 --> 01:29:27,062
- We're right on top of that.
<i>- That ain't all.</i>

1021
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,799
<i>A bunch of other cars showed up, too.</i>
<i>So y'all be careful.</i>

1022
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,629
Read you, Cooter. We're on our way.
Can you relay that to Mabel?

1023
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:35,931
<i>10-4.</i>

1024
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:59,223
This is it, boys. I foreclosed on it...

1025
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:02,886
and turned it into a studio
and a record-pressing plant.

1026
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:06,735
- Still looks like a farm, though, don't it?
- What's that smell?

1027
01:30:06,969 --> 01:30:10,336
Fresh air. And inside this studio...

1028
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:13,933
is a lady with a trick voice
who's gonna make us all a ton.

1029
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:16,944
She'd better.
We're taking a risk being here.

1030
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,343
Robert, you keep your eyes peeled.
This place gives me the creeps.

1031
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,112
No alleys, no sewers, no place to hide.

1032
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,924
I sure hope Mabel got that message.

1033
01:30:33,996 --> 01:30:37,329
With Cooter's transmitter,
they'll get it in Moscow.

1034
01:30:40,536 --> 01:30:42,868
<i>And once again, here come the law.</i>

1035
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:47,340
- So where is she?
- In the ladies' room. She's a little nervous.

1036
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,035
Here she is now.
Come in here, sweetheart.

1037
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:52,305
- Guys, I'd like you to meet...
- Boss!

1038
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:53,813
Daisy Duke!

1039
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:56,646
You didn't tell me that Boss was the boss.

1040
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,687
You two know each other?

1041
01:30:58,988 --> 01:31:02,048
Yeah, I know her.
I just don't know anything about her.

1042
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:06,352
We made this trip,
and you ain't ever heard her sing?

1043
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:10,592
No, why, we were both
in the same church choir.

1044
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:12,564
Isn't that so, Daisy?

1045
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:16,235
- Yes, Boss sings bass.
- No kidding.

1046
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:18,029
That's right.

1047
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,541
- Let's get on with it.
- Excuse me...

1048
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:24,704
- I have to go to the little girls' room.
- Again?

1049
01:31:26,115 --> 01:31:27,343
Me, too.

1050
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:49,601
- You can't come in here!
- It's as good a place to die as any.

1051
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:54,003
- You trying to get us killed?
- I'm trying to get my $50 back.

1052
01:31:54,076 --> 01:31:58,137
What $50? Never mind.
I don't know what you Dukes are up to...

1053
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:03,009
but you better be able to
sing like a bird or we're all dead ducks!

1054
01:32:03,152 --> 01:32:07,452
Those syndicate boys out there
invented cement shoes.

1055
01:32:07,556 --> 01:32:09,319
Lord, who would want any?

1056
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:13,590
- Can you sing?
- Fair.

1057
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:15,395
We're dead.

1058
01:32:19,101 --> 01:32:21,729
What is going on?
Those guys are getting edgy.

1059
01:32:21,804 --> 01:32:24,170
That happened once before
on St. Valentine's Day.

1060
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,036
Now get out there and sing.

1061
01:32:36,619 --> 01:32:40,020
- Now what?
- Man, this is a weird case.

1062
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:43,923
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for coming to hear me.

1063
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,793
Did you have a pleasant trip down?

1064
01:32:46,862 --> 01:32:49,422
What is this?
We gonna hear her sing, or what?

1065
01:32:49,498 --> 01:32:52,934
Somebody's stalling.
Stalling makes me nervous.

1066
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:54,295
Okay.

1067
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:57,662
For my first song, I'd like to sing for you...

1068
01:32:57,806 --> 01:33:01,264
this real catchy tune that... I made it up.

1069
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:08,646
- What's that?
- What's going on around here?

1070
01:33:14,323 --> 01:33:16,348
What the hell is this?

1071
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,365
<i>Now you know what the girls were for:</i>

1072
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:27,868
<i>bait, to get everybody outside.</i>

1073
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:38,545
Who called for broads?

1074
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:48,047
- Who else knows we're down here?
- Nobody knows.

1075
01:33:48,657 --> 01:33:51,023
- It's a mistake.
- Damn straight, it's a mistake!

1076
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,491
Let's get out of here.

1077
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:55,856
- I should've never dealt with hicks.
- Who are you calling a hick?

1078
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:14,138
Come on, now.
You don't want to miss the fun.

1079
01:34:29,465 --> 01:34:33,458
Hey, Boss. You here, too?
Welcome to Hazzard County, gentlemen.

1080
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:37,300
- The sheriff and the FBI are on their way.
- FBI!

1081
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,003
You fool!

1082
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:33,521
Old Rosco put his foot in it this time.

1083
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:37,794
Isn't that just the prettiest sight
you've ever seen in your life?

1084
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:44,501
Come on, light, you son of a gun.

1085
01:35:44,673 --> 01:35:46,766
- Light it up.
- There she is.

1086
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:50,834
She's trying.

1087
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:52,274
There she goes.

1088
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,736
<i>And that's the legend of Daisy's song.</i>

1089
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:26,338
<i>And the FBI didn't get their man:</i>
<i>no evidence.</i>

1090
01:36:26,515 --> 01:36:29,973
<i>And Boss didn't get in the syndicate:</i>
<i>no record plant.</i>

1091
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:34,212
<i>Looks like it would have been a lot easier</i>
<i>just to give Daisy her $50 back.</i>

1092
01:36:37,593 --> 01:36:39,322
<i>But that ain't the whole story.</i>

1093
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:03,547
Want to hear our new song?
It hasn't even been released yet.

1094
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:04,711
Sure.

1095
01:37:08,457 --> 01:37:11,654
Jessi Colter sent it.
She's going to record it for real.

1096
01:37:11,727 --> 01:37:13,126
Oh, my Lord!

1097
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:18,927
Listen!

1098
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:25,835
See, I told you. All you got to do
is just keep dreaming them dreams.

1099
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:33,141
<i>Another good thing about Hazzard County:</i>

1100
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:36,146
<i>We tend to have happy endings.</i>

1101
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:12,313
English

1102
01:38:25,978 --> 01:38:29,641
I'm gonna nail Bo and Luke Duke.

1103
01:38:29,848 --> 01:38:33,875
Crazy Cooter talking.
Turkey coming right down my alley.

1104
01:38:34,386 --> 01:38:37,082
I'm having a picnic.
Which way to the beach?

1105
01:38:37,155 --> 01:38:39,055
I want those slot machines.

1106
01:38:39,524 --> 01:38:41,583
Now we got them.

1107
01:38:49,668 --> 01:38:52,501
I wish those Duke boys were on my side.

1108
01:38:52,804 --> 01:38:56,763
- Happy Birthday, Daisy.
- Why, thank you, Enos.

1109
01:38:56,842 --> 01:38:58,776
Now get her out.

1110
01:39:02,981 --> 01:39:04,972
Don't stand there. Go get her.

1111
01:39:09,454 --> 01:39:11,945
<i>Welcome to Hazzard County.</i>

1112
01:40:22,194 --> 01:40:23,923
<i>Welcome to Hazzard County.</i>

1113
01:40:39,444 --> 01:40:42,504
<i>You've probably noticed</i>
<i>there's something different here.</i>

1114
01:40:42,581 --> 01:40:46,711
<i>Well, this is Hazzard County.</i>
<i>They do things different here.</i>

1115
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:55,782
<i>This is Bo Duke and Luke Duke.</i>
<i>They're cousins.</i>

1116
01:40:56,728 --> 01:40:58,320
<i>They fight the system.</i>

1117
01:41:02,534 --> 01:41:06,095
When I got up, the thing on my mind
was to do a little rabbit hunting.

1118
01:41:06,171 --> 01:41:08,867
- And then the hound dog runs off.
- And my car is taken.

1119
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:10,805
And now we're chasing the Sheriff's car.

1120
01:41:10,876 --> 01:41:14,243
Ain't you glad we ain't in the big city
where life gets complicated?

1121
01:41:15,013 --> 01:41:17,004
Do you mind waiting till this is over.

1122
01:41:17,082 --> 01:41:19,243
Move it. What are you doing?
Taking a break?

1123
01:41:19,317 --> 01:41:21,751
If you'd tuned this car instead
of chasing women...

1124
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:25,085
- we'd have already had him.
- Not with you asleep at the wheel.

1125
01:41:28,193 --> 01:41:30,218
- Grab that sign.
- You grab it.

1126
01:41:30,295 --> 01:41:33,696
- I can't. I'm driving.
- Is that what you call it?

1127
01:41:37,302 --> 01:41:38,826
Try not to lose him, okay.

1128
01:41:38,904 --> 01:41:41,270
It wouldn't be much of a chase if we do.

1129
01:42:04,696 --> 01:42:07,688
Bo, you drive
like my fanny whips apple butter.

1130
01:42:19,978 --> 01:42:23,436
You know what? I kind of admire
the way he handles that thing.

1131
01:42:35,493 --> 01:42:38,018
Shoot fire and save box matches!

1132
01:42:38,096 --> 01:42:41,827
Cooter Davenport. You ain't got the sense
the good Lord promised a turkey.

1133
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,765
Hey, Luke. What say, Bo.

1134
01:42:44,069 --> 01:42:46,833
Ain't you gonna see what he did
with your car?

1135
01:42:46,905 --> 01:42:49,135
You borrowed my car.
What did you do with it?

1136
01:42:49,207 --> 01:42:53,371
I used it to run the Sheriff off the road
to make him mad. When he jumped out...

1137
01:42:53,445 --> 01:42:57,142
You jumped into his, right?
Why did you steal the Sheriff's car?

1138
01:42:57,215 --> 01:43:01,015
He impounded mine.
Seemed only fair to take his.

1139
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,853
Using my car?
Oh, that's real good, Cooter.

1140
01:43:04,923 --> 01:43:06,982
I told you not to lend Cooter your car.

1141
01:43:07,058 --> 01:43:11,017
Cooter, do you realize what it's gonna take
to straighten all this out?

1142
01:43:11,663 --> 01:43:12,721
No.

1143
01:43:14,933 --> 01:43:16,423
Hello, bandit.

1144
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:24,201
- What's that doing there?
- Maybe it was took in a raid.

1145
01:43:24,276 --> 01:43:26,369
There ain't no slot machines
in Hazzard County.

1146
01:43:26,444 --> 01:43:28,810
There is gonna be soon.
He's bringing them in.

1147
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,748
- Who is?
- Sheriff Rosco Coltrane.

1148
01:43:33,451 --> 01:43:36,978
<i>That's him. Sheriff Rosco Coltrane.</i>

1149
01:43:39,024 --> 01:43:41,686
<i>After 30 years as a fairly honest lawman...</i>

1150
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,457
<i>most of Rosco's pension got defeated</i>
<i>in the last bond election.</i>

1151
01:43:45,997 --> 01:43:49,831
<i>This left Rosco to face retirement</i>
<i>on a bad case of hemorrhoids.</i>

1152
01:43:50,135 --> 01:43:53,263
<i>And about two years left in office</i>
<i>to grab all he could.</i>

1153
01:43:53,705 --> 01:43:57,664
<i>So overnight, Rosco became</i>
<i>the best lawman that money could buy.</i>

1154
01:43:58,243 --> 01:44:01,406
<i>He got a rake-off</i>
<i>from moonshine, contraband...</i>

1155
01:44:01,479 --> 01:44:05,108
<i>and even portable prostitution</i>
<i>in two cruising RV campers.</i>

1156
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:08,050
<i>Now old Rosco is up for reelection.</i>

1157
01:44:08,787 --> 01:44:12,382
<i>That means the one man</i>
<i>he's got to see is Boss Hogg.</i>

1158
01:44:16,194 --> 01:44:18,389
<i>If Sheriff Rosco runs the county...</i>

1159
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:20,327
<i>Boss Hogg runs Rosco.</i>

1160
01:44:25,203 --> 01:44:28,832
<i>Boss eats at the Boars Nest</i>
<i>because his wife Lulu is a lousy cook.</i>

1161
01:44:29,874 --> 01:44:33,241
<i>You can tell a lot about a man</i>
<i>by what he eats for breakfast.</i>

1162
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:36,039
<i>Boss usually has coffee and raw liver.</i>

1163
01:44:42,554 --> 01:44:44,579
<i>Well, at least he don't dunk it.</i>

1164
01:44:44,656 --> 01:44:47,318
Boss, them slot machines
is coming in today.

1165
01:44:47,625 --> 01:44:50,093
Good. Tell me something.

1166
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:54,754
Did the police get your car back?

1167
01:44:58,536 --> 01:45:03,303
Boss, listen, I don't think I'm getting
enough rake-off on them slot machines.

1168
01:45:05,143 --> 01:45:09,603
I mean, I got a lot of expenses,
with the election and it's...

1169
01:45:13,685 --> 01:45:17,519
Listen, I'm taking all responsibility
of putting them slot machines in.

1170
01:45:18,623 --> 01:45:21,285
- You owe me, Boss.
- I owe you?

1171
01:45:23,828 --> 01:45:27,127
Rosco, I've overpaid any debt
I'll ever have to you.

1172
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:30,892
- Because you married my fat sister.
- I married your fat sister.

1173
01:45:33,238 --> 01:45:36,639
- Boss, about the election...
- You'd just better win.

1174
01:45:37,142 --> 01:45:40,236
That Honest John Ledbetter
who's running against you...

1175
01:45:40,478 --> 01:45:42,070
can't be bought.

1176
01:45:42,414 --> 01:45:44,439
You mean to tell me he's honest?

1177
01:45:45,283 --> 01:45:47,808
He's so crooked,
he makes you look straight.

1178
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,985
But he's clean ruthless.

1179
01:45:51,189 --> 01:45:55,353
You're dirty ruthless.
Give me dirty ruthless any day.

1180
01:45:56,861 --> 01:45:59,329
Listen, I'm gonna beat him. I'll beat him.

1181
01:46:00,765 --> 01:46:03,757
Rosco, with your image right now...

1182
01:46:04,402 --> 01:46:07,565
- if you were the only man running...
- I'd come in second.

1183
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:09,197
You'd come in second.

1184
01:46:15,146 --> 01:46:17,307
<i>Jesse Duke is the clan patriarch.</i>

1185
01:46:17,715 --> 01:46:21,116
<i>You're gonna love old Jesse.</i>
<i>He's quite a study.</i>

1186
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:24,084
<i>Jesse is a retired moonshiner.</i>

1187
01:46:24,289 --> 01:46:26,086
<i>And he's very religious.</i>

1188
01:46:26,324 --> 01:46:30,351
<i>Although he's well-read, he's rough</i>
<i>as a mouthful of bark when he's riled.</i>

1189
01:46:30,462 --> 01:46:34,228
<i>Bo and Luke always have breakfast</i>
<i>with Jesse, eXcept on Saturdays...</i>

1190
01:46:34,299 --> 01:46:37,393
<i>when they eat at the garage,</i>
<i>on donuts and beer.</i>

1191
01:46:38,536 --> 01:46:41,130
You get your car back
from the Sheriff yet?

1192
01:46:41,206 --> 01:46:42,969
Dumb Cooter Davenport.

1193
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:46,404
Dumb Cooter? You're the one
that loaned your car to him.

1194
01:46:46,878 --> 01:46:50,814
Next time you wanna loan your car
to a fool like that, just run it over a cliff.

1195
01:46:50,882 --> 01:46:52,144
Save gas.

1196
01:46:53,418 --> 01:46:56,751
- Mr. Duke.
- Oh, howdy.

1197
01:46:56,955 --> 01:46:59,685
Remember me? Jill Dodson.
The orphanage fund?

1198
01:46:59,757 --> 01:47:02,248
Sure. And I got some money ready for you.

1199
01:47:02,327 --> 01:47:04,318
Thank you so much. Excuse me.

1200
01:47:04,395 --> 01:47:06,761
I really appreciate everything
that you've done.

1201
01:47:06,831 --> 01:47:08,628
- I'll just get it.
- Okay. Thank you.

1202
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:11,260
Jill Dodson.
You're little Jillie Rae Dodson?

1203
01:47:11,336 --> 01:47:12,598
It's just Jill now.

1204
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:14,865
I haven't seen you
since you ran off to college.

1205
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:16,201
It's been a while.

1206
01:47:16,274 --> 01:47:19,141
Hey, Luke, ain't it wonderful
what hormones can do?

1207
01:47:21,613 --> 01:47:23,308
What are you doing now?

1208
01:47:23,515 --> 01:47:27,076
Since I got back I've been working
on the orphanage project.

1209
01:47:27,785 --> 01:47:31,380
The Health Department will close it down
if it's not completely renovated.

1210
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,219
What about the county funds?

1211
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:36,021
Unfortunately, it's not eligible
for county funds.

1212
01:47:36,094 --> 01:47:38,119
It was privately endowed years ago.

1213
01:47:38,196 --> 01:47:40,357
The money just seems
to have run out now.

1214
01:47:40,431 --> 01:47:42,991
So you're gonna save the old place
all by yourself?

1215
01:47:43,067 --> 01:47:45,058
Well, I was raised there.

1216
01:47:45,403 --> 01:47:48,429
Me and Luke would be glad to help out.
Wouldn't we, Luke?

1217
01:47:48,907 --> 01:47:50,568
- Nope.
- What do you mean nope?

1218
01:47:50,642 --> 01:47:51,973
It's your civic duty.

1219
01:47:52,043 --> 01:47:55,308
Why, at least two of them kids
at the orphanage could be yours.

1220
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:57,473
Bo's always bragging on me.

1221
01:47:58,783 --> 01:48:01,013
You know what I remember
most about you?

1222
01:48:01,085 --> 01:48:03,781
- What?
- Your crush on me.

1223
01:48:04,856 --> 01:48:07,791
Isn't it funny how our tastes change
when we mature.

1224
01:48:10,028 --> 01:48:12,861
- Was that a compliment?
- You'd probably think it is.

1225
01:48:14,365 --> 01:48:18,267
<i>Now, all this romance</i>
<i>does eventually fit into Rosco's election.</i>

1226
01:48:18,536 --> 01:48:20,436
<i>So y'all stick with us.</i>

1227
01:48:47,966 --> 01:48:52,198
<i>The Boars Nest, owned by Boss Hogg,</i>
<i>is the slickest club in Hazzard.</i>

1228
01:48:52,971 --> 01:48:54,598
<i>All the elite go there.</i>

1229
01:48:55,173 --> 01:48:57,971
<i>It has a $1 cover charge</i>
<i>to keep out the riffraff.</i>

1230
01:48:58,042 --> 01:48:59,771
I just don't understand you.

1231
01:48:59,844 --> 01:49:02,472
Why don't you wanna help Jill
with the orphanage fund?

1232
01:49:02,547 --> 01:49:04,037
We got nothing else cooking.

1233
01:49:04,115 --> 01:49:07,209
She don't do nothing for me.
I hate skinny women.

1234
01:49:07,585 --> 01:49:10,019
You just ain't got no taste, that's all.

1235
01:49:10,288 --> 01:49:13,348
I swear, if women were birds,
you'd probably date a buzzard.

1236
01:49:13,424 --> 01:49:15,551
And you'd date a crane. No meat.

1237
01:49:17,195 --> 01:49:19,220
- I'm collecting these.
- What for?

1238
01:49:19,497 --> 01:49:21,226
Lining the rabbit's cage.

1239
01:49:24,135 --> 01:49:25,193
Face up.

1240
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,401
<i>Daisy Duke is Bo and Luke's cousin.</i>

1241
01:49:40,151 --> 01:49:43,177
<i>She drives like Richard Petty,</i>
<i>shoots like Annie Oakley...</i>

1242
01:49:43,254 --> 01:49:46,121
<i>and knows the words</i>
<i>to all of Dolly Parton's songs.</i>

1243
01:49:54,132 --> 01:49:56,066
If we weren't cousins, I'd marry you.

1244
01:49:56,134 --> 01:49:58,625
That's never stopped anyone
in this family before.

1245
01:49:58,703 --> 01:50:00,330
You got a point there.

1246
01:50:01,506 --> 01:50:03,269
- Fill it up, baby.
- Take it easy.

1247
01:50:05,543 --> 01:50:08,603
Hey, don't you forget we got plans later.

1248
01:50:09,013 --> 01:50:11,038
Get your cotton-picking paws off.

1249
01:50:11,115 --> 01:50:14,516
Now that I finally got a hold,
I think I'll just hang on.

1250
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:17,810
- Let go.
- No, it feels kind of nice.

1251
01:50:36,407 --> 01:50:38,341
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1252
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:42,669
Bo, why did you step in like that?
I'm gonna get charged for two beers.

1253
01:50:42,747 --> 01:50:44,942
Believe me, honey,
I'm not gonna do it again.

1254
01:50:45,016 --> 01:50:47,143
Were you going out
with that sharecropper?

1255
01:50:47,218 --> 01:50:49,482
- Of course not.
- Was that dude bothering you?

1256
01:50:49,554 --> 01:50:51,852
He just thinks he's this big-shot gangster...

1257
01:50:51,923 --> 01:50:55,188
because he's gonna unload
some slot machines off a fertilizer truck.

1258
01:50:55,259 --> 01:50:57,955
- That doesn't exactly make him Al Capone.
- Slot machines?

1259
01:50:58,029 --> 01:50:59,894
Don't put my business out on the streets.

1260
01:50:59,964 --> 01:51:02,728
Hey, dude, sit down.
You got me to mess with.

1261
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,700
Okay. I'll mess with you.

1262
01:51:05,169 --> 01:51:08,935
Really. His brother's bringing in
these slot machines on a fertilizer truck.

1263
01:51:09,006 --> 01:51:12,567
And then that silly dude wants me
to go to the No-Tell Motel with him.

1264
01:51:12,643 --> 01:51:16,602
Says he'll take me off to Nashville.
See the <i>Grand Ole Opry,</i> the works.

1265
01:51:16,814 --> 01:51:19,442
I reckon I've never wanted to see
anything that bad.

1266
01:51:19,517 --> 01:51:21,382
Not even Dolly Parton.

1267
01:51:23,888 --> 01:51:28,086
Can you imagine the look on Rosco's face
when he opens up that fertilizer truck...

1268
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,957
And all he sees is fertilizer?

1269
01:51:37,769 --> 01:51:39,862
Hey, Bo! What say, Luke!

1270
01:51:39,937 --> 01:51:42,337
- How you doing?
- Hello, Cooter.

1271
01:51:42,406 --> 01:51:44,897
- Y'all still driving this thing on the road?
- Yep.

1272
01:51:44,976 --> 01:51:47,137
- I was wondering...
- No, you can't borrow it.

1273
01:51:47,211 --> 01:51:49,702
Where's my share
of the trucking money you owe me?

1274
01:51:49,781 --> 01:51:51,544
- I gave it to Bo.
- How come?

1275
01:51:52,016 --> 01:51:56,544
Well, you see, I owed him $50,
and y'all being kin, I figured...

1276
01:51:56,621 --> 01:51:57,986
We're even.

1277
01:51:59,991 --> 01:52:01,788
Hey, look here now.

1278
01:52:01,993 --> 01:52:05,087
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Brodie, we were looking for you.

1279
01:52:05,163 --> 01:52:06,653
What are you doing?

1280
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:10,428
Hey, Mr. Dobro. You all in for a little fun?
We got our cars.

1281
01:52:10,501 --> 01:52:12,298
Yeah? What's on?

1282
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:15,068
Sheriff Rosco.

1283
01:52:17,475 --> 01:52:19,534
<i>Bo and Luke laid it out for them.</i>

1284
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:22,807
<i>After a gut-busting laugh,</i>
<i>cranked up and cut out.</i>

1285
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:46,698
- Go straight.
- It's all right. I know where I'm going.

1286
01:53:01,285 --> 01:53:03,378
I love your shortcut. Cute.

1287
01:53:03,454 --> 01:53:07,618
They must've just changed this since
last time a girl chased me through here.

1288
01:53:08,759 --> 01:53:11,819
You know, Bo,
you could lose your way on a racetrack.

1289
01:53:24,308 --> 01:53:26,572
Burt Reynolds never seemed to get lost.

1290
01:53:27,511 --> 01:53:29,103
He's got a mustache.

1291
01:53:35,386 --> 01:53:39,345
<i>If there's one thing them old boys</i>
<i>love better than a race on the track...</i>

1292
01:53:39,423 --> 01:53:41,118
<i>it's a chase on the road.</i>

1293
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:33,235
<i>Since they all had CBs, they set up a net</i>
<i>with each man on a different road.</i>

1294
01:54:33,678 --> 01:54:37,375
<i>Whoever spotted the fertilizer truck</i>
<i>would call back to Bo and Luke...</i>

1295
01:54:37,448 --> 01:54:39,040
<i>who'd intercept.</i>

1296
01:54:39,183 --> 01:54:41,811
<i>Dobro Doolin staked out</i>
<i>on the interchange.</i>

1297
01:54:43,921 --> 01:54:47,721
This is Dobro Doolin coming to you live
from the interchange.

1298
01:54:50,528 --> 01:54:52,860
<i>Old Brodie watching 76 South...</i>

1299
01:54:53,397 --> 01:54:55,695
<i>and Crazy Cooter covered 421.</i>

1300
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:58,268
<i>For that fertilizer truck to get by...</i>

1301
01:54:58,336 --> 01:55:00,964
<i>it'd have to leave the road</i>
<i>and come overland.</i>

1302
01:55:01,906 --> 01:55:04,204
- It ain't gonna work.
- Can't miss.

1303
01:55:05,676 --> 01:55:09,612
What if it does work? What are we
gonna do with all them slot machines?

1304
01:55:10,781 --> 01:55:14,182
I never thought about that.
We'll think of something.

1305
01:55:20,825 --> 01:55:24,352
Crazy Cooter talking.
Turkey coming right down my alley.

1306
01:55:25,162 --> 01:55:26,652
I read you, Cooter.

1307
01:55:26,731 --> 01:55:30,189
- Did you copy that, Daisy? Cooter's on 421.
- Ten-four.

1308
01:55:30,701 --> 01:55:31,895
Hit it.

1309
01:55:55,326 --> 01:55:57,556
What have we got here?

1310
01:55:59,196 --> 01:56:01,824
Leroy, let's get that girl right here.

1311
01:56:02,199 --> 01:56:03,928
I'm gonna steal that away.

1312
01:56:06,604 --> 01:56:09,129
Are you having trouble, little lady?

1313
01:56:09,306 --> 01:56:12,833
Yeah, I'm having a picnic.
Which way to the beach?

1314
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:14,969
There ain't no beach around here.

1315
01:56:16,414 --> 01:56:20,578
And me with this basketful of lemonade
and chitlin sandwiches.

1316
01:56:22,553 --> 01:56:25,716
All right, boys.
Raise them high, and don't turn around.

1317
01:56:26,323 --> 01:56:29,190
Now y'all promised me
you wouldn't bring machine guns.

1318
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:31,319
- Machine guns?
- Lord, have mercy.

1319
01:56:31,395 --> 01:56:32,862
Good luck, fellows.

1320
01:56:38,836 --> 01:56:40,667
You ain't going nowhere off.

1321
01:56:49,847 --> 01:56:51,405
<i>Ain't this fun?</i>

1322
01:56:54,718 --> 01:56:57,050
<i>The Duke family had been</i>
<i>in the whiskey business...</i>

1323
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:59,851
<i>fifty years before</i>
<i>the Declaration of Independence.</i>

1324
01:56:59,957 --> 01:57:01,117
<i>They fought everybody...</i>

1325
01:57:01,192 --> 01:57:04,787
<i>from the British to the Confederacy</i>
<i>to the U.S. Government to stay in it...</i>

1326
01:57:04,862 --> 01:57:08,263
<i>until last year when Bo and Luke</i>
<i>got caught on a whiskey run.</i>

1327
01:57:08,332 --> 01:57:10,857
<i>So Jesse swallowed a lifetime of pride...</i>

1328
01:57:10,935 --> 01:57:14,632
<i>signed a treaty with the U.S. Government</i>
<i>to stop making whiskey...</i>

1329
01:57:14,705 --> 01:57:16,935
<i>if Bo and Luke could get probation.</i>

1330
01:57:17,641 --> 01:57:20,701
<i>You see, he loved them boys</i>
<i>better than life itself...</i>

1331
01:57:20,811 --> 01:57:23,974
<i>but sometimes,</i>
<i>they really made him wonder why.</i>

1332
01:57:29,687 --> 01:57:30,847
He found them.

1333
01:57:30,921 --> 01:57:34,049
- You were supposed to get the eggs.
- I thought you were.

1334
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,367
This time... you've gone too far.

1335
01:57:46,437 --> 01:57:48,837
- Now, Jesse...
- Where'd you get them?

1336
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:52,573
Sheriff Rosco snuck them in
on a truckload full of fertilizer.

1337
01:57:52,643 --> 01:57:54,270
So we hijacked the truck.

1338
01:57:54,345 --> 01:57:58,145
You mean, you stole these
gambling machines and a truck.

1339
01:57:58,215 --> 01:58:00,115
- No.
- Yeah.

1340
01:58:01,085 --> 01:58:03,645
We left the truck
in front of the Sheriff's office.

1341
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:05,348
What about these?

1342
01:58:05,623 --> 01:58:10,117
- Well, we were just thinking that maybe...
- Young man, you think again.

1343
01:58:10,961 --> 01:58:14,590
You know good and well that this family
don't hold with no gambling.

1344
01:58:14,665 --> 01:58:17,930
Now, Jesse, we've been making
moonshine for over 200 years.

1345
01:58:18,002 --> 01:58:19,435
Why's gambling different?

1346
01:58:19,503 --> 01:58:23,530
Because making whiskey
was a family tradition...

1347
01:58:23,607 --> 01:58:27,099
long before there was
a U.S.A. Federal Government...

1348
01:58:27,211 --> 01:58:29,042
to tell us that we couldn't.

1349
01:58:29,446 --> 01:58:32,279
And passing a law
didn't change the family ways.

1350
01:58:32,349 --> 01:58:35,147
- Yeah. But this is something...
- Besides...

1351
01:58:36,086 --> 01:58:40,853
when we were making corn whiskey,
we paid taxes on the corn.

1352
01:58:41,892 --> 01:58:45,589
Gambling's a vice.
How are you gonna tax vice?

1353
01:58:46,864 --> 01:58:48,263
Now, then...

1354
01:58:48,766 --> 01:58:52,293
I'm going in there
and I'm gonna collect my eggs.

1355
01:58:52,369 --> 01:58:54,098
When I come back out here...

1356
01:58:54,171 --> 01:58:57,800
I don't wanna see anything
but hind ends and elbows...

1357
01:58:57,875 --> 01:59:02,278
as you two boys are loading them there
machines on that there truck.

1358
01:59:06,317 --> 01:59:09,844
And don't go selling them at a profit.

1359
01:59:10,554 --> 01:59:12,385
That'd be wrong, too.

1360
01:59:13,924 --> 01:59:15,323
What do you think?

1361
01:59:15,893 --> 01:59:18,726
I think I'm tired of you
always getting us into trouble...

1362
01:59:18,796 --> 01:59:20,889
and me having to think a way out.

1363
01:59:21,232 --> 01:59:22,927
We got to change his mind.

1364
01:59:23,467 --> 01:59:25,992
That'd be like reversing a buzz saw.

1365
01:59:27,037 --> 01:59:30,131
If we can't sell them,
we're just gonna have to give them away.

1366
01:59:30,207 --> 01:59:32,334
Like a charity or something.

1367
01:59:34,712 --> 01:59:36,873
We're gonna reverse that buzz saw.

1368
01:59:37,982 --> 01:59:39,244
Uncle Jesse...

1369
01:59:41,252 --> 01:59:44,619
we're fixing to change your mind.
Or rather, Luke is.

1370
01:59:45,089 --> 01:59:46,989
- Tell him.
- Well, Luke?

1371
01:59:48,592 --> 01:59:52,494
Can we keep those slots if I show you
that all gambling ain't bad?

1372
01:59:52,563 --> 01:59:53,791
No way.

1373
01:59:54,331 --> 01:59:57,425
Now how about if all the proceeds
from those machines...

1374
01:59:57,501 --> 01:59:59,093
went to the orphanage?

1375
01:59:59,870 --> 02:00:01,667
You just found a way.

1376
02:00:01,939 --> 02:00:04,908
<i>To put the machines</i>
<i>where they'd do the most business...</i>

1377
02:00:04,975 --> 02:00:07,637
<i>Bo and Luke ignored</i>
<i>the bars and roadhouses...</i>

1378
02:00:07,711 --> 02:00:10,179
<i>and hit all the civic and fraternal clubs.</i>

1379
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:12,949
<i>And took 30% right off the top.</i>

1380
02:00:13,851 --> 02:00:16,979
<i>You all ever belonged to a group</i>
<i>that wasn't trying to raise money?</i>

1381
02:00:18,856 --> 02:00:23,418
<i>For instance, the Hazzard Ladies'AuXiliary</i>
<i>needed money for a door prize...</i>

1382
02:00:23,494 --> 02:00:25,758
<i>a trip to see</i> The Lawrence Welk Show.

1383
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:28,960
<i>The Hunting Club had two projects:</i>

1384
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:32,068
<i>Raising money for</i>
<i>the Animal Protective League...</i>

1385
02:00:32,136 --> 02:00:34,366
<i>and their annual turkey shoot.</i>

1386
02:00:34,905 --> 02:00:37,965
<i>In one day Bo and Luke were sold-out.</i>

1387
02:00:38,275 --> 02:00:41,938
I want those slot machines.
They've been missing three days.

1388
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:43,910
That ain't my fault, Boss.

1389
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:48,042
They set up my drivers with a half-naked
female woman up on that highway.

1390
02:00:48,452 --> 02:00:49,919
Anybody'd stop for that.

1391
02:00:49,987 --> 02:00:52,820
You'd better get them back
before word gets around...

1392
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:54,949
or you're gonna be out with the voters.

1393
02:00:55,025 --> 02:00:56,424
- And you.
- And me.

1394
02:01:19,583 --> 02:01:22,575
Better not hit too hard
or the whole orphanage is gonna fall in.

1395
02:01:22,653 --> 02:01:25,850
- Hi. You startled me.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

1396
02:01:27,124 --> 02:01:29,115
- What's that?
- Money.

1397
02:01:29,793 --> 02:01:31,454
- What's that?
- Rudy.

1398
02:01:31,528 --> 02:01:32,654
He's my helper.

1399
02:01:32,730 --> 02:01:35,062
- You wanna get a soda pop?
- Sure.

1400
02:01:37,468 --> 02:01:40,437
- So, here's your money.
- You're kidding.

1401
02:01:40,804 --> 02:01:43,295
- I never kid about love or money.
- But how...

1402
02:01:43,374 --> 02:01:46,104
It was donated
by some very civic-minded people.

1403
02:01:46,176 --> 02:01:47,837
It's not much, but it's a start.

1404
02:01:47,911 --> 02:01:51,176
- I'm gonna collect from them every week.
- That's wonderful!

1405
02:01:51,582 --> 02:01:55,484
I knew it. It is my money you're after.
Everybody said it was my body.

1406
02:01:55,552 --> 02:01:57,042
- Incredible.
- My body?

1407
02:01:57,121 --> 02:02:00,454
- Your ego.
- Thanks. I've been working on it for years.

1408
02:02:00,524 --> 02:02:02,822
Look. Don't get me wrong.

1409
02:02:03,093 --> 02:02:05,357
I appreciate the money, really.

1410
02:02:05,462 --> 02:02:08,226
It's just that I know
this is only a game to you.

1411
02:02:08,298 --> 02:02:09,492
A game?

1412
02:02:09,566 --> 02:02:12,000
Bo, this project is very serious to me.

1413
02:02:12,336 --> 02:02:16,432
For the two weeks I've been back,
I've fought the rotten county politics...

1414
02:02:16,507 --> 02:02:19,874
the Health Department, everybody,
to try and save this place.

1415
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:22,445
The only reason
we're being closed down...

1416
02:02:22,513 --> 02:02:25,846
is because Boss Hogg
controls the board and wants the land.

1417
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:29,583
- What does Boss want the land for?
- A shopping center.

1418
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,947
This was my home.

1419
02:02:32,189 --> 02:02:35,022
The best possible any orphanage could be.

1420
02:02:36,026 --> 02:02:39,359
You mean well,
and any other time it might be fun...

1421
02:02:39,963 --> 02:02:43,990
but I just don't have time for your cute
country shucking and jiving right now.

1422
02:02:44,067 --> 02:02:45,762
I do like a woman salty.

1423
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:48,365
- You haven't been listening.
- Sure I have.

1424
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:50,134
You been away to the big city...

1425
02:02:50,207 --> 02:02:52,698
and now you've come back
to save the old homestead.

1426
02:02:52,776 --> 02:02:55,802
- Look, l...
- Well, while you were gone all that time...

1427
02:02:55,946 --> 02:02:59,382
I was here fighting
that same rotten system every day.

1428
02:03:00,517 --> 02:03:04,112
- Look...
- Now, I live here. I choose this life.

1429
02:03:04,655 --> 02:03:08,523
Not because I don't know no better,
but because I believe it is better.

1430
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:12,789
And I'm gonna fight anything or anybody
that pollutes the well where I drink.

1431
02:03:13,564 --> 02:03:15,657
Saving this orphanage is just part of it.

1432
02:03:15,732 --> 02:03:17,666
- I didn't mean...
- And another thing.

1433
02:03:17,734 --> 02:03:20,669
If you think I'm doing all this
to make a play for you...

1434
02:03:20,737 --> 02:03:22,227
well, would you grow up?

1435
02:03:22,306 --> 02:03:23,830
Because believe it or not...

1436
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:27,240
when I make a play on a lady,
I don't have to give her money.

1437
02:03:27,411 --> 02:03:29,709
Although, it does keep her hands busy.

1438
02:03:31,448 --> 02:03:32,745
How am I doing?

1439
02:03:35,652 --> 02:03:39,019
Now, you walk me to my car
or the next money I collect...

1440
02:03:39,089 --> 02:03:41,717
you're gonna have to come
and get it yourself.

1441
02:03:48,298 --> 02:03:51,426
- What are you doing, son?
- Squirting flies.

1442
02:03:54,905 --> 02:03:56,304
I hate kids.

1443
02:04:17,528 --> 02:04:20,395
- Where did you get that?
- We got two of them, Sheriff.

1444
02:04:20,464 --> 02:04:22,659
I know you got two of them. I can see that.

1445
02:04:22,733 --> 02:04:25,793
We wanted more
but the other clubs had taken them all.

1446
02:04:27,905 --> 02:04:31,238
When you say others,
you're talking, like another club?

1447
02:04:31,308 --> 02:04:35,335
- The Ladies Aid, the Hunting Club, the...
- Holy smoke.

1448
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:37,909
All the clubs are going great.

1449
02:04:38,749 --> 02:04:41,479
You ain't gonna cause a fuss,
are you, Rosco?

1450
02:04:41,552 --> 02:04:44,077
I'd be very unpopular if you did.

1451
02:04:44,154 --> 02:04:46,281
No. I'm gonna cause no fuss, Harvey.

1452
02:04:46,356 --> 02:04:49,257
But I'm the Sheriff.
I'm supposed to know these things.

1453
02:04:49,326 --> 02:04:53,695
- Now tell me, where did you get it?
- The Duke boys, Bo and Luke.

1454
02:04:55,866 --> 02:04:57,458
Bo and Luke Duke?

1455
02:04:58,502 --> 02:05:01,130
They get 30% and we get 70%...

1456
02:05:01,204 --> 02:05:03,934
Thirty! Heck, I only get...

1457
02:05:05,442 --> 02:05:08,240
Rosco, if you pick up some more slots
in a raid...

1458
02:05:08,312 --> 02:05:11,577
could we have them?
We need some new carpeting bad.

1459
02:05:19,356 --> 02:05:20,755
Is that her?

1460
02:05:22,693 --> 02:05:25,355
Yeah. That's her.

1461
02:05:26,296 --> 02:05:27,991
- Now, you swear?
- Yeah.

1462
02:05:28,265 --> 02:05:31,632
Rosco, if you know them Duke boys
got our machines...

1463
02:05:31,969 --> 02:05:33,994
why don't you throw them in jail?

1464
02:05:34,071 --> 02:05:37,336
I will, son. I will.
When I get enough evidence.

1465
02:05:38,075 --> 02:05:40,066
You? Since when?

1466
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:43,138
Since when elections are coming up.
Get out.

1467
02:06:01,431 --> 02:06:03,991
- Hey, Sheriff.
- You're gonna have to come with me.

1468
02:06:04,067 --> 02:06:07,503
I'd love to. But I've gotta get myself
to work. I'm gonna be late.

1469
02:06:07,571 --> 02:06:10,199
You don't understand.
I mean I'll have to arrest you.

1470
02:06:10,273 --> 02:06:13,572
- Oh, my Lord. What for?
- Hijacking. That's what for.

1471
02:06:21,151 --> 02:06:22,140
Damn.

1472
02:06:29,126 --> 02:06:30,718
Follow that car!

1473
02:06:32,462 --> 02:06:35,022
- You're kidding.
- Move!

1474
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:09,526
- Faster.
- I don't want to get no ticket.

1475
02:07:10,233 --> 02:07:12,827
From who, you jackass?

1476
02:08:05,889 --> 02:08:06,981
Stop!

1477
02:08:10,427 --> 02:08:11,655
<i>Y'all hang on.</i>

1478
02:08:35,352 --> 02:08:38,344
Put the window down.

1479
02:08:40,957 --> 02:08:42,356
Hey, again.

1480
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:46,525
If you two don't take the prize.

1481
02:08:46,963 --> 02:08:51,423
Now, chasing around, risking your own
probation and prison is your business.

1482
02:08:51,501 --> 02:08:53,526
- Now we didn't mean...
- But Daisy.

1483
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:58,097
How many times have I said to you,
"Boys, look out for Daisy"?

1484
02:08:58,775 --> 02:09:02,370
And how many times have you said to me,
"We will, Uncle Jesse."

1485
02:09:02,445 --> 02:09:05,312
And what do you do?
You get her throwed in jail.

1486
02:09:05,382 --> 02:09:07,942
Now, just wait a minute.
It isn't always that way.

1487
02:09:08,018 --> 02:09:10,578
Daisy's the hope of the whole clan.

1488
02:09:11,588 --> 02:09:15,046
- Thanks a lot.
- The family line ends with Daisy.

1489
02:09:17,561 --> 02:09:21,964
The chance of you two producing
a family rates right up there...

1490
02:09:22,032 --> 02:09:24,296
with hogs producing beef.

1491
02:09:25,235 --> 02:09:27,362
For 200 years...

1492
02:09:27,838 --> 02:09:31,467
the Duke family had the whiskey craft.

1493
02:09:31,975 --> 02:09:34,034
The government took that away from us.

1494
02:09:34,110 --> 02:09:38,171
Then we had the land,
and The Depression took that.

1495
02:09:38,849 --> 02:09:43,218
Now all the Duke family has left
is what it started with, and that's family...

1496
02:09:43,286 --> 02:09:45,311
and Daisy is family.

1497
02:09:47,357 --> 02:09:49,086
Now get her out.

1498
02:09:49,526 --> 02:09:52,723
<i>So the neXt morning</i>
<i>Luke decided to visit the shut-ins.</i>

1499
02:09:53,063 --> 02:09:56,897
<i>Escorting Luke to Daisy's cell</i>
<i>was Deputy Enos Strate.</i>

1500
02:09:57,267 --> 02:09:59,292
<i>He and the boys grew up together.</i>

1501
02:09:59,369 --> 02:10:01,303
<i>Enos had a crush on Daisy.</i>

1502
02:10:01,638 --> 02:10:05,233
<i>And the reputation of being</i>
<i>the oldest virgin in Hazzard County.</i>

1503
02:10:05,308 --> 02:10:08,300
Hold it. Now, Enos, you can tell me.

1504
02:10:09,579 --> 02:10:10,944
Any change?

1505
02:10:15,952 --> 02:10:17,442
Hang in there.

1506
02:10:25,161 --> 02:10:27,789
- Hey, Daisy. How are you doing?
- Great.

1507
02:10:27,864 --> 02:10:31,527
I'm writing this whole new song
about this enriching experience.

1508
02:10:31,868 --> 02:10:34,928
Boy! Jail cooking really puts on
the weight, don't it?

1509
02:10:35,705 --> 02:10:38,230
Luke, I've only been here overnight.

1510
02:10:38,642 --> 02:10:41,236
And stuck in the slammer
today of all days.

1511
02:10:41,311 --> 02:10:43,609
- It's her birthday, you know.
- It is?

1512
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,816
- Happy Birthday, Daisy.
- Why, thank you, Enos.

1513
02:10:52,489 --> 02:10:55,424
Jesse sent along this birthday flower
for your hair.

1514
02:10:56,593 --> 02:10:57,719
That's sweet.

1515
02:10:57,794 --> 02:11:00,558
I brought you these
change of clothes to cheer you up...

1516
02:11:00,630 --> 02:11:02,996
since you're stuck here
in that waitress outfit.

1517
02:11:03,066 --> 02:11:05,967
Better check it out.
Make sure a shotgun ain't hidden there.

1518
02:11:06,036 --> 02:11:10,097
I better let y'all visit. No tricks now, okay.

1519
02:11:10,907 --> 02:11:14,138
- Bye, Daisy.
- Bye, Enos. See you at supper.

1520
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:21,674
Now, listen up.

1521
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:26,314
Correct me if I'm wrong, Rosco...

1522
02:11:26,589 --> 02:11:29,786
but the only thing you've done
to get back those slot machines...

1523
02:11:29,859 --> 02:11:34,159
is arrest a woman in a bikini
for hijacking a load of fertilizer.

1524
02:11:34,564 --> 02:11:35,792
- Right?
- Right, Boss.

1525
02:11:35,865 --> 02:11:38,698
But that's exactly what's gonna get
those machines back.

1526
02:11:38,768 --> 02:11:41,202
You mean, you know where they are?

1527
02:11:48,778 --> 02:11:52,179
The Duke boys have put them all over,
in all the civic clubs.

1528
02:11:52,248 --> 02:11:56,082
- The Hazzard Cotillion, The Ladies Aid...
- Ladies Aid?

1529
02:11:56,786 --> 02:12:00,688
Hot damn.
I wish those Duke boys were on my side.

1530
02:12:00,757 --> 02:12:02,224
You don't have to worry...

1531
02:12:02,292 --> 02:12:05,352
because I'm gonna hit them Duke boys
where they live.

1532
02:12:05,428 --> 02:12:08,886
I've got Daisy, their cousin, in jail.
And they're gonna swap.

1533
02:12:08,965 --> 02:12:13,459
And then I'm gonna arrest them
for possession of illegal gambling devices.

1534
02:12:15,005 --> 02:12:16,233
- Rosco.
- What?

1535
02:12:16,306 --> 02:12:18,467
I got me three medals in two wars...

1536
02:12:18,541 --> 02:12:21,977
and the only time I get scared
is when you get smug.

1537
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:27,046
This feels kind of awkward.

1538
02:12:27,117 --> 02:12:29,347
The ground gives your back
natural support...

1539
02:12:29,419 --> 02:12:31,148
and strengthens your arms.

1540
02:12:31,388 --> 02:12:34,084
This is the way beginners learn?
On the ground?

1541
02:12:34,257 --> 02:12:36,851
No. But I finally got you lying down.

1542
02:12:38,595 --> 02:12:41,792
- Why'd you take up bow hunting?
- I didn't have no choice.

1543
02:12:42,065 --> 02:12:44,966
Luke and me are on probation
and can't own no guns.

1544
02:12:45,035 --> 02:12:47,299
So it's either use the bows or throw rocks.

1545
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:49,429
- At what?
- At game.

1546
02:12:50,373 --> 02:12:53,035
See, when we run low on food,
we have to go hunting.

1547
02:12:53,109 --> 02:12:55,703
Jesse, he don't take kindly to
no government assistance.

1548
02:12:55,779 --> 02:12:56,939
He'd rather starve.

1549
02:12:57,013 --> 02:12:59,504
Are you going to the orphanage picnic
on Saturday?

1550
02:12:59,582 --> 02:13:00,776
Well...

1551
02:13:01,151 --> 02:13:02,413
You have to come.

1552
02:13:02,485 --> 02:13:05,613
It's the money you and Luke collected
that got us rolling.

1553
02:13:05,688 --> 02:13:06,985
Saturday?

1554
02:13:10,093 --> 02:13:12,994
Yeah. That could turn into
a real barn burner.

1555
02:13:13,063 --> 02:13:15,691
Bo, may I ask you something seriously?

1556
02:13:16,599 --> 02:13:18,965
Where is all that money
really coming from?

1557
02:13:19,035 --> 02:13:21,765
It's so much, and it's always in quarters.

1558
02:13:21,838 --> 02:13:24,329
Look, the true source
is a very prominent man...

1559
02:13:24,407 --> 02:13:26,637
who'd be real embarrassed
if everybody knew.

1560
02:13:26,709 --> 02:13:30,076
- He's a philanthropist.
- He's been called everything.

1561
02:13:31,347 --> 02:13:33,747
We still have a long way to go...

1562
02:13:34,217 --> 02:13:36,913
but if it hadn't been for him,
we couldn't even begin.

1563
02:13:36,986 --> 02:13:38,351
I'd love to thank him.

1564
02:13:38,421 --> 02:13:40,855
Well, love me. I'm the go-between.

1565
02:13:42,692 --> 02:13:44,216
- Bo.
- Yeah?

1566
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:46,626
Why do you always try to be funny?

1567
02:13:46,696 --> 02:13:49,995
Well, because... you scare me to death.

1568
02:13:50,934 --> 02:13:53,459
We might get complicated.

1569
02:13:54,571 --> 02:13:58,530
- Would it be easier if I said I was leaving?
- Leaving?

1570
02:13:59,242 --> 02:14:02,109
A job. This was only temporary.

1571
02:14:02,879 --> 02:14:05,006
Damn. Why didn't you tell me that?

1572
02:14:06,416 --> 02:14:08,611
- Is it important?
- Sure it is.

1573
02:14:08,751 --> 02:14:10,218
I don't know why...

1574
02:14:10,286 --> 02:14:14,052
but I always think that the world
ticks on my schedule and then...

1575
02:14:17,427 --> 02:14:20,760
- I really hate that you're leaving, Jill.
- Why?

1576
02:14:21,998 --> 02:14:25,627
Maybe because you do scare me,
and believe me, not many women do.

1577
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:36,743
- How much time we got?
- Well...

1578
02:14:38,915 --> 02:14:40,143
Enough.

1579
02:14:57,200 --> 02:14:59,998
- Hazel?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1580
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:04,301
I'm sorry to be such a bother,
but I have to go to the little girls' room.

1581
02:15:04,374 --> 02:15:08,674
Again? I got other things to do, you know.

1582
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:15,583
You're an angel.

1583
02:15:15,652 --> 02:15:19,452
- I hate to be such a bother.
- You're a real pain, sweetheart.

1584
02:15:29,065 --> 02:15:30,930
I'll just be a minute.

1585
02:15:36,806 --> 02:15:41,038
Hazel, honey, I know I'm a pest,
but that light's not working.

1586
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,100
Wake up, birthday girl.

1587
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:16,910
Sheriff, I got bad news.

1588
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:19,574
- Quiet. I'm having my lunch.
- Daisy's gone.

1589
02:16:22,151 --> 02:16:24,585
- What did you just say?
- Daisy's gone.

1590
02:16:25,421 --> 02:16:28,151
Don't stand there. Go get her. You, too.

1591
02:16:43,072 --> 02:16:45,540
- Get a roadblock.
- It wasn't my fault.

1592
02:16:45,608 --> 02:16:47,974
You couldn't keep a canary in a cage.

1593
02:17:09,299 --> 02:17:11,563
Sheriff, there she is. Right here.

1594
02:17:20,176 --> 02:17:23,236
Judas Priest on a pony!
She's got my car again.

1595
02:17:26,115 --> 02:17:28,709
Come back, Daisy! Good God, Daisy!

1596
02:17:53,643 --> 02:17:56,737
<i>Bet you all ain't never seen</i>
<i>a jailbreak like this.</i>

1597
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:20,733
- That boy's fast.
- And he drives good, too.

1598
02:18:21,304 --> 02:18:24,796
Hey, fella. You ever considered a career
in law enforcement?

1599
02:18:25,641 --> 02:18:28,474
Look, Enos, we're willing
to forget what happened.

1600
02:18:32,749 --> 02:18:35,240
It ain't your fault you're on the wrong side.

1601
02:18:35,318 --> 02:18:36,842
Wrong side. Me?

1602
02:18:42,692 --> 02:18:45,456
You know Sheriff Rosco
brought in them slot machines...

1603
02:18:45,528 --> 02:18:46,961
and that was wrong.

1604
02:18:47,029 --> 02:18:49,657
Yeah, I know.
I don't sleep good at night knowing it.

1605
02:18:49,732 --> 02:18:52,633
But it's just as wrong for you
to steal them and make money.

1606
02:18:52,702 --> 02:18:55,262
Enos, your daddy ran moonshine.
So did ours.

1607
02:18:55,338 --> 02:18:57,533
Did you ever know us
to mess with gambling?

1608
02:18:57,607 --> 02:19:00,132
- Then why'd y'all do it?
- You'd never guess.

1609
02:19:00,343 --> 02:19:02,368
We did it for the Sheriff.

1610
02:19:03,513 --> 02:19:06,812
- You're right. I'd never guess.
- You see, it's a long story.

1611
02:19:06,883 --> 02:19:09,249
It all started about four years ago...

1612
02:19:28,871 --> 02:19:31,704
And while you're letting
those prisoners escape...

1613
02:19:32,141 --> 02:19:36,305
old Ledbetter there is kissing those babies
and winning those votes.

1614
02:19:36,379 --> 02:19:39,246
Don't you worry about it,
'cause I'll tell you something.

1615
02:19:39,315 --> 02:19:41,647
I'm gonna nail Bo and Luke Duke.

1616
02:19:43,886 --> 02:19:45,217
Nail them.

1617
02:19:45,621 --> 02:19:48,317
Rosco, before you start
building any crosses...

1618
02:19:48,825 --> 02:19:51,817
just remember those boys
are very popular around here.

1619
02:19:51,894 --> 02:19:54,362
You better be sure you have the evidence.

1620
02:19:54,430 --> 02:19:58,389
There'll be no railroading in my county
this close to elections.

1621
02:19:58,935 --> 02:20:02,894
I happen to know that those boys
are bringing in two broken slot machines...

1622
02:20:02,972 --> 02:20:05,133
and I know where and I know when.

1623
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:07,535
- You do?
- Yeah.

1624
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:11,046
- How good is your information?
- It's good.

1625
02:20:11,113 --> 02:20:14,082
In fact, it's my deputy.
They made a fool out of him.

1626
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:16,380
Boy, he's anxious to get even.

1627
02:20:32,735 --> 02:20:36,535
- Sitting ducks. All set.
- That's a roger.

1628
02:20:47,316 --> 02:20:50,808
- Coming at you, Sheriff.
- They're all mine.

1629
02:21:26,188 --> 02:21:29,487
- They're headed for town.
- I'll come in the other side.

1630
02:21:50,379 --> 02:21:52,472
- Hey, did you see that?
- See what?

1631
02:21:52,648 --> 02:21:54,878
The bait shop.
Having a sale on worms and crickets.

1632
02:21:55,785 --> 02:21:59,585
Well, if he don't sell them now,
he's gonna have to feed them all winter.

1633
02:24:12,254 --> 02:24:15,883
- They're right in front of you, Sheriff.
- Now we got them.

1634
02:24:20,062 --> 02:24:21,654
Hang on, cousin.

1635
02:24:36,412 --> 02:24:37,777
I got them.

1636
02:24:39,315 --> 02:24:41,806
I got you. This time I've got you.

1637
02:24:43,319 --> 02:24:46,254
You have been gotten.
Read them their rights.

1638
02:24:48,624 --> 02:24:50,615
"Welcome, Sheriff Rosco"?

1639
02:25:04,673 --> 02:25:07,574
How can we ever thank you
for all that you've done!

1640
02:25:08,244 --> 02:25:09,768
Hey, kids, now don't be...

1641
02:25:09,845 --> 02:25:12,939
I know we promised not to tell,
but she drug it out of us.

1642
02:25:13,015 --> 02:25:16,644
Besides, we figured people had
a right to know who saved the orphanage.

1643
02:25:16,719 --> 02:25:19,279
You wait till Boss Hogg
finds out it was you.

1644
02:25:19,355 --> 02:25:21,255
Oh, Rosco, you old softy.

1645
02:25:22,958 --> 02:25:26,792
We knew you'd be too modest to show up
to the celebration, so we tricked you.

1646
02:25:26,862 --> 02:25:28,261
Enos here helped.

1647
02:25:29,431 --> 02:25:32,298
I had you all wrong
about the slot machines.

1648
02:25:32,368 --> 02:25:35,030
I'm mighty proud
to serve under a man like you.

1649
02:25:35,404 --> 02:25:36,996
Okay, Enos.

1650
02:25:55,624 --> 02:25:58,889
<i>Well, the word got out</i>
<i>and old Rosco was reelected.</i>

1651
02:25:59,061 --> 02:26:02,588
<i>Which meant the Dukes</i>
<i>could still fight an enemy they knew.</i>

1652
02:26:08,137 --> 02:26:10,731
<i>Jill decided to hang around an eXtra week.</i>

1653
02:26:11,207 --> 02:26:13,471
<i>Old Boss was really burned at Rosco...</i>

1654
02:26:13,542 --> 02:26:16,238
<i>for taking all the credit</i>
<i>for saving the orphanage.</i>

1655
02:26:16,312 --> 02:26:18,974
<i>After all, they were his slot machines.</i>

1656
02:26:20,816 --> 02:26:24,980
<i>So that's the legend of how Sheriff Rosco</i>
<i>helped save the orphanage...</i>

1657
02:26:25,054 --> 02:26:28,148
<i>and made gambling respectable</i>
<i>in Hazzard County.</i>

1658
02:26:29,058 --> 02:26:31,458
<i>Of course... he had a little help.</i>

1659
