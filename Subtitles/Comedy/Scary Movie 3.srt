WOMAN ON TV:
Day after day...

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
The store that one might...

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,800
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
because of TV and television,
we're losing

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,800
Oh, please.

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,800

Dude!

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
"Dude"!

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,100
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,800
You know what else I heard?

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,000
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
- Aah!
- Aah!

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,900
It's not working!

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,800
It's backwards!

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,200
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, my God!

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
[Television clicks off,
both sigh]

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
That was kind of scary.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
Have you heard about
this videotape?

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And then in the bathtub?

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
- And did you see the...
- No.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
- Not that tape.
- Oh.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
The one with
all the scary images.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,400
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,800
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
You were with Josh last weekend?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, yes, I was.

38

Oh, you ho!

39

This is really weird.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Yeah.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,600
Big house, only one phone.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, precious.
Having fun?

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,900

[Thunder crashes]

Katie?

62
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,900
Are you okay?

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Are you okay?

- Tom, did you hear...
- [Dog barks]

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,400

What are you doing out here?

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,200
We were worried sick.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
What's wrong?

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,300
I wonder what they're
trying to tell us.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
ANNOUNCER:
And now...

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Washington, D.C.'s
leading morning news program,

94
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
"The Morning News."

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Thank you, Ross.

98
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,800
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

103
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
But either way,
it's clear something strange

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
is happening in that small town.

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Ross?

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
Coming up, more news after this.

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,100
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,200
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

114
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
But I can tell
when danger's near.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
[Gasps]
Ow!

116
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,900
Ow!
My eyes!

117
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,200
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

118
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
People want
human interest stories.

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Like the one you did yesterday.

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,100
The report
on breast augmentation?

121
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,400
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

122
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
I mean, come on.

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
MAN: Wow!

124
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Why are these so interesting?

125
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, for God's sake.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
[Sighs]
People don't care about this.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,800
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

128
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
And twins!

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800

<i>Dogs that love cats</i>

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,900
You think it was
the Kreisel boys

136
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

137
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,300
All I know is my crops are gone.

138
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

139
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,800
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

140
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
The last thing you needed
was more...

142
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,000
[Blowing nose]

143
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,600
...hardship in your life.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Especially after
what happened to...

145
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

146
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

147
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,000
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,400
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Your faith will return.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

151
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,200
Sounds like a long shot.

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Look, there's always
an explanation

153
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,500
for all this so-called
phenomena.

154
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
Maybe you're right.

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
And when I get through
with them,

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

158
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
for a long time.

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
You'll see.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You all right, Tom?
Get some rest.

161
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,700

George!

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I need you back here tomorrow
night after you pick up Sue.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
That tractor needs fixing.

166
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,400
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

167
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Not that stupid
hip-hop stuff again.

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Damn it, when are you going to
do something with your life?

169
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
I got a dream!

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

171
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,400

is chase adolescent fantasies.

And now this stupid
hip-hop thing.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
For your information,

176
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
this hip-hop thing is gonna
get me paid.

177
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm gonna win that rap battle.

178
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Rap battle?
Oh, for God's sake.

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,400
You just hate me
'cause I'm black.

180
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
You don't have any faith in me.

181
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
You don't have any faith

Oh, too long.
I've been working so hard.

193

I've had to spend more
and more time at the station.

194

What was the assignment?

196

Well, you know, I just haven't
found the right guy.

I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

201
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,200
I know.
You want commitment.

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
No, I want great sex.
And when I meet that guy...

203

You don't dress like a farmer.

222

My brother's the farmer.

223

Honey, what is it?

Are you having
one of your visions?

There's a girl...
with black hair.

247

She wants to kill you.

in three... two... one.

What else?
Cody, what else do you see?

I see a little boy
and a grown woman.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
But no father.

252
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,600
Oh, Cody.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I see you kneeling in dog shit.

Cody, don't you understand?

257
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,800
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

258
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
I know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

259

God, I have been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

thinking about you 24...

leaving soon, so...

No.

playing.

Anyway, I left a number where
I can be reached on the table.

280

Also, he has a little rash
on his behind.

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,900
So make sure he takes a bath.

over here and move over there?

00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
George, stop!
She's dead!

706
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
No!
We won't lose you again!

707
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,600
Mahalik, help!

708
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Nothing!

709
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
- Ooh!
- [Screams]

710
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,200
She's not breathing!

711
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,000
No!

712
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,200
Live, damn it!
Live!

713
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,200
Live, damn it!
Live!

714
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,100
Let me open her windpipe!

715
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,200
MRS. MEEKS:
No! Oh, God!

716
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,600
Charles!
Charles, stop them!

717
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Breathe!

718
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,000
Someone stop them!
What are they doing?!

719
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Get up!

720
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,700
She's alive!
She's alive!

721
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Wake up!
Breathe!

722
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,800
[All shouting]

723
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
- Charles! Charles!
- Clear!

724
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
No!

725
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,100
Aah!

726
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
I got something!
I got something!

727
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,300
[Gasps, screams]

728
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
Aah!

729
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,500
- That's it!
- George!

730
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,400
That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

731
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
George, don't get down
on yourself.

732
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,300
I know you were only trying
to help.

733
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
You're a good, caring person.

734
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,500
Which is why I like you.

735
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,800
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

736
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,100
But I don't want to
screw your life up, too.

737
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,000
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

738
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
is to just get out of here.

739
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
George!
What about Sue?

740
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,400
Oh, yes.
Of course.

741
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,200
Once I get Sue, then...

742
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
Wait!

743
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,000
I could really use a friend
right now.

744
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,200
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

745
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

746
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh, God, it's so hard!

747
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,600
Well, you're beautiful and
you're pressing up against me.

748
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,300
Look, Cindy.

749
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,100
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

750
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,400
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

751
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,200
Is that a yes?

752
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,600
Yes.

753
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,600
Cindy, did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

754
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,400
She did mention something.

755
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

756
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,900
Yes, go.
Of course. Go.

757
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,800
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

758
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
You're getting lucky tonight.

759
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,600
He doesn't know you're a guy.

760
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
[Thunder crashes]

761
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,200

762
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh, shit.

[Telephone ringing]

768
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,600
Hello?

769

[Man speaking indistinctly]

770
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,400
What?

[Mumbling]

774
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
What?

775
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,800
Can you hear me now?

776
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,000
Kind of.

777
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes. Perfect.

778
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
Seven days.

779
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Seven days.

780
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,600
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die next Monday?

781
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,900
Yes.
No. Wait.

782
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,000
Monday. That would be
seven business days.

783
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This is seven days starting now.

784
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
So seven days to this very hour?
My watch broke.

785
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
How am I gonna know
the exact hour?

786
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,800
Forget hours.
This day seven days from now.

787
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,500
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday?

788
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,200
Well, that depends.
What holiday?

789
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,200
- Martin Luther King Day.
- Then no.

790
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,600
Why not? Everybody at work
is taking it off.

791
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,800
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving
you seven friggin' days.

792
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,300
I can come over now and kill the
shit out of you if you'd rather.

793

[Click, dial tone]

794
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Yo, George, I don't care
what you say, man.

795
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm signing you up
for another rap battle.

796
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

797
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,000
I said the same thing about
getting with C.J.'s sister.

798
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,600
- I'm still hitting that.
- He's still hitting it, man!

799
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
And she fine as shit!
That's my sister! What?

800
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,100
It doesn't matter.
I'm done.

801
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,600
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

802

[Laughs]

803
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,200
Yeah! Yeah!
A-come on!

804
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Maybe my brother was right.
Maybe I should just settle down.

[Laughing]

806
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,600
- What's up, then?!
- Mother...

807

I got another one, y'all.

808
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Yo, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man.

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
- Let that go.
- [Laughing]

810
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Hey, you got to try
this shit, George.

811
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,600
Ow!

Yo, man, you got to take
the lid off!

813

- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Sorry!

terrible has happened!

Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

819
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
George, you have to help me.

820
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

821
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

822
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,200
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

823
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, there is!

824
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
I know somebody who can
help you.

825
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

826
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

827
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,300
This morning he woke up dead.

828
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

829
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

830
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

831
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
MAHALIK:
You can't go to bed dead!

832
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,600
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

833
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,700
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

834
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,400
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

835
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,600
But you are in a bed, man.

836
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,000
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

838
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,100
You should be teaching classes!

839
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,200
- Just tell me who can help me!
- Damn!

Her and her man
into this weird shit.

They saw the tape before anybody
else knew about it.

- Go see them tonight.
- Tonight? Yeah.

844

CODY: George,
we're gonna have so much fun.

and board games

and baseball cards in my room

848
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,300
and this really cool
model airplane.

849
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,600
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

850
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
Okay, so I made him a snack.

851
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
You can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep.

- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Here it is.

- Right.

You know, it's funny.

is a family.

You're Cindy.
Be right with you.

Bingo.

the Oracle.

And don't worry about that vase.

A great mystery
lies ahead of you,

The tape is connected to the

1069
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,100
Sir, I think you need
to go on TV

1070
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,700
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a UFO.

There's no such thing

- That's not quite true.
- Sir?

A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

- A body may have been recovered.
- "May have been"?

1077
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,400
Well, there was
a terrible mix-up.

1078
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,300
It was Thanksgiving.

1079
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,700
The body was sent down
to the kitchen.

1080
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,400
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

1081

That's the last I saw of it.

No, scratch that.

There were some sandwiches
made the next day.

to put my pants on again?

00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,200
No, sir. It's just a feeling
I've been having

1089
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,800
since the news about the aliens.

- Something's not right.
- I know what you mean.

1091

It's like that feeling
that something's not right.

What is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape?

1105
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,300
The answer is simple.

1106

You are the eventuality
of an anomaly.

1107
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,200
You are inexorably seeking

- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

1230
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,600
Aah!
You're hideous!

1231
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,800
Get off my planet!

1232
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,600
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1233
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,800
The exits are all blocked.

1234
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,400
I'll find one, sir.

1235
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,600
Everybody, clear!

1236
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,400
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1237
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,300
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1238
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,000
Cody?

1239
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,100
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1240
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,200
Honey?

1241
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

1242
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,000
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1243
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,700
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1244
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,400
Oh, no.

1245
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,000
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1246
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,200
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1247
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,800
We're the only station
that has it,

1248
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,400
and we're showing it all night.

1249
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1250
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,800
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1251
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,200
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1252
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
- George.
- Cindy.

1253
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,900
There's no time.

1254
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,200
Cody.

1255
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1256
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,800
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1257
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,400
No, he didn't.

1258
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Okay, but I was gonna.

1259
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,200
No, he wasn't.

1260
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,700
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1261
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,400
I wanted to be with George.

1262
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1263
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1264
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,600
Why would I be good at that?

1265
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,900
SUE:
Uncle George!

1266
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,200
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1267
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,400
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1268
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,200
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1269
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
about you
the day you were born?

1270
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,300
No.

1271
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,800
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1272
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,600
She was having a hard time.

1273
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,200
Then you began
to come out of her.

1274
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,200
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1275
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,000
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1276
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,600
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1277
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,400
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1278
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,500
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1279
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,200
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1280
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, finally you came out.

1281
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,800
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1282
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,800
Well, on the second try.

1283
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,400
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1284
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,900
After all, she was drunk.

1285
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,200
Actually, drugged.

1286
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,400
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1287
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,600
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1288
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,400
So she did just a little.

1289
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,600
My penis?

1290
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,400
Yes.

1291
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,000
They sewed it on upside down.

1292
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,800
So that's why I pee up?

1293
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,200
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1294
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,100
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1295
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,800
Anyway, there you were.

1296
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,400
Your mom turned to me and said,

1297
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,500
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1298
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,200
Then she died.

1299
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,600
And I took you.

1300
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Do you know why?

1301
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1302
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,300
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1303
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,100
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1304
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,600
But I love you.

1305
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,700
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1306
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,200
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

1307
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,800
TOM:
George!

1308
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,000
[Banging]

1309
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,600
Are they gone?

1310
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,800
I don't hear anything.

1311
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,000
[Banging]

1312
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,600
[Screams effeminately]

1313
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,900
Don't worry, Sue.

1314
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,100
SUE:
It was Uncle George.

1315
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,800
Well, it's scary.

1316
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,200
Good work, Sue.

1317
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,500
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

1318
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
made these lights go off.

1319
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,000
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1320
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,500
I can get these lights back on.

1321
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,700
[Banging]

1322
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,200
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

1323
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,800
Jam it against the door.

1324
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,400
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

1325
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,700
My balls!

1326
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,800
Oh!
Not those!

1327
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,400
Jesus!

1328
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,600
No!

1329
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,600
SUE:
Uncle George!

1330
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm scared!

1331
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,800
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

1332
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,400
Aah!

1333
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,400
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1334
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
I can't see anything.

1335
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,400
Oh, my God.

1336
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,800
Can you see them?

1337
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,600
They're horrible.

1338
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,700
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

1339
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,400
Their teeth are grotesque.

1340
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,000
[Trilling]

1341
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,400
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

1342
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, no.

1343
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,500
Oh, no, I think...

1344
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,000
- I think they want...
- [Banging]

1345
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,100
Aaah!
Help!

1346
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,700
Cody!
Oh, my God!

1347
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,100
George.
Swing away, George.

1348
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,000
- Aah! Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

1349
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I'll save you.

1350
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,800
- Ugh!
- Die!

1351
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,600
Die!

1352
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,900
You damn aliens, let him go!

1353
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,500
You're not getting in here!

1354
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,400
- What else you got?
- George.

1355
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,500
There!
Had enough?

1356
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

1357
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,800
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

1358
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,800
Come on.

1359
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,800
SUE:
Daddy!

1360
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,200
- Daddy!
- Sue!

1361
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,200
Oh!

1362
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,500
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

1363
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,600
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

1364
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,600
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

1365
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,400
They're gone.

1366
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,800
Good.
They couldn't get in.

1367
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,200
I hear they can't open doors.

1368
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,900
They mastered space flight,

1369
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,800
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

1370
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,000
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

1371
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,800
Women and children stay here.

1372
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,800
- Ugh!
- All right, and the men,

1373
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,200
we go outside and fight.

1374
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,800
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

1375
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,200
Come on!

1376
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,700
[Groans]

1377
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,800

- [Shovel cocks]
- Follow me.

1379
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,200
[Tires screeching]

1380
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
I'm sorry.

1381
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,200
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

1382
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,200
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

1383
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

1384
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,600
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1385
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,000
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1386
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Ah, good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1387
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
We don't have round planes, sir.

1388
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,500
Oh, my God.

1389
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,800
Oh, my God.

1390
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
- [Hip-hop music plays]
- Wait. Do you hear that?

1391
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,400
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1392
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,800
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1393
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,000
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1394
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
- Yo, what's up, George?
- C.J.!

1395
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

1396
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,600
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

1397
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,500
Who we gonna shoot?

1398
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,800
Is y'all ready to go step?

1399
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,200
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

1400
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,400
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

1401
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Call me "bitch" again,

1402
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,500
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

1403
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,200
Damn, homey!

1404
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,600
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

1405
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,700
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

1406
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,000
Come on, let's go.

1407
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

1408
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,900
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

1409
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,000
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

1410
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,200
I got nuts bigger than him.

1411
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,200
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

1412
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,500
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1413
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,800
Get down!
Get down!

1414
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,300
I can't believe what I just saw.

1415
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,000
These men died
for their country.

1416
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,200
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

1417
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
I can't break free!

1418
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,200
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1419
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

1420
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,600
I found it!

1421
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,600
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

1422
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,400
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

1423
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,200
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1424
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,800
We must destroy her
before seven days.

1425
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,000
You mean you watched
the videotape?

1426
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

1427
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,800
That was a week ago.

1428
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1429
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

1430
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

1431
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,700
Oh, that's how we say hello.

1432
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,000
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

1433
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

1434
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,900
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

1435
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,200
Oh!

1436
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,800
[Groans]
I had to ask.

1437
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,700
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

1438
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,100
[Choking]

1439
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,600
So we're not so different
after all.

1440
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,900
There's something
about this place.

1441
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,400
It's like I've seen it before.

1442
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,000
Oh, my God.

1443
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
This used to be their farm.

1444
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,200
She died right here.

1445
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,500
There's something down there.

1446
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,200
Ugh!

1447
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,000
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

1448
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,100
Just look at this.

1449
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,400
Human beings and aliens
working together.

1450
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,800
We're all just
one big galactic family.

1451
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,600
Family.

1452
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
That's just what
I've been running away from.

1453
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,800
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

1454
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,200
This is it.

1455
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,300
ARCHITECT: My wife took her
to the family farm

1456
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,400
and drowned her in the well.

1457
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,400
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

1458
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,800
[Gasps]

1459
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,700
Aah!

1460
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,200
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

1461
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,400
[Crowbar clanks]

1462
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,100
[Chainsaw sputters, buzzes]

1463
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,000
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

1464
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,500
[Growling]

1465
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,400
Cindy!

1466
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,200
No.
Don't hurt him!

1467
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,500
Cindy, come outside.

1468
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,100
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

1469
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,700
Aah!

1470
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,400
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

1471
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,000
- Aah!
- CINDY: Wait!

1472
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,200
Wait.
Don't do this.

1473
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,400
You don't have to be evil.

1474
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,800
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

1475
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,800
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

1476
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,400
You were just a little girl.

1477
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,400
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

1478
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,800
and with really bad teeth.

1479
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,800
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

1480
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,000
And a father.

1481
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,400
We could be...

1482
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,500
A family.

1483
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,600
Thank you all.

1484
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,000
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1485
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,700
I'll never have to kill again.

1486
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,300
Really?

1487
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,000
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

1488
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
[Grunts]
Aah!

1489
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

1490
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,800
- We're all counting on you.
- [Splash]

1491
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,900
Now it's over.

1492
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,000
- [Gasps]
- Aah!

1493
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,700
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

1494
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,200
He's our friend.

1495
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,200
Thank you for saving
our species.

1496
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,000
Now we must return
to our home planet.

1497
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,400
Goodbye, then.

1498
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,300
Ugh!

1499
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,900
Goodbye.

1500
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,200
Hey, congratulations, George!

1501
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,000
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

1502
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,600
Yeah, yeah!

1503
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,100
Come on!

1504
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,400
Bye!

1505
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,900
Whoo!

1506
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,800
- Oh!
- Oh!

1507
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,500
ALL: Bye!

1508
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,200
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

1509
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,600
Finally we're a family.

1510
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,800
Yeah.
You, me, and...

1511
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,600
- Damn!
- Damn!

1512
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,000
[Tires screeching]

1513
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
Cindy, George, wait!

1514
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,500
[Sighs]

1515
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,200
<i>Come on</i>

01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,400
<i>"Scary Movie 3"</i>

01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,000
<i>Welcome to the future, baby</i>

1518
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,500
<i>You think you hot shit 'cause</i>
<i>you got ice on your wrist</i>

1519
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,000
<i>Now, y'all picture this</i>...
<i>tough guy turned snitch</i>

1520
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,600
<i>Knew he was lying</i>
<i>by the way his eyes twitch</i>

01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
<i>He gulp when he swallow</i>

1522
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,300
<i>When he spoke,</i>
<i>his voice pitch</i>

1523
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,000
<i>My first thought's</i>
<i>to slap him up, but I'm grown</i>

1524
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,500
<i>So I dropped a jewel</i>
<i>in his ear</i>

1525
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,100
<i>Told him get on,</i>
<i>leave it alone</i>

1526
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,400
<i>Now he's asking questions he</i>
<i>shoulda asked from the start</i>

1527
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,900
<i>I'm gonna spit from the</i>

<i>From the stage in the park,</i>
<i>I'm gonna bite if you bark</i>

<i>Just to show him</i>
<i>that it's fun to me</i>

01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,900
<i>And take a look at what</i>
<i>being broke gonna mean</i>

<i>I am the truth,</i>
<i>plus I'm hungry</i>
