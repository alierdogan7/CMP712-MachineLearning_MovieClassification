00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:02,304
<i>The Eye.</i>

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:04,902
<i>It may not lie...</i>

3
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:08,537
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,069
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

5
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:15,069
<i>But is it truth?</i>

6
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:18,537
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods.</i>

7
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:19,703
<i>Are they?</i>

8
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,902
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

9
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,403
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

10
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:26,837
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,736
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,470
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

13
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,004
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

14
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,769
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

15
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:40,969
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

16
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:42,937
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,103
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

18
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:47,004
<i>Framed. Holding the bag.</i>

19
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:48,903
<i>Me.</i>

20
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,669
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

21
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,836
<i>When you emerge,
and you will...</i>

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,969
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

23
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,403
<i>you will get
what's coming to you.</i>

25
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,770
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

26
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,437
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,438
<i>Because one thing
I believe in</i>

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,671
<i>is any eye for an eye.</i>

29
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:25,180
<b>NOW YOU SEE ME 2
Subrip: Pix</b>

30
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,773
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

31
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,039
Who am I speaking to?

32
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,607
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

33
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,738
<i>You've asked many questions.</i>

34
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,339
<i>And registered
many complaints.</i>

35
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,406
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

36
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,905
Have you? Because I don't...

37
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,440
<i>-Trust?
-No.</i>

38
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,072
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

39
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:57,340
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

40
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:01,740
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

41
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,973
I don't like that every
message I get from Dylan is,

42
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,505
"Wait. Be patient.

43
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,740
"The Eye has a plan."

44
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:09,107
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

45
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,539
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

46
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,605
This is games and
it's not working for me.

47
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:17,106
<i>You feel it is you who should
be leading the Horsemen,</i>

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,573
<i>not Dylan.</i>

49
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,673
<i>If that is
what you desire,</i>

50
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,040
<i>stay the course.</i>

51
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,107
<i>Trust that
your unique talents</i>

52
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,006
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

53
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,739
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

54
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,839
<i>Dylan has a plan and will
gather you together soon.</i>

55
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,675
<i>Now leave!</i>

56
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:55,008
<i>North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.</i>

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,574
<i>We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.</i>

58
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,540
<i>I need to see some results.</i>

59
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,474
Hey. Sorry.

60
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,540
Just real quick. Can I have
you for a couple of minutes?

61
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,808
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

62
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,774
No, I know. It's okay.
Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry.

63
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,973
Sorry about that.

64
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,375
Call the mayor.

65
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,708
Thanks a lot.
Twins? Good.

66
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:14,973
Is he coming?

67
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,108
Look, I wouldn't have brought
you out of that meeting

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,740
unless it was
something important.

69
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:21,075
It's about
the Horsemen.

70
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,474
Something's happening here
and it's happening now.

71
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:27,108
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

72
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,709
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

73
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,541
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

74
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,041
I know what Octa is.

75
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,875
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

76
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,374
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

77
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,474
And I said
that I was wrong.

78
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,075
He knew that
the Horsemen

79
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,107
were going to hit the
Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,374
I have proof.

81
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,774
-Let him talk.
-Thank you.

82
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,375
Communications.

83
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:49,442
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

84
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:52,042
and who may be
Merritt McKinney.

85
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,075
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones?

86
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,575
Any transcripts?

87
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:56,692
Pigeons.

88
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:57,775
What?

89
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:00,076
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

90
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:02,842
No, I mean actual pigeon
pigeons. Like carrier pigeons.

91
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,409
Okay? Magicians work

92
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,841
-with pigeons.
-Doves.

93
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,509
Stay with me.

94
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,708
This pigeon,
right here...

95
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:14,475
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

96
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,609
East Village.

97
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,342
Same pigeon, West Village.

98
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:20,008
42nd Street, pigeon.
65th Street.

99
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,975
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

100
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,509
on a sail boat
with a guy

101
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,709
that looks just
like Merritt McKinney.

102
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,109
And what does
this all mean?

103
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:30,409
I know
what it means.

104
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,709
It means nothing.
It's bullshit.

105
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,543
-Could you sing a new song?
-No.

106
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,608
How is it that two years
ago you were so close...

107
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:38,110
You think I went out of my way to
screw up my own investigation?

108
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,177
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

109
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,443
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

110
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,375
but you want everybody else to
think that you're an idiot.

111
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,408
Okay, stop.

112
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,509
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

113
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,777
people who don't even know
you, think you're an asshole.

114
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:51,909
-And you?
-Ma'am.

115
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:54,810
You don't know me, but my
first year in the Academy,

116
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:56,110
you gave a talk.

117
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:57,942
The "long game"
you called it.

118
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,709
You talked about
a moral compass.

119
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,876
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

120
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:07,077
And I thought to myself,
"That guy.

121
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,010
"One day,
I want to be that guy."

122
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,376
And now... A pigeon?

123
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,577
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,077
Okay. So here's what
I'm going to do.

125
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,676
You want to take
a vacation day?

126
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,011
Go on your own? Fine.

127
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:24,644
But I'm not going to devote
resources to another snipe hunt.

128
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,810
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

129
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:28,944
Boss, thank you.

130
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:31,476
I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

131
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,844
We're gonna get
those Horsemen.

132
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:34,977
She's great.

133
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,777
The problem is

134
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,376
when you're two people
at the same time,

135
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,811
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

136
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,476
And when that happens,

137
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,044
I will be there.

138
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,877
Duly noted.

139
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,911
-Hi!
-Who are you?

140
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,745
-What are you doing in my...
-It's actually a funny story.

141
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,477
How did you get
into my apartment?

142
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,777
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "

143
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,944
Or you might not think
that it's funny "

144
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,411
I think it's funny. I guess
it's all kind of relative.

145
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:20,411
I was actually...
No, that's not...

146
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,644
I made myself in the
neighborhood and now I'm here,

147
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:23,911
and maybe...

148
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:27,912
Okay.

149
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:29,778
Seriously, how did
you get in here?

150
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,744
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

151
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:33,745
My God. No, no, no,
I recognize you.

152
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,510
You did that B-grade

153
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:36,912
"geek magic" thing, didn't you?
You pulled a...

154
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:38,112
Pulled a hat
out of the rabbit.

155
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,512
A hat out of the rabbit,
that's right.

156
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:40,677
I know
that it didn't work.

157
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,811
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

158
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,045
It was way worse
for the rabbit.

159
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,777
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

160
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,012
So if you wouldn't mind

161
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:50,346
crawling out from
under my couch and...

162
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:56,611
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

163
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,545
By the way,
that rabbit thing?

164
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,379
That was eight
years ago, okay?

165
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:02,013
I've gotten so much
better since then.

166
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,746
-Have you?
-Yeah.

167
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,013
Okay, come here. What
is it that you want?

168
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,712
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

169
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:08,545
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

170
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:11,579
I said it. I do. And I want
to use my magic for good,

171
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,946
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

172
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,013
That's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

173
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,478
I know that he
faked his own death.

174
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,812
I am a huge fan
of faking deaths.

175
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,445
That was crazy!

176
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,912
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

177
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,812
-Yeah.
-It's terrible.

178
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:25,879
Embarrassing.

179
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,912
Okay.

180
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:29,978
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

181
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,878
-God!
-Sorry.

182
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,380
That's actually
a little better.

183
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,547
You know what I heard?

184
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:35,613
-What?
-About Henley?

185
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,413
I heard that she got
tired of waiting around.

186
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,878
She lost faith and so
she asked for an out,

187
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:42,847
and the Eye
gave it to her.

188
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,113
But who knows, right?

189
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,346
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

190
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,579
I mean, maybe she got
sick of you.

191
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,746
You ever think
about that?

192
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,913
Control issues?

193
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,979
Maybe you just didn't tie
her up tight enough.!

194
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:53,546
Here's what's
going to happen.

195
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,846
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

196
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,479
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

197
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:59,780
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

198
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,546
It's all in the wrist.

199
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,647
Let the momentum of the
card do the work for you.

200
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,714
This last one
I call the Stall.

201
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,046
Not bad.

202
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,780
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

203
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:22,613
-I do indeed.
-Here you go.

204
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,813
And bingo bango bongo.

205
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,680
That's good.

206
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,613
No, no, no, it's
good to be positive

207
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,081
despite making zero
progress in a year.

208
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,381
Yeah.

209
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:34,381
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

210
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:36,714
the student has almost
become the master.

211
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,947
I like your confidence,

212
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,481
but you might say that
you have the better teacher.

213
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:42,613
Yeah.

214
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:43,713
You're right.
You're right.

215
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,114
Your teacher definitely
doesn't know what he's doing.

216
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,082
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

217
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,414
In fact it was.

218
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,647
I thought so.

219
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,347
That's not bad.

220
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,781
If I can hypnotize Danny before
you hit him with a card,

221
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:01,082
I get top bunk
for a week.

222
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,114
Okay, that's a deal.

223
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,382
-Danny, what's up, man?
-Hey.

224
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:06,747
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

225
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,048
you will begin
to notice...

226
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:08,948
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

227
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,414
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

228
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,014
I didn't know you guys
did party tricks

229
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,814
when there weren't floozies
around to impress.

230
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,115
I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

231
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,482
in, like, 1937.

232
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,582
Okay, somebody broke into
my apartment, all right?

233
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,449
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

234
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,716
everything about
Henley leaving,

235
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:26,915
and everything about us.

236
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:28,047
That's her.

237
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,748
Hey!

238
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:30,882
Hi.

239
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,015
You met Lula.

240
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,681
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

241
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,582
I'm the new Horseman!

242
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,715
I'm the girl Horseman.

243
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:42,548
Yeah!

244
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:44,748
Nobody.
No excitement.

245
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,083
Jack? Anything?

246
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,115
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

247
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,849
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

248
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:54,615
and I think she
has some real talent,

249
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,681
and I'd like to
try her on stage

250
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:57,782
to balance out the duo.

251
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:58,849
What?

252
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,816
No, are you serious, man?

253
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:02,415
After Henley left, you said I
could get back on stage again.

254
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,815
Not someone who
just showed up.

255
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:05,382
I told you I'd think
about it, and I have,

256
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,981
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

257
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,382
Dylan, come on. I've been behind
the scenes my whole life.

258
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,849
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

259
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,150
Much as I appreciate

260
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,982
the addition of some
femininity to the group,

261
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,449
over and above
what Atlas provides...

262
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,782
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

263
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,116
Yeah, the issue is that we have
been rehearsing for months

264
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,917
for something... We don't
even know what it is.

265
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,017
And you're going to
keep working until...

266
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,083
Until we work as
a single organism.

267
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,383
I know, I've heard
you say that.

268
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,516
The thing is,
when you say that,

269
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,383
I think what you're referring
to is us, not you.

270
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:37,682
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

271
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,350
Okay? And then
I give them to you.

272
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,782
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

273
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,050
No, I'm not going anywhere.
But I'm...

274
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,249
I'm taking care
of myself.

275
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:44,949
Guys, can I just weigh
in here really quickly?

276
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:46,615
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

277
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,516
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

278
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,850
-I'm a new person...
-We are anything but a family.

279
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,817
Okay, well, my mother

280
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,949
literally knifed my father
in the neck one time.

281
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,982
So you are actually a little
bit like my family unit.

282
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,451
-Literally?
-But, yeah.

283
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,451
It was an accident,
I think.

284
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,551
Okay. So, does this mean we're
actually going to do something?

285
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,683
Yes.

286
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:11,083
You've all heard of Octa and
their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

287
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:13,783
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

288
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,084
You wanna know what all
this has been leading to?

289
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,183
Yeah.

290
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,750
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

291
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,718
Once these phones
hit the streets,

292
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,650
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

293
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:27,450
Meaning Octa's selling
privacy to up their profit.

294
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,451
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

295
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,550
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

296
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,417
Rehearsal's over, guys.

297
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,017
This is what we've
been waiting for.

298
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,583
Now it's time
to get to work.

299
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,883
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

300
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,650

<i>Our latest product,

305
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:00,886
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

306
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:03,618
Thank you, sir.

307
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,085
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

308
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:10,818
Sorry, we will take very
good care of it for you.

309
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,684
By the way.

310
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:15,484
Security memo
from Case himself.

311
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:18,918
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

312
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:20,919
We're all good. I'm heading
to the control room.

313
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,551
All right.
Thanks, Jack.

314
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,951
Atlas, go.

315
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,984
No, Dylan, I can't...

316
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,352
<i>What?
What's the problem?</i>

317
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,418
No, there's
too many people...

318
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,785
Atlas, I got Owen
landing now.

319
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,385
Okay, I'm going now.

320
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,984
Stop.

321
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,818
-Okay.
-Thanks.

322
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,918
Pascal, we need you
in the kitchen.

323
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:59,753
Look, the speech is
about freedom, okay?

324
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,553
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

325
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:02,986
Which part of that
do you not understand?

326
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,352
-For goodness sake!
-I know, I'm sorry.

327
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,786
Mr. Case.
John from legal.

328
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,586
Just need your
signature for release.

329
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,354
Thank you so much.

330
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,786
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

331
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:19,554
Hey there, buddy!
Smile!

332
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:20,735
Who are you?
What the hell?

333
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,885
Who am I?

334
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,820
It is picture day. Did Julie
not tell you it's picture day?

335
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,819
-Picture day? What are you...
-Company-wide policy.

336
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:26,903
Look, I got a job to do.

337
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:27,953
I have a job to do, too.

338
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,354
Hold on a second.
What is that?

339
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:30,653
I'm going to need
some backup here.

340
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,620
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

341
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:32,754
Security, my name is

342
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:34,387
-Bo Walsh, thank you.
-Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

343
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,786
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

344
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:36,854
Calm down, please.

345
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,487
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

346
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,986
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

347
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,386
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

348
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,986
-Who is this guy?
-I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

349
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,021
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

350
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,619
-"Mark D. Stooge."
-Hold on a second.

351
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,720
I've never seen
this before in my life.

352
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,787
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

353
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,387
-Come on, Mr. Stooge.
-Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

354
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,120
-Come on. Let's go.
-What's going on here?

355
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:54,987
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

356
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,454
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

357
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,088
Get off me! Look, I want
to make a phone call.

358
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:03,053
-I want to call my boss!
-Hey, hey! What's going on?

359
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,121
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

360
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,054
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

361
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,488
That's my right.

362
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,420
-What the hell?
-You're crazy. Let's go.

363
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,021
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

364
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,886
Where's my phone?

365
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,753
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

366
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:17,854
Okay.

367
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:20,521
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

368
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,555
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Owen Case.</i>

369
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:28,087
All right. Lula, show these
guys what you're made of.

370
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,889
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

371
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,354
What break? Who's Clark?

372
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:40,922
"Who's Clark?"
That's funny.

373
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,454
Imagine if I told Roger
that, he'd freak out.

374
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:45,454
-Don't do that!
-What?

375
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:46,788
Who the hell is Roger?

376
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,454
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

377
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,121
-I don't know who Lisa is.
-Are you kidding again?

378
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,754
-You don't know who Lisa is now?
-No, I don't. Just get away.

379
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:52,887
That is
a dangerous...

380
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:53,987
You're ruining the meat.

381
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,721
Don't make me
have to go to Brian!

382
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,355
-I don't know who Brian is!
-Why are you acting like this?

383
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,722
-I'll go straight to him.
-Give me that!

384
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:01,787
My God!

385
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,521
<i>What are you
doing to me?</i>

386
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,589
Help me!

387
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,622
Help her. Go!

388
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,556
Have some water.

389
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,389
I feel from your face you're
freaked by the flow of blood,

390
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,955
which is fully fixable
in a snap

391
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:20,621
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

392
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,923
as you're flowing
and floating,

393
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:25,923
which is why you're
focusing on my commands.

394
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,488
You got this far in life

395
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,055
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

396
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,023
This is that voice.

397
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,955
Look at the light.

398
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,889
Listen to
your own voice.

399
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,722
My God.

400
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,523
What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

401
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,122
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

402
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:56,722
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

403
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,489
I quit!

404
00:16:58,523 --> 00:16:59,524
Get another towel.

405
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,656
Thank you,
and goodbye.

406
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,656
God.

407
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,988
<i>Welcome everybody!</i>

408
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:11,956
<i>And now, the moment that
you've all been waiting for...</i>

409
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:14,123
Nice work, lady.

410
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:15,123
Thanks.

411
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,023
<i>Revolutionized music
with Octa 2.</i>

412
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:22,889
I'm actually nervous, and
I'm not even going onstage.

413
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:25,422
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

414
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:28,390
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

415
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,056
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

416
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,956
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

417
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,490
So, I don't know.

418
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:34,756
Do you want...
We should try it.

419
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,690
Not the right mood.

420
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,390
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

421
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,457
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

422
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,358
I mean, I admit, from the
neck up there are issues.

423
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,491
But from the neck down,
the David.

424
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,889
<i>Owen Case.</i>

425
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,390
Good morning,
Octa-lites.

426
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:53,957
Good morning,
Octa-lites.

427
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:56,724
Now, I've made the claim...

428
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:59,791
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

429
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,857
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

430
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:03,991
<i>You know, the truth is,</i>

431
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,458
<i>that's just one of
those things I say...</i>

432
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,058
when in fact
I mean something else.

433
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,957
<i>when in fact</i>

434
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,924
<i>I mean something else.</i>

435
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,958
What else do I mean?

436
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:18,358
<i>Well, here to fill
you in on some of my</i>

<i>fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

438
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:24,725
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

439
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,125
They are the world's...

440
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,492
<i>greatest magicians.</i>

441
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

442
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,558
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

443
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,658
<i>here are the Horsemen.</i>

444
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,492
<i>Hello, New York!</i>

445
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:52,124
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

446
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:53,991
<i>Hey, it's great to be back.</i>

447
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,426
<i>And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?</i>

448
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,426
-Feels good, right?
-Feels pretty good.

449
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,492
Pretty good.

450
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,691
<i>Thank you, thank you.
Okay.</i>

451
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:10,492
<i>We want to talk to you
about your privacy.</i>

452
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,624
<i>What does your privacy
mean to you?</i>

453
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:15,092
<i>Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.</i>

454
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,958
<i>No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.</i>

455
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,791
<i>You see, he's mocked
your privacy.</i>

456
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,692
<i>He's scorned it.</i>

457
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,125
<i>Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to</i>

458
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,560
<i>when you signed,
probably without reading</i>

459
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:29,694
<i>the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.</i>

460
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,392
Dylan, the FBI is here.

461
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,660
All right.
Don't worry about it.

462
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,694
All right,
go to plan C-4.

463
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,826
Lock the doors.

464
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,560
Hey, boss,
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,525
Don't.

466
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,860
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

467
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,526
These Horsemen
are tricky, okay?

468
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,727
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

469
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,860
Hey, sorry, don't mean to
gloat, but I told you so.

470
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:57,859
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

471
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,459
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

472
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,792
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

473
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,059
What are you
talking about?

474
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,193
You sent agents to Detroit
and Philadelphia.

475
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,927
You've been crying wolf so
we wouldn't send them here.

476
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,426
Boss, please.

477
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,059
Keep working
on the doors.

478
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:13,693
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

479
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,193
<i>Before we start
the show...</i>

480
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:19,059
<i>We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.</i>

481
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,126
<i>So, everything that he had
once considered private...</i>

482
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:26,827
<i>That he thinks
is really private...</i>

483
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,860
<i>Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...</i>

484
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:32,892
My.

485
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,027
<i>As the Horsemen
like to say,</i>

486
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:41,028
<i>magic is about
controlling perception.</i>

487
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,127
<i>You see them as champions
of the truth, but are they?</i>

488
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,094
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

489
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:49,461
What's going on, Rhodes?

490
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:50,794
This is crazy.

491
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:52,394
We got to get everyone
to the other entrance.

492
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:53,511
Let's go, to the back.

493
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:54,594
No. You stay here.

494
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:57,395
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

495
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:59,894
<i>Let's reveal
some of theirs.</i>

496
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,728
Danny, everyone,
get off the stage.

497
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
<i>Abort.</i>

498
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:05,428
Jack, go with them.

499
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,760
-I'll see you at the meet-up point.
-Let's go.

500
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:09,860
<i>Do you recall the death
of Jack Wilder?</i>

501
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:14,795
<i>What if I told you he's not just
alive, but he's actually right here.</i>

502
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,728
<i>And do you know
who else is here?</i>

503
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,362
<i>The FBI.</i>

504
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:27,562
<i>Let's let them in,
shall we?</i>

505
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,662
<i>And now,
for the big reveal.</i>

506
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:33,527
Go! Move!
To the stage.

507
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,561
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

508
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,494
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

509
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,028
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

510
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,430
-I knew it.
-What?

511
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:47,561
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

512
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:48,729
You think you're
looking at one thing,

513
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,428
-but you have no idea.
-Who are you?

514
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:51,961
The same man
I've always been.

515
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:53,995
Boys, I'm sorry.

516
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:04,495
You gotta
be kidding me.

517
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,529
We've gotta
get to the chute.

518
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:06,830
Move! Move!

519
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:08,096
Who are those guys?

520
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,528
Who cares? Come on!

521
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:10,762
-Hurry, hurry!
-Keep going!

522
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,429
How the hell
could this happen?

523
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,662
I thought Dylan had
everything under control.

524
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,495
Yeah.
Apparently he didn't.

525
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:16,963
Maybe you're
the leak, Dan.

526
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:18,596
Where you been
sneaking off to?

527
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,062
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

528
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:21,662
I'm not insinuating.
That's your...

529
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,629
Let's get to the truck,
come on!

530
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,096
-Stay together!
-Move! Move!

531
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:26,929
Lula, come on!

532
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,895
Coming!

533
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:41,096
<i>Sleep. Sleep.
Sleep. Sleep.</i>

534
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,097
What the hell
is going on?

535
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,464
Wasn't there supposed
to be a truck?

536
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,629
Where the hell are we?

537
00:22:57,797 --> 00:22:58,996
Come on!

538
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,963
Hey, hey! Wait,
did you mis-run the tube?

539
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,764
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

540
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,429
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

541
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:05,597
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

542
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:06,863
Were we above a Chinese
restaurant? Give me that!

543
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:08,763
-I'm moving! Relax!
-There's something very wrong.

544
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,564
Okay.
Why are we here?

545
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:16,630
Why am I
frickin' starving?

546
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,797
Yeah,
I'm weirdly starving, too.

547
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:21,030
This makes no sense.

548
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,398
Okay, sorry.

549
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:50,497
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

550
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,832
but apparently we're now
surrounded by Chinese food.

551
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,997
Right?

552
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,431
Guys...

553
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:58,565
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

554
00:23:58,597 --> 00:23:59,798
It's just called

555
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:01,664
"food."

556
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,631
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

557
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,064
I believe in your particular
parlance, the word is

558
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,465
"magic."

559
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,997
That guy looks
exactly like you.

560
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,064
He looks exactly like you. Are
you seeing this right now?

561
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,398
Chase.

562
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:24,665
Must confess,

563
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,499
it's like what I heard about
meeting the Rolling Stones.

564
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,431
They're a lot
shorter in person.

565
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:32,398
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

566
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,732
This is
my twin brother, Chase.

567
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,499
Wait,
did you do this?

568
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:41,698
As you can see,

569
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,632
my boss don't mess around.

570
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,432
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

571
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,565
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

572
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,632
You jumped off a rooftop in New
York and you landed in Macau.

573
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:56,732
AKA the Vegas of China.

574
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,632
And presto-changeo.

575
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,832
Don't you just love it?

576
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,965
The "greatest magicians
in the world"

577
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:04,598
are the object of someone
else's magic trick?

578
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,766
Isn't that poetic?

579
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,433
No?
You know what,

580
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,532
I'm not gonna let you
guys yuck my yum.

581
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:14,932
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu.
Whatever.

582
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,500
And you know
what they say,

583
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,033
"What happens in Macau..."

584
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,666
Well, I don't know
the rest of it,

585
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:24,499
'cause it's
in Chinese...

586
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:26,099
Hey, thanks, guys!

587
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:48,033
<i>Reports are coming in
that the infamous Horsemen</i>

588
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:50,367
<i>hijacked the Octa
product launch today.</i>

589
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,001
<i>The trick was
on them, however,</i>

590
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,466
<i>as we learned of the miraculous
resurrection of Jack Wilder.</i>

591
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:58,600
<i>And the stunning revelation
that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes</i>

592
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,999
<i>has been working as a mole
within the Bureau.</i>

593
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,568
<i>Questions abound today</i>

594
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,733
<i>as an international
manhunt is underway</i>

595
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:08,368
<i>for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive
and criminal band of illusionists.</i>

596
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,000
Hey, seriously,
where are you guys?

597
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,467
I'm at the meetup. I've
been leaving you messages.

598
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,534
I haven't heard
from anyone.

599
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,433
Please, call me!

600
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:17,501
<i>And the stock market saw</i>

601
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,467
<i>big gains and modest
losses on Thursday.</i>

602
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,500
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

603
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,067
<i>Right where you left me.
18 months ago,</i>

604
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,801
Agent Rhodes.

605
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,034
Thaddeus?

606
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:31,000
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

607
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:34,968
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

608
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,334
How does it feel to be out of
control, perhaps for the first time?

609
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:41,800
What do you want?

610
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,935
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

611
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,834
Where are they?

612
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:47,935
I'm not telling
you on the phone!

613
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,435
Where are they?

614
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:53,135
And if you're wondering if I was
behind the Horsemen's recent debacle,

615
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,967
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Hey, I burned you once,
I'll burn you again.

617
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,034
I'm not playing,
Thaddeus.

618
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:00,868
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

619
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,501
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

620
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:05,135
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

621
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:07,102
Next one is yours.

622
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:11,836
<i>No!</i>

623
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:14,335
Let go!

624
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:17,736
Dad! Help me! Dad!

625
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:22,036
<i>Dad!</i>

626
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:40,669
<i>It's all about
blind spots.</i>

627
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,001
<i>When you're staring
straight at something,</i>

628
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,570
<i>and not see it. Why?</i>

629
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,968
Blind spots.

630
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:49,801
We learned that together.
Didn't we, bro?

631
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,136
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

632
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,535
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

633
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:06,570
Cool.

634
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,837
And then, one day,
we were 12

635
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,104
and Virginia von Welsheim

636
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:16,436
had a very nice party
down the street.

637
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:19,103
I had a little tum-tum,
couldn't go.

638
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:23,769
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and
got a taste of the solo thing,

639
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,403
and kicked me
to the curb.

640
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:28,770
God.

641
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:31,802
Chase, you win!
I concede.

642
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,036
Just tell me
how you did it.

643
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:38,903
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

644
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:40,738
Za?

645
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,770
Pizza?

646
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,637
Is this apartment
d3375?

647
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:47,670
Not even close.

648
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,371
Sleep!

649
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:55,104
Relaxing, floating,

650
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:57,471
drifting, dreaming...

651
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,803
Falling.

652
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,071
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

653
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:06,071
is he downloaded all
your private information,

654
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:09,503
and my employer
had all he needed.

655
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:10,837
Thanks.

656
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:13,771
How did you know
how to find him?

657
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,355
That's a very
good question, Atlas.

658
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,905
Okay.

659
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,937
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

660
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,071
Been fun playing this
cat-and-mouse with you, broski.

661
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,038
Meow.

662
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:51,538
Have fun at the Sands.

663
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:56,905
I am so, so, so sorry.

664
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,038
Yeah, you should be.

665
00:29:58,071 --> 00:30:01,038
Don't ever accuse me of
betraying us again, okay?

666
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:16,372
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

667
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,771
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

668
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:22,573
And at the exact
right moment,

669
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:24,805
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

670
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,772
"Yes! Thank God
you're here!

671
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:29,372
"Thank God! Just in
the nick of time, Eye!"

672
00:30:29,405 --> 00:30:31,038
And then we'll
just celebrate,

673
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:33,406
and it was all
worth it in the end?

674
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,639
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

675
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,639
It's cool.

676
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:58,907
Ta-da!

677
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,706
So happy to be
working with you.

678
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,473
Please, come in. Come in.

679
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:08,639
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

680
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,972
Well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

681
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:13,905
is working
with that rabbit.

682
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,406
We'll be working
together. Yes.

683
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,440
Allow me
to introduce myself.

684
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:20,507
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

685
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,073
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

686
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,072
Fake your death, the world
puts its guard down.

687
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,139
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

688
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:28,439
including my old partner,
Owen's,

689
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,974
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

690
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:33,507
And that violates
how many SEC laws?

691
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,807
I believe it
breaks all of them.

692
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,374
All of them.

693
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:39,073
You see,
you all want an audience.

694
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,374
Need one, desperately.

695
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,674
It's quite sad, really.

696
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:44,806
Hence, my ability
to nab you.

697
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,741
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

698
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,375
I just want to be, and I am

699
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,074
100% off the grid.

700
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:53,608
You know why?

701
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:56,040
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

702
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:58,608
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

703
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:01,774
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

704
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:04,041
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

705
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:06,040
-Follow me.
-Yeah.

706
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:07,906
-Follow me.
-Okay. All right.

707
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:10,407
You pulled a hat out of a
rabbit. That was very colorful.

708
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,074
Almost eight and
a half years ago.

709
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:13,908
So, no need
to bring that up.

710
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:16,641
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

711
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:18,807
Can we, Magicolio?

712
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,374
Magicolio,
that was 15 years ago.

713
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,075
Don't get me wrong,
I love magic.

714
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,807
Like you, and many others who, I suppose,
were not getting any sex in high school,

715
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,708
I dabbled with it.

716
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:30,875
But, unlike you, I was
able to transition upward

717
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,007
towards actual magic.

718
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,674
Science, you may
have heard it called.

719
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,008
So,

720
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,042
would you like to know, my
friends, just how I got you here?

721
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:43,475
We know how you did it.

722
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,508
No, you don't.

723
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:45,508
Yeah,

724
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,476
you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

725
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,708
Stop. No.
Seriously, stop.

726
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,408
The strobe was a combo of
binaural beats, as well as...

727
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,743
I said stop!

728
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:57,509
You might not be
having fun, but I am.

729
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,543
You have an unusual
way of showing it.

730
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:01,075
So...

731
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:02,909
How did I do it?

732
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,142
Easy.

733
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:08,141
You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

734
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:09,776
In your heightened
state of agitation,

735
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:12,142
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

736
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:14,743
<i>And your minds
filled in the rest.</i>

737
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,642
<i>But the tube you meant to go
down was 20 feet to your right.</i>

738
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,743
Go on, sit down. There's no
one standing in your way.

739
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:20,843
Don't mind if I do.

740
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:25,376
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

741
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,376
<i>Blah, blah, blah,
the strobe contained</i>

742
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,110
<i>UV letters pulsing
the word "sleep."</i>

743
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:35,042
<i>And that, combined with the sound, put
you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

744
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:37,908
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

745
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,676
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

746
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,909
And I can assure you,

747
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:43,043
you don't know
what happened.

748
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:48,910
That's really creepy.

749
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:50,776
Really, really creepy.

750
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,876
That's not cool.

751
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,543
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

752
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,377
if you put your mind to it.

753
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:01,409
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

754
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:04,043
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

755
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,943
Well, to start with, the man
you stole from last year,

756
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:08,410
turns out I had invested

757
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:09,809
quite a lot of money
in some of his companies,

758
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:13,044
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

759
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,909
Good news is, it's very easy
for you to pay me back.

760
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:18,776
I just need your skills.

761
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,676
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

762
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,810
Elfin?

763
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,144
Geniuses.

764
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:25,910
Pretty sure the Beatles
were geniuses.

765
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:27,411
And like them,
we had a dream.

766
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:32,876
Could we create actual,
genuine magic?

767
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,377
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

768
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,543
That is what he
would like you to think.

769
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,610
My vision

770
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:44,744
was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

771
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:47,044
But Owen wanted it for
himself so he humiliated me

772
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:50,477
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

773
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,877
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

774
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:54,045
Did you take a picture of
him while he was sleeping?

775
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,610
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

776
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:56,911
and now he goes around

777
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,811
taking credit for a chip that's
not just the key to one computer,

778
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,911
but every computer
system on the planet.

779
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:06,044
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

780
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:08,910
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

781
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,777
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

782
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,512
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

783
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:13,911
So he gets the money?

784
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:16,144
And the pleasure? No.

785
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:17,411
No, no, no. Besides,

786
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,645
why would I buy it when I could
have you steal it for me?

787
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:23,479
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

788
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:24,978
which will
include your targets,

789
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,645
a crew lead by
a South African gangster.

790
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:27,911
South African gangster.

791
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:29,879
Yes. How your team gets past
security, that's up to you.

792
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:32,878
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

793
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:33,845
That's it?

794
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:36,012
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

795
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,778
You're magicians and thieves.

796
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,946
What makes you think we would
even consider doing this?

797
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:43,478
Wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Yes.

798
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,012
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

799
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:48,478
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

800
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:51,678
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

801
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,046
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

802
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,146
You know what?

803
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,812
I'm not stealing
a thing for you.

804
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,645
Not unless Dylan
tells me it's okay.

805
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:03,811
Really? Dylan is
where, exactly?

806
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:04,911
It doesn't matter.

807
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,978
Yeah, I'm with him. So you
can go ahead and kill us

808
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,011
because I'm not gonna steal
anything for you either.

809
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,747
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

810
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,413
and we're calling
your bluff.

811
00:36:15,978 --> 00:36:17,012
Actually,
we'll do it.

812
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:18,045
What?

813
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:20,912
We're in Macau. The oldest magic
store in the world is here.

814
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,412
We'll get the supplies we
need, and we'll do it.

815
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:26,880
Thank you.

816
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,111
It should be fun.

817
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,547
Chase will take you to the
magic shop in the morning.

818
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:37,646
<i>Badge.</i>

819
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:42,580
Really?

820
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,013
Thanks.

821
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:47,046
Agent Cowan.

822
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:50,645
Your ID.

823
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,013
Yeah. Thanks.

824
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,680
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

825
00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:01,513
Yeah? Tell him
recess is over.

826
00:37:09,414 --> 00:37:10,414
What?

827
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,680
All right,
so I made my move.

828
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,081
Where are they? I don't
have time for bullshit.

829
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,747
I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

830
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,514
And I didn't get to
finish my lobster,

831
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,013
which makes me very grumpy.

832
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,948
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

833
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:44,382
You can dispense with the
tough guy act to begin with.

834
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,814
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

835
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:51,648
I said,
what do you want?

836
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,980
You used
a form 219 warrant

837
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,213
to search my room.

838
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,947
You found a connection between
me and the Four Horsemen.

839
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,080
Which means

840
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,682
you can take me out of
here on a 24-hour leave.

841
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,949
You want me
to break you out?

842
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:07,682
I want you
to take me out.

843
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:09,949
All you need is
an extradition order,

844
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:11,882
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

845
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:14,915
Dylan,

846
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:19,082
I had nothing to do with the
Horsemen's disappearance.

847
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,781
You were lured
into a trap.

848
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:24,848
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

849
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,048
you're beginning
to realize

850
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:29,715
that the only way out

851
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:31,082
is through.

852
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:33,682
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

853
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,515
You got this place wired.

854
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,682
You don't need me
to get out of here.

855
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,716
This is all about payback.

856
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:43,048
I believe in
an eye for an eye.

857
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:44,649
So you're out
to destroy me?

858
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:45,715
Absolutely.

859
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:47,116
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

860
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:48,915
I know you will.

861
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:50,982
Because no matter
how hard you try

862
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:52,982
to find a culprit
behind all this,

863
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:55,549
you're going to blame
only yourself.

864
00:38:55,581 --> 00:39:00,117
When your little vendetta ended with
you putting me in jail 18 months ago,

865
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,950
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

866
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:06,050
And that's where you lost.

867
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,783
So,

868
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,749
you can save yourself,

869
00:39:14,548 --> 00:39:16,782
or you can make
a deal with me,

870
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:18,950
and save the Four Horsemen,

871
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,416
and stop wasting
both of our time.

872
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:26,949
<i>Steal something</i>

873
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:29,916
for this narcissistic little
man boy? I don't like it.

874
00:39:29,948 --> 00:39:31,882
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

875
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,783
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

876
00:39:34,816 --> 00:39:36,684
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

877
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:38,517
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

878
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,784
But we can fix that.

879
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:41,049
-We can fix it?
-Yeah.

880
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,683
So you're officially
part of the team now?

881
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,584
-Excuse me?
-I'm sure this is what Dylan

882
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:46,716
Meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

883
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:49,983
Yeah, that is a fairytale that
Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

884
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,783
Look, even if we get this
stick, he'll never let us go.

885
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:55,118
We can't trust Walter, okay?

886
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,916
The Eye has
a history in Macau.

887
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:57,983
They're the only
ones we can trust.

888
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,917
Now, if we can
get it to them,

889
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,384
they can clear our names and
get us the hell out of here.

890
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,851
It's a bad plan, man.

891
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:12,017
Hey.

892
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:14,450
Hi, how are you?

893
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:16,517
We need some
things custom-made.

894
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,051
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

895
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:19,817
And...

896
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,517
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

897
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:31,417
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

898
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,685
-What?
-Got you.

899
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:33,752
-Okay.
-Look.

900
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,550
Where'd it go?

901
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:41,085
And now it's
by my head. How fun.

902
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:42,818
-$20.
-$20?

903
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,784
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

904
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,934
$10.

905
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:47,051
No.

906
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:48,152
-Two for one.
-No.

907
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:50,052
Okay, all right. Just
give us the thumbs. Yeah?

908
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:52,518
Okay. Thanks a lot,
Jack. Please take these.

909
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,118
So, we need
a Keplinger holdout,

910
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:58,517
and we also need roughing
fluid, a Sanada gimmick,

911
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:01,386
sleeves, tracks. This is all in
plastic, though, if you can.

912
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:06,818
What?

913
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,285
Is there a problem?

914
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,818
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

915
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:16,119
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

916
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:19,819
We're going through a very
sensitive metal detector, okay?

917
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,718
So plastic, nothing.
Metal...

918
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:25,953
It detects.

919
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,086
What did she say?

920
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,785
She said just because you're talking
slowly and moving your hands

921
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,819
doesn't mean she can
suddenly understand English.

922
00:41:37,852 --> 00:41:38,885
Yeah.

923
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:40,685
So sorry. He's racist.

924
00:41:40,718 --> 00:41:41,853
Hey, bro.

925
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:44,919
Listen, I know that the
only thing that we agree on

926
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:48,819
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

927
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:51,952
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

928
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:53,586
and go get
a little drinkey-poo?

929
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:55,052
If it's free, it's me.

930
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:56,519
Great.

931
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:58,919
Guys, we'll be right back.

932
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:02,720
Okay, kiddies, the
chaperones are watching you.

933
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,952
Don't do anything
I wouldn't enjoy.

934
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:08,052
Okay.
Have fun, you two.

935
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:11,985
Hey.

936
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,920
Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

937
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:16,086
Sure.

938
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,820
-On the house.
-Thanks.

939
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:20,452
Who are you calling?

940
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:22,087
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

941
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,954
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

942
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:25,419
You've been doing it
on your own?

943
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:26,587
Maybe.

944
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,987
God. Dylan's not
gonna like this.

945
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,586
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes.

946
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,519
Okay?
I'm doing this for us.

947
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:37,053
What is wrong
with this thing?

948
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,421
Hey, relax,
it's just a kid's toy.

949
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:39,787
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

950
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,087
Okay. Let me just...

951
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,687
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

952
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:48,053
Hey, can you get this?

953
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:54,688
It's like birth,
you know.

954
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:56,886
One person
enters the hospital,

955
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,153
two people come out.

956
00:42:58,186 --> 00:42:59,754
Walk and talk.

957
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,053
I'll tell you
on the plane.

958
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:04,387
What plane?

959
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:07,421
My sources tell me your
Horsemen are in Macau.

960
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:09,153
What's the look?

961
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,487
It's none of your business.

962
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,687
Who are your sources?

963
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,454
Just some old friends.

964
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:26,389
When we have the card,
where do I go?

965
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:28,788
And 0 for 52.

966
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:31,821
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

967
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,754
Then what about girls?

968
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:37,655
Like, relationships?

969
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:38,822
What?

970
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:46,388
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

971
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,954
but every girl
I get close to,

972
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:52,489
I end up
taking their trust.

973
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:54,922
And then their wallet.

974
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:56,689
So...

975
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,654
You take their wallets?

976
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:01,689
Yeah.

977
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:05,988
You ever take
their belts?

978
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:08,689
Or how about

979
00:44:08,722 --> 00:44:11,922
some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

980
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:14,921
Not sure why
you took those.

981
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:18,055
I'm sorry, did you think that
I was like those other girls?

982
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:21,522
Jack.

983
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:29,489
Okay. So there's a
marketplace down the street.

984
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:31,656
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

985
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:34,490
He'll get the stick to the
right people and get us home.

986
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:36,523
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

987
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:38,389
And, hey,
put your belt on.

988
00:44:38,423 --> 00:44:42,089
No, it's not...
She took it off me and...

989
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:45,055
You know, the most heartbreaking
moment of my life

990
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:47,389
was when I discovered

991
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,890
that you had stolen
all my money and split.

992
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:52,057
I didn't realize until now

993
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,655
how much of that money
you put into your face.

994
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:59,389
Seriously, is it weird to have more
hair in your nose than on your head?

995
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:01,922
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

996
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:04,723
you might wanna
consider requesting

997
00:45:04,756 --> 00:45:07,655
something other
than old man pubes.

998
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:11,757
You know what? You are
such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

999
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,757
And this little ploy
you have

1000
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,923
of stalling me while your
friends screw over my employer?

1001
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:19,657
Not gonna work.

1002
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:23,757
Chase! As you stare
into my eyes,

1003
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,157
you will find
that you wanna sleep.

1004
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:28,691
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

1005
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:32,124
and realize that you will never
be half the man that he is.

1006
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,391
Merritt,

1007
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:40,824
I am so, so
very, very sorry

1008
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:43,656
about how pathetic
your pupil is.

1009
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:46,890
Hey, a little hint on your
technique of surprise.

1010
00:45:46,923 --> 00:45:50,657
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

1011
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,024
Hey, this has been fun,
Mer-Bear.

1012
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:56,058
Let's do it again
sometime.

1013
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:01,058
Well,

1014
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,623
I've had ample time to do
some research, and you know,

1015
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:05,557
I was wrong.

1016
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:09,425
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

1017
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,890
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

1018
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:12,924
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

1019
00:46:12,957 --> 00:46:16,492
that this road would lead to the
great wizard behind the curtain

1020
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,991
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

1021
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,057
That ain't gonna happen.

1022
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,925
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

1023
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:23,425
Listen to me.
I broke you out of there.

1024
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,692
We're not
changing the terms now.

1025
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:25,925
-You put me there!
-Yeah,

1026
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:27,524
Because you deserve
to be there.

1027
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:30,125
Listen, I did not
kill your father.

1028
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:31,225
What?

1029
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:34,058
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

1030
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,524
I know who you are,

1031
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:37,725
Shrike.

1032
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:41,058
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

1033
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:45,091
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

1034
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,524
I know the time in
jail was a result

1035
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,691
of a 30-year revenge plot
against me.

1036
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:52,393
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

1037
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:53,560
Man.

1038
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:56,493
30 years.

1039
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:58,092
30 years,

1040
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:02,692
and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

1041
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:05,058
Just to put me
behind bars.

1042
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:06,426
Okay.

1043
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:09,958
So how did it feel,
seeing me there?

1044
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,792
Was it all you hoped?

1045
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:13,992
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1046
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:15,126
You're lying.

1047
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:18,526
It was an empty experience.

1048
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,592
And you wanna know
how I know?

1049
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:24,493
I know because you know.

1050
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,926
There's always, always more

1051
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:30,759
-than what's on the surface.
-So what,

1052
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,392
The past didn't happen, and
you're not who I think you are?

1053
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:33,993
Now, don't tell me
in 30 years

1054
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:36,827
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

1055
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,025
I am not my father.

1056
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,860
You're not getting
in my head, okay?

1057
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:43,526
You think you're luring me
into a trap? You're not.

1058
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:46,092
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

1059
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:49,725
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

1060
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,526
And you're gonna lead me
to them. And if you don't,

1061
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,526
I promise you, you're
gonna end up far worse

1062
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,093
than in some cushy
jail cell somewhere.

1063
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:14,127
What if the Horsemen don't
actually need you to save them?

1064
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,427
All right. So the lab is made
up of two distinct layers,

1065
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:22,727
the security perimeter

1066
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:24,726
and the clean room.

1067
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,793
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

1068
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:28,826
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

1069
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,727
and replace it with a decoy.

1070
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,894
Now, we're about
to get to the chip.

1071
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:33,193
This is the thing about
the chip, it's very thin.

1072
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:36,694
Luckily, it's similar in weight
and size to a playing card,

1073
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,628
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

1074
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,427
That's no good.

1075
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:59,061
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

1076
00:48:59,093 --> 00:49:00,927
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

1077
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:02,895
<i>He's RSVP'd with
what looks like</i>

1078
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:04,794
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

1079
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:07,827
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

1080
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,594
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels with
a different bimbo every week.</i>

1081
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:13,628
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

1082
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,762
Hey, can I get in?

1083
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,027
At the soothing
sound of the slots

1084
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:31,563
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

1085
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,561
<i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

1086
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:37,396
<i>they will think you're Hannes, so
lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

1087
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:39,595
You trust your
people implicitly.

1088
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:41,661
You will have them
take care of everything,

1089
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,062
and you will wait
in the car.

1090
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:46,796
And eyes open,
wide awake. Go.

1091
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,696
Excuse me. These people
are following me.

1092
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:49,928
You might wanna
check their pockets.

1093
00:49:53,962 --> 00:49:55,728
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

1094
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:57,130
<i>and get the card
to the market,</i>

1095
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,595
<i>where I'll hand it off
to the Eye,</i>

1096
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,563
<i>so we can all
get the hell home.</i>

1097
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:20,829
Hannes, my old friend.

1098
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:22,530
So glad
you could make it.

1099
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,663
I knew you had a soft spot for
an old-school bidding war.

1100
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:26,796
How have you been?

1101
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:28,929
I trust my people
implicitly.

1102
00:50:28,961 --> 00:50:30,129
What they say goes.

1103
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:33,696
Certainly. But I'm sure you'd
like to see it for yourself.

1104
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:36,496
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1105
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:41,529
Or not. Also fine.

1106
00:50:41,563 --> 00:50:43,564
Well, if you'd like
to follow me.

1107
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:49,597
You'll have to
remove all your metal.

1108
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,830
Watches, rings, etc.

1109
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,064
Yeah, of course.

1110
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,930
Excuse me for asking...

1111
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,830
Where might I
have seen you before?

1112
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,597
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1113
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:00,796
The book jacket!

1114
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:02,464
I have to say,
Dr. Michaelakis,

1115
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:03,697
I'm a huge fan.

1116
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,663
Thank you so much.

1117
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:09,131
Which book?
There have been so many.

1118
00:51:09,163 --> 00:51:11,963
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1119
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,831
Doctor?

1120
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,430
Sorry, when you say "chippy," you
are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1121
00:51:21,463 --> 00:51:22,598
Of course.

1122
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:26,663
Hannes prefers
the term "floozy"

1123
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:28,930
for all his boy toys.

1124
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:30,480
Yeah. He does.
That's good.

1125
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:31,997
Noted.

1126
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:34,097
By the way, I got your
email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1127
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,730
You had a query
about our ability

1128
00:51:35,764 --> 00:51:37,865
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1129
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:39,798
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators,

1130
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:42,531
or error correction.

1131
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:44,131
Do you care
to elucidate?

1132
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:45,664
-Right.
-Yeah.

1133
00:51:45,696 --> 00:51:47,663
Yes, I did send that email.

1134
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:49,464
-The other day, I saw you.
-I did, I sent it.

1135
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:50,698
So what gives?

1136
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:52,132
I'm sorry, what gives...

1137
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:53,798
I think what
she's trying to say...

1138
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:55,831
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1139
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,131
Okay.

1140
00:51:57,165 --> 00:51:58,564
If you'll hold on to that.

1141
00:51:58,597 --> 00:52:00,398
-Yeah, sure, Doctor.
-Thank you.

1142
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:02,831
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1143
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:04,965
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1144
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,930
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder."

1145
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:08,731
Disorder!

1146
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:12,565
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1147
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:22,432
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1148
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:25,532
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1149
00:52:25,565 --> 00:52:28,466
So that is,
in fact, what gives.

1150
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:34,532
Thank you.

1151
00:52:40,964 --> 00:52:45,066
You know, Buffy is not
a bad name for you.

1152
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:48,799
You know,
buff, firm, taut.

1153
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,700
That's good. Did you just
find a thesaurus somewhere?

1154
00:52:50,732 --> 00:52:51,999
Nubile.

1155
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:53,733
That's good.
Thank you. Okay.

1156
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:55,133
There we go.

1157
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:07,132
Sorry, sorry.

1158
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,600
The stick's metal. How are
we going to get it out?

1159
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:17,800
Yeah. I don't know.

1160
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,833
This is the housing.

1161
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:24,834
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1162
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,401
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1163
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:34,933
is the processor,

1164
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:37,966
which we playfully refer to
as the Magic Broomstick.

1165
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:39,067
The Broomstick?

1166
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,533
Has the power to
clear the contents

1167
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:42,866
of any computing
system on the planet

1168
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,666
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1169
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,401
Broomstick.
That's funny.

1170
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,066
Take a look,
vet it however you'd like,

1171
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,601
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1172
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:54,834
Thank you.

1173
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,666
My God. I must be allergic
to something in here.

1174
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:01,433
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1175
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:02,468
This room is
hermetically sealed.

1176
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,834
That's it.

1177
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,934
I'm allergic to
hermetic seals.

1178
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,667
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1179
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:10,068
That's the one thing.

1180
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,433
Just until
he's recovered.

1181
00:54:11,466 --> 00:54:12,900
We're gonna need
some anti-bacterial...

1182
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:15,867
Do we have
alcohol wipes?

1183
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,402
Your hands need to be sterile if
you intend to get any closer.

1184
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,568
Do I make myself clear?

1185
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,700
Sorry. We couldn't...

1186
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:25,000
No, I'm fine.

1187
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:26,434
Take his medicine
into the country.

1188
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:27,602
Yeah.

1189
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,535
Can't risk
any contamination.

1190
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:36,135
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1191
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,667
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1192
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,434
-All right. If you're done...
-Here you go.

1193
00:54:39,468 --> 00:54:41,067
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1194
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,134
-This happens to him sometimes. It'll pass.
-Allergies.

1195
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:45,434
Allergies.
Nothing you can do.

1196
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,402
Well, something
you could do, Doctor.

1197
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,501
Okay?

1198
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:16,569
Search him, please.

1199
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:17,969
Didn't we
just do that?

1200
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,101
Are you serious?

1201
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:20,934
Okay. I wanna run full
diagnostics on the system.

1202
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:25,136
This is completely
unnecessary.

1203
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:55,935
Up, up.

1204
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,070
Okay.

1205
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:19,738
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1206
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:31,603
Sorry.

1207
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,536
Hey!

1208
00:56:50,569 --> 00:56:52,536
I can do that myself.

1209
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:54,803
We just met, man.

1210
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:56,104
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1211
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:09,504
Hey!

1212
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:13,070
My eyes are up here, man.

1213
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:14,604
How do you like it?

1214
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:38,105
Hey, I'm good.

1215
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:40,839
Turn around.

1216
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:00,406
Do you have anything?

1217
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:01,971
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1218
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:04,706
I'm good.

1219
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:05,806
They're clean.

1220
00:58:07,137 --> 00:58:09,104
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1221
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,605
We're walking
this way again. Yay.

1222
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:20,705
I don't speak
the language.

1223
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,538
See?

1224
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,439
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1225
00:58:31,473 --> 00:58:33,872
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1226
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,439
Something about
a big white dance floor,

1227
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:53,672
makes me wanna boogie.

1228
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:55,073
Hey, thanks for having us.

1229
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,507
That's great stuff.

1230
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:05,640
Okay.

1231
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:08,407
You guys are pretty serious
about your security?

1232
00:59:11,772 --> 00:59:13,473
Okay.

1233
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:15,940
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in

1234
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:17,606
with more stuff. Did I
come in with more stuff?

1235
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:20,806
You don't think so?

1236
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:26,672
Sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1237
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:29,441
Remember, I, gave it
to you when I came in?

1238
00:59:29,474 --> 00:59:31,608
It would be nice
to leave with it.

1239
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,441
Wallet coming through.

1240
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:46,774
Sorry, my belt.

1241
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,075
I guess that's
everything, right?

1242
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:57,408
Thank you.

1243
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,641
That is not a toy,
Buffy.

1244
00:59:58,642 --> 00:59:59,841
Sorry.

1245
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:06,708
Go, go, go!

1246
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,075
All right. Now,
drop me off at the market

1247
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:16,775
so I can get this
to the Eye.

1248
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:20,442
You asked me to call you when they started
running around like headless chickens.

1249
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:22,774
Well, that's
what's happening.

1250
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:40,075
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1251
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:43,975
No, this is where my sources
said we might find an answer.

1252
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,942
She must be familiar
with your work.

1253
01:00:56,975 --> 01:00:58,574
Excuse me.

1254
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:00,875
Miss, have you seen
these people?

1255
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:14,808
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1256
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:15,976
He's in the back.

1257
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:17,941
What?

1258
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,908
No"
you speak Mandarin"?

1259
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,709
The Coffin
to the Beyond.

1260
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:57,544
It was always a flap,

1261
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:59,710
or a trap or mirrors.

1262
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:03,711
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1263
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:08,378
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1264
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:24,710
I believe that's the prototype for
the one your father had made.

1265
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:25,944
He, like many others
over the years,

1266
01:02:25,977 --> 01:02:27,144
ordered his supplies
from here.

1267
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,977
Of course.

1268
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,844
That's why
you gave me the look

1269
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,777
when I said
they were in Macau.

1270
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:37,944
Your father used to come
here when you were young.

1271
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:39,810
Can I please get
some space here?

1272
01:02:45,144 --> 01:02:47,744
You think you're the only one
who'd wondered for 30 years

1273
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:49,544
what happened?

1274
01:02:49,577 --> 01:02:51,144
You're not.

1275
01:02:51,178 --> 01:02:53,678
Lionel was
a master magician.

1276
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,111
Either he gamed the hinges,

1277
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:58,811
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1278
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:01,412
or he had access to the
lock from the inside

1279
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:02,712
so he could pick it.

1280
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:04,411
Word is

1281
01:03:04,444 --> 01:03:07,544
the safe was made from
cheap metal, and it bowed.

1282
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:13,078
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1283
01:03:13,112 --> 01:03:17,146
Unless he'd reached the
limit of his capabilities

1284
01:03:17,178 --> 01:03:19,878
and his clock ran out.

1285
01:03:24,578 --> 01:03:26,411
Excuse me.

1286
01:03:26,444 --> 01:03:28,711
My grandmother has
something you might want.

1287
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,078
This was your father's.

1288
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,479
He had several
of these made.

1289
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:57,780
And the Horsemen?

1290
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:01,545
I overheard
them talking.

1291
01:04:01,578 --> 01:04:04,478
One of them, Atlas,
he's meeting someone

1292
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:05,947
at the market nearby.

1293
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:24,880
As for
former Agent Rhodes,

1294
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:27,612
his location is now
your number one priority.

1295
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:29,812
We're putting out
an international APB.

1296
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:30,779
We have Interpol,

1297
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:32,146
including cooperation
from local authorities.

1298
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:33,945
Agent Cowan.

1299
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:35,812
I'm assuming it was
actually not you

1300
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:37,613
who walked into
Newburgh Federal Prison,

1301
01:04:37,647 --> 01:04:40,613
then walked out 30 minutes
later with Thaddeus Bradley?

1302
01:04:40,647 --> 01:04:42,581
-What?
-He used your ID.

1303
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:48,646
What are you doing,
Rhodes?

1304
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:17,030
Atlas, hey.

1305
01:05:17,031 --> 01:05:18,080
Dylan.

1306
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,747
-I blew it, I'm sorry.
-What are you doing here?

1307
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:20,980
I'm here to help now.

1308
01:05:21,014 --> 01:05:22,515
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1309
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:23,814
I know I messed up,
all right?

1310
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:25,415
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1311
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:26,632
Where is everybody?

1312
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:27,814
Where is everybody?

1313
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:29,547
I can't be seen with you
actually, right now.

1314
01:05:29,581 --> 01:05:31,148
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1315
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,481
the time to take control
for a little while.

1316
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:33,680
Hey, I'm actually...
Yeah?

1317
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:35,415
Yeah, but I got it now,
all right? Yeah.

1318
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:37,080
You do? You look like you
can get some rest, buddy.

1319
01:05:37,114 --> 01:05:38,615
Who you meeting here?

1320
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:40,015
I'm not meeting anybody.

1321
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:41,647
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1322
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,648
At long's?

1323
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,447
Okay, yeah,
no, I am...

1324
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,947
I'm meeting somebody
from the Eye.

1325
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:50,014
Yeah, no, they agreed
to meet me

1326
01:05:50,048 --> 01:05:53,448
to exchange this computer
chip for our lives back.

1327
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:54,615
So that's what
it's come to now.

1328
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:56,614
I hope you're happy with the
situation you've put us in.

1329
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,082
You're talking
to the Eye?

1330
01:05:58,115 --> 01:05:59,415
Yeah.

1331
01:05:59,448 --> 01:06:01,115
Why are you talking
to the Eye?

1332
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:03,681
Atlas.

1333
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:05,081
Atlas,
give me the stick.

1334
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:07,614
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1335
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:08,948
You're not our hero.

1336
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:10,416
You're not FBI.

1337
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:11,747
You're not
a magician.

1338
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,416
You're not
really anything.

1339
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:16,082
And we trusted you
for a year.

1340
01:06:16,115 --> 01:06:18,749
So if you really
wanna help us...

1341
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:21,482
If you really wanna help
us, you would leave.

1342
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:31,949
I get it. Cool.

1343
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:32,983
Bye.

1344
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:51,782
Hello, hello!

1345
01:06:51,815 --> 01:06:54,450
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1346
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:56,915
So much fun though,

1347
01:06:56,948 --> 01:06:58,450
knowing you'd be scurrying
away from me at the lab

1348
01:06:58,482 --> 01:06:59,748
just to bring it
to me here.

1349
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,617
Did you actually
think I'd let you go?

1350
01:07:01,649 --> 01:07:02,815
How did you do that?

1351
01:07:02,848 --> 01:07:04,417
Everyone has their button.

1352
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:05,816
You push it
and they go blind.

1353
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:07,850
And yours,
obviously, is ego.

1354
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,949
"Stay the course.

1355
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:12,817
<i>"Great changes
are in store.</i>

1356
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:15,483
<i>"Trust that
your unique talents</i>

1357
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:16,983
"will not go
unrecognized."

1358
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:19,783
-That was you.
-Yeah.

1359
01:07:19,817 --> 01:07:21,417
Merritt downloaded
all the files,

1360
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:24,084
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1361
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:24,984
Your phone.

1362
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:29,151
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1363
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:32,051
What you actually put your phone
on was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1364
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,949
<i>Once again,</i>

1365
01:07:35,982 --> 01:07:38,549
science beats magic.

1366
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:39,717
So, the stick?

1367
01:07:39,718 --> 01:07:40,851
No.

1368
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:44,949
I got it!

1369
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,518
I got it. I got it.

1370
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,484
-Fuck, Dylan!
-Wait, leave them!

1371
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:51,950
You really think I'm gonna
walk away from you?

1372
01:07:51,982 --> 01:07:54,083
Give me the stick!

1373
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:55,016
Give me it!

1374
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,151
All right. Don't ever
question me again.

1375
01:07:57,183 --> 01:07:58,384
Beat it!

1376
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,684
So, the stick.

1377
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:11,718
Go to hell.

1378
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,583
Boys.

1379
01:08:25,918 --> 01:08:27,885
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1380
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:45,619
There's like 10 of you.

1381
01:08:45,652 --> 01:08:47,518
Come on,
he's just doing tricks.

1382
01:08:47,552 --> 01:08:49,452
-He's there!
-Go!

1383
01:10:12,853 --> 01:10:16,854
Dylan, watch the pretty
birdies fly. And sleep.

1384
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:19,053
Doesn't work on me.

1385
01:10:19,085 --> 01:10:21,453
Not even
as a distraction?

1386
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:25,336
Good job.

1387
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:26,687
Nice to be involved.

1388
01:10:34,854 --> 01:10:36,921
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1389
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:38,553
I just saw Dylan.
Something happened.

1390
01:10:38,587 --> 01:10:39,686
What do you mean
you just saw Dylan?

1391
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,754
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1392
01:10:41,786 --> 01:10:42,970
Atlas.

1393
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,153
I don't know.

1394
01:10:49,054 --> 01:10:50,420
What are they doing?

1395
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,820
Those are Walter's men.

1396
01:10:52,854 --> 01:10:55,954
This is what they want.

1397
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:58,188
What the hell? How do
you still have that?

1398
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:04,954
That's
Lionel Shrike's safe.

1399
01:11:04,986 --> 01:11:07,620
What the hell
do they want with that?

1400
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:09,487
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1401
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:12,788
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1402
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:18,555
What do you want?

1403
01:11:18,588 --> 01:11:22,121
You to understand something
very important.

1404
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,755
We

1405
01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:26,555
Are mirror images.

1406
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:27,655
You see, because like you,

1407
01:11:27,687 --> 01:11:30,121
I share a very deep
connection with my father.

1408
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,088
And like you,
I'll stop at nothing

1409
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:36,588
to avenge any wrongs
done to him.

1410
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:44,755
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1411
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:46,689
Mine's still alive.

1412
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,589
Get him up.

1413
01:12:01,987 --> 01:12:03,688
So,

1414
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:06,523
this is the man

1415
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:09,589
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1416
01:12:11,656 --> 01:12:13,922
I wouldn't have
known your face

1417
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:17,588
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1418
01:12:17,621 --> 01:12:19,823
But you have spent,
what, 30 years

1419
01:12:19,855 --> 01:12:21,188
thinking about mine?

1420
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:22,823
When my father died,

1421
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:24,823
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1422
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:26,156
-I wouldn't even have known...
-She died a pauper!

1423
01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:28,090
who your mother was.

1424
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:29,157
She was a digit,

1425
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:32,822
a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1426
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,789
Because nothing
is personal to you

1427
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:37,055
and everyone and everything is
just a number, isn't that so?

1428
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:39,822
That is where you are wrong, Mr.
Rhodes.

1429
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:44,790
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1430
01:12:45,989 --> 01:12:47,890
-My son...
-Yeah, the sociopath.

1431
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:49,424
Funny thing is,

1432
01:12:49,456 --> 01:12:52,689
I have seven so-called
legitimate children.

1433
01:12:52,722 --> 01:12:54,190
Sniveling, snobbish,

1434
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,089
stupid runts.

1435
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:59,689
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1436
01:12:59,722 --> 01:13:02,056
The point is,
he wants something,

1437
01:13:02,089 --> 01:13:03,757
and like any good parent,

1438
01:13:03,789 --> 01:13:06,156
I will stop at nothing

1439
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:07,490
to get it for him.

1440
01:13:07,522 --> 01:13:09,157
Your Horsemen have it.

1441
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:11,690
You will turn it and them

1442
01:13:11,723 --> 01:13:13,657
over to us, now.

1443
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,758
No.

1444
01:13:18,556 --> 01:13:21,090
Dylan, I would like you to
really take this moment

1445
01:13:21,124 --> 01:13:22,824
because this is
the consequence

1446
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,790
of your personal
vendetta come to life

1447
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:26,690
and staring you
in the face.

1448
01:13:26,722 --> 01:13:28,424
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1449
01:13:28,456 --> 01:13:29,456
we're not going to stop.

1450
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:31,791
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1451
01:13:31,823 --> 01:13:33,956
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1452
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,891
Now then,
cast your mind back

1453
01:13:35,923 --> 01:13:39,057
to standing by the banks of the
river watching your father descend,

1454
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:41,090
disgraced and discredited.

1455
01:13:41,123 --> 01:13:43,958
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1456
01:13:44,723 --> 01:13:46,823
I felt that same thing

1457
01:13:46,857 --> 01:13:47,824
two years ago

1458
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,690
as you drained not
just my father's fortune,

1459
01:13:49,723 --> 01:13:51,758
but his dignity!

1460
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,792
And yet you took
pleasure from it.

1461
01:13:56,657 --> 01:13:59,125
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1462
01:14:26,623 --> 01:14:28,558
-Would you like some tea?
-Thank you.

1463
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:45,242
You ready?

1464
01:14:45,243 --> 01:14:46,459
Over to you.

1465
01:14:53,492 --> 01:14:54,525
Splash!

1466
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,459
Job done!

1467
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:17,959
Hell is going to seem
like a day at the spa

1468
01:15:17,992 --> 01:15:20,926
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1469
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,343
Wouldn't you say?

1470
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:23,726
You had me at "hell."

1471
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:42,927
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1472
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:47,894
Always keep something
up my sleeve.

1473
01:17:06,728 --> 01:17:09,795
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1474
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:11,961
one speck of remorse,

1475
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,927
but I can't.

1476
01:17:13,961 --> 01:17:17,195
So I'll stick to
the business at hand

1477
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:19,728
and try not to smile
too broadly.

1478
01:17:20,562 --> 01:17:23,428
And, thank you

1479
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:25,796
for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1480
01:17:26,628 --> 01:17:28,429
I take it it's done.

1481
01:17:29,694 --> 01:17:31,661
Literally hit
the bottom.

1482
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:33,130
Now,

1483
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:35,896
where are the Horsemen?

1484
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:37,895
They're performers.

1485
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:40,162
Their pride, their ego...

1486
01:17:40,196 --> 01:17:43,629
Their need to be adored
are all too powerful

1487
01:17:43,661 --> 01:17:45,561
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1488
01:17:45,595 --> 01:17:48,762
If they don't make
themselves known,

1489
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:51,062
you will find yourself

1490
01:17:51,095 --> 01:17:53,563
in a very similar position

1491
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:55,096
to Mr. Rhodes.

1492
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,928
Are we clear about that?

1493
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:58,995
As clear as the water
he's under.

1494
01:18:06,595 --> 01:18:08,195
You'll have the rest

1495
01:18:08,228 --> 01:18:10,028
when I have the Horsemen.

1496
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:43,464
Dylan!

1497
01:18:44,796 --> 01:18:47,096
Dylan, come on,
buddy, breathe!

1498
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,564
-Dylan.
-Dylan?

1499
01:18:48,597 --> 01:18:50,664
Dylan, come on!

1500
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:57,664
You're okay.

1501
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,496
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1502
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:01,664
Are you all right, bro?

1503
01:19:01,996 --> 01:19:04,097
Okay!

1504
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,098
-Thank you!
-This is the least I could do.

1505
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,097
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1506
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,596
That was not an option.

1507
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,563
You took a bullet
for us, it was huge.

1508
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:12,830
You really did, man.

1509
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,864
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1510
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:20,131
Yeah.

1511
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:22,497
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1512
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:24,098
Literally, in my case,

1513
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:25,498
I was just standing on the
shore while Atlas jumped down

1514
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,564
and got you.

1515
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:28,165
I'm serious.

1516
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:30,098
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1517
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,531
-What's wrong?
-What?

1518
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:34,665
It's fake.

1519
01:19:34,697 --> 01:19:35,864
What?

1520
01:19:37,631 --> 01:19:39,098
No, I had the stick.

1521
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:41,198
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand.

1522
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:43,831
In the lab. And then I put
it in the little case thing.

1523
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:44,998
And I gave it to Atlas.

1524
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,331
Right, which I then
gave to Dylan.

1525
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,964
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1526
01:19:48,998 --> 01:19:50,131
No.

1527
01:19:50,163 --> 01:19:52,999
I took it from you and then
slipped it back in your coat

1528
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:54,965
when I pushed you out.

1529
01:19:54,997 --> 01:19:57,831
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1530
01:19:57,865 --> 01:20:00,565
Yeah, but they're gonna come after
us as if we do have something.

1531
01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:02,832
No. Okay. I agree that
somebody got the better of us.

1532
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:03,931
Okay? Somehow.

1533
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,531
But I don't agree that we
have a sack full of nada.

1534
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:07,731
Because we're all here.

1535
01:20:07,765 --> 01:20:09,698
That's a sack
full of something.

1536
01:20:10,697 --> 01:20:12,132
Listen.

1537
01:20:12,164 --> 01:20:17,465
We all know that Walter is not going
to stop until he gets that chip.

1538
01:20:17,498 --> 01:20:20,964
And we're the only ones that
even know that he's alive.

1539
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:23,698
We can't just walk away.

1540
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,700
That's not what
the Horsemen do.

1541
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:30,199
There's a quote...

1542
01:20:30,231 --> 01:20:31,800
It's actually
by the magician

1543
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:33,598
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1544
01:20:33,632 --> 01:20:35,599
It's...

1545
01:20:35,632 --> 01:20:39,933
"A magician's greatest power
lies forever shrouded

1546
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,199
"in his empty fist."

1547
01:20:42,232 --> 01:20:44,733
"And the very idea that
he can convince the world

1548
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:47,899
"that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1549
01:20:47,932 --> 01:20:49,565
That's Lionel Shrike.

1550
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:50,600
Right.

1551
01:20:52,032 --> 01:20:53,199
So what are you saying?

1552
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:55,866
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1553
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:01,000
What is Walter's
greatest fear?

1554
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:03,467
Being seen.

1555
01:21:03,498 --> 01:21:04,698
And what does
the stick do?

1556
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:07,000
The stick can
unencode anything.

1557
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:10,434
It can open up a back door
into any computer

1558
01:21:10,467 --> 01:21:11,999
on the planet.

1559
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,767
-Including his.
-Yeah.

1560
01:21:15,731 --> 01:21:18,099
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1561
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:22,434
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1562
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:23,566
We need a plan.

1563
01:21:23,599 --> 01:21:25,801
But we don't have time.

1564
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:29,434
We have each other and
there are five of us.

1565
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,467
But we also need supplies,
right? And resources.

1566
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,700
And probably more
than five people.

1567
01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:39,634
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1568
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:42,534
She speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1569
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:47,934
Do you know why the Fool is the
most powerful card in the tarot?

1570
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:51,700
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1571
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:53,200
He's a fool

1572
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:56,101
because he's a clean slate,

1573
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:58,666
and, therefore, can become

1574
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,101
anything.

1575
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:01,567
You were chosen.

1576
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,067
All of you.

1577
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:06,667
Not because of
who you are,

1578
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,468
but because of who
you might become.

1579
01:22:10,966 --> 01:22:12,133
When you say "chosen"...

1580
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,801
Are you part of
the Eye?

1581
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:15,966
Yes.

1582
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,968
We are part of
the Eye.

1583
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:22,168
You've each
doubted our existence.

1584
01:22:23,035 --> 01:22:24,868
Wondering

1585
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,467
if we, indeed,
were watching.

1586
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:32,535
We are.

1587
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:34,667
We always have been.

1588
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:37,134
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1589
01:22:37,168 --> 01:22:38,435
You know what
she's saying, right?

1590
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:39,567
Yes.

1591
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,869
That now we have
resources and help.

1592
01:22:43,768 --> 01:22:45,035
Thank you.

1593
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,169
So, who's in?

1594
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,436
I'm in.

1595
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,703
Yeah, I'm in.

1596
01:22:58,568 --> 01:22:59,568
Let's do this.

1597
01:23:17,135 --> 01:23:18,869
No, no, no.

1598
01:23:21,602 --> 01:23:23,702
<i>Not long ago,
we were tricked.</i>

1599
01:23:23,734 --> 01:23:26,735
<i>I was exposed and brought
back from the dead.</i>

1600
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,602
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1601
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,536
<i>to the person
who did it to us.</i>

1602
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,969
<i>Midnight, New Year's Eve.
London.</i>

1603
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:35,735
<i>We will be performing
a series of shows</i>

1604
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:37,436
<i>that all connect
to our big finale,</i>

1605
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,602
<i>so pay close attention
to each trick.</i>

1606
01:23:39,634 --> 01:23:40,735
Get my father.

1607
01:23:42,836 --> 01:23:44,070
Run!

1608
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:47,136
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1609
01:23:47,168 --> 01:23:48,603
What do we know
about Rhodes?

1610
01:23:48,635 --> 01:23:50,569
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1611
01:23:50,602 --> 01:23:52,303
Let's get
to the airport.

1612
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:53,637
<i>So leave your kiddies at home
and get ready for a wild night,</i>

1613
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:57,437
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1614
01:23:57,469 --> 01:23:59,102
Let's move, everyone!

1615
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:01,103
<i>In front of the largest
stage in the world...</i>

1616
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:03,102
<i>The actual world.</i>

1617
01:24:03,136 --> 01:24:05,136
You know they're
playing you, right?

1618
01:24:05,168 --> 01:24:06,969
Leading you into a trap?

1619
01:24:07,002 --> 01:24:08,869
Yeah, but the threat
is real.

1620
01:24:08,903 --> 01:24:11,536
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1621
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:13,837
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1622
01:24:13,869 --> 01:24:15,469
Me. Everything we've done.

1623
01:24:15,502 --> 01:24:17,537
Is it real,
Mr. McKinney?

1624
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:26,070
The threat is real.

1625
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:28,537
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1626
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,870
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1627
01:24:39,603 --> 01:24:40,936
<i>We are here in London</i>

1628
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,704
<i>on this New Year's Eve, and
the crowds are out in force.</i>

1629
01:24:43,737 --> 01:24:45,104
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1630
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:47,504
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1631
01:24:47,536 --> 01:24:49,470
<i>A video gone viral
from the infamous</i>

1632
01:24:49,503 --> 01:24:51,437
<i>Horsemen magicians
has surfaced.</i>

1633
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:53,170
<i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

1634
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:56,203
<i>But will it end in their
arrest on national television?</i>

1635
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:57,970
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1636
01:24:58,004 --> 01:25:00,071
<i>Who knows where
they'll show up...</i>

1637
01:25:00,104 --> 01:25:04,004
<i>But we do know, wherever, whenever
that is, people will be watching.</i>

1638
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:08,837
Yeah, texts, tweets,
Instagrams.

1639
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:11,571
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1640
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:13,204
tag them and bundle them.

1641
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:15,737
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1642
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:16,805
Whoever you want.

1643
01:25:16,838 --> 01:25:18,572
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1644
01:25:18,604 --> 01:25:20,038
Anyone who wants to work

1645
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:22,938
stationed throughout the city, so
they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1646
01:25:37,103 --> 01:25:39,506
Hello! Hey!

1647
01:25:41,471 --> 01:25:43,938
My name's Jack Wilder.

1648
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,972
Goddamn, it feels
good to be back.

1649
01:25:46,005 --> 01:25:48,472
All right,
gather around.

1650
01:25:48,504 --> 01:25:49,538
Indulge me.

1651
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:52,438
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1652
01:25:52,472 --> 01:25:55,906
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1653
01:25:55,938 --> 01:26:00,205
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1654
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,838
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1655
01:26:02,872 --> 01:26:04,906
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1656
01:26:07,373 --> 01:26:11,872
While we're at it, let's find
ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1657
01:26:11,904 --> 01:26:13,872
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1658
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:19,072
Don't worry.
I promise you

1659
01:26:19,104 --> 01:26:20,939
there's a 50% chance you'll
get her back after the show.

1660
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:22,839
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1661
01:26:22,871 --> 01:26:26,505
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1662
01:26:26,538 --> 01:26:27,772
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1663
01:26:27,805 --> 01:26:29,972
I know how
these guys work now.

1664
01:26:30,004 --> 01:26:31,672
They're gonna start
with a tease.

1665
01:26:31,706 --> 01:26:33,706
A few little pop-ups.

1666
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:36,672
<i>Something to
lure you in. Like...</i>

1667
01:26:36,706 --> 01:26:40,840
Well, you know... Like Three
Card Monte, where the guy goes,

1668
01:26:40,872 --> 01:26:43,539
"Looky here,
but no, no, looky here!"

1669
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:47,539
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1670
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,672
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1671
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:53,739
is the inside of your own
colon, with the words

1672
01:26:53,773 --> 01:26:56,707
<i>"Horsemen"
written all over it.</i>

1673
01:26:57,507 --> 01:26:58,973
In blood.

1674
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:02,607
We get the picture,
Mr. McKinney.

1675
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,973
And get out
of my chair.

1676
01:27:05,005 --> 01:27:06,939
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1677
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,973
<i>Come close, come on!</i>

1678
01:27:09,005 --> 01:27:10,972
All right,
all right, so listen.

1679
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:14,773
Tonight, I am going
to make something fly

1680
01:27:14,807 --> 01:27:16,606
using actual magic.

1681
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,474
-Are you ready?
-Yeah!

1682
01:27:18,506 --> 01:27:21,573
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1683
01:27:21,607 --> 01:27:25,841
I'm gonna make it fly over
there and land on the Thames.

1684
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,840
Can you handle that?

1685
01:27:27,874 --> 01:27:29,541
Same rules
apply as before.

1686
01:27:29,574 --> 01:27:31,674
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1687
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:32,973
It's as simple as that.

1688
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:34,841
-Are you guys ready?
-Yeah!

1689
01:27:34,873 --> 01:27:37,673
Dad, look at this.

1690
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:38,774
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1691
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:40,840
Near the river. Looks like
the shows are starting.

1692
01:27:40,874 --> 01:27:42,841
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1693
01:27:42,873 --> 01:27:44,508
-What do you mean?
-It's on Channel One.

1694
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:53,973
-Let's go to 2.
-Here we go.

1695
01:27:54,006 --> 01:27:56,708
Got him.
We have a location.

1696
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,707
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1697
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,741
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1698
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:01,675
Typing in grid
coordinates now.

1699
01:28:04,174 --> 01:28:06,876
Turn around. Hide
yourselves with the cards.

1700
01:28:07,608 --> 01:28:09,708
And here we go.

1701
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,541
Switch!

1702
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,541
You guys still
have your eye on her?

1703
01:28:13,575 --> 01:28:14,542
You want me to
go back and do it?

1704
01:28:14,574 --> 01:28:15,974
Okay, all right.
I'm moving on.

1705
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:17,608
And switch.

1706
01:28:19,608 --> 01:28:20,675
Where is she?

1707
01:28:21,907 --> 01:28:23,975
Down at the end?
You sure?

1708
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,874
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1709
01:28:26,907 --> 01:28:28,475
Thank you very much.

1710
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:37,142
There's my girl.

1711
01:28:37,174 --> 01:28:39,674
Not my girl.
100% your girl.

1712
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:41,442
But just
in this situation.

1713
01:28:41,476 --> 01:28:44,009
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1714
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:47,974
So, let me just make
something small fly, like...

1715
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:50,108
Fly, fly, fly!

1716
01:28:50,142 --> 01:28:51,942
Right?
Look at that!

1717
01:28:51,975 --> 01:28:53,743
Come on, people.

1718
01:28:53,776 --> 01:28:56,708
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1719
01:28:56,742 --> 01:28:57,877
-Me?
-Check your fly.

1720
01:29:00,742 --> 01:29:03,010
You like that?

1721
01:29:03,042 --> 01:29:04,976
You support
that relationship?

1722
01:29:05,008 --> 01:29:07,910
That guy had a bird in his
pants. That's disgusting.

1723
01:29:11,642 --> 01:29:13,709
<i>Copy that. We've got
two sightings reported.</i>

1724
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:15,226
<i>Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>

1725
01:29:15,227 --> 01:29:16,709
Get me Thaddeus.

1726
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:19,010
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1727
01:29:19,043 --> 01:29:20,743
<i>Let 'em move.</i>

1728
01:29:20,776 --> 01:29:21,942
That's what
the Horsemen want.

1729
01:29:21,976 --> 01:29:23,943
Well, what if they get there
first? That can't happen.

1730
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:26,110
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1731
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:27,511
Find the pattern.

1732
01:29:28,476 --> 01:29:29,742
You do that,

1733
01:29:29,776 --> 01:29:31,843
and you'll be able
to cut them off

1734
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:33,843
<i>before they get to
their final trick.</i>

1735
01:29:33,876 --> 01:29:35,477
If it makes you feel better,

1736
01:29:35,509 --> 01:29:37,610
I'll take care of the FBI.

1737
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:53,443
I guess you found me!

1738
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:54,944
We've got a third spot.

1739
01:29:54,976 --> 01:29:57,576
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1740
01:29:59,877 --> 01:30:01,810
Give me 2,

1741
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:04,910
13 and 21.

1742
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:07,011
What the hell is that?

1743
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:08,878
Freeze that and zoom in.

1744
01:30:10,977 --> 01:30:13,843
How the hell
did this happen?

1745
01:30:13,877 --> 01:30:17,044
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1746
01:30:17,076 --> 01:30:19,444
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1747
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:20,710
what are we
gonna do about it?

1748
01:30:20,742 --> 01:30:22,110
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1749
01:30:22,143 --> 01:30:23,777
Where's my coat?

1750
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:26,610
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1751
01:30:26,643 --> 01:30:28,110
I know
where they're going.

1752
01:30:28,144 --> 01:30:30,844
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1753
01:30:30,877 --> 01:30:32,077
Chase, you need
to get to him

1754
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,445
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1755
01:30:40,043 --> 01:30:41,577
<i>I've a confession to make.</i>

1756
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,844
I've been told I have
some control issues.

1757
01:30:43,878 --> 01:30:47,144
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1758
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:49,177
so I'm gonna try
to control something

1759
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:51,145
that's a lot
easier than people.

1760
01:30:51,177 --> 01:30:52,710
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1761
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:54,845
Yeah, rain...

1762
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:58,744
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1763
01:30:58,778 --> 01:31:01,644
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1764
01:31:01,678 --> 01:31:03,945
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1765
01:31:03,977 --> 01:31:06,878
I'm not just gonna make
it clear up. No, no, no.

1766
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:09,011
I'm gonna make
it actually stop.

1767
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:23,612
And can God do that?

1768
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,611
No, I don't think so.

1769
01:31:25,645 --> 01:31:27,913
Or what about make it go up?

1770
01:31:35,645 --> 01:31:37,679
<i>Are you still with me?</i>

1771
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:39,578
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it.

1772
01:31:39,611 --> 01:31:40,746
Turn around.

1773
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:45,146
Switch!

1774
01:31:48,912 --> 01:31:50,078
Show me the lady.

1775
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:52,978
Show me the lady!

1776
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:54,147
The end? End?

1777
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:58,746
You know what? I'm actually
starting to feel kinda bad.

1778
01:31:59,845 --> 01:32:01,479
It's just because
I can actually feel

1779
01:32:01,513 --> 01:32:02,946
that you guys are
paying attention.

1780
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:04,346
It's just that...

1781
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:07,414
You know, it's unfortunate that
it's the wrong kind of attention.

1782
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:11,845
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1783
01:32:13,011 --> 01:32:16,145
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1784
01:32:16,178 --> 01:32:19,013
Let's kill him, right?

1785
01:32:19,045 --> 01:32:21,078
Merritt,
move into position.

1786
01:32:21,112 --> 01:32:23,046
Got it, Dylan.

1787
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,847
I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1788
01:32:24,879 --> 01:32:27,212
Lula, stand by, all right?

1789
01:32:27,246 --> 01:32:29,714
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1790
01:32:39,113 --> 01:32:41,479
<i>Reports are coming in
from all over London</i>

1791
01:32:41,513 --> 01:32:45,181
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1792
01:32:48,247 --> 01:32:51,980
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1793
01:32:52,012 --> 01:32:53,480
-Please, bro, don't do this.
-Where are you headed?

1794
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:55,180
North, south, east?

1795
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,713
East. Tower of London?

1796
01:32:57,746 --> 01:33:00,581
Tower Bridge? Near Tower Bridge?
The Thames!

1797
01:33:00,613 --> 01:33:03,814
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy!

1798
01:33:03,848 --> 01:33:05,681
You're so easy!

1799
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,848
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1800
01:33:07,881 --> 01:33:10,448
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1801
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:12,681
South Bank? Greenwich?

1802
01:33:12,714 --> 01:33:14,114
Greenwich.

1803
01:33:14,147 --> 01:33:17,148
I know where
you're going. I know where...

1804
01:33:19,147 --> 01:33:20,614
Watch it, hobo.

1805
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,982
Hey, Merritt. Come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1806
01:33:27,781 --> 01:33:29,115
When?

1807
01:33:29,147 --> 01:33:31,880
Shit. All right.
All right, I got it.

1808
01:33:31,914 --> 01:33:33,981
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1809
01:33:36,914 --> 01:33:38,681
Sorry. Just...

1810
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,449
What? I just told you...

1811
01:33:42,481 --> 01:33:43,481
Phone call.

1812
01:33:44,848 --> 01:33:45,947
<i>-Hello?
-Lula.</i>

1813
01:33:45,981 --> 01:33:47,214
Dylan. Yeah.

1814
01:33:47,248 --> 01:33:49,482
Kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1815
01:33:49,514 --> 01:33:51,614
<i>Wrap it up. Meet me at the
rendezvous point now.</i>

1816
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:52,649
<i>-What?
-Now!</i>

1817
01:33:54,014 --> 01:33:56,015
Was that an act of God?

1818
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,147
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1819
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,682
and the strobe lights

1820
01:34:00,714 --> 01:34:02,549
and rain machines.

1821
01:34:02,582 --> 01:34:04,549
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1822
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:06,715
Because you're gonna need to
know all of that for the final.

1823
01:34:10,182 --> 01:34:11,949
<i>So how did I do it?</i>

1824
01:34:11,982 --> 01:34:13,449
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1825
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,081
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1826
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:16,481
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1827
01:34:16,514 --> 01:34:18,016
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1828
01:34:18,049 --> 01:34:19,849
You're gonna have to wait
to find out. I know.

1829
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:21,716
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1830
01:34:25,747 --> 01:34:26,816
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1831
01:34:26,848 --> 01:34:28,983
I have to go.

1832
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:49,783
<i>Out of the way, FBI!</i>

1833
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:51,983
Move, move, move! Go!

1834
01:34:52,016 --> 01:34:53,817
Get some men in that park!

1835
01:34:53,849 --> 01:34:54,784
Men in the park now!

1836
01:34:54,816 --> 01:34:57,182
You gonna
fill up on appetizers?

1837
01:34:57,215 --> 01:34:59,949
Or save room for
the main course?

1838
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:01,849
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

1839
01:35:01,882 --> 01:35:02,950
You can chase them
all you want,

1840
01:35:02,982 --> 01:35:05,716
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1841
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:09,583
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1842
01:35:09,615 --> 01:35:11,117
So, what's it gonna be?

1843
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:12,449
Chase them?

1844
01:35:13,482 --> 01:35:14,750
Or make a deal with me?

1845
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:22,982
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1846
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:24,850
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1847
01:35:24,883 --> 01:35:26,550
-Where's Merritt?
-Fine. I don't know.

1848
01:35:26,584 --> 01:35:27,584
I'm here.

1849
01:35:27,616 --> 01:35:29,483
-Where's Lula?
-I'm right here!

1850
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,450
What the hell happened?

1851
01:35:31,484 --> 01:35:33,149
-My goddamn brother happened.
-Don't worry about it.

1852
01:35:33,183 --> 01:35:34,483
We just gotta get
to the destination.

1853
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:35,584
Lula, can you
handle that thing?

1854
01:35:35,616 --> 01:35:37,050
I can ride it.

1855
01:35:37,082 --> 01:35:38,483
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1856
01:35:38,516 --> 01:35:39,584
Yeah, good point.

1857
01:35:39,616 --> 01:35:40,950
-Let's go!
-No, Jack.

1858
01:35:46,016 --> 01:35:47,017
Shit!

1859
01:35:49,984 --> 01:35:51,484
Jack's down.
We gotta get him.

1860
01:35:54,784 --> 01:35:55,851
Come on, move!

1861
01:36:01,184 --> 01:36:02,401
Jack! Go, go!

1862
01:36:02,402 --> 01:36:03,616
That's the brake.

1863
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:05,151
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1864
01:36:05,184 --> 01:36:06,951
Come on, follow me!

1865
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:09,152
That's it?

1866
01:36:25,884 --> 01:36:27,584
-Hey, ready?
-Yeah!

1867
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,718
Get on.

1868
01:36:39,052 --> 01:36:40,084
Yeah!

1869
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:42,617
Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1870
01:36:42,651 --> 01:36:43,986
Jesus!

1871
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:47,152
I'm coming!

1872
01:36:55,485 --> 01:36:57,186
-Get up! Come on!
-Okay.

1873
01:36:58,618 --> 01:36:59,851
You got me.

1874
01:36:59,885 --> 01:37:02,019
Those things are
really dangerous!

1875
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:05,452
-Come on!
-Go!

1876
01:37:07,784 --> 01:37:09,919
Get him in! Move it!

1877
01:37:14,486 --> 01:37:16,084
What is happening?

1878
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:18,485
Where are they?

1879
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:20,520
They should be
arriving any second.

1880
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:24,119
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1881
01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:38,120
Okay, feeling fear.

1882
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:40,220
Fear.

1883
01:37:40,253 --> 01:37:41,453
Anger, anger.

1884
01:37:42,619 --> 01:37:43,919
Full house!

1885
01:37:43,953 --> 01:37:45,620
That's enough.

1886
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,619
I was done.

1887
01:37:49,586 --> 01:37:53,686
So nice to see you all again.

1888
01:37:53,719 --> 01:37:56,785
But since we're
such old friends,

1889
01:37:56,819 --> 01:37:59,119
let's skip the formalities.

1890
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:01,719
One of you

1891
01:38:01,753 --> 01:38:04,920
has something we require.

1892
01:38:06,652 --> 01:38:08,153
So give it over.

1893
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:18,754
Nothing at all?

1894
01:38:19,954 --> 01:38:21,021
Really?

1895
01:38:24,153 --> 01:38:26,053
Sit down!

1896
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:34,120
Let's go, let's go!

1897
01:38:35,487 --> 01:38:36,687
Let's go, let's go!

1898
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,520
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1899
01:38:39,553 --> 01:38:40,720
Get those lights off me!

1900
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:47,954
Get on the plane!

1901
01:38:50,019 --> 01:38:52,154
Hey!

1902
01:38:54,821 --> 01:38:55,822
Get on the plane!

1903
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:06,787
-Hey!
-Hey!

1904
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:08,754
Yeah,
take off immediately.

1905
01:39:12,055 --> 01:39:14,788
You know, you make it
almost too easy?

1906
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,687
I mean,
even your hilarious attempts

1907
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,587
to make
yourselves unpredictable,

1908
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,554
just follow the same
pattern each time.

1909
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:22,588
Set up, set up, set up.

1910
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:23,687
Big reveal.

1911
01:39:23,721 --> 01:39:26,456
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1912
01:39:26,488 --> 01:39:29,021
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1913
01:39:33,921 --> 01:39:37,754
Well, there will be a big
reveal, and it will come now.

1914
01:39:39,588 --> 01:39:41,888
The stick, dear boy.

1915
01:39:43,121 --> 01:39:44,488
-No.
-Fine.

1916
01:39:44,987 --> 01:39:47,189
Start with her.

1917
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:49,622
Hey, hey, hey!

1918
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:53,488
Give it to him.

1919
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:55,155
Danny, give him the card.

1920
01:39:55,187 --> 01:39:57,022
-Just give it to him.
-Danny, come on.

1921
01:40:07,089 --> 01:40:08,157
We'll have a closer look.

1922
01:40:16,789 --> 01:40:18,789
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1923
01:40:18,821 --> 01:40:20,621
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1924
01:40:20,654 --> 01:40:21,722
This is the both of us.

1925
01:40:21,723 --> 01:40:22,789
Okay, it's the both of us.

1926
01:40:22,821 --> 01:40:24,457
-Guys, come on!
-Come on, stop!

1927
01:40:24,489 --> 01:40:26,189
You, to save your
little girlfriend!

1928
01:40:26,223 --> 01:40:28,156
To save my... He had
a knife to her head!

1929
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:29,690
I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1930
01:40:29,722 --> 01:40:30,955
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1931
01:40:30,988 --> 01:40:32,557
And you,
what's your deal, man?

1932
01:40:32,589 --> 01:40:33,789
Look, they're not
gonna get blood

1933
01:40:33,823 --> 01:40:34,857
-all over the seats.
-Right.

1934
01:40:34,889 --> 01:40:36,123
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1935
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,856
-Really?
-I'm sorry to interrupt,

1936
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,988
But I just have to
say congratulations.

1937
01:40:40,022 --> 01:40:41,190
And thank you!

1938
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:44,055
It's real.

1939
01:40:44,089 --> 01:40:45,657
What?

1940
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:47,091
It's real?

1941
01:40:48,857 --> 01:40:49,924
Bring them through.

1942
01:40:49,956 --> 01:40:51,089
Did you say it's real?

1943
01:40:51,123 --> 01:40:52,124
What is
he talking about?

1944
01:40:52,157 --> 01:40:53,557
Move!

1945
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:54,990
Well done, my boy.

1946
01:40:58,923 --> 01:41:01,489
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1947
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:04,124
It's the most
expensive bottle

1948
01:41:04,156 --> 01:41:05,590
on Earth.

1949
01:41:06,523 --> 01:41:08,657
$1.2 million.

1950
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:12,723
And I saved it just
for this occasion.

1951
01:41:12,755 --> 01:41:16,524
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1952
01:41:17,022 --> 01:41:18,789
Hey.

1953
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:20,123
You got what you wanted.

1954
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:22,824
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1955
01:41:22,856 --> 01:41:25,857
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1956
01:41:25,889 --> 01:41:26,989
You sure?

1957
01:41:27,022 --> 01:41:28,956
Chase, what shall we do?

1958
01:41:31,223 --> 01:41:33,558
Toss them out.

1959
01:41:33,591 --> 01:41:35,791
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1960
01:41:38,024 --> 01:41:39,991
No! Come on! No!

1961
01:41:40,023 --> 01:41:41,025
Farewell.

1962
01:41:41,858 --> 01:41:44,024
God! No!

1963
01:41:45,258 --> 01:41:47,758
Wait! I just wanna say.

1964
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,025
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1965
01:41:50,057 --> 01:41:52,090
but I'm leaving
with the right one.

1966
01:41:52,123 --> 01:41:53,790
I love you guys!

1967
01:41:53,824 --> 01:41:54,858
-No!
-No, no, no!

1968
01:41:56,724 --> 01:41:59,091
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1969
01:41:59,124 --> 01:42:00,225
No!

1970
01:42:01,823 --> 01:42:03,057
Who's next?

1971
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,124
No, wait! Let me go!

1972
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:13,624
Let go of me!

1973
01:42:13,658 --> 01:42:15,024
No, no, no!

1974
01:42:15,991 --> 01:42:17,459
-Let me go!
-Toss her!

1975
01:42:21,825 --> 01:42:23,058
God!

1976
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:24,492
Hurry up and
shut that door!

1977
01:42:24,524 --> 01:42:26,124
It's getting
cold in here.

1978
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:28,092
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1979
01:42:33,724 --> 01:42:34,825
No, no, no!

1980
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,592
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1981
01:42:42,192 --> 01:42:43,193
That was fun!

1982
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:47,724
Cheers!

1983
01:42:47,758 --> 01:42:49,093
Well done, my boy.

1984
01:42:55,024 --> 01:42:57,226
No, is it supposed
to taste like that?

1985
01:42:57,259 --> 01:42:58,859
No, it is not.

1986
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:20,160
What the hell
is going on?

1987
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,794
Okay,
come pick them up!

1988
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:34,827
-Come on.
-Come on out.

1989
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:49,792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1990
01:43:49,826 --> 01:43:51,993
<i>The Horsemen!</i>

1991
01:44:12,226 --> 01:44:14,693
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1992
01:44:14,727 --> 01:44:15,960
<i>You predicted it correctly.</i>

1993
01:44:15,994 --> 01:44:18,228
<i>The Thames,
stroke of midnight.</i>

1994
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,127
<i>New Year's Eve.
Happy New Year!</i>

1995
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:28,160
Unbelievable!

1996
01:44:28,193 --> 01:44:29,860
-We are moving now.
-The whole thing just changed.

1997
01:44:29,894 --> 01:44:31,262
All backup into position stat!

1998
01:44:31,263 --> 01:44:32,628
We're on the move.

1999
01:44:34,026 --> 01:44:35,127
You're staying here!

2000
01:44:35,161 --> 01:44:36,162
Of course.

2001
01:44:43,628 --> 01:44:45,628
Move! Move!
Out of the way!

2002
01:44:45,661 --> 01:44:47,862
<i>Thank you very much, London!</i>

2003
01:44:47,895 --> 01:44:50,762
<i>We would like to acknowledge
not just our old friend</i>

2004
01:44:50,795 --> 01:44:52,028
<i>Arthur Tressler.</i>

2005
01:44:52,061 --> 01:44:54,862
<i>But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.</i>

2006
01:44:54,894 --> 01:44:57,494
<i>Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion</i>

2007
01:44:57,528 --> 01:44:59,062
<i>even we have ever seen.</i>

2008
01:44:59,095 --> 01:45:03,462
<i>He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!</i>

2009
01:45:03,495 --> 01:45:06,062
<i>But before he did that,</i>

2010
01:45:06,094 --> 01:45:07,595
<i>he revealed someone.</i>

2011
01:45:07,627 --> 01:45:10,528
<i>And we think it
only right to give him</i>

2012
01:45:10,561 --> 01:45:12,762
<i>a proper introduction.</i>

2013
01:45:12,795 --> 01:45:15,628
<i>He is our friend
and he is our leader.</i>

2014
01:45:15,661 --> 01:45:16,828
<i>Dylan Shrike!</i>

2015
01:45:16,862 --> 01:45:17,862
<i>Get over here!</i>

2016
01:45:17,863 --> 01:45:18,862
Yeah!

2017
01:45:24,761 --> 01:45:26,829
<i>So, normally</i>

2018
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:31,663
<i>only the magician, his assistant,
and a few trusted stage hands</i>

2019
01:45:31,696 --> 01:45:33,862
<i>know the secret
of a trick.</i>

2020
01:45:33,895 --> 01:45:36,929
<i>But tonight,
however, in this effect,</i>

2021
01:45:36,962 --> 01:45:40,062
<i>all of you people
around the Thames here.</i>

2022
01:45:40,094 --> 01:45:42,128
<i>And since we're
streaming live,</i>

2023
01:45:42,162 --> 01:45:44,863
<i>everyone around the world</i>

2024
01:45:44,895 --> 01:45:47,495
<i>already knows everything.</i>

2025
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:51,629
<i>And only these fellows here are
the ones left in the dark.</i>

2026
01:45:51,662 --> 01:45:54,629
<i>So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.</i>

2027
01:45:54,661 --> 01:45:57,763
<i>Remember when we were
playing "Find the Lady."</i>

2028
01:45:57,796 --> 01:45:59,797
<i>I said that we
used a Barry Trap.</i>

2029
01:46:01,062 --> 01:46:04,762
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

2030
01:46:04,795 --> 01:46:08,197
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

2031
01:46:11,262 --> 01:46:13,628
<i>Which took us to
a duplicate hangar</i>

2032
01:46:13,661 --> 01:46:15,930
<i>where we used
your need to rush,</i>

2033
01:46:15,962 --> 01:46:19,497
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

2034
01:46:19,529 --> 01:46:20,763
<i>Get those lights off me!</i>

2035
01:46:22,597 --> 01:46:24,630
<i>So, the airplane.</i>

2036
01:46:24,663 --> 01:46:26,197
<i>How did we get it to fly?</i>

2037
01:46:27,896 --> 01:46:29,863
<i>Well, we used fans,</i>

2038
01:46:29,896 --> 01:46:32,730
<i>and lights and rain machines.</i>

2039
01:46:37,896 --> 01:46:42,630
<i>Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.</i>

2040
01:46:42,663 --> 01:46:43,930
<i>But we needed to make sure</i>

2041
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:46,063
<i>that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do</i>

2042
01:46:46,097 --> 01:46:47,664
<i>once you did catch us.</i>

2043
01:46:47,697 --> 01:46:49,563
<i>My brother Chase,</i>

2044
01:46:49,597 --> 01:46:53,831
<i>who was technical adviser
to the losing team.</i>

2045
01:46:53,863 --> 01:46:56,630
<i>He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.</i>

2046
01:46:56,662 --> 01:46:58,164
I know where you're going!

2047
01:46:58,197 --> 01:47:01,864
<i>And, surprises.</i>

2048
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:05,131
Watch it, hobo.

2049
01:47:05,163 --> 01:47:06,896
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

2050
01:47:06,929 --> 01:47:09,764
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

2051
01:47:09,796 --> 01:47:11,797
It's going to be your idea
to throw the Horsemen

2052
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,131
out of the plane.

2053
01:47:13,164 --> 01:47:15,465
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

2054
01:47:15,497 --> 01:47:17,764
I can maybe catch
you up on it later.

2055
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:20,165
Probably see you what,
three to five?

2056
01:47:21,263 --> 01:47:23,465
Come on, put it there.

2057
01:47:23,498 --> 01:47:24,899
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

2058
01:47:26,196 --> 01:47:29,197
<i>Basically,
we showed them everything.</i>

2059
01:47:29,231 --> 01:47:30,598
<i>How you kidnapped us</i>

2060
01:47:30,632 --> 01:47:34,631
<i>to steal the very thing that
is in your pocket right now.</i>

2061
01:47:36,763 --> 01:47:38,032
<i>Whoops!</i>

2062
01:47:41,797 --> 01:47:44,231
<i>You know,
this thing here,</i>

2063
01:47:44,264 --> 01:47:47,598
<i>which you said you could
use to adjust markets,</i>

2064
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:49,164
<i>manipulate governments,</i>

2065
01:47:49,197 --> 01:47:51,030
<i>and spy on whomever
you choose.</i>

2066
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:56,098
<i>Also, you could, as you said control
the public from outside the grid.</i>

2067
01:47:57,698 --> 01:48:02,964
<i>These men destroy
people's lives.</i>

2068
01:48:02,998 --> 01:48:07,031
<i>Spying on the world, robbing
you of your right to privacy.</i>

2069
01:48:07,065 --> 01:48:10,532
<i>And they do that
by hiding in the dark.</i>

2070
01:48:10,564 --> 01:48:14,998
<i>So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.</i>

2071
01:48:15,032 --> 01:48:16,933
<i>Tonight, they,</i>

2072
01:48:17,899 --> 01:48:20,133
<i>like all of us,</i>

2073
01:48:20,165 --> 01:48:22,966
<i>are finally stepping
into the light.</i>

2074
01:48:27,498 --> 01:48:28,698
<i>Thank you, everybody!</i>

2075
01:48:28,733 --> 01:48:30,766
<i>We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!</i>

2076
01:48:33,564 --> 01:48:35,899
Five, four, three,

2077
01:48:35,931 --> 01:48:37,598
two, one!

2078
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:55,567
Hey, we're on the clock.

2079
01:48:55,568 --> 01:48:56,900
Get a move on.

2080
01:48:59,998 --> 01:49:00,999
There they are!

2081
01:49:01,032 --> 01:49:02,133
There's more inside.

2082
01:49:02,134 --> 01:49:03,233
Don't you bloody touch me!

2083
01:49:03,266 --> 01:49:05,001
The Horsemen are
over on the...

2084
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:09,200
Shit!

2085
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:11,799
Stay with them!

2086
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:13,867
Everybody spread out!

2087
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:15,766
Nobody leaves this barge!

2088
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:20,766
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

2089
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,067
This contains everything.

2090
01:49:28,099 --> 01:49:31,200
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

2091
01:49:31,234 --> 01:49:34,234
All their contacts,
the entire network.

2092
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:36,634
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

2093
01:49:36,667 --> 01:49:38,468
I told you.

2094
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,467
I'm the same man
I've always been.

2095
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:42,900
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

2096
01:49:42,932 --> 01:49:45,733
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

2097
01:49:45,766 --> 01:49:47,967
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

2098
01:49:49,934 --> 01:49:51,101
10 minutes.

2099
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:55,734
Now you're playing
the long game.

2100
01:50:09,634 --> 01:50:11,835
Dad, I promise
you I will fix this.

2101
01:50:11,868 --> 01:50:14,167
You can't.
Stop calling me dad.

2102
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:18,234
There were so many women, I have
no idea whose bastard you are.

2103
01:50:18,268 --> 01:50:19,235
What?

2104
01:50:19,268 --> 01:50:20,584
What happened?

2105
01:50:20,585 --> 01:50:21,901
Thin air, gone.
Come with me.

2106
01:50:21,934 --> 01:50:23,734
What're you talking
about, gone?

2107
01:50:23,767 --> 01:50:25,668
People don't
just disappear.

2108
01:50:25,701 --> 01:50:28,501
You realize that he doesn't
actually have magical powers!

2109
01:51:08,001 --> 01:51:09,569
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

2110
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:10,752
Good to see you all.

2111
01:51:10,753 --> 01:51:11,902
Good to see you, Li.

2112
01:51:13,035 --> 01:51:14,136
Come on in.

2113
01:51:17,502 --> 01:51:18,768
Good morning.

2114
01:51:19,168 --> 01:51:20,202
Welcome.

2115
01:51:22,768 --> 01:51:24,635
I'm proud of you.

2116
01:51:24,668 --> 01:51:26,169
All of you.

2117
01:51:26,202 --> 01:51:28,670
I have a lot to show you.

2118
01:51:28,703 --> 01:51:29,869
Come.

2119
01:51:31,035 --> 01:51:32,203
Come.

2120
01:51:43,702 --> 01:51:44,869
Dad.

2121
01:52:02,202 --> 01:52:03,936
Yes.

2122
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:06,803
Your father and I
were partners.

2123
01:52:06,836 --> 01:52:09,937
Our act was
that of rivals.

2124
01:52:11,103 --> 01:52:14,037
I was the
hard-eyed realist.

2125
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:16,871
He was the
dreamy-eyed idealist.

2126
01:52:16,902 --> 01:52:19,671
We thought it was
the perfect misdirect.

2127
01:52:20,737 --> 01:52:24,503
Yes, in public,
I did goad him.

2128
01:52:24,537 --> 01:52:26,438
The only thing
we didn't count on

2129
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:29,070
was it going so wrong.

2130
01:52:33,171 --> 01:52:35,037
Why?

2131
01:52:35,071 --> 01:52:36,937
Why didn't you ever
say anything to me?

2132
01:52:36,971 --> 01:52:38,571
I don't know.

2133
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,971
Give it a name.

2134
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:43,004
Shame, guilt.

2135
01:52:43,037 --> 01:52:44,504
Regret.

2136
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:51,070
Hey, guys, you might wanna
come take a look at this.

2137
01:52:55,271 --> 01:52:56,671
Look.

2138
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:58,504
<i>I put you
in jail, man.</i>

2139
01:52:58,537 --> 01:53:00,903
Why didn't you
say something then?

2140
01:53:00,936 --> 01:53:04,003
Well, you know,
I was going to.

2141
01:53:04,037 --> 01:53:07,971
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

2142
01:53:09,936 --> 01:53:11,671
Well, quite frankly

2143
01:53:11,705 --> 01:53:13,472
it spoiled
the trick for me.

2144
01:53:13,504 --> 01:53:14,805
I showed my weakness.

2145
01:53:14,837 --> 01:53:17,704
Well, it showed
you weren't ready.

2146
01:53:17,737 --> 01:53:20,472
But when you came
back to my cell,

2147
01:53:20,505 --> 01:53:24,505
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me

2148
01:53:25,804 --> 01:53:27,105
for your Horsemen.

2149
01:53:28,837 --> 01:53:31,538
<i>And I said to myself,</i>

2150
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:33,571
<i>"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

2151
01:53:34,272 --> 01:53:36,838
<i>And I knew it was my job</i>

2152
01:53:36,872 --> 01:53:41,672
<i>to see to it that he became the
magician he was born to be.</i>

2153
01:53:41,704 --> 01:53:43,972
All that was
left then was...

2154
01:53:45,837 --> 01:53:47,038
For me to hit bottom.

2155
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:49,138
So the safe,

2156
01:53:49,172 --> 01:53:51,105
my father's wristwatch,

2157
01:53:51,137 --> 01:53:52,740
that was all you?

2158
01:53:55,572 --> 01:53:58,873
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

2159
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:01,805
<i>We knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

2160
01:54:01,839 --> 01:54:05,605
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

2161
01:54:08,838 --> 01:54:10,939
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

2162
01:54:10,973 --> 01:54:15,807
<i>They needed to learn to work
together like a single organism.</i>

2163
01:54:23,605 --> 01:54:26,140
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

2164
01:54:26,173 --> 01:54:27,706
You're the Horsemen,
aren't you?

2165
01:54:35,539 --> 01:54:36,705
Okay.

2166
01:54:36,738 --> 01:54:39,139
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

2167
01:54:39,173 --> 01:54:41,140
You know,
the best tricks

2168
01:54:41,172 --> 01:54:43,673
work on many levels.

2169
01:54:43,706 --> 01:54:45,606
And the deepest one,

2170
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,740
for me, at least,

2171
01:54:47,772 --> 01:54:50,573
is this moment
right here.

2172
01:54:54,073 --> 01:54:55,674
I'm sorry, Dylan.

2173
01:54:56,205 --> 01:54:58,873
I miss your father.

2174
01:54:58,907 --> 01:55:02,574
30 years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

2175
01:55:02,606 --> 01:55:04,108
Yes, it is.

2176
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:15,507
So, now what?

2177
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,774
Now I'm about
out of moves.

2178
01:55:20,806 --> 01:55:22,173
And I'm tired.

2179
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:24,607
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

2180
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,541
lead to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

2181
01:55:26,574 --> 01:55:27,641
I did.

2182
01:55:27,674 --> 01:55:30,741
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

2183
01:55:31,207 --> 01:55:32,908
I am.

2184
01:55:38,773 --> 01:55:41,207
It's your game now.

2185
01:55:41,241 --> 01:55:43,909
You play it however
you see fit.

2186
01:55:45,107 --> 01:55:47,540
My suggestion, however,

2187
01:55:47,574 --> 01:55:51,008
is that you find
yourself a successor.

2188
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:52,975
Hi. Okay, so...

2189
01:55:53,007 --> 01:55:55,141
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions.

2190
01:55:55,175 --> 01:55:57,108
Right?

2191
01:55:57,141 --> 01:55:58,942
By "a few," I think he
means, like, five million.

2192
01:55:58,975 --> 01:56:00,641
-Yeah.
-Well.

2193
01:56:00,674 --> 01:56:02,575
Good luck to you all.

2194
01:56:02,608 --> 01:56:04,141
-What!
-Okay. See, that's not fair.

2195
01:56:04,175 --> 01:56:05,475
-Come on.
-That's not right.

2196
01:56:05,508 --> 01:56:06,741
That's gonna make
me really angry!

2197
01:56:06,774 --> 01:56:07,975
Not right now.

2198
01:56:08,007 --> 01:56:09,708
By the way...

2199
01:56:11,874 --> 01:56:14,476
Pay no attention
to the curtain.

2200
01:56:17,207 --> 01:56:18,708
There is a curtain.

2201
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:20,041
Go, go, go.

2202
01:56:29,508 --> 01:56:32,041
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

2203
01:56:32,075 --> 01:56:33,942
<i>But is it truth?</i>

2204
01:56:33,976 --> 01:56:36,709
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

2205
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:39,174
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

2206
01:56:39,207 --> 01:56:41,241
<i>When you emerge,</i>

2207
01:56:41,275 --> 01:56:43,708
<i>and you will,</i>

2208
01:56:43,742 --> 01:56:46,875
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

2209
01:56:46,909 --> 01:56:49,576
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

2210
01:56:49,608 --> 01:56:52,608
<i>you will get
what's coming to you</i>

2211
01:56:52,641 --> 01:56:55,142
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

2212
01:56:56,042 --> 01:56:58,809
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

2213
01:56:58,841 --> 01:57:02,008
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

2214
01:57:02,042 --> 01:57:04,076
<i>is an eye</i>

2215
01:57:04,108 --> 01:57:05,945
<i>for an eye.</i>
