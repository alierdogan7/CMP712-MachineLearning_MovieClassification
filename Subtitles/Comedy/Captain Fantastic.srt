DOCTOR: Mr. Cash?

1060
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:08,516
She's got a decent concussion,
but we did a CAT scan,

1061
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,435
and there's absolutely
no damage to the brain.

1062
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:14,397
She does have a slight fracture across
the tibia and fibula of her left leg.

1063
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,276
She's going to need a neck brace
and a cast, but otherwise she's fine.
