- Yes.

You have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

of uttering
the name of our Lord.

- And so as a blasphemer...

- Look, I'd had a lovely supper,

174
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,530
and all I said to my wife was,

175
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,335
"That piece of halibut
was good enough for Jehovah. "

Very well. By virtue
of the authority vested in me...

Do you understand? Even... and I want
to make this absolutely clear...

Spare a talent
for an old ex-leper?

That's more than he earns in a month!

- Now, go away!

- Come on, Big Nose, let's haggle.
- What?

224
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,362
You open at one shekel.
I start at 2,000. We close about 1,800.

any money, so piss off!

- I were cured, sir.

- Cured?
- Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.

- Well, who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.

up he comes, cures me!

"You're cured, mate. "
Bloody do-gooder.

Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

I could do that, sir.
Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.

241
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,687
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit
lame in one leg during the middle of the week.

- Don't start that, Brian. Go and clean your room out.

- Bloody Romans!
- Now look, Brian.

we wouldn't have all this.

- My nose?

Yes. Well, there's a reason
it's like it is, Brian.

told you a long time ago...

- Well, Brian...

262

isn't Mr. Cohen.

- Well, I never thought he was.
- None of your cheek!

264

He was a Roman, Brian.

265
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,497
He was a centurion
in the Roman army.

- Well, at first, yes.

- Naughtius Maximus, his name was.

the known world, he did.

with me, he had...

I do feel, Reg, that any

nobody's fault, not even the Romans'...

the right to have babies?

330
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,608
It is symbolic of our
struggle against oppression.

331
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,215
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

Yeah, and not those rich,

We may have a little job
for you, Brian.

380
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,711
What's this, then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?

381
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,883
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

382
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,120
I- It says "Romans, go home. "

383
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,290
No, it doesn't.
What's Latin for "Roman"?

384
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,492
- Come on!
- "Romanes"?

385
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,501
- Goes like?
- "Annus"?

386
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,833
- Vocative plural of "annus" is?
- "Anni"?

387
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,703
"Romani. "

388
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,368
- "Eunt"? What is "eunt"?
- "Go. "

389
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,537
Conjugate the verb "to go. "

390
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,980
"Ire, eo, is, it,
imus, itis, eunt. "

391
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,074
So "eunt" is?

392
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,813
Third person plural,
present indicative. "They go. "

393
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:27,587
But "Romans, go home" is
an order, so you must use the...

394
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,820
- The imperative.
- Which is?

395
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,988
Um, oh, oh, "i. "

396
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,588
- How many Romans?
- Aah! Plural, plural.

397
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,533
- "Ite. "
- "Ite. "

398
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,799
- [Panting]
- "Domus"? Nominative?

399
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:45,002
"Go home. " This is motion
towards, isn't it, Brian?

400
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,010
Dative!

401

No, not dative!

- Except when "domus" takes the...

404
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,188
- Locative, sir.
- Which is?

405
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,450
- "Domum. "
- "Domum. "

406
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,685
- [Panting]
- "Um. "

407
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,694
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

up through into the main

418
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:51,396
and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

419
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,836
Having grabbed his wife, we inform
Pilate that she is in our custody...

420
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,238
and forthwith issue our demands.

421
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,277
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?

422
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,438
We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle...

423
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,039
the entire apparatus of
the Roman Imperialist State,

424
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,414
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

425
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,454
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.

426
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,491
Send them back
on the hour, every hour.

427
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,288
And, of course, we point out
that they bear...

428
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,852
full responsibility
when we chop her up...

429
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,058
and that we shall not submit
to blackmail.

[Together]
No blackmail!

431
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,132
They bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

432
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,937
And not just from us. From our fathers
and from our fathers' fathers.

433
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,342
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Yeah.

434
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:38,041
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Don't labor the point.

435
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,677
And what have they ever
given us in return?

436
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,347
- The aqueduct.
- What?

437
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,517
The aqueduct.

438
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They did give us that.

439
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,229
And the sanitation.

440
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,825
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

441
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,667
Yeah, I'll grant you, the aqueduct and
sanitation are two things the Romans have done.

442
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,674
- And the roads.
- Well, obviously the roads.

443
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,267
I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

444
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,313
But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads...

445
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,211
- Irrigation.
- Medicine.

446
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,750
- Education.
- Yeah, all right. Fair enough.

447
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,878
- And the wine.
- [Men Agreeing]

448
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,186
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss,
Reg, if the Romans left.

449
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,058
- Public baths.
- And it's safe to walk in the streets at night.

450
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,929
Yeah, they certainly keep order. They're
the only ones who could in a place like this.

[Men Laughing, Agreeing]

452
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,031
All right, but apart from
the sanitation, the medicine,

453
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,267
education, wine, public order,
irrigation, roads,

454

the fresh water system
and public health,

455
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,276
what have the Romans
ever done for us?

It's all clear.

00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,909
Well, where's Reg?

464
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,212
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.

465
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,312
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.

466
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,552
- Did he finish the slogan?
- A hundred times,

467
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,618
in letters ten foot high,
all the way around the palace.

468
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,426
Oh, great. Great.

469
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,400
We... We need doers
in our movement, Brian,

470
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,936
but before you join us, know this:

471
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,598
There is not one of us who
would not gladly suffer death...

472
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,108
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.

473
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,441
- [Man] Uh, well, one.
- Oh, yeah, there's one.

474
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,879
But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?

475
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,611
Yes.

476
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,452
From now on you shall be called
"Brian that is called Brian. "

477
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,492
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

478
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,528
Right.
This is the plan.

479
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,190
Now, this is the palace
on Caesar's Square.

480
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,098
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street under cover of night...

481
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,729
and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

482
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,798
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

483
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,437
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the P.F. J.,

484
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,039
will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head,

485
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,313
though he himself will not be taking
part in any terrorist action...

486

- Solidarity, brother.

Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.

489
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,623
[Francis] Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

490
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,893
There is a Roman feast later
in the evening, so you must move fast.

491
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,901
And don't wear
your best sandals.

492
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,700

Every night, they take me down for
20 minutes, then they hang me up again,

which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

561

taught me to respect the Romans,

never get anywhere in this life...

- Come on, out with it.

988
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,486
Well, they think
I'm the Messiah, Mum.

989
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,920
What have you
been telling them?

990
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,288
- Nothing. I only...
- You're only making it worse for yourself.

991
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,886
- I can explain.
- Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!

992
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:02,625
- [Gasps]
- Your son is a born leader.

993
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:06,362
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

994
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:09,371
They believe he can give them hope...
hope of a new life,

995
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,907
a new world,
a better future!

996
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,374
- Who's that?
- [Gasps]

997
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:19,506
That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.

998
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,516
Hmm. Aaah!

999
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,349
- Ohhh!
- Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!

1000
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,393
Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

1001
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,691
Now, you listen here.
He's not the Messiah!

1002
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,028
He's a very naughty boy.
Now, go away!

1003
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:41,161
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.

1004
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:45,697
Behold his mother!
Behold his mother!

1005
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,176
Hail to thee,
mother of Brian!

1006
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:53,773
Blessed art thou!
Hosanna!

1007
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:57,479
All praise to thee,
now and always!

1008
01:05:57,554 --> 01:06:00,785
Well, now don't think
you can get around me like that.

1009
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:04,349
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

1010
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,495
- Now, shove off!
- No!

1011
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:13,025
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!

1012
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,003
Oh, I see.
It's like that, is it?

1013
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,473
- Yes!
- Oh, all right, then.

1014
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,273
You can see him for one minute,
but not one second more!

1015
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,837
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1016
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:30,079
- Promise?
- Well... all right.

1017
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,816
All right, here he is, then.
Come on, Brian. Come and talk.

1018
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:37,291
- But, Mum, Judith.
- Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.

1019
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,328
I don't really want to.

1020
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,455

- Good morning.
- A blessing! A blessing!

No, no. Please.
Please, please listen.

1024
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,776
I've got one or two
things to say.

1025
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,407
Tell us!
Tell us both of them!

1026

Look, you've
got it all wrong.

1027
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,913
You don't need to follow me.

1028
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:09,254
You don't need
to follow anybody.

1029
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,657
You've got to think
for yourselves.

1030
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:14,492
You're all individuals.

1031
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:17,829
[Together]
Yes, we're all individuals!

1032
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:19,926
You're all different.

1033
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,166
Yes, we're all different!

1034
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,935
- I'm not.
- Shhh.

1035
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:29,672
You've all got to work it
out for yourselves.

1036
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:33,876
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

1037
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,941
Exactly.

1038
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,249
Tell us more!

1039
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:42,849
No! That's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

1040
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,951
Otherwise... Ow!

1041
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:47,053
That's enough.

Ooh, that wasn't a minute!

- Oh, yes it was!
- Oh, no it wasn't!

1044

Now, stop that!
And go away!

- Yes?

- Are you a virgin?
- I beg your pardon!

1047

Well, if it's not a personal
question, are you a virgin?

1048

If it's not
a personal question?

1049
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,990
How much more personal
can you get?

I say, could you just
see my wife?

You'll have to wait,
I'm afraid.

We've got
a luncheon appointment.

is the ex-mayor of Gath!

Brian, can I introduce the gentleman
who's letting us have the Mounts on Sunday?

1064
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:11,306
- Don't push!
- And keep the noise down!

have to wait for a few minutes.

Um, women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

Brian? Brian,
you were fantastic.

1069
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:31,159
You weren't so bad yourself.

1070
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,226
No. What you said just now.
It was quite extraordinary.

1071
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,237
What?
All that, was it?

1072
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,432
We don't any leaders.
You're so right.

- Reg has been dominating us for too long.
- Well, yes.

1074
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:45,144
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian.
- You're very attractive.

1075
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:48,479
It's our revolution.
We can all do it together.

- I think. I think...
- We're all behind you, Brian.

- The revolution is in your hands!
- What?

what I meant at all!

Give it a miss?

1100

- Yeah. Thank you, Reg.

1112
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,036
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

1113
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:51,073
unless we can smash the Roman Empire
within the next 12 months.

1114
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,074
- Twelve months, yeah?
- Twelve months.

1115
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,600
And let's face it, as empires
go, this is the big one,

1116
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,945
so we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talkin' about it.

1117
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,918
- Hear! Hear!
- It's action that counts, not words.

1118
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,352
- And we need action now!
- Hear! Hear!

1119
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,447
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

1120
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,960
talkin', passin' resolutions,
makin' clever speeches.

1121
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,360
It's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

1122
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,866
So let's just stop gabbin' on about it.
It's completely pointless.

1123
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,902
- And it's gettin' us nowhere.
- Right!

1124
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,437
I agree. This is a complete
waste of time.

1125
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:26,307
- They've arrested Brian!
- What? What?

1126
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,037
They dragged him off!
They want to crucify him!

1127
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:32,638
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

1128
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,273
- What?
- Immediate!

1129
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,783
- Right.
- New motion?

1130
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,184
Completely new motion.
Uh, that, uh,

1131
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,950
that there be
immediate action...

1132
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,651
- Once the vote has been taken.
- Obviously once the vote's been taken.

1133
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:47,856
- You can't act on a resolution till you've voted on it.
- Reg, let's go now, please!

1134
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,958
- Right! In the light of fresh information from Sibling Judith.
- Not so fast, Reg.

1135
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,903
Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple.

1136
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:00,033
All you've got to do
is to go out of that door now...

1137
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,669
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1138
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,647
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!

1139
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,276
Can't you understand?

1140
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:11,286
Oh!

1141
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,015
- [Door Slams]
- Ooh. Ooh. Yup.

1142
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,458
A little ego trip
from the feminists?

1143
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,018
- What?
- Oh, sorry, Loretta?

1144
01:13:21,097 --> 01:13:23,122
Uh, read that back,
would you?

1145
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:38,840
Next? Crucifixion?

1146
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,849

01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:40,685
That's the motion to get on with it,
passed with one abstention.

1305
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:43,384
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a seconder for...

1306
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,552
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.

1307
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,039
Oh, no!

1308
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,771
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it!

1309
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,837
There's still
a few crosses left.

1310
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:09,974
Up you go, Big Nose.

1311
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:13,044
- I'll get you for this, you bastard.
- Oh, yeah?

1312
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:16,386
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I never forget a face.
- No?

so hard, you Roman git!

I'm not Jewish!

- I'm a Samaritan!
- A Samaritan?

1317

to be a Jewish section.

You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1319

It may not matter to you, Roman, but it
certainly matters to us, doesn't it, darling?

1320
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,642
- Oh, rather!
- Under the terms of the Roman occupancy,

1321
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,686
we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1322
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,313
Pharisees separate
from Sadducees.

1323
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,517
- [Men Grumbling]
- And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1324
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:54,528
All right, all right, all right.
We'll soon settle this.

1325
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:59,090
Hands up all those who don't
want to be crucified here.

1326
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,227
- [All Grunting]
- Right. Next!

1327
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:05,239
- Uh, look. It's not my cross.
- What?

1328
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:08,105
Um, it's not my cross.
I was, um, holding it for someone.

1329
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,110
Just lie down.
I haven't got all day.

1330
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,544
No, of course. Look.
I hate to make a fuss...

1331
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:15,947
Look. We've had a busy day.
There's 140 of you lot to get up.

1332
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:18,578
- Is he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?

1333
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,884
We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

1334
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:24,221
- Belt up!
- Will you let me down if he comes back?

1335
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:26,887
Yeah, yeah,
we'll let you down. Next!

1336
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:29,795
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to take orders.

1337
01:24:29,865 --> 01:24:32,129
I like orders.

1338
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,490
See? Not so bad,
once you're up.

1339
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,527
You being rescued, then,
are you?

1340
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,529
It's a bit late for that now,
isn't it?

1341
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,963
Oh, now, now. We've got
a couple of days up here.

1342
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,000
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1343
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:09,560
- Oh?
- Yeah. My brother usually rescues me,

1344
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:12,198
if he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1345
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,208
- Oh?
- Randy little bugger.

Hello.
Your family arrived, then?

1349
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:28,488
- Hello, Sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.

1350
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:33,153
Well, I think I should point out first, Brian,
in all fairness, we are not the rescue committee.

1351
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:36,095
However, I have been asked to read
the following prepared statement...

1352
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,155
on behalf of the movement.

1353

on a personal note, my own admiration...

for us, Brian,

for you a very difficult time.
