Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

1298
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:02,710
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

1300
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,722
So, what would be the easiest toy to make?
One for boys and one for girls.

1301
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,057
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

1302

and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

make enough gifts to meet our quota?

Yeah, it is possible.

1306
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,867
It is, but, Fred, that's not what
the kids asked for.

1307
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,496
Yeah, but all that matters is that
each of the kids get a toy.

1308
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,708
That they all have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

somebody who's thinking about them.

Get out there, big guy.

1618

Mind if I take her away for a second?

01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:26,046
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

So I thought maybe you should just
sort of clean up your act, you know?

Have a great new wardrobe to start off
the new year. You're a Claus.

Get out there. You know,
look at your dad. He's so dapper.

01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:49,778
Don't do it to me.
I'm trying to be positive.

1629
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:54,445
Oh, but I'm positive too. I'm positive
I'm right. You need a new wardrobe.
