1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,095
Mac, you've got to
see this movie, dude.

2
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:07,919
- Really? I found it boring.
- It's about the end of the world.

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,885
Inconvenient Truth is not about that.

4
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:11,924
It's about how,
if we don't stop global warming,

5
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,116
- we're gonna destroy this environment.
- It sounds cool. I'll check it out.

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,140
It's awesome.

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:19,347
Dude, come on. What the hell is that?

8
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:20,807
What?

9
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:22,183
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,276
What is the big deal, Dennis?

11
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,816
What is the big deal?
Are you nuts?

12
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:28,231
You see a movie,
now you're crazy about the environment.

13
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:31,327
I'm sorry. Maybe I would actually
like to do some good in this world.

14
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:32,777
- Make a difference.
- You would?

15
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:34,672
-You want to do good?
- Yes. I do.

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,697
- You're not good at that.
- I can do good.

17
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,324
I am capable of doing good.

18
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,659
You just screw people over
for your own benefit.

19
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:42,751
You guys are gonna be so angry
when you look back

20
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,493
and see that the world looks
at Dennis Reynolds and says, "Dennis,

21
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,155
"you are a good person,
you are making a dif... "

22
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,003
Holy shit!

23
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,630
What?

24
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,240
There's a baby in
this Dumpster.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,837
What the hell is it doing?

28
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:36,389
- We got to call somebody.
- Who? The police?

29
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:37,790
The mother?
I mean, think, Dee.

30
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,942
Somebody threw this baby in the trash.
We can't put it back into the system.

31
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:43,094
- It's a terrible system.
- It's a horrible system!

32
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:46,137
We live in a throwaway culture.
Everyone's looking for the easy way out.

33
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,775
Don't wanna carry your Big Gulp?
Just throw it in the street.

34
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,492
Don't want to take care of your baby?
Throw it in a Dumpster.

35
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:52,523
I just can't take it!

36
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,700
- Charlie, you're harping on it!
- I'm sorry.

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,442
I'd like to know whether or not
I share a bed with my father!

38
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,862
I'm telling you,
I am not your father! Enough!

39
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,711
- Then take a stupid blood test!
- I'm not taking no blood test!

40
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:05,036
Look, I had enough of this,
I'm not even gonna talk...

41
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,704
What the hell is that?

42
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,316
It's a baby we found in the trash.

43
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,460
Put it back.
It doesn't belong to you.

44
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:14,086
We're not going to put it back.

45
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,133
Give it to the cops.
Get it out of here.

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,945
- It's bad for business.
- That's great.

47
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,830
Pass the buck...
Everybody passing the buck, you know?

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,763
It's time we start taking responsibility
for the refuse we're creating.

49
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,049
Oh, my God, dude.

50
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:27,642
Are you still harping on that
stupid global heating movie

51
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:29,394
- you saw?
- Globalwarming, Charlie.

52
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:31,208
Yeah, right.

53
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:34,029
Like the Earth is magically
getting hotter.

54
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,096
Stop!

55
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,128
This is not the right
environment for a child.

56
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:40,196
I'll take care of the baby until we
figure out what to do with it. Dee,

57
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,157
- you're helping me.
- What? No, I'm not.

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,677
See what's happening here?
Do you see this?

59
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:48,318
Family values in this country
are going down the toilet.

60
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,298
It's because of people like you.
Men and women raising a child together

61
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:53,403
is a proven system
a thousand years old.

62
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:55,882
There're parental roles
that need to be filled here, right?

63
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:58,631
Otherwise, the kid winds up
roaming the streets, having

64
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:01,175
unprotected sex
with multiple partners,

65
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:02,927
sharing needles and contracting

66
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,745
the HIV virus and it's all your fault.
Are you happy, Dee?

67
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,698
Is this what you wanted? You just gave
this baby full-blown AIDS!

68
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,314
What the hell are
these scrubs doing, dude?

69
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:22,625
They're activists.
They're sifting through the trash

70
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,425
looking for recyclable materials.

71
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,409
Recycling? What a waste.

72
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,780
Frank, we are trying
to make a difference.

73
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,711
You see, he has no problem
not calling me "Dad."

74
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,748
Uh, hey, man, where can I get
one of those recycle bags?

75
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,241
Get lost, narc.

76
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,716
Excuse me?

77
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,167
What we're doing is
completely legal,

78
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,947
you just leave us alone?

79
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:49,098
I'm not a cop, man.
I just want to help out.

80
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,285
Sure, you do. I saw you pull up
in that Range Rover.

81
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,644
Is everything okay, Sage?

82
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:56,589
No, everything is fine.
I was just explaing to your friend that

83
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,232
- I wanna help you guys out.
- Listen,

84
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:01,660
I know your type...
straight edge, mainline,

85
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:04,536
weekend warrior coming
down here in your cashmere sweater,

86
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,449
with your moussed-up,
hair-sprayed coif.

87
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,118
This isn't just a hobby for us,

88
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,641
so why don't you take your phony,
suburban, half-assed bullshit

89
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:13,914
someplace else?

90
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,767
I'll take that, hippie!

91
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:25,677
Hey, Frank!

92
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,382
Can you believe this thing, man?

93
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,649
Charlie !

94
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,368
Get down!

95
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:43,856
This is amazing!
Look at this!

96
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,614
You could chop a camel right in the hump
and drink all of its milk

97
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,978
right off the tip of this thing!

98
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:49,411
That is a find, man!

99
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,243
- It's an Ali Baba sword!
- Spectacular!

100
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:52,953
Let's get out of here.

101
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,163
Look at this.

102
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,465
I don't care about that, all right?
You're making me look like an asshole.

103
00:04:57,545 --> 00:05:00,340
I'm trying to make a difference,
and you're over here rummaging

104
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,753
like a couple of narcs, okay?

105
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,657
You can't just come down here
with your mainline, cashmere,

106
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:09,204
moussed coif hairspray
and start being like a suburban tool!

107
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:14,475
What are you saying?
Did you even look at this thing?

108
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:17,506
I don't know. I think I just got
punk'd out by a couple of hippies.

109
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:20,648
I got to do something about
this.

110
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,265
God damn this dumbster baby's heavy!

111
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,524
No, it's good for your back.

112
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,318
All right, so we got the
diapers and the wipes and the
powder.

113
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,074
Shit, this raising babies is easy.

114
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,453
Okay, first things first. Baby smells
like trash. Throw it in the bath.

115
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,619
- Already with this?
- I didn't do it.

116
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,667
Already with this?
I come home to a crying baby?

117
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:41,544
I didn't do anything. It's okay.

118
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:43,501
You know what?
I'm just gonna kick back,

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,047
grab a beer, and watch the Sixers.

120
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,299
You're not gonna help me
and do this with you?

121
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,590
Would it kill you to go shopping
once in a while?

122
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:50,942
- We're out of beer.
- We are?

123
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,055
We're not out of anything,
You don't live here.

124
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,890
One left.

125
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,242
If we're gonna raise
this baby together,

126
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,986
I think it's important that we at
least try to make it work, so,

127
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,006
when you're done with the bath,
why don't you go out and get some beer?

128
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,088
And, um... a pack of smokes
would be good.

129
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,369
We're not gonna raise anything
together. You know why?

130
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,503
I said I would help you hang
onto this baby for

131
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,841
a couple of days until
we figure out what to do with it.

132
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,783
Really?

133
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:14,851
- You're gonna raise your voice to me?
- I'm not.

134
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,563
I'm trying to have a conversation,
I feel like you're berating me

135
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,386
for absolutly no reason.
So, you know what?

136
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,664
For the sake of the baby,
I think we need some space.

137
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:23,966
I'm gonna go out with the guys
and blow off some steam.

138
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,856
You're gonna dump
this thing on me and leave?

139
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:28,465
You gonna guilt me into staying?
Okay, I guess I have to stay.

140
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,737
For the sake of Dumpster baby.

141
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,516
But I'll tell you what. I'm not gonna
stand here and be berated.

142
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:33,739
I'm going to bed.

143
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:43,898
Charlie!

144
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,530
Would you just please lay there
and go to sleep?

145
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,202
I can't sleep, dude. It's impossible.

146
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:50,002
My mind's going like a mile a minute.

147
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,201
Stop thinking about it.
I'm not your father.

148
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,212
- Now, go to sleep.
- Dude, it's not that.

149
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:56,887
I'm thinking about something
completely different.

150
00:06:57,775 --> 00:07:00,915
- It's the trash, isn't it?
- It's the sweet, sweet trash.

151
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:03,684
I mean, man, we found some
amazing shit out there, today.

152
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,587
The kind of shit I didn't think
you could find in the trash, you know?

153
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,978
I'm just going nuts thinking
about what else is out there.

154
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,072
Frank, there's ordinary guys
just like you and me

155
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,892
going through everyone else's trash.

156
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:16,112
People don't appreciate
their trash, Frank.

157
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,056
Let's go get the flashlights.

158
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:27,109
So I scale this tree.
This is a big tree, too, right?

159
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:30,263
I get to the top of it, I find
the nest. This is baby bluebirds.

160
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,531
They're starving to death, so I
regurgitate my lunch

161
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,367
nourish the entire flock...

162
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,016
Well, well, well,
check it out, babe, the narc is back.

163
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,206
Hey, uh, Sage,

164
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,074
I thought about what you said and

165
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,511
I think you were right, man,
I was half-assing it,

166
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:48,381
but I'm not gonna half-ass it anymore.

167
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,423
I'm gonna devote myself
completely to the cause.

168
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,459
Look, bro, just 'cause you come
in here with your Birkenstocks

169
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,810
and your Phish T- shirt
doesn't mean you're devoted.

170
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,389
It means you're a total poser.

171
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:01,570
Wow, um...

172
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:05,213
You know what, man?
I'm just gonna go, then, I guess.

173
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:08,306
You know, I'll take my Birkenstocks
and my Phish T- shirt

174
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,694
- and my kine bud with me.
- What?

175
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,418
Did you just say you had kine bud?

176
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:19,004
Kine bu... Yeah, I mean, you know,
I just have, like,

177
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,626
this much.

178
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,440
- Look at this, a little ray gun, like.
- That's nice!

179
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,241
Look at this thing right here, dude.

180
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,399
Put this in a plastic bag and boom!
Shower radio, buddy.

181
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:35,259
- Unbelievable.
- Look at this.

182
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,365
We wrap stuff in this.

183
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,763
Look... wrap it all up.

184
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,225
Electrics? Electrics!

185
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:47,525
- &A sneaker!
- What size?

186
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,815
- 14.
- Throw it in the pile, baby.

187
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,377
Right in the pile.

188
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:53,415
Oh, Charlie, isn't this great?

189
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,779
We go right to the source,
forget about the dump.

190
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,667
Yeah, screw the dump, man.
It's right in your backyard, dude.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,876
This is it.

192
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,328
- What's that? What's that?
- It's another coat, man!

193
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,349
- Ooh, can I have it?
- No.

194
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,481
- You already got one.
- Frank, use your head.

195
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,662
This is the coat that's gonna
protect my other coat.

196
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:09,752
Come on, man.

197
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,560
- When you're right, you're right.
- Yeah, baby, you'll find one.

198
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,970
If you keep digging, you're
gonna find one of these.

199
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,878
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

200
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,346
Oh, hello.

201
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,422
Look who it is, huh?

202
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,091
The girl who ruined my life,
by falling in love with my best friend

203
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,297
and having sex
with this guy right here.

204
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,105
- How you doin'?
- Gross,

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,972
and gross to you. You know what?
I don't know what you're doing.

206
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,402
I don't want to know.
Do it in somebody else's Dumpster.

207
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,239
Hold on a second.
What do you got in those?

208
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,741
Coffee cups and food scraps.

209
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,995
- Yeah, we'll take 'em.
- Hand 'em over.

210
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,538
- I don't know why it's cranky.
- Maybe he's hungry, all right?

211
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,716
- Should we nursing it?
- I haven't slept in 3 days.

212
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,425
I don't have any thoughts anymore.

213
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,086
Raising a child is not nearly as fun
as I thought it'd be.

214
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:59,218
Well, what if we put it back
where we found it?

215
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,315
Oh, my God, that is the cutest
little baby I've ever seen.

216
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,395
What's his name?

217
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,461
- Uh, his name?
- It's...

218
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,316
- D.B.
- D.B.

219
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,741
Oh, he could be a Gerber baby.

220
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,501
He could be in commercials.

221
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,609
- I have an idea.
- I'm three steps ahead of you.

222
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,996
- We need to make Dumpster baby a star.
- Exactly.

223
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:31,402
This is what I'm talking about. We can't
put it back into a corrupt system.

224
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,335
We have an opportunity
to give it a future.

225
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:34,888
Yes, by making it a star.

226
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,076
And who have better
lives than child stars?

227
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,091
- Nobody.
- Rich, famous, they have it all.

228
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,121
They're the happiest people on hearth.

229
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:44,789
D.B, my main man, you got tossed
into the right Dumpster.

230
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:52,617
Brenda, I'm not gonna waste any more
of your time than I have to.

231
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,315
We've got meetings with agents
all over town.

232
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:57,025
Can you make D.B. a star?

233
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,968
Well, I'm sorry to say,
but in today's commercial world,

234
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,666
there's just no room for
another white baby actor.

235
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,117
There's an influx already.

236
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,493
White babies don't sell.

237
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,282
White babies aren't selling right now.

238
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:10,122
Question: who is selling, Brenda?

239
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:13,751
Well, the Latino market is the fastest
growing demographic in the country.

240
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,887
- Great. So Mexicans are selling.
- Oh, well, D.B. can play Mexican.

241
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,380
D.B. could definitely be a Mexican.

242
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:19,923
We get him some pistols.

243
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,542
He fires 'em off like crazy.
Do the jumping thing.

244
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,553
He does the Mexican jumping bean.

245
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,777
We get him a little thing
with the chips.

246
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,837
And he can dip the chips
into the nacho cheese.

247
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,426
- It's perfect.
- It's hilarious.

248
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,062
For all we know, he is Mexican.

249
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,877
- 'Cause here's the thing.
- Oh, oh, we got...

250
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,400
I can't really get into the specifics
of the whole thing,

251
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,096
but we've got no idea
who D.B.'s dad is.

252
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,197
We don't know who the dad is.
It isn't me...

253
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,117
Sorry, but your son
just does not look Latino.

254
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,799
Oh, well, I mean, that's a bit of a...

255
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,691
- disappointment for us.
- That makes me sad.

256
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:55,563
Because we're truly trying
to give him a future.

257
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,960
Is there anything we can do?

258
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:01,131
Not unless you can change
the color of this baby's skin.

259
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:05,010
Let me get this straight.

260
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:07,846
You want to put your baby
into a tanning bed?

261
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:11,521
- That's correct.
- I'm sorry, that's against the law.

262
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,911
Look, pal, we are well
aware of the law, okay?

263
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,262
We don't want to jam you up.

264
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:17,789
We just want to put him in there
for a couple of minutes.

265
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:18,954
Just to get a base.

266
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,207
We'll sign whatever waivers
or whatever you need.

267
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,237
Let us cook him,
and we'll be out of your hair.

268
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,864
I'm feeling compelled to call
the authorities.

269
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:29,235
Oh, are you? Then why don't we take
our business elsewhere?

270
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,135
I sense some judgment in your voice,
sir, and I don't appreciate it.

271
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,498
You could have help change
this child's life forever.

272
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,405
You chose not to.
That's on you.

273
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:37,942
I can live with that.

274
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:39,240
Come on, D.B.

275
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,000
I guess the road to stardom is paved
with hard knocks and orange assholes.

276
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:46,753
Trees are people, too!

277
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,053
Save this tree!

278
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:51,667
These developer pigs
are gonna tear down this tree.

279
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,393
So tonight, we will hold
a candlelight vigil

280
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,667
in protest.

281
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,552
Sage, Asrael,
can we commune for a moment?

282
00:12:58,602 --> 00:12:59,609
Yeah, what's up?

283
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:02,245
Listen, I don't want to be
putting out any negative vibrations

284
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,529
or anything like that, but I think we're
going about this the wrong way.

285
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,138
Thanks, but we got it.

286
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,949
Why don't we hear him out, Sage?

287
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,185
Thanks, Asrael.

288
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,261
Well, listen, while I think
lighting a couple of candles

289
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,984
and singing a few sweet jams
sounds like a really good time,

290
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,876
it's not gonna stop a bulldozer.

291
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,546
Somebody needs to step up and be
a hero here. So I'm thinking,

292
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,667
I would chain myself to that tree,

293
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,303
and that way, if they want to kill
that tree, they got to kill me first.

294
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,722
That is so brave of
you, Dennis.

295
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,376
- Is it?
- Wait.

296
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:37,460
If anyone is gonna chain themselves
to anything, it's gonna be me.

297
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,314
- But it was Dennis' idea.
- No, wait, Asrael, he's right.

298
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,982
Maybe it should be him.

299
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:43,942
Right, I'm the one in charge here.

300
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:45,569
You're the one in charge.

301
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,280
- Right, Mountain, go get some chains.
- No, wait.

302
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,491
hold off on that, Mountain.

303
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,811
I brought some.

304
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,707
Charlie, we gotta stop, we gotta stop.

305
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:58,652
- Two more, let's keep it moving.
- We gotta drop off at the base camp.

306
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:00,876
No, no, base camp.
We got to keep moving.

307
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,556
Do not lose that! Do not lose that!

308
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:08,091
I think we gotta stop.
We gotta stop at the apartment.

309
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,079
- No, dude, no time for that, man.
- We gotta drop some stuff.

310
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,721
All right, fine. Well, make it quick.

311
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,965
All right.

312
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:18,268
Charlie, maybe we should get rid
of some of this shit.

313
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:20,440
- What?
- Yeah.

314
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:22,505
- What'd you say, get rid of it?
- Yeah.

315
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,911
Frank, look at this. Huh?

316
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,612
This-This... look at that, bro.

317
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,663
This shit is our future, man.

318
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,981
People are throwing this away.
Get rid of it, dude?

319
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,551
Frank, we start getting rid of this,

320
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,657
we're gonna just like
the wasters out there.

321
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,309
Guess what?
Somebody else is gonna find it.

322
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,124
You're right, you're right.

323
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,709
Where are we gonna sleep?

324
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,230
So you still want to do this?

325
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:55,297
Mountain, this is what
it's all about.

326
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:59,450
Me and my girl, side by side,
saving a life,

327
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,521
bringing in the dawn together.
I mean, come on.

328
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:06,586
- Looks like it's gonna rain.
- It does look like it's gonna rain.

329
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:07,818
Have you seen Asrael?

330
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:09,672
No.

331
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,861
Wonder where she is.

332
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,827
Tonight, we cross the plane of reality

333
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,738
into the dimension
of no place or time.

334
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,189
Open your mouth.

335
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:31,331
Become the journey.

336
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,160
What are we doing, man?

337
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:37,639
It's pouring rain out here!

338
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,814
- We're like animals.
- Look, we got to stick together,

339
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,596
- we gonna make it.
- We stick together.

340
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,994
- All right, let's use our heads.
- What are we gonna do?

341
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,795
- We got to get off of this rain.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,226
Where are we gonna go?

343
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,154
We could get in that Dumpster.

344
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:55,991
I'm not above that.
Let's go.

345
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:58,063
Asrael!

346
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:01,484
Where are you?!

347
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,050
- Can I get a bite of that, dude?
- Okay.

348
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,773
I'm starving.

349
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:29,769
Charlie, I'm really sorry
that I banged your girlfriend.

350
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,967
Bro, you got to stop talking
about that, dude.

351
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,158
I'm also sorry that I
didn't get the blood test.

352
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:37,724
But I know I'm a hundred percent
positive that I am not your dad.

353
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,762
How can you be
a hundred percent positive?

354
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,034
How do you know?

355
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,398
Your mother and I were gonna
keep this a secret, but...

356
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:48,465
After we made love,
she did get pregnant.

357
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:50,522
But she had an abortion.

358
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,524
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,634
Are you sure
she went through with it, dude?

360
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:57,926
Maybe she didn't tell you.

361
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,455
She probably went right from the clinic,
banged some guy

362
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:03,725
and got knocked up,
because your mother was a giant whore.

363
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,350
You know what, dude?
I don't believe you, Frank.

364
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,939
- It's hard to take.
- Oh, my God. You're a liar, man.

365
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,103
Where are you going,
Charlie?!

366
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:16,761
To find out the
truth!

367
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,175
Charlie!

368
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,014
- Frank doesn't know the truth.
- I knew it.

369
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:37,894
All right, you didn't have an abortion,
you just told him you did.

370
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,344
- I get that.
- No.

371
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,135
I had an abortion,
it just didn't take.

372
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,642
What does that mean?

373
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,439
It means you survived it.

374
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,816
You survived the abortion.

375
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,558
What the hell
are you talking about, Ma?

376
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:57,099
We went to one of those clinics,
one of those underground clinics

377
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,311
because Frank didn't want
to spend a lot of money.

378
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,090
And I had the procedure
and then they told me you were dead.

379
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:07,112
And then, three month later,
you popped out, happy as a clam.

380
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:11,126
Sweetie, I had to keep it a
secret from Frank.

381
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,853
I never wanted the abortion
in the first place.

382
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,297
But he was married,

383
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,300
I knew if he found out,
he would've forced me to get rid of you,

384
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,015
once and for all.

385
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,778
He would've made me
throw you in a Dumpster.

386
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:31,058
Oh... my... God.

387
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,525
- No, his skin need to be darker, Dee.
- Yeah, I know.

388
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,839
We're just gonna paint
this bronzing lotion on him

389
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,512
- Shoe polish.
- Shoe polish?

390
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,602
Shoe polish on a baby?
You are such an idiot.

391
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,350
Gonna look stupid and smell like shit.

392
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,563
We'll see.

393
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,379
Where's D.B ?

394
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,751
My door's open.

395
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,329
- Did he get kidnapped?
- Somebody took him?

396
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,640
There's a note.

397
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:53,600
"Taked baby.

398
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:56,142
"Meet at later bar,
night or day sometime."

399
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,875
Charlie.

400
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:02,093
Feast your eyes on this.

401
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,353
Oh, my God, Charlie,
where did you get a baby?

402
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,227
I think you know good and well
where I got this baby now, don't you?

403
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,041
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you and Frank

404
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,981
throwing your love child here
in the Dumpster behind Paddy's Pub.

405
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,421
Do you think I wouldn't find out?

406
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,328
Well, I did, yeah.

407
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,858
What you might not know,
is that this little baby of yours

408
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,780
also happens to be my half brother.

409
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,368
Charlie, the incident with Frank
happened three months ago.

410
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:27,029
It takes nine months to make a baby.

411
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,454
So you can just give me the baby
and stop screaming.

412
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:31,442
There was time
where I would've helped you

413
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,932
raise this little Dumpster baby
brother of mine like a son,

414
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,055
that's gone now 'cause you ruined it!

415
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:37,999
You threw your babies away!

416
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:39,965
And you threw your swords away!

417
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,467
You threw your golf clubs and
your tasty treats!

418
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:45,024
And you know what? I found them.

419
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,638
And I'm gonna raise all of them.

420
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:49,795
Get me the number for Child Services.

421
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,065
Sage, buddy, how are you, man?
How're you feeling?

422
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,875
I did it. I saved the tree.

423
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,403
You sure did, man.

424
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,111
You saved that tree.

425
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,959
I got to say, I'm really impressed.

426
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,715
I could've done
what you did here today.

427
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:09,748
- I'm a hero.
- You are, you're a hero. Come here.

428
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,238
Come here, come with me.

429
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:12,889
Man, it is a good day to be alive.

430
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,710
It's a good day to be alive, isn't it?

431
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,698
Okay, guys, she's all yours.

432
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,718
You might want to see this.

433
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,336
I banged your girlfriend.

434
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,382
What time did he say he
was gonna meet us?

435
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,115
"Later bar, night or day sometime."

436
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,771
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

437
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,611
Hey, any of you guys seen
that Ali Baba sword that Charlie had?

438
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,701
- What?
- The little shit

439
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,350
dumped me in a Dumpster, last night.
I'm taking all the stuff.

440
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:49,492
Every man for himself.

441
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,529
I got to fing another Baba sword.

442
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:54,331
Pour me a shot there, I am the man.

443
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,227
Why are you so chipper?

444
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:58,001
I got punked out
by this peace activist.

445
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:00,817
So what I did is,
I infiltrated his organization,

446
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,763
- I banged his girlfriend...
- Hey, Frank!

447
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:05,550
You recognize this young man
right here?

448
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,986
Or should I say "Hey, Dad"?

449
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:10,246
That's right, everybody.

450
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,922
Who would like to hear
a mind-blowing story?

451
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:15,184
Nobody. Give us back our baby,
so we can paint it.

452
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,242
You're gonna paint it?
Be careful painting it

453
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,217
'cause you'll be painting my brother.

454
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:21,358
I guess you already knew that,
didn't you, Dad?

455
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,485
What the hell are you talking about?

456
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,570
About you and the waitress
duming your baby in a Dumpster.

457
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:29,305
And the abortion that you tried
to make my mom have.

458
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,612
Well, guess what, Frankie?
It didn't take.

459
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,546
I'm an abortion survivor, Dad!

460
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:35,955
- I survived the abortion, Dad!
- First of all,

461
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,797
it takes nine months to have a baby.

462
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,460
That is not my baby.

463
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:44,756
Second of all, your mother is
feeding you a line of crap.

464
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,299
Holy shit, you guys kept
the Ali Baba sword?

465
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,233
Gimme the sword.
That's the sword, I want it.

466
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,399
Back off, man.

467
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,306
- I'm trying to play with it.
- It's my sword.

468
