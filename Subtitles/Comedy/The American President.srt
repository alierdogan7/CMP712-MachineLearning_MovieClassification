I was showing off for a colleague
who doesn't think much of me.

327
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,586
It would be a real injustice to hold the GDC
accountable for my behavior today.

328
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:54,758
On top of which, I am monumentally sorry
for having insulted you like that.

When the city planners sat down to design
Washington, D.C., their intention was...

335
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,113
...to build a city that would intimidate
and humble foreign heads of state.

336
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,741
- It's true.
- I didn't know that.

home-court advantage in the modern world.

It's a long shot at 10.

is uncomfortable...

01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:38,710
Good luck, Mr. President.

1305
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,922
Liberty's moving.

1306
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:47,386
- Mr. President. Can we have a moment?
JANIE: He's incredibly late.

1307
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,680
Hop in, we'll talk in the car.

1308
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,725
SHEPHERD: What is it?
LEWIS: We have a small problem.

1309
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,186
ROBIN: It could've been small.
It's a medium nightmare.

1310
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,523
LEWIS: It's an opportunity.
ROBIN: It could have been if we'd caught it.

1311
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,149
- We caught it.
- At 5:45.

1312
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,819
It doesn't do me any good.
Network news is in make-up.

1313
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:08,365
- Twelve people work for you...
- Guys, do I have to be here for this?

1314
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:12,119
Sorry, sir. Uh, it's on the evening news,
it's buried as the third story.

1315
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,787
It's got a bullet.

1316
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:17,082
Sydney was at a protest rally.
They burned a flag.

1317
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,334
- Today?
LEWIS: About 13 years ago.

1318
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,671
In front of the Department of Commerce.
Anti-apartheid.

1319
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,590
Uh, let me see if I got this.

1320
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,551
The third story on the news...

1321
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,138
...was that someone I didn't know
13 years ago, when I wasn't president...

1322
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:35,350
...went to a demonstration where no laws
were broken, in protest of something...

1323
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:39,396
...that so many people were against,
doesn't exist anymore.

1324
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,274
Just out of curiosity,
what was the fourth story?

1325
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,235
Right. See, I think it's important
when we deal with it...

1326
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,154
SHEPHERD:
Don't deal with it.

1327
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,906
- Excuse me?
- Trying to get us to swing at the dirt.

1328
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,159
Nobody wins these fights. It'll go away.

1329
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,831
LEWIS: Sir, I'm not sure
that's the wisest course of action.

1330
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,083
SHEPHERD: Hell.
ROBIN: It's already distracting you.

1331
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,294
SHEPHERD:
No. You reminded me

1332
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,504
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Sydney tonight.

1333
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,467
Oh, it's terrific. Beth, I love it.

1334
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:12,429
I can't believe I'm loaning you clothes.
I thought you owned everything.

1335
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:13,722
Well, work clothes.

1336
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,434
I always wear a suit at the White House.
I thought a dress would be nice.

1337
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,479
Go ahead. Try it on.
I brought earrings too.

1338
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,731
[PHONE RINGING]

1339
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,733
- Hello.
SHEPHERD: Hi, what are you doing?

1340
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,985
Uh, just trying on dresses.

1341
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,988
I feel terrible,
but I'll have to cancel our date tonight.

1342
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,865
SYDNEY: Another woman?
- Heh, no.

1343
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:35,077
I've gotta go to St. Louis
to avert a massive airline strike.

1344
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,537
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that one.

1345
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,539
Thanks for understanding.
I'll call you later.

1346
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,333
Okay, bye.

1347
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,711
Oh, I hate doing that.
She was trying on dresses.

1348
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:46,838
LEWIS:
I tell any girl I'm going out with...

1349
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:50,383
...to assume that all plans are soft
until she receives confirmation...

1350
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,637
...30 minutes beforehand.
- And they find this romantic?

1351
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,597
I say it with a great deal of charm.

1352
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,683
Look! There it is!
Carmen's House of Flowers.

1353
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,227
- Coop, we gotta stop.
LEWIS: What?

1354
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,853
I gotta get her flowers.

1355
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,105
- Here?
- Now?

1356
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,148
That's what men do
when they break a date.

1357
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,526
That's not what men do.
I don't know men who do that.

1358
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,820
I'm gonna hop out at the flower shop.

1359
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,947
- You'll "hop out," sir?
- He's not hopping.

1360
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,490
No hopping, sir.

1361
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,035
- Stay in the car. I'll get the flowers.
SHEPHERD: It's not gonna be personal.

1362
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,455
LEWIS: Let them do a security sweep.
We don't know who's in there.

1363
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:25,168
The florist is planning an assassination
on the off-chance I might stop by?

1364
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,753
It's possible.

1365
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,256
WOMAN:
No, no.

1366
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,342
You're not hearing me.
Listen to what I'm saying.

1367
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:35,178
It was at the basketball game.

1368
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,429
Excuse me.

1369
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:39,141
No, girl, at the game.
Kiki wasn't even there.

1370
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,893
- Excuse me?
- Ha, ha. Ugh, hold on.

1371
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,521
I will be right with you.

1372
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,899
SHEPHERD: I don't know if you're the one
I talked to on the phone...

1373
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,986
Virginia, dogwood, president...

1374
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:54,197
Does any of this ring a bell?

1375
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,408
Same girl, she remembered me.

1376
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,412
RUMSON: I'm glad to see
that the president has a girlfriend.

1377
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,038
Never mind...

1378
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:07,294
...that she's the hired gun of an
ultra-liberal political action committee.

1379
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,505
Never mind...

1380
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,924
...that the president takes the 5th...

1381
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:17,512
...any time a reporter has the temerity
to ask him a question about a woman...

1382
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,849
...in a position
to exert enormous influence...

1383
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,561
...over a huge range of issues.

1384
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:29,608
Never mind that this woman's idea of how
to unwind at the end of a tough day...

1385
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,319
...is to get together with her ACLU pals...

1386
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,863
...and to set American flags on fire.

1387
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,493
No reaction from the White House.

1388
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,705
SHEPHERD: It doesn't need to be dignified
with a response.

1389
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,333
There's no upside. I'm leaving it alone.

1390
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,251
SYDNEY:
What do Lewis and Robin think?

1391
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,337
Brutus and Cassius, heh?

1392
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,256
They want me to get into
a character debate and mix it up.

1393
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,717
Lewis and Robin are very smart.

1394
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,845
- Sydney says you guys are really stupid.
SYDNEY: I didn't say that.

1395
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:02,307
- She's questioning your loyalty.
- I question it all the time.

1396
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,227
Wait a minute.
Here comes my favorite part.

1397
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,689
My name is Bob Rumson
and I'm running for president.

1398
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:14,319
Glad he cleared that up because the crowd
was about to buy some Amway products.

1399
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,363
His numbers are climbing.

1400
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,657
Sydney, his numbers
have nowhere to go but up.

1401
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,617
SYDNEY:
What about yours?

1402
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:24,246
Ugh, we'll be back up in the 60s
once I get the votes for the crime bill.

1403
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,830
So, what are you doing this weekend?

1404
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,167
Uh, I've got work
I was going to bring home. Why?

1405
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,127
Well, negotiations are going pretty well.

1406
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,172
Looks like the nation's
going to keep on flying and, uh...

1407
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,841
...Lucy's spending Saturday night
at a friend's house.

1408
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,551
What do you have in mind?

1409
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,640
You ever been to Camp David?

1410
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,058
[CHUCKLES]

1411
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,894
Camp David. Sure.
I used to go there all the time...

1412
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,522
...but then they changed chefs and I...

1413
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,733
It's sass, right? You're sassing me.

1414
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,443
Ha, ha, yes.

1415
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,363
I'm gonna have somebody pick you up
on Saturday morning.

1416
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,740
Okay. Bye.

1417
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,367
Bye.

1418
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,092
SYDNEY: Mm, good God.
SHEPHERD: What?

1419
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,762
SYDNEY: I'm looking at your college
transcripts. This isn't human.

1420
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:26,891
Nobody gets this many A's.
You were like a Stepford student. Ha, ha.

1421
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,060
Still reading that ridiculous biography?

1422
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,771
No. I finished
Shepherd: Road to the White House.

1423
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,399
Now I'm on to
Shepherd: The Early Years.

- Oh, Andy. C-minus in Women's Studies.

1426
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,034
That course wasn't about...

1427
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,369
...what I thought it was going to be about.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1428
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,872
MAN [ON TV]: President Shepherd
was in Maryland this week...

spent the day at Camp David...

...GOP presidential hopeful...

1434
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:09,267
...Robert Rumson, continued his attacks
on President Shepherd's character.

During the Saturday news program,
Capitol Review with Kenneth Michaels...

1436
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,565
...Senator Rumson suggested that...

1437

...GDC political director,
Sydney Ellen Wade...

1438
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,112
...whose close personal relationship
with the president...

1439
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,157
...has caused the White House headaches
for two months...

1440
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:29,454
...may have traded sexual favors for key
votes in the Virginia State Legislature...

1441
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,665
...while lobbying for
the Virginia Teachers Association.

1442
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:36,753
- That's a heck of an accusation to make...
- I'm not saying...

1443
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,756
Let me be very clear.
I'm not making an accusation.

1444
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:43,051
I am saying, when you hear one thing,
you dismiss it.

1445
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,552
You hear two, you dismiss it.

1446
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,599
But when several, several well-respected
members and former members...

1447
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,727
...of the Virginia State Legislature...
MAN: Can you give us names?

1448
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,439
- He's making this up as he goes along.
- I'm so sorry, Sydney.

1449

I don't know what we call her.
The First Mistress?

1450
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:02,070
Oh, man. My father heard that.

1451
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,447
He's just gonna have to turn a deaf ear.

1452
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,742
My father doesn't have a deaf ear.
He hears fine out of both.

1453
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,787
So do I and so does my sister
and so does my friends.

1454
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,205
You're the only one who...

1455
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:15,750
I can't challenge a school bully to a fight
because he picks on my girlfriend.

1456
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:20,713
I'm not asking you to. I can take care
of myself. It's not about me.

1457
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,966
How can you keep quiet?

1458
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:26,177
How do you have patience for people
who claim to love America...

1459
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,596
...but clearly can't stand Americans?

1460
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,519
I have one election left. I don't have
the luxury of losing my patience.

1461
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:42,068
I, um... I want to say something to you

We lost Jarrett.

then we need to work on our people skills.

We're three votes down again, sir.

Mr. President, as of this morning,
Sydney only needed one more vote.

I don't think there will be
a better opportunity.

1638

The press expects an announcement
on the crime bill by the State of the Union.

If you agree to stick 455 in the drawer
until after the elections...

LEON: There isn't.

It's important legislation that
for the first time has a legitimate chance.

01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,240
- She deserves every opportunity.
LEWIS: "She"?

- It's not that simple.

isn't talking about my presidency.

This poll is talking about my life!

1667

- Two hundred sixty-four million people...
- They don't give a damn about your life.

that isn't true?

1780
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:17,354
Am I not a commander in chief
who's never served in the military?

1781
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:21,775
Am I not opposed to a constitutional
amendment banning flag burning?

1782
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:25,154
Am I not an unmarried father
sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist...

1783
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,407
...down the hall from his daughter?
- You think you're wrong?

1784
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:31,702
You don't win by telling 59 percent of them
that they are.

1785
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:35,747
"We fight the fights we can win"?
You fight the fights that need fighting!

1786
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,834
Is the view pretty good
from the cheap seats, A. J?

1787
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,335
I beg your pardon?

1788
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:44,465
Because it occurs to me that in 25 years
I've never seen your name on a ballot.

1789
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,885
Now, why is that?
Why are you always one step behind me?

1790
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,305
If I wasn't, you'd be
the most popular history professor...

1791
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,056
...at the University of Wisconsin.

1792
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,350
Fuck you!

1793
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,232
Have Lewis put the final draft...

1794
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,611
...of the State of the Union
on my desk in the morning.

1795
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,863
Yes, sir.

1796
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,583
If Mary hadn't died...

1797
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:24,129
...would we have won three years ago?

1798
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:27,758
Would we have won?

1799
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,513
If we had to go through a character debate
three years ago...

1800
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,598
...would we have won?

1801
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,184
I don't know.

1802
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:41,480
But I would have liked that campaign.

1803
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,399
If my friend, Andy Shepherd,
had shown up...

1804
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,110
...I would have liked that campaign
very much.

1805
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,281
Yeah.

1806
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:52,843
ROBIN: Because the president feels there
is no value in this kind of character debate.

1807
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,721
Will the president respond
to Senator Rumson's question...

1808
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,390
...about being a member
of the American Civil Liberties Union?

1809
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,977
Yes, he will. Good morning. It's all right.
Please keep your seats. Good morning.

[REPORTERS MURMURING]

1811
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:13,572
For the last couple of months,
Senator Rumson has suggested...

1812
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:18,076
...that being president of this country
was to a certain extent about character.

1813
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:22,414
Although I have not been willing
to engage in his attacks on me...

1814
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:26,335
...I've been here three years
and three days...

1815
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,755
...and I can tell you without hesitation...

1816
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,591
...being president of this country...

1817
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:36,094
...is entirely about character.

1818
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,013
For the record:

1819
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:41,933
Yes, I am a card-carrying member
of the ACLU.

1820
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,270
But the more important question is:
Why aren't you, Bob?

1821
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,397
Now, this is an organization...

1822
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:50,651
...whose sole purpose is to defend
the Bill of Rights.

1823
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,779
So it naturally begs the question:
Why would a senator...

1824
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:57,783
...his party's most powerful spokesman
and a candidate for president...

1825
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:01,119
...choose to reject
upholding the Constitution?

1826
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:05,123
Now, if you can answer that, folks,
then you're smarter than I am...

1827
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,211
...because I didn't understand it
until a few hours ago.

1828
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,964
America isn't easy.

1829
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:18,136
America is advanced citizenship.
You've gotta want it bad...

1830
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,514
...because it's gonna put up a fight.

1831
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,183
It's gonna say, "You want free speech?

1832
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,436
Let's see you acknowledge a man
whose words make your blood boil...

1833
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:30,107
...who's standing center stage,
advocating at the top of his lungs...

1834
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,944
...that which you would spend
a lifetime opposing at the top of yours.

1835
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:36,571
You want to claim this land
as the land of the free?

1836
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:40,117
Then the symbol of your country
cannot just be a flag.

1837
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,993
The symbol also has to be...

1838
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:47,124
...one of its citizens exercising his right
to burn that flag in protest.

1839
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,086
Now, show me that, defend that,
celebrate that in your classrooms.

1840
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:54,923
Then you can stand up
and sing about 'the land of the free."'

1841
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:59,052
I've known Bob Rumson for years and
I've been operating under the assumption...

1842
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,764
...that the reason Bob devotes
so much energy to shouting at the rain...

1843
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,100
...was that he simply didn't get it.

1844
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,520
Well, I was wrong.
Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it.

1845
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:11,106
Bob's problem is that he can't sell it.

1846
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:14,943
We have serious problems to solve...

1847
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,779
...and we need serious people
to solve them.

1848
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:21,450
And whatever your particular problem is,
I promise you...

1849
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:25,746
...Bob Rumson is not the least bit
interested in solving it.

1850
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:29,666
He is interested in two things
and two things only:

1851
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:33,211
Making you afraid of it,
and telling you who's to blame for it.

1852
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:36,089
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is how you win elections.

1853
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:39,801
You gather a group of middle-aged,
middle-income voters...

1854
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:43,013
...who remember with longing
an easier time. You talk to them...

1855
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:46,349
...about family and American values
and character.

1856
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:50,729
Then you wave an old photo of the
president's girlfriend, scream patriotism...

1857
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:53,982
...tell them she's to blame
for their lot in life...

1858
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,318
...and you go on television...

1859
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,862
...and you call her a whore.

1860
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:02,282
Sydney Ellen Wade
has done nothing to you, Bob.

1861
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,786
She has done nothing
but put herself through school...

1862
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,497
...represent the interest
of public-school teachers...

1863
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,249
...and lobby for the safety
of our natural resources.

1864
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,502
You want a character debate, Bob?

1865
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,170
You better stick with me...

1866
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:18,590
...because Sydney Ellen Wade
is way out of your league.

1868

I lost one to cancer...

1869
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:35,857
...and I lost the other
because I was so busy keeping my job...

1870
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,193
...I forgot to do my job.

1871
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,571
Well, that ends right now.

1872
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:43,532
Tomorrow morning...

1873
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,702
...the White House is sending
a bill to Congress for its consideration.

1874
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:50,413
It's White House Resolution 455...

1875
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,959
...an energy bill,
requiring a 20 percent reduction...

1876
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:57,546
...of the emission of fossil fuels
over the next 10 years.

1877
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,716
It is by far the most aggressive stride
ever taken...

1878
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,678
...in the fight to reverse
the effects of global warming.

1879
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:08,265
The other piece of legislation
is the crime bill.

1880
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:12,561
As of today, it no longer exists.

1881
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,354
I'm throwing it out.

1882
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:18,441
I'm throwing it out and writing a law
that makes sense.

1883
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,902
You can't address crime prevention...

1884
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,780
...without getting rid of assault weapons
and handguns.

1885
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:27,117
I consider them a threat
to national security and I will go...

1886
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:29,160
...door-to-door if I have to...

1887
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:33,373
...but I'll convince Americans that I'm right
and I'm gonna get the guns.

and we need serious people.

...you'd better come at me with more
than a burning flag and a membership card.

If you want to talk about character
and American values, fine.

and I'll show up.

01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,875
I've tried to do it a number of times,
but somehow I've always managed...

1941
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:05,877
...to trip over my job...

1942
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,171
...but here...

1943
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:09,631

How'd you finally do it?

Do what?

1952
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:39,619
Manage to give a woman flowers
and be president at the same time?
