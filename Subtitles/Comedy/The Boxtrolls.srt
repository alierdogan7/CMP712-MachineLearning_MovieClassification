36

Mr. Pickles : My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. 
I wouldn’t say the foot itself was evil.

Mr. Trout : You really think these boxtrolls 
understand the duality of good and evil?

42
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,666
Mr. Pickles : They must, right? Why else would they hide from us.
Mr. Gristle : Nice! Nice!

 vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of...

 be obsessing over grotesque monsters.

153
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:42,636
Well, at first I did, but I think this situation offers a great 
opportunity for a father and daughter to discuss their feelings...

Would find their infant children snatched

Quite forgot to lock his door 


212
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:52,492

The Boxtrolls came in to withdraw Poor Baby

Or Boxtrolls with their creepy claws

And drag them down to feed their jaws

When he found out he'd lost his child 


219

He did what any Dad would do 
He ran off swiftly to pursue

220

 those Boxtrolls 

221
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:28,447
Help, help, help me please won't you?
But the Boxtrolls did what Boxtrolls do 


222
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:34,247
They snatched him up and began to chew 
Until there was no residue Of Trubshaw. 

223
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,173
They pulled him down into their nest 
Hardly pausing to digest


224
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,101
They left his bones but ate the rest 
Never be a dinner guest of Boxtrolls

Snatcher : Wrong, Mr. Pickles!

256
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:29,319
Snatcher : A boxtroll cannot choose a new life 
because a boxtroll does not aspire to be anything more than a weak, lowly pest.

than to walk in the shoes  of those to whom we aspire?

You know what cheese can do to you...

and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what...

273
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:12,655
I say, old chaps, it’s quite, um... Quite-

274
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:19,424

of a mother’s smile on a warm spring day? Hmm...

I belong up there! 

288

Mr. Pickles : Very clever. 

289
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:37,576
Snatcher : In the tasting room, supping on the choicest cheeses...

291
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:46,735

Mr. Trout : Now, now boss... Don’t get yourself all worked up.

292

Mr. Pickles : Stop moving! 

332
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:53,233

333
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:07,293
Eggs : Boxtrolls don’t hurt anyone! Let them go!

But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive! 

341
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:39,502
Mr. Trout : Sorry, miss. 
Winnie : What are you doing? Unhand me! 

342
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:44,485
Snatcher : Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new 
victim, miss. And her name is YOU. 

343
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,780
Winnie : What have you dragged me into?

344
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:07,582
Mr. Gristle : I’m swinging on a chain! 
Eggs & Winnie : AHHH! 

345
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:28,980
Mr. Pickles : Don’t make no sense. That’s evil prevailing over good. 
Snatcher : If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I’ve worked for! 

346
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,465
Mr. Trout : You mean, we worked for?

347
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:40,781
Mr. Pickles : I think we’re all saying the same thing here. 
Mr. Trout : I don’t think we are. 

348
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:44,666
Snatcher : Barghhh
Bah... Mr. Pickles : But, just in different ways.

00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:50,200
Eggs : I don’t know, but The Redhats have 
them building something in their factory.

359
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:55,640
Winnie : I said what’s going on? Why aren’t 
they ripping out our eyeballs and eating our faces?

360
00:46:56,534 --> 00:47:04,206
Winnie : And where are the rivers of blood 
and mountains of bones?! I was promised mountains of bones!! 

361
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:14,905
Eggs : I told you, we don’t eat people! 
Winnie :Why do you keep saying “we”? You’re not one of them! You’re a boy! 

362
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:26,284
Eggs : No I’m not, I’m a boxtroll! Eggs; the boxtroll. 
Winnie :Oh really? Then let’s see you fit in your box.

363
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,286
Eggs : I... I can’t right now. 
Winnie :Mm hmm. 

364
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:37,236
Eggs : I’m long-boned. 
Winnie : You don’t talk like them! 

365
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,680
Eggs : I- I have a speech impediment! 
Winnie : Your ears aren’t pointy! 

366
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,479
Eggs : I slept on them funny! 
Winnie :Oh for goodness sake. Give me your hand! 

367
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,346
Winnie : I don’t bite. 

368
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,582
Eggs : Hey! 

369
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:12,458
Winnie : You’re one of us. You’re a boy, 
Eggs; Or should I call you the
Trubshaw baby? 

370
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:20,896
Eggs : It’s not true is it Fish? I’m a boxtroll like you, aren’t I? 
Fish : “No”.

371
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:28,033
Winnie : See?! I was right! Now admit it, admit you stole him! 
Fish : Gurglegurglegurgle! 

372
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:33,959
Winnie : Is he confessing? 
Eggs : He says I was... given to him. 

373
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:38,051
Winnie :Ha, right again! I- ...wait, what? 
Eggs : I was given to you? 

374
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:51,917
Eggs : Who gave me to you? 
Fish : [GURGLE GURGLE] 

375
00:48:57,095 --> 00:49:02,847

Eggs : Oh, sorry. He says a long time a go there was a kind man...

376
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:16,807
Eggs : The one man in town who saw they weren’t monsters... 
(Baby Giggles) 
Eggs : But builders... like him. 

377
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:26,823
Herbert : I’ve tried adjusting the dongle and there doesn’t seem to be any 
possible solut... Oh look, you’ve solved it! 

378
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:31,208
Herbert : Who’s up for a jelly break? 

379
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:34,399
Herbert : I tell you I could eat this stuff for the rest of my life.

380
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:35,828
Egg : But one night... 

381
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:40,077
Snatcher : Come on! I’m being reasonable. I can be unreasonable. 

382
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:43,906
Eggs : Snatcher wanted him to build 
something....But he refused... 
Herbert : I-- I’m an inventor, not a killer! 

383
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,402
Eggs : And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him... 

384
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:50,415
Snatcher : Maybe if I hold on to your son... 
Herbert : Not my boy! 

385
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:54,300
Herbert : Run! Take my son... 

386
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:56,986
(Baby Crying)

387
00:49:58,858 --> 00:49:59,619
Eggs : And then they... 

388
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,191
Winnie : They what? 
Eggs : They killed him.

389
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:44,489
Winnie :I think that kind man was your father. 

390
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:46,777
Eggs : What’s a father?

391
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,673
Winnie :Um... well... a father is the one who raises you...

392
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,373
looks after you... Loves you...

393
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:58,147
Eggs : Oh! Like Fish....
Winnie : Yes... 

394
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:11,772
Winnie :  No. They’re supposed to be like that man in the story. Someone who’ll do 
anything to help you. They always listen and never get angry...

395
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:16,201
Winnie : They guide you when you don’t know what to do. 
They’re there when it’s dark 

396
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:22,337
and you’re scared or lonely, and they are never, ever too busy 
to talk to you... 

397
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,560
Eggs : You have a father! 

398
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:30,400
We can tell him I’m the Trubshaw Baby... and the boxtrolls didn’t 
eat me. And he’ll stop Snatcher! 

399
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,305
Winnie :Well, he doesn’t really listen to children. 
Eggs : He’s a father, isn’t he? 

400
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:37,081
Winnie :You don’t know what he’s like. 
Eggs : But he’s the only father we have

401
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:43,075
Eggs : Please help us. 

402
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:52,816
Winnie : If I agree to help, you have to do exactly as I say.
Eggs : I promise! 

403
00:51:54,037 --> 00:52:01,742
Winnie :All right, first thing’s first... off with the box. 
Boxtrolls terrified : AAAAAAAAh! 

404
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:04,594
Winnie : Stop that! 

405
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:08,418
Alright, you petty thieves. Bring me your loot!

406
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,141
Oh, thanks. 

407
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:17,382
No.

408
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,561
This might work. 

409
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:23,603
No

410
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:24,943
(Growls)

411
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:26,693
Oh yes! 

412
00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:29,892
No! 

413
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:33,678
Yes! 

414
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,941
Winnie : You look like a proper boy


415
00:52:40,085 --> 00:52:42,385
Eggs : Me... a proper boy. 

416
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:44,280
Winnie : How do we get out of this place? 

417
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,459
Winnie : AHHHHHHHH! 

418
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:00,651
Winnie : Come on Eggs

419
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:23,555
Winnie : STOP! You don’t scratch there in public! 
That’s why they’re called... (whispered)... privates. 

420
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,641
Eggs : (whispered) Okay

421
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:32,958
Winnie : For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. 
When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands. 


422
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:38,228
Winnie : What are you doing?! Put those down!

423
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:41,162
Like this.

424
00:53:42,964 --> 00:53:44,686
Winnie : The other one. 
Eggs : Oh, right. 

425
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,121
Winnie :Then you say, “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” 
Eggs : “It’s a pleasure to meet you.” 

426
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:53,158
Winnie : And you say that even if you’re not pleased to meet them.

427
00:53:58,676 --> 00:53:59,946
Winnie : Just stick close, okay? 

428
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:07,516
Eggs : Which one is your father? 
Winnie : Lord Portley-Rind 

429
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,122
He’s usually making speeches about cheese.

Winnie : Hello, mommy dear.

431
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,361

432
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:19,372
Eggs : I’m Eggs.. 
Winnie : Bert. Eggsbert. Is a normal name... that he has. 

433
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:25,046
Lady Cyhthia : Eggsbert. How nice, I... umm, adore names from the bible.

434
00:54:25,486 --> 00:54:31,317
Eggs : Its a pleasure to meet you. 
Winnie : No, no. You kiss a lady’s hand.

435
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:39,567
Lady Cyhthia : Darling, it’s time to take off that dress and... burn it. 

436
00:54:40,124 --> 00:54:44,594
Winnie : Don’t move. I’ll be right back. 
Eggs : But which ones are the ladies?! 

437
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:47,686
Lady Broderick : Oh! 
Sir Broderick : Ahem!

438
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:53,180
Eggs : It’s a pleasure to meet you. 
Sir Broderick : Very good. 

439
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,802
Eggs : Even if I don’t mean it! 
Sir Broderick : What? Well, I never! 

440
00:54:57,351 --> 00:55:09,242
Eggs : And, it’s a pleasure to meet you.
Lady Broderick : Nooo! 

441
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:13,957
Eggs : I was right! It’s a pleasure to meet you... 

442
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:15,628
it’s a pleasure to meet you... 

443
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:18,012
it’s a pleasure to meet youuuuu! Oooooh!

Eggs : Yum. Mmm thats good. 
Boulanger :  (clears throat loudly)

446
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:49,992
Eggs : Huh? Oh!

447
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:05,287
Butler : Ladies and Gentlemen... Lord Portley-Rind! 

448
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:16,512
Lord Portley-Rind : Distinguished members of the cheese guild
We were here to celebrate the successful fund-raising for a new children’s hospital!

449
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:29,605
But my fellow White Hats and I decided the money would be better spent on 
this. I present: The Briehemoth!

450
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,833
Madame Frou Frou : Zere you are! 

451
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:38,923
Madame Frou Frou : Come. Such a naughty boy! We have 
so much to discuss. (Snatcher's voice) Alone

452
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:42,101
Madame Frou Frou : (Snatcher’s voice)
Come to snitch on old Snatcher did you?

453
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:45,978
SIR Broderick : Hello, Frou Frou! 
Madame Frou Frou : Nice to see you, too! 

454
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:56,948
Madame Frou Frou : You really think Portley-Rind will help a nobody like YOU? In this town, 
you want help, you’ve got to help yourself! That’s what a man does! 

455
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:01,102
Eggs : You’re a liar! When I tell Winnie’s 
father the truth, he’ll-- OOF! 


456
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:09,792
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : He’ll THANK ME! Because all your 
little boxtroll friends are going to die...tonight.

457
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,231
Eggs : What?! 
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : That will make me the most respected man in this town.

458
00:57:14,728 --> 00:57:17,063
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : They’ll have no choice but to give me a white hat. 

459
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:20,368
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : They’ll parade me into the tasting room on their shoulders!

460
00:57:21,424 --> 00:57:26,587
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : And I’m not going to let that be 
ruined by some little boxtroll sewer rat

461
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:36,815
Sir Langsdale : Yoo hoo, Madame Frou Frou... You promised your snookums a dance! 
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : I did? I did! Ha! But of course! 


462

Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : Oooh! Vatch your hands, monsieur! 
Sir Langsdale : (laughs lasciviously)

Winnie :There you are. 
Eggs : We have to get to your father! 

464
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,442
Winnie : You can’t just cut through.

465
00:58:07,874 --> 00:58:09,525
Winnie : We’ll dance! 
Eggs : We’ll WHAT? 

466
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:16,195
Winnie : Like this. One two three... one two three. 



467
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:21,488
Winnie : Just make a box. 
Eggs : You made me get out of my box! 

468
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:24,265
Winnie : With your feet, silly! 



469
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:32,862
That’s it, Eggs ... You’re dancing! 
(Both Laughing)

470
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:56,487
Eggs : Snatcher is here. 
Winnie : Who? Where? 

471
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,246
Sir Broderick : My turn, Madame. 


472
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:05,059
Winnie : Frou Frou? 
Eggs : I uh... 

473
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:10,983
Sir Broderick : (lascivious laughter)
Ah ha ha ha!

Lady Cynthia : 
(startled, confused)
Ooh! 

Winnie : Uh oh!  Eggs... LOOK OUT

00:59:15,363 --> 00:59:16,454
Winnie : Uh oh!  Eggs... LOOK OUT!

476
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:20,845
(Ladies Screams!) 

477
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,241
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : (snarls) 
Lord Portley-Rind : What is going on here?

478
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:57,591
Lord Portley-Rind : No.. No.. N.. N.. Nooo! 


479
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:21,006
Lord Portley-Rind : What have you done!? 
Eggs : Lord Winnie’s Father...

480
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:27,943
Eggs : People of the upper world

481
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:32,035
- Archibald Snatcher has lied to you all!

482
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:40,313
Eggs : He told you that boxtrolls are monsters 
-- that they steal children -- but they don’t. 


483
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:44,087
They would never hurt anyone. I know because... 

484
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,221
Eggs : Because... I am the Trubshaw Baby! 

485
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,137
Lord Portley-Rind : Do you know how expensive that cheese was? 
Eggs : What?!

486
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,975
Lord Portley-Rind : We might as well have built a children’s hospital! 
Winnie :Did you hear a word he said?! 

487
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:04,262
Lord Portley-Rind : Not now. 
Winnie : But father-­

488
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,730
Lord Portley-Rind : Have you any idea how long it will take my men to 
Fish it out of the river?! 

489
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,448
Langsdale : Ahh. What? 
Boulanger : Eww... the river?

490
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:14,460
Eggs : If you won’t listen to me, ask Snatcher himself.

491
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,894
(Crowd shock)
(GASP!)

492
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,339
Madame Frou Frou/Snatcher : You have me. I am not a true red head.

493
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,231
Lady Cynthia : Poor woman. 
Lord Portley-Rind : You insult our guest of honor? 

494
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,470
Lord Portley-Rind : Who are you?! 
Eggs : A proper boy. 

495
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,693
Winnie : He is with me father. 
Lord Portley-Rind : You know this... creature?

496
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,256
Winnie : He’s my friend. What he said is true-­
Lord Portley-Rind : Enough! 

497
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:37,434
Winnie :But... 
Lord Portley-Rind : Winifred! 

498
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:40,208
Lord Portley-Rind : I don’t want to see you again, do you hear me? 
Eggs : But he’s not a..

499
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:42,464
Lord Portley-Rind : Leave my house

500
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:44,982
Now

501
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:02,535
Snatcher : Zees parties are so confusing. No? 
Lord Portley-Rind : There, there. You poor, poor dear. 

502
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:12,968
Winnie : Eggs, wait! 

503
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:18,212
Eggs : You said fathers were supposed to 
help. That they took care of kids.

504
01:02:20,557 --> 01:02:26,300
Winnie :(sigh) Well, they’re supposed to. 
Eggs : People are just mean and selfish. 

505
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:27,899
 They’re monsters

506
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:33,803
Winnie : Not all of us. You aren’t. 


507
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,520
Eggs : Well, I don’t want to be a boy anymore.

508
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:46,191
Eggs : It was a pleasure meeting you. 
Winnie : Eggs... 

509
01:02:47,757 --> 01:02:50,187
Eggs : And, Winnie I really do mean it. 

510
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,840
BOXTROLLS : Eggs! 

511
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,408
Eggs : We have to leave the cavern. 

512
01:03:12,108 --> 01:03:13,678
(The boxtrolls stop drumming) 

513
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,358
Eggs : We’re not safe down here anymore.  Come on... 

514
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:23,723
Eggs : I said, we have to leave now! 

515
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:28,282
Eggs : Snatcher is planning something! We 
have to get out of here. 

516
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,979
Eggs : Come on let’s go. Now! 

517
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:38,391
Eggs : Get up! No! No! 
Don’t don’t just hide! What are you doing?! 



518
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,798
Eggs : Fish, help me.

519
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,342
Eggs : No! I’m not a boxtroll!

520
01:03:54,105 --> 01:04:01,325
Eggs : I’m sorry. I... I didn’t mean it. 
Please come out. Fish... 

521
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:03,991
(Cavern Rumbles)

522
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:06,406
Eggs : He’s here. 

523
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:11,820
Boxtrolls : AHHHHHHHH!!!!! 

524
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:29,963
Snatcher : How’s that for an entrance! 

525
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:32,989
Mr. Pickles : Dramatical! 
Mr. Trout : Don’t you mean “dramatic”? 

526
01:04:33,398 --> 01:04:34,838
(Mr. Gristle laughs insanely)

527
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:43,122
Eggs : AHH! 



528
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:56,978
Eggs : Get up! That thing will kill you! 
Snatcher : My, my, what a surprise. Don’t look

529
01:04:58,092 --> 01:05:00,996
like your little friends wanna run, does it? 

530
01:05:01,406 --> 01:05:07,045
How strange, how peculiar. No, 
wait, it’s exactly as I expected! 

531
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:14,629
Eggs : You have to get up. Please! 
Snatcher : NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW! 

532
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:25,263
Snatcher : Time to earn my white hat! 

533
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,185
Eggs : No! 



534
01:05:43,049 --> 01:05:44,062
Eggs : Fish! Shoe! 

535
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,791
Eggs : No! Please! 

536
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:03,713
Snatcher :Give up, Trubshaw! Boxtrolls lost 
looooong time ago. 


537
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:11,679
These miserable pests will never be a match for a
 man with dream! Mr. Gristle! 


538
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22,445
Fish : Eggs? Eggs? 
Snatcher : Acquire them! 

539
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,263
Fish : (SNARLS FEROCIOUSLY) 


540
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:38,831
Mr. Pickles : Never seen one do that before! 
Mr. Gristle : That Boxtroll was mad! 

541
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:49,587
Mr. Pickles : Goodness always triumphs over 
evil... right Mr. Trout? Mr. Trout? 

542
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,974
Mr. Pickles : I’m still sixty to seventy percent certain that’s us. 
A couple of goodguys vanquishing evil and all that. 

543
01:07:36,149 --> 01:07:43,118
Prisoner : (whispered) Jelly... Jelly! 
Eggs : What the...? 

544
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:48,699
Prisoner : When I’m good I get jelly

545
01:07:49,803 --> 01:07:52,215
. I like jelly. JELLY!

546
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:58,271
Eggs : (whispers) Who are you? 
Prisoner : Who am I? Who are you? 

547
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:05,026
Eggs : 
(confused, defeated)
I don’t know. 


548
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:07,666
Prisoner : Boy? Or Boxtroll? 

549
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,601
Prisoner : Dresses like a boxtroll, but, uh... 
looks like a boy.

550
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:20,813
A boy-troll? Yes, or a box-boy?
A new species. Never seen before. 

551
01:08:26,886 --> 01:08:36,254
Snatcher : 
(humming... then in normal voice)
Ohhh... nooo boxtrolls! 

552
01:08:37,426 --> 01:08:41,078
Snatcher : Trubshaw senior loved his kid, same 
as regular faaaaathers did.... 

553
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:48,925
Eggs : He’s my, you’re my... are you my father? 
Herbert : JELLY!

554
01:08:51,415 --> 01:08:58,797
Snatcher : He was once. Won’t get much out of him now, though. 
A decade hanging upside down scrambled his noodles good. 

555
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,851
Snatcher : Still, did a fine job designing this beauty. Best inventor in town,
your dad. Working with the best little builders.

556
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,384
Eggs : No, no no, don’t hide. Fish! Shoe! RUN! Get up, get up and run!
 Sparky. Sweets, run! 

557
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:26,345
Snatcher :Yell all you want, boy. They ain’t 
gonna run. You can’t change nature. 


558
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:34,341
Snatcher : I’m coming down, men! I want to pull the crushing lever myself!

559
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,311
It’s the little moments. 

560
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:49,671
Herbert : Yes. I see it now! A mutation of 
nature. Self-imposed metamorphosis.

561
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:52,644
Boxboy! You did it! 

562
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,281
Eggs : I don’t understand. 
Herbert : You changed your nature. Tell them. 

563
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:03,657
Eggs : I tried. They won’t listen. 

564
01:10:06,043 --> 01:10:10,333
Herbert You did it. You made you. Tell them. 

565
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:14,343
Tell them!

566
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:19,215
Herbert : Boxboy! BOXBOY! 
My son.

567
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:23,519
Eggs : Father? 
Herbert : Son!

568
01:10:24,143 --> 01:10:28,690
Herbert : Son! They can change. They can do it! Tell them. 

569
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:35,661
Eggs : Fish, Fish, everyone! Listen!

570
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:51,200
 I’m a boxtroll and I stopped hiding, so you can too! Stand up for yourselves! We can 
fight back! Don’t be afraid anymore. Sparky! Fragile! Get up! Get up and fight! 

571
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:56,020
Eggs : Just stand up and take a step.
Please! Do it for me! 



572
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,934
Snatcher : Well, good speech. 

573
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:03,133
Eggs : No! No! No! NOOOOOO! 

574
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:09,660
Fish, Shoe, Sparky... 

575
01:11:10,126 --> 01:11:18,299
Herbert Look what you did. Look what you did! (laughs) 
Eggs : Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They’re crushed. 

576
01:11:19,347 --> 01:11:22,398
Mr. Trout : Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded. 

577
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:27,566
Snatcher : All.... but.... one.... 

578
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:41,296
Snatcher : Hear ye! Hear ye!

579
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:44,615
Good citizens of Cheesebridge, 

580
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,714
come out of your homes!

581
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:51,340
The curfew has been lifted! 

582
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,400
Townsfolk Boy : Whoah! What is it? 



583
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:58,978
Snatcher : Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished! 

584
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:04,033
Snatcher : Your streets are SAFE! 
Mr. Gristle : SAAAFE! 

585
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:07,404
Male Townsfolk : The curfew is over? 
Mr. Trout : Yeah... 

586
01:12:11,562 --> 01:12:18,848
Snatcher : Join me! Your purger of pests! 
Your white knight who has taken back the night! 

587
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:24,184
Snatcher : Lord Portley-Riiiiind! 

588
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,499
(Door Squeks)

589
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:30,320
Snatcher : I come bearing the most delightful news. 

590
01:12:33,466 --> 01:12:36,357
Lord Portley-Rind : Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this? 

591
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:39,343
Snatcher : Show him lads.

boxtroll and I am a man of my word

594
01:12:55,976 --> 01:12:58,874

Winnie : Eggs! 

596
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,783

600
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:17,843
Lord Portley-Rind : There’s probably some, uh,  paperwork... 
then have a hat shipped in... 

601
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:27,114
Snatcher :No. Me thinks a deed of this magnitude 
deserves something a bit more... significant. 

602

01:14:04,256 --> 01:14:09,000
Mr. Pickles : I thought this was all gonna be a show, like with Frou Frou. 
I brought my mustache and everything. 

608
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:12,003
Mr. Trout : This really does stretch the limits 
of the term “hero”, doesn’t it?

617
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:14,822
Winnie :Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?! 
Mr. Pickles : I knew that’s how people saw us.
