00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,114
Welcome back, a cappella enthusiasts.

3
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,685
My name is John Smith,
and sitting here to my left is

4
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,732
Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberger.

5
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,335
This one's gonna stick, John.

6
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:42,145
Well, you save the Jew for last.

7
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:47,065
You're listening to "'Let's Talk", in front of the
world's premier, downloadable a cappella podcast

8
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,724
We are coming to you live
from the nation's capital,

9
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,922
<i>Where the Barden University Bellas are
about to rock the historic Kennedy Center.</i>

10
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:57,462
<i>Boy, these girls have broken down every
single barrier in their path, haven't they, Gail?</i>

11
00:00:57,613 --> 00:01:01,203
Absolutely, John, the first all
female group to win a national title.

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,852
<i>Three time defending champs,
and now here they are,</i>

13
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:07,878
performing for the President
of the United States on his birthday.

14
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:13,554
Wow, what an inspiration to girls all over the
Country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders.

15
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,406
<i>Here's Beca Mitchell, leader of the group.</i>

16
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>Look at these sequins and sparkles,
oh my, their feet just don't stop moving.</i>

17
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:35,232
<i>Florencia Fuentes,
just earned her green card, John.</i>

18
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:39,102
She may have to do that back flip
right back over the fence into Mexico.

19
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,976
- I think she's Guatemalan.
- Oh, none of that matters.

20
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:45,531
There's so much happening on stage,
I don't even know where to look.

21
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,976
Back in my day,
we put on our blazers and we just sang,

22
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,666
we maybe snapped our fingers
if we were feeling frisky.

23
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:07,163
♫ I came in like a wrecking ball,
I never... ♫ Oh! Another surprise!

24
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,080
A overweight girl
dangling from the ceiling.

25
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,611
- Who hasn't had that dream?
- Lots of us.

26
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:40,055
<i>- No!
- She has no underwear on.</i>

27
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:40,805
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

28
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,338
We have a commando situation.
<i>There is a commando situation on stage.</i>

29
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,092
<i>Take her back up!
Pull her up already!</i>

30
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:52,073
- She turning, brace yourself.
-<i> She coming, she's coming!</i>

31
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,272
<i>Avert your eyes or take it all in!</i>

32
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:56,822
Not the front!
Nobody wants to see the front!

33
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,272
Oh, no!

34
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,516
Happy Birthday, Mr. President.

35
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,849
The Australian singer who calls herself Fat Amy
gave the President a birthday gift

36
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,941
from down under during last night's celebration
held at the historic Kennedy Center.

37
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:15,865
In case you're wondering what I mean by
"down under", yes, I mean her xxx.

38
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:18,113
She showed her xxx...
to the President.

39
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:25,388
All eyes were on the a cappella singers,
the Barden Bellas.

40
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:28,690
Three time defending a
cappella national champion,

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,388
which is... a real thing... apparently.

42
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,371
Although authorities have ruled
out terrorism as a motive,

43
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:38,525
the Bellas claim the mishap was merely
an accident and issued an apology.

44
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,570
I am deeply sorry for the
upset that I have caused.

45
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:47,738
I fell that I have already
received punishment enough...

46
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,180
in the form silk burn.

47
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,330
Exhibit C.

48
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:58,523
Filth... women who're seen are just another
example cultural decay through loose morals.

49
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,290
Not wearing underwear seems
kinda intentional to me.

50
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,461
Yeah, you can choose to wear underwear,
or you don't wear underwear.

51
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,974
That choice I make every day.

52
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:10,605
Ya know, until today I thought singing a cappella
was the most embarrassing thing you could do.

53
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:15,570
Normally that group is on-point, and last night
they were off-point. off-key, and then on the floor.

54
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,974
It's a national disgrace.

55
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,827
Yeah, but I'd rather be in that
limo ride home with the president,

56
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:23,631
cut to the real President, he'd be like:
"That xxx was off the hook."

57
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:54,907
Chloe, chill out, it was a mistake,
they're not gonna burn us for witchcraft.

58
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,747
No, but the National a Cappella Association
is in there talking to the Dean about us,

59
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:00,183
and who knows what's gonna happen.

60
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:03,833
We won three championships, whatever
happens in there, we're gonna be fine.

61
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,076
Maybe it's time to
think about other stuff.

62
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:09,848
- What other stuff?
- Ya know, school, jobs, life.

63
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,997
This group is my life.

64
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:15,603
I've intentionally failed Russian Lit.
three times so I could be a Bella.

65
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:19,023
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to us... ever.

66
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,219
Ya know, before coming to Barden,
I had diarrhea for seven years.

67
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,652
But, yes, this is terrible.

68
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,563
The Dean is ready for you tramps.

69
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:39,761
Ladies, you have dragged the good name
of Barden University into the gutter.

70
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,458
And you've really upset these people who...

71
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,789
who's names I've already forgotten.

72
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,673
Your little Southern Exposure in
front of our Commander in Chief ...

73
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:51,434
has irreparably damaged the
entire institution of a cappella.

74
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,584
- Blew it up.
- Funding drying up.

75
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,734
Sponsors are pulling out.

76
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,684
Unfortunately, an example must be made.

77
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,902
It is the decision of this
governing body that the Bellas

78
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,699
are hereby suspended from
competing at the collegiate level.

79
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,270
The terms of your suspension
are laid-out in this document.

80
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
<i>I'm sorry, but it's over.</i>

81
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,229
Okay, can we be reasonable?

82
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,820
Fat Amy apologized,
this was an accident.

83
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,531
- Was it?
- You're taking us off of our victory tour?

84
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,125
Who's gonna sing the National
Anthem at the Puppy Bowl?

85
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:24,030
You're being replaced by
the European champions.

86
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,790
A German group of total professionals.

87
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,707
In other words,
they're gonna keep their pants on.

88
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:31,287
So, we can't defend our title,
and we can't tour?

89
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,060
<i>And you can't hold any auditions.</i>

90
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,001
We don't need your ranks to
grow like a fungus.

91
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:37,251
<i>Oh, so that's it then?</i>

92
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,401
So, basically, the Bellas are over?

93
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:44,509
Look Ladies, I'm sorry that this
disciplinary action has shocked you.

94
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,191
<i>Especially since you're all seniors.</i>

95
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,160
<i>But the truth is,</i>
you're just women...

96
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,184
and you'll all be pregnant soon.

97
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:58,121
Mom, I'm late, it's orientation,
you gotta let me go.

98
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,987
Well, I can't.

99
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:02,138
- I just can't do it.
- Mom, you can do it.

100
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,082
My only daughter leaving the nest.

101
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,712
You want me to stop, or I could keep singing.

102
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,303
Mom, I don't know how I'm gonna get
by without your spontaneous singing.

103
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,582
Well, Honey, you're gonna love this place.

104
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,499
Just promise you'll call.

105
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,831
Oh, and Honey,
don't be afraid to express yourself.

106
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,515
And not with those weird buttons
they wear in their earlobes.

107
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,231
- Unless you're gonna get a job...
- Slow down,

108
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:37,381
I'm not gonna go anything crazy, I'm just gonna
write my songs and join an a cappella group.

109
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:40,318
Not just ANY a cappella group,

110
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,059
the Bellas are an institution.

111
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,264
- My days as a Bella were...
- ...the best of your life.

112
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:49,333
I know, and I can't WAIT to be one.

113
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,202
Unless they don't take me, Mom.

114
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,715
Oh, no, no... no, Honey,
they're gonna take you.

115
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,177
Thanks to me, you were born INTO it.

116
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:00,878
Then I'm gonna be your mother,
and your sister.

117
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,660
Gross! Okay...

118
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,647
All right, the next phase of my life....

119
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,436
begins.

120
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:14,236
Hold on, there's nothing in here
that strips us of our national title.

121
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,954
And, if we're still reigning champs,
then we are automatically

122
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:20,011
invited to represent America at the
World Championships this spring.

123
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,857
Ah, yes, the World Championships of a Cappella,
where every four years

124
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:27,309
groups from around the globe
compete for world domination.

125
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,029
I'm sorry, it's just like I'm
supposed to be on, ya know?

126
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:34,816
Well, look, Ladies, we can't stop you
from going to the World's Competition,

127
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,673
<i>- it's not gonna help your case here.
- Not at all.</i>

128
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:39,883
- What if we win it?
-<i> What if you win it?</i>

129
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:45,609
Like... you... out-perform the other groups?

130
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,800
How do you fit such big
dreams in such a small body?

131
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,050
<i>What if you win it?</i>

132
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,707
- No...
- What if... what if you win it?

133
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,301
- Yeah, if we win, will you reinstate us?
-<i> Sure.</i>

134
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,493
No American team has ever won.

135
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:11,340
- That's because they hate us.
- The whole world.

136
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,040
The whole world hates us.

137
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:19,378
<I>Hello, freshman sons,
welcome to the Barden University.</i>

138
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:27,916
Get off the stage, nobody cares about it.

139
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:32,334
All right, you have made
a great choice, and a cheap one.

140
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:35,080
Yea Barden.

141
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,713
We have a very special
performance for you guys today,

142
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,084
the pride and joy of Barden University,

143
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,093
the Treblemakers.

144
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,178
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

145
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,270
We are the Treblemakers.

146
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,628
I'm Jesse, and this is a cappella.

147
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,455
Let's do this! Yo, Treble!

148
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:04,295
♫ Sucking too hard on a lollipop,
Oh, love's gonna get you down, ♫

149
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:09,588
♫ Sucking too hard on a lollipop,
Oh, love's gonna get you down, ♫

150
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:14,106
♫ Yeah, sucking too hard on a lollipop,
Oh, love's gonna get you down. ♫

151
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:19,329
♫ I went walking with my momma one day
when she warned me what people say, ♫

152
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,257
♫ Live your life until love is found
or love's gonna get you down. ♫

153
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:29,326
♫ Take a look at the girl next door,
she's a player and a downright bore, ♫

154
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:34,906
♫ Jesus loves her... she wants more,
oh, bad girls get you down, sing it! ♫

155
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:39,411
♫ Sucking too hard on a lollipop,
Oh, love's gonna get you down, ♫

156
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:44,467
♫ Sucking too hard on a lollipop,
Oh, love's gonna get you down, ♫

157
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:49,254
♫ Say love, say love,
oh, love's gonna get you down. ♫

158
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:54,243
♫ Say love, say love,
oh, love's gonna get you down. ♫

159
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,299
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

160
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,969
Chloe, do not blame yourself.
You're a ginger, that's punishment enough.

161
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,119
This is not all your fault, it's on all of us.

162
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,673
So, if we don't win the World, then what
are we, just a bunch of girls who hang out?

163
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,028
What's wrong with that?

164
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,078
If we don't win,
the Bellas are over.

165
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,908
This is the biggest challenge
that any of us have ever faced.

166
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:10,109
When I was nine years old my brother
tried to sell me for a chicken, so...

167
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,229
Well, I will do whoever it takes in
order for us to get back to the top.

168
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,756
- You mean whatever "it" takes?
- Yeah, I'll go that, too.

169
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,120
That's great news, yes.

170
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,982
No, I could start Monday.
I would be stoked to start on Monday.

171
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,132
Sorry, I don't say "stoked",
I don't say stuff like that.

172
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,613
I'm like... I'm pretty cool, you're gonna me.

173
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,240
That was bad, too.

174
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,598
We need to attack this problem head-on.

175
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:33,875
I want 100% commitment
and laser focus, right?

176
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:36,335
Great, I will see you Monday.

177
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,185
Beca out.

178
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:42,073
<i>- Beca!</i>
- Yep!

179
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:43,765
Hey, Ladies, wanna come to a party?

180
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,417
It's a tootsie party, you guys don't
even have to wear shoes.

181
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:50,183
Best kind of party. Here ya go.

182
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:53,085
Great job, Trebles,
you guys killed it.

183
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:54,336
Thank you.

184
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,835
- You like a cappella?
- Oh, yeah, I've got my heart set on being a Bella.

185
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,967
It's actually at the very top of all my dream boards.

186
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:04,877
Did I hear mention of dreams,
Hi, Benjamin Applebaum, at your service, hello.

187
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,361
I just have to say,
you are so spirited, I...

188
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:11,406
I just want to put you in
a box and saw you in half.

189
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:15,130
For magic, as a part of a trick,
he does magic.

190
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,451
- Right.
- It's only weird if you don't embrace it.

191
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:19,197
Dude, explain yourself.

192
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,405
I'll be honest, I completely blacked out.
How did I do, Man?

193
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,136
Honestly, I've seen you do worse.

194
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:31,461
<i>It's been months and we're
still getting hate mail?</i>

195
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,504
- God!
- "For your hairy situation"?

196
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,961
<i>Okay, we are officially registered.</i>

197
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,310
Update your passports,
Ladies, because we are going

198
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:47,354
to the very sunny,
very beautiful Copenhagen.

199
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:49,373
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

200
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,529
- Where is that?
- I don't know, I failed math.

201
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:59,364
It looks like the Competition has been dominated by
that stupid German group that took over our tour.

202
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:02,083
You mean stole our tour.

203
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:05,121
We need to scout those Deutchbags.

204
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,783
The, how good can they be?

205
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,807
Germany hasn't produced a good
singer since David Hasselhoff.

206
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:12,350
<i>We're going to crush them,
and when we do</i>

207
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,874
we can stick it to these chumps who send us
all these hate mail, like... Sonia Sotomayor.

208
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:20,819
Judgy bitch.

209
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,937
The Bellas are back.

210
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:27,417
D'ya'll talk to Beca today?

211
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,635
So, any first day jitters?

212
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,975
No, no, ya know, I'm just gonna be
moody and distant, artists love that.

213
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,509
I know I love that.
Here ya go.

214
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,559
Okay.

215
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,920
Hey, why do I feel so guilty?

216
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,894
I've a lot to Bellas, right?
Like, three years of my life.

217
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:46,450
Yeah, Bec, you should not feel
guilty at all about taking your shot.

218
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,825
- This is a big deal, right?
- Yes, it is a very big deal.

219
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:56,877
Nothin's gonna stop my girl.

220
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,412
I do not know him.

221
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:00,879
- X in a fex show.
- You can go.

222
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,751
Are you ready, or...

223
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,839
Okay, everybody, huddle up!

224
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,649
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

225
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,269
Get up! C'mon!
To the table, please! To the table!

226
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:48,677
Last one at this table has to help Frank watch
YouTube videos to find the next Justin Bieber.

227
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:52,467
Hey, so, I'm turning 25 next week,
if anybody want to get some drinks... celebrate.

228
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:56,486
<i>Frank, Buddy, less talk.
Thank you so much.</i>

229
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:58,536
Okay, my people, check it out.

230
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:00,869
That ...

231
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:05,390
Dax... with the tech guy... did you call the tech guy?

232
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,932
Yeah, I talked to him.

233
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,242
Do you understand, everything else in my life works.

234
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,292
Oh-oh.

235
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,368
So I just need everything
here to work,too, okay?

236
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:16,308
- He said he was gonna call me back.
- Oh, my God.

237
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,425
- Do you want me to call him back?
- Don't do it now.

238
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:22,993
Okay, there we go.

239
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:25,447
That is the Lion himself,

240
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:29,040
That is the legendary Snoop D-Oh-Double-G

241
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,873
singing "White Christmas"
at a tree lighting ceremony in Moscow.

242
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:35,477
He was so moved by the power of music
to unite the world, or some shit,

243
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:38,095
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

244
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,376
<i>And because I sleep on a bed of Grammys,</i>

245
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,715
he has decided to hired me to produce it.

246
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:45,056
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
the Christmas album.

247
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,079
If you had listened to his album like I did...

248
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:51,281
stranded in the air with T.I.
on a golden  hang glider,

249
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,765
then you would have known that
none of the songs were classics.

250
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,741
I've had to listen to that
album on two separate occasions,

251
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,430
Hang glider with T.I.,

252
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,176
and also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

253
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:06,192
It doesn't go anywhere,
but he's got dreams for it, okay?

254
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,732
So, I need you to close your mouth.

255
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,682
Herein lies the problem, everybody...

256
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,845
Last time I checked,
there were over a million

257
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:16,617
Christmas albums with the
same ten damn songs on them.

258
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:20,544
<i>So, Guys, I'm tellin' you man,</i>
I need all hands on deck right now,.

259
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,889
to come up with ideas on how
to make this one stand out.

260
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,641
Okay? You got it?

261
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,556
Fire when ready, I wanna hear ideas.

262
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,209
<i>Anything.</i>

263
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,922
Anybody, anybody right now would be great,
anybody can talk right now...

264
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:35,328
- What if we got those dogs...
- Anybody but you.

265
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,842
What if we got those dogs that bark
"Jingle Bells" to back him up?

266
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:43,529
L'me, l'me, let me guess, let me guess, you want those
dogs to back him up because he's Snoop Dogg?

267
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,551
- Yeah.
- That is a really great example.

268
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:48,350
of a horrible idea.

269
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,581
Take a lap.

270
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:54,255
- What?
- Take a lap.

271
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,732
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.
- I don't care.

272
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,285
Go, go, let's go, I want to see knees up.

273
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,480
Knees up!

274
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:06,555
Guys, I should give you a little more time,
a minute, you got one minute, 60 seconds.

275
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:10,252
My time is like a toddler in a tiara,
okay, precious and short.

276
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:13,760
I need really great ideas,
Snoop is coming.

277
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:29,238
Sorry, my boobs are all crazy,
I was just jumping.

278
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:32,516
I... I just came from auditions,
you guys weren't there,

279
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,975
- I was hoping for the chance to sing for you.
- No, I can't help you,

280
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,125
we're not allowed to take anyone else in.

281
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,604
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm a Junk.

282
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:43,054
Whaddya say about your junk?

283
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,256
I'm Emily... Junk.

284
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:49,157
I know it's weird.. my Mom's last name.
My Dad's last name is Hardon, so...

285
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,693
I'm a legacy... Junk.

286
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,709
My Mom was a Bella.

287
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,946
- Your mother is Katherine Junk?
- Who?

288
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:04,721
Only the Top Bitch of the 1981 Bellas.

289
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,625
She pioneered the Syncopated  Booty Shake.
And word is she has a 5 octave vocal range.

290
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,841
Yeah, still does... you do not want to
hear that woman doin' it with my dad.

291
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,798
What an odd thing to say.

292
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,190
True, if a Legacy wants to audition,
we have to let her.

293
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,528
Show us what ya got.

294
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:27,512
Right now? Right here?
Right here, right now.

295
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:33,083
Okay, I'd like to perform an original
song that I've been working on,

296
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,715
I'm not quite finished with it though, so ...

297
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:37,465
let's not be dicks about it.

298
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,296
Sorry, that was crass, wasn't it?

299
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:43,948
- Fat Amy, you have a lovely vagina.
- Thank you. proceed.

300
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,928
That one I'm... I'm still kinda
tinkering with... so whatever...

301
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,142
So nothing is completely set.

302
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,978
Would you excuse us for just one second?

303
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,493
She's pretty good.
Can we take her?

304
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:47,128
What... what do you expect us to say,
she's standing right there?

305
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,285
- Definitely not a soloist.
- No.

306
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,317
Technically she came to us,
so we're not breaking any rules.

307
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:57,467
- Yeah, it's the perfect loophole.
- You know, it's always good to have an extra body,

308
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,078
Just in case one of us gets kidnapped for ransom ...

309
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:04,756
is thrown into a shipping container
and is made to eat only leaves and Gazra seeds.

310
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,106
Yeah, I agree, we need new blood.

311
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,617
I don't think we should
decide anything without Bec.

312
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,415
I keep a pen under my tongue.

313
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,622
Anyone else think that it was creepy that she
never really opened her eyes the whole time?

314
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:20,382
Again, we're talking about her,
and she's standing right there.

315
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:23,701
But if we're gonna talk negative,
let's start with the giraffe legs.

316
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:26,366
Okay, let's take a vote on it.

317
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:29,570
Anyone who wants her in, sing G sharp,
anyone who doesn't, sing E flat.

318
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,248
One, two...

319
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:41,108
I like the sweat shirt.

320
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,972
Welcome to the Bellas.

321
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,543
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, Girl.

322
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:55,552
So, when does the new hazing start.

323
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:57,275
Tell you what,
I'll go back to my dorm and pretend

324
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,025
to be surprised when you
throw the hood over my head

325
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,962
and make me solve a Rubik's Cube
while sucking vodka from a Maxi Pad.

326
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:03,763
That's what my Mom said happened.

327
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:06,166
-  Not in here.
- You might want to look around,

328
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:09,610
we don't exactly have
a Maxi Pad to spare.

329
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,852
All right! Grab your guts, Ladies, it's party time!

330
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:16,296
We got tickets to Copenhagen
and a brand new Bella.

331
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,219
Let's go!

332
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,561
I should... um...

333
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,712
I can just leave it.

334
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:28,222
Let's go get into trouble.

335
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,073
This bush always been here?

336
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:33,002
- Watch it!
- You know there's a gate, right?

337
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:40,039
It sure is a stylish party.

338
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:42,811
Yeah, well, this isn't just any college party,

339
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:45,506
this is a cappella angry.

340
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,439
So, get prepared to meet a
lot of sexually confused men.

341
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,805
Bellas, welcome, welcome, welcome.

342
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:54,063
Jesse, where is Beca, I thought she
was gonna be with you tonight?

343
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:57,282
- I thought she was with you.
- I thought she was with you.

344
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:02,154
- Benji, right?
- Right! Slarggen.

345
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:04,883
Norf-Fless-Pan-Then.

346
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,319
Oh, those aren't... sorry, those aren't words.

347
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,034
- Movies.
- Are you asking me out?

348
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,966
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

349
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:26,052
It's my first day, I wasn't really
planning on rushing in on anything.

350
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:42,565
You made it.

351
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:46,090
Yeah, couldn't miss a last good night party.

352
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,012
So, how was the internship?

353
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:51,620
Eye opening, yeah, he does not mess around.

354
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,187
Chloe asked where you were,
why didn't you tell her?

355
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:57,337
Oh, she's just...

356
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:01,495
she's, like, watching the whole world right now,
and I'm lookin' for the right time.. I'll tell her.

357
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:03,605
Bumper's back.

358
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:06,664
Campus Security.

359
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,926
- Bumper, Bumper.
- Fat Amy's back.

360
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,604
Because I never left,
because I'm still there.

361
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:17,926
But I'm back, and that's a big deal,
because I'm arrived again.

362
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:22,680
Yeah, for someone who left four years ago,
you had it to shake the money.

363
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,932
I've got some deep, ugly news.

364
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:30,236
- What?
- I have been hand plucked

365
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:31,691
to be put on a waiting list,

366
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:36,896
to put on a very well known
TV singing competition.

367
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:37,946
- Really?
- Yep!

368
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:39,037
I know what you're thinking...

369
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,889
Oh! Bumper! You shut your
face and kiss me, Bumper

370
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,436
- G'night.
Bumper, please, just...

371
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,586
That is not even how I talk.

372
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:48,988
You talk exactly like this.

373
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,675
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

374
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:53,009
No, I don't.

375
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,003
- So, shut up.
- You shut up.

376
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:13,179
I'm so excited to meet the woman who
single handedly created the Bellas sound.

377
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,775
We're sisters... I can't believe we're sisters.

378
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:16,825
- Oh, yeah, hi!
- Hi!

379
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:21,167
Chloe texted me that we added a Legacy,
I didn't even know that was a thing.

380
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:05,248
<i>Remind me again why
we are at a car show.</i>

381
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:08,072
We are here for one reason
and one reason only...

382
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,459
scout the competition.

383
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,939
Totally gonna help us win the World's
if we know what we're up against.

384
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,611
All right,
now where are those tour thieves?

385
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:17,862
Stacy!

386
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,650
Just keep it in your pants maybe.

387
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,956
This all should have been ours.

388
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:29,106
I hate these Germans.

389
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:35,937
Okay, the car's moved,
nothing more else is gonna be half as good.

390
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,804
But they're moving backwards,

391
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,524
with girls driving them.

392
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:45,880
We are... we are the Sound Machine.

393
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,927
A German collective operating in concert

394
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:51,457
to create sonic... sonic mastery.

395
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:55,339
What better way to appreciate
automotive perfection.

396
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,761
They really nasty! How we gonna
compete against a group that size?

397
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,611
They're so frickin' insane.

398
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,011
<i>Did you clap?</i>

399
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:48,162
- We clap?
- A noisy clap.

400
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:59,699
Barden Bellas, you came here to see us?

401
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,579
Is it because you are...

402
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,404
what do the American kids say... "Jelly"?

403
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,554
We are so not Jelly.

404
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:10,155
We should really thank you for
making this tour a reality.

405
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:12,768
You know, with your bumbling ineptitude.

406
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:15,206
We should send them something... a fruit basket?

407
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:18,948
Or would you prefer mini muffins?

408
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,505
Okay, we didn't come here to
start something with you guys,

409
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,816
we just wanted to check you out before
the Worlds where we're gonna kick your ass.

410
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:31,602
You? You are the kicker of ass?

411
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:36,175
- Oh, yeah.
- You are so tiny, like an elf.

412
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:38,959
Or is it a fairy?

413
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,236
- Troll.
- That's it.

414
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,763
You are like a troll.

415
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:48,311
You are physically flawless.

416
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,658
- Thank you.
- But it doesn't mean I like you.

417
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,894
We are not scared about the Worlds,

418
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:58,355
because when the Bellas hit the
stage we are going to blow minds.

419
00:30:58,505 --> 00:31:01,980
With what?
More of Flubby Abby's baby shoot?

420
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:04,423
- That's not my name.
- I don't know your name.

421
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:09,337
Could be anything, Obese Denise,
Inflexible Tina, Lazy Susan.

422
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:14,646
My name is Fat Amy and I
eat crap like you for lunch.

423
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:18,975
Your team is like a...
how do you say that, a heated mess.

424
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:22,252
You know, a mess where
heat is applied to it,

425
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:26,272
so what once was a little
messy is now even messier.

426
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:30,777
Darlings, please take my advice,
don't try to beat us.

427
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,216
You can't, we are the best.

428
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:36,039
And now I must really go and rest my neck,

429
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,660
it's sore from looking down.

430
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:44,866
Just because you are making me very sexually
confused, does not mean that you are intimidating.

431
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:48,550
We have nothing to lose,
we have literally nothing.

432
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,624
Be seein' ya, Bitches.

433
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:53,364
Oh, what is happening,
I'm using my hands so much?

434
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,355
All right, Ladies, focus up.

435
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:58,196
We need to beat those German idiots.

436
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:02,623
We're going to beat D.S.M. at their own game,
see what they do, just better.

437
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:06,598
And we're about to do a full scales assessment
to blow out our choreography too much.

438
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:10,174
But... the important thing
is that we have fun, right?

439
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,910
Legacy, don't take this the wrong way,

440
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,087
you're the dumbest person alive.

441
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:12,634
Is it weird that we never got
around to singing today?

442
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,599
Well, it's kinda hard to start
singing without arrangements

443
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,187
And that's on me, so,
thank you for reminding me.

444
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,573
Yeah, by including me about A.S.A.P. so we
can start nailing down the choreography.

445
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:24,742
Right on top of that, Chloe.

446
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,160
I just wanted... just wanted to let you
know that I've been working really hard on,

447
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,309
you know, calming my nerves
and keeping my eyes open.

448
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,957
I was wondering if you could
give me some pointers... maybe.

449
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:36,062
You know, with the singing, I don't really know
exactly where you're gonna put me in on the songs...

450
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:38,574
I don't mean to be rude,
I just have somewhere that I need to be.

451
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,833
- You did great today.
- Thanks.

452
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,316
Wait, hold up, just hold up for a second.

453
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:12,426
Wait? Hold up? Man, that sounds awesome
right now, what are you talking about?

454
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:15,894
Naw, It's not... it's not you, it's a tech thing.
So,  just go ahead and take five.

455
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:18,198
It better be a tech thing. 'cause...

456
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,826
the way I sound in my ear drums...
This is immaculate, Man.

457
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:29,913
This song, there's nothing... nothing
special about it yet, you know what I mean?

458
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,085
- Any ideas, because...
- Hear me out ...

459
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:37,312
- Please, Dax, please.
- We can remove the sleigh bells

460
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:39,930
and put in kalimba.

461
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:43,288
Ya know, the finger thing.

462
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:46,996
I know what the kalimba does,
I know how it's operated, okay?

463
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,141
- Kalimba...
- Don't say it again.

464
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,512
Go in the corner,
go eat your lunch in the corner.

465
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,980
But, what am I gonna do with my Sriracha?

466
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,110
Say one more hipster thing, and I'm gonna shove
you in your vintage bassoon case, okay?

467
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:02,920
Turn!

468
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:05,418
Aim higher, People, okay?

469
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:08,475
And be very careful what
you pitch to me next.

470
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:11,180
Just have him sing it again... the singer.

471
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,427
Who are you?

472
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:16,928
Nobody, literally nobody,
I just had a thought.

473
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:20,372
No, okay, sure, sure.

474
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:23,188
Nobody else has an idea.

475
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:27,241
Let's do it exactly the same way.

476
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,316
<i>Again.</i>

477
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,340
<i>Will do, Nephew.</i>

478
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:43,516
Or it  can be something different, I can...

479
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:45,607
That was amazing, Snoop.

480
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:48,707
Thank you so very much,
you can take a small break, Man.

481
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:51,243
Everything... perfection... perfection.

482
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:53,312
Groovy like a drive-in movie.

483
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,996
You can sing.

484
00:36:57,273 --> 00:37:01,651
Yeah, I'm like a three time
collegiate a cappella champion, so...

485
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,681
We're both huge successes in our field.

486
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,831
Yeah, yeah, let's say that.

487
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:08,581
What do you do here?

488
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:13,054
I just get coffee and burritos and stuff.

489
00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:15,058
I want to produce music.

490
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,955
Dax, can you do me a favor?

491
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,558
Turn around right now
and watch this exchange.

492
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,596
That's "value added".

493
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,482
If you have any demos, You,
I can listen to, I'll make the time.

494
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:28,593
- Oh, seriously?
-<i> Seriously, yeah.</i>

495
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:30,744
Dax, did you see what happened there?

496
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:32,894
She did something that was helpful.

497
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:36,168
And now I'm going to reward
her by listening to her demos.

498
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:37,472
Turn back around.

499
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,423
Now! Turn around, please.

500
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:44,234
So, Snoop, we've got an idea.

501
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:47,647
Me too, water skis, but for dry land.

502
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:50,877
- Real play, ya know what I'm talkin' about?
- Brilliant.

503
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,598
- I'll write that down.
- Yeah, please.

504
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:18,844
What am I looking at?

505
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:20,107
We're pillow fighting.

506
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,640
You know this sets women
back like 30 years.

507
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,208
Just relieving some stress.

508
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:27,794
This was on the porch.

509
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,931
What is that?

510
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,091
- Says we're invited to sing at some kind of a party.
- We're going to sing?

511
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,399
Finally.

512
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:47,549
Well, there's just an address and a password.

513
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,499
How sexy and mysterious.

514
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:53,151
I count all my teeth from other people.

515
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,506
Anyone else scared?

516
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,401
Not really, I already lived
longer than I expected.

517
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:11,429
<i>Password?</i>

518
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:15,997
Fart noise.

519
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,947
<i>Did you not see the parentheses?</i>

520
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:29,738
Bellas, so glad Y'all came, c'mon in.

521
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:38,232
Standing in front of you, Ladies, happens
to be the world's biggest a cappella fan.

522
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,790
- We found you.
- <i>Yes, hello, here I am.</i>

523
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,303
What can we do for you?

524
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:46,323
So, last week, when I just happened to tinkle,
it occurred to me... do not! Do not!

525
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:52,715
That was rude, you do not come to a
gentleman's house and touch his goose.

526
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,832
So, we are... are we... or...

527
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:59,932
Actually, you're pretty late.
C'mon, let's go!

528
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:05,461
This is the big time.

529
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,642
Das Sound Machine, two o'clock.

530
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:23,622
- Tiny Mouse.
- We meet again.

531
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:27,148
Another verbal beat-down.
<i>The highlight of my day.</i>

532
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:31,209
So, have you abandoned your foolish
plans to face us at the Worlds?

533
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:36,183
You wish, You Gorgeous Specimen.

534
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,383
- Is she really in my head.
-<i> There we were.</i>

535
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,733
I'll be happy to send you there.

536
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:45,509
I'll mail you,
A large envelope costs nothing.

537
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,459
<i>Well, it would cost more than nothing,</i>

538
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,921
but still cheaper than shipping
by either horse or perhaps an adult moose.

539
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:53,771
Do you ever think maybe you're too big?

540
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,621
It'll cost a fortune to mail you.

541
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:57,771
You... you're enormous.

542
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,168
I think we should change her name to
"Feisty Mouse".

543
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:01,669
Yeah!

544
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,134
Just need to find is, like, a taller pair of shoes.

545
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:05,951
- Hey!
- Hey!

546
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,445
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

547
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:09,496
I guess I gotta go.

548
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:11,051
- Why?
- I don't know.

549
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:15,203
Welcome to the first ever showdown of

550
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,860
the National a Cappella
Laser Ninja Dragon League.

551
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:27,447
Can you dig it?

552
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,128
Okay, let's meet our teams.

553
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,830
First we have the Treblemakers.

554
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:43,093
Okay, we have the Barden Bellas.

555
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:48,307
We have the Tone Hangers.

556
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:55,684
♫ Sorbet, sorbet, sorbet,
sorbet, and a cherry on top. ♫

557
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,320
And taking a break from their national tour,

558
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,800
Das Sound Machine.

559
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:09,540
And the pride of Wisconsin,
the Green Bay Packers.

560
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:18,536
I could be the vixen in that man's sandwich.

561
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:20,613
Well, here's how this is gonna work...

562
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:23,921
When I point to you,
you sing a song from one of the

563
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:26,462
categories that's gonna appear
up there on the big board.

564
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,163
<i>There's only one rule,</i>

565
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,924
you have to meet the beat.

566
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:41,477
But you have to do it follow-the-leader style.

567
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:08,957
<i>That was fun.</i>

568
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:14,447
Now... if you can't carry the tune,
the whole team's out.

569
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,190
As in, you're gone.

570
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:18,051
And then...

571
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:23,199
Cornelius, too heavy, I told you before
'cause I hurt my arm saluting the flag.

572
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:29,537
The winners will get...

573
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,274
epic bragging rights.

574
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,338
<i>I'm sorry, did I not mention this?</i>

575
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:40,138
A forty-two thousand dollar
gift card to Dave & Buster's.

576
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,367
Clay Matthews lost it.

577
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:49,979
Okay, all right, let's get this thing started,
let's take a look at the first category?

578
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,780
Songs about butts.

579
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
- I know, anything on the radio, basically, right?
- Right!

580
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,060
<i>Think about what you're gonna sing.</i>

581
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,178
Let's start with...
Das Sound Machine.

582
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,606
Stop, stop, what was that, yo.

583
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:44,866
Not! How about we keep playin' the game?

584
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:48,562
You think you're a better lyricist

585
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,860
than Sir Mix-a-Lot,
a man who was knighted by Queen.

586
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,945
- Do you know the band Queen?
- Yes.. no... no, Sir, I do not.

587
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:59,504
Just... I couldn't help it, I caught a
glimpse of an angel... I got inspired.

588
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:03,087
Well, you're goin' to hell.
Because, Treblemakers,

589
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:05,237
you are...

590
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:13,803
Four left!
Let's take a look at the next category?

591
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:15,938
Oh, Country Love.

592
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,636
Oh! Oh! I know all about this.

593
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:21,029
Nobody in this room has love more
tender than I have. Please pick us.

594
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:24,187
- Let me have it. - Let us have it.
- Let the world have it.

595
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:26,146
I would give it to him.

596
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:28,296
All right then, well, why don't we start with you?

597
00:46:28,446 --> 00:46:30,446
Tone Hangers, you're up, you're up!

598
00:46:30,884 --> 00:46:33,681
We're gonna get this, I got this, I got this.

599
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,558
I got it, I got it.

600
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,508
I tender, I got nothin', Guys.

601
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,093
You are such a disa-aca-pointment!

602
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:34,109
Thank you,
Reginald Wilson Vankree Matthew the Fourth.

603
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:36,823
What on God's Good
Green One are you doing?

604
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,797
I had my mind on those 42 gees at D & B's.

605
00:47:41,947 --> 00:47:44,395
I'm afraid you can kiss that goodbye.

606
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:46,545
Green Bay Packers...

607
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:52,506
Let's see what the next category is.

608
00:47:52,556 --> 00:47:54,362
<u><b>I DATED JOHN MAYER</b></u>

609
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:58,751
Oh, I was his personal assistant!

610
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,901
That's so unfair.

611
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:03,051
- We got this, we got this.
- Get in there, get in there.

612
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:05,900
Okay, then why don't we start with you,
Das Sound Machine.

613
00:49:06,982 --> 00:49:09,979
That doesn't deserve a boo.

614
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:12,814
It's funny... for everyone, because

615
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:18,710
it sounds like you're implying that
John Mayer and Tina Turner are having...

616
00:49:18,746 --> 00:49:21,946
- Oh, yeah.
-<i> Get him out, get him out!</i>

617
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:24,850
- I don't know if I believe him.
- I... I'm telling the truth.

618
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,294
<i>The Tone Hangers!</i>

619
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:31,046
There we have our two.

620
00:49:31,243 --> 00:49:33,063
Yeah, we have a show-down.

621
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:36,341
All right, c'mon in,
let's do this face-off style.

622
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:40,527
Okay, take a look, see what your final category is.

623
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,578
<u><b>90'S HIP HOP JAMZ</b></u>

624
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,728
<i>90's Hip Hop Jamz</i>

625
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:46,878
Okay, Y'all,
take a second to think about it.

626
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:48,767
Time's up! Go!

627
00:50:58,784 --> 00:51:04,598
Sorry... what... 90's... hip hop jamz is that again?

628
00:51:07,115 --> 00:51:10,476
More like a 21st century jamz.

629
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:13,283
That's it... yeah, I wrote it.

630
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:23,889
You're saying it's an original?

631
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:26,705
Yes, I'm saying it's an original.

632
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:36,418
-  Our jam is cover.
- We spit on originals.

633
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:39,528
- What is your name?
- Emily.

634
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,256
Emily.
I hate you.

635
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:50,023
In light of this embarrassment,

636
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,804
and unprofessional information,

637
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:55,203
I am forced to declare,

638
00:51:55,354 --> 00:51:56,517
Sorry, guys.

639
00:51:56,669 --> 00:52:00,352
Das Sound Machine are the winners.

640
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:22,090
- Did you really write that?
- You shouldn't've done that, Emily.

641
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,454
Now they have something
they have to drop on us.

642
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:25,877
I'm sorry, I panicked.

643
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:28,740
I understand you want me to
crawl under a rock and die.

644
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,585
We don't want... hey, we don't want that.

645
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:33,927
Hey, Becs, let's go meet the Green Bay Packers.

646
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,911
I'm just kidding,
would you like to have sex later?

647
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:54,536
No.

648
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:58,397
So, that's a "no" then?
Because of the wink and...

649
00:52:58,547 --> 00:53:00,547
It's a hundred percent "no".

650
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:31,099
Da... Dax, I swear, if this kid was not my nephew.

651
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:35,554
Hey, I know you're crazy busy,
but have you had a chance to check-out those demos?

652
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:38,554
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.

653
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:43,098
This dead air between us is a good sign.

654
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,900
You got a great ear,
you proved that in the booth,

655
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,963
and I was super excited
to hear what else you had,

656
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:53,146
and what you gave me
was more mash-ups.

657
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,196
That's sorta what I do.

658
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:57,802
Listen, Reggie,
is it Reggie?

659
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:02,151
Beca... that happens a lot,
though, you'd be surprised.

660
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:04,401
Okay, here's the thing,

661
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:09,255
any kid with ears and a laptop can do that...
Dax can do that.

662
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:14,410
That's fine if you want a career
D.J.ing raves out in the desert,

663
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,781
but if you want to write "Music producer"
on your tax forms someday,

664
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,796
then you've got to have an original voice, you
understand, you've got to show me what YOU have.

665
00:54:21,946 --> 00:54:24,668
Right now what I have is a
demo with mash-ups on it.

666
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:28,496
Yeah, yeah, I got lots of stuff to say,
I'm just saving it all up.

667
00:54:31,557 --> 00:54:33,285
Bridget... Rebec... what is it, Beca?

668
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:34,731
- Beca.
- Okay, yeah.

669
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:39,115
You're an intern,
and everybody else in here's an intern.

670
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:42,711
You're talented,
everybody else in here is talented.

671
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,925
So what the hell makes you special?
Do you know what I mean?

672
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,173
That's good.
So what I'm gonna do...

673
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:55,526
is I'm gonna give you one more shot to
show me who you are, as an artist, okay?

674
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:57,029
Do not waste it.

675
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,477
No, sir, will not waste it.

676
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:01,828
I really hope you don't, for your sake,

677
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:05,313
because I would hate to think that singing
covers in an a cappella group is all you can do.

678
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:09,305
Please replace the paper towels.

679
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:28,022
<I>Hey, it's Jesse, text me.</i>

680
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:30,545
Hey, it's me.

681
00:55:32,314 --> 00:55:35,271
Hey, so, you may not get to
hear this message because...

682
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:38,321
because I have nothing to say.

683
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,967
That's music industry speak for "I suck."

684
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:46,396
All right, you're definitely asleep by now.

685
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:48,290
That's cool.

686
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:50,829
Text me when you're up.

687
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:57,990
The girl can't say she's gonna grab
a smoothie and return 14 hours later?

688
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,740
Something suspicious about that.

689
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:02,931
Why are you up so late anyways?

690
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:06,359
I was just figuring some stuff out.

691
00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:07,909
You're working on the set?

692
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:13,996
- I'm not working on the set, I'm just like...
-<i> What?</i>

693
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,605
Nothin', doesn't matter.

694
00:56:23,232 --> 00:56:26,295
If you did want to
share something with me,

695
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:29,723
your best friend,
I'm a good keeper of secrets,

696
00:56:29,873 --> 00:56:33,826
I'm like a safe that locks,
with a key,

697
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,730
and the key is stashed up my bum,

698
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,444
- Because...
- It's fine, forget it, it's all good.

699
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:42,594
So this has nothing to do
with that internship that you sneak off to?

700
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:46,027
Come on, Beca.

701
00:56:46,178 --> 00:56:48,078
You know how you always
do that thing every month where

702
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:51,328
I take twenty dollars out of your
purse and you pretend not to notice?

703
00:56:51,628 --> 00:56:53,628
<i>I saw your I.D. badge in your bag.</i>

704
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,450
Don't be mad.

705
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,152
I... I'm... I'm not mad, actually...
about the badge.

706
00:56:59,302 --> 00:57:01,402
That money I wanna come back to.

707
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:05,067
Let's just focus on your lie.

708
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:09,023
Beca, why didn't you tell us?

709
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,155
Or at least Chloe?

710
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:14,213
No, just... it was just easier.

711
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:17,229
There's like so much going on and
Chloe would lose her mind

712
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:20,342
if she thought my sole
focus wasn't winning World.

713
00:57:20,492 --> 00:57:22,392
Sorry, just now I'm freaking out because...

714
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:26,807
it turns out, like, totally not
good enough to be a music producer,

715
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:30,010
which is cool, and fun to know
as I enter the rest of my life.

716
00:57:30,348 --> 00:57:32,912
Hey, I'm just gonna stop you right there!

717
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:35,589
You're the most talented
person that I know,

718
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:39,603
and I've met three of the Wiggles...
intimately.

719
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:43,488
Beca, do you know how awesome you are?

720
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:45,538
You're Beca F-en Mitchell.

721
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:50,795
Okay, you're the big B.M.,
that's you, you're awesome.

722
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:56,921
Do you need some of my self-confidence,
'cause I can turn mine down a notch.

723
00:57:57,213 --> 00:58:00,851
- Yeah, okay.
- Then I'm gonna go  rub some out.

724
00:58:01,987 --> 00:58:04,049
- Oh, okay.
- Wait,

725
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,199
- I think you need a bit more.
- It comes from there?

726
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:08,796
- Okay, thank you.
- You just need that.

727
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:10,646
I'm gonna get you the good stuff now.

728
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:13,429
No, I don't want butt confidence! I don't want
your butt confidence! I don't want your butt...

729
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,840
I believe in Beca.

730
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:47,979
C'mere.

731
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:52,858
Candles, cloth napkins,

732
00:58:53,507 --> 00:58:56,134
food other than salsa.

733
00:58:56,284 --> 00:58:59,284
This is a little classier than a typical hook-up.

734
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:06,386
<i>Is it? Huh. I have a patisserie,
some charcuterie, and...</i>

735
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:10,267
a huge bowl with exotic capers.

736
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,531
<i>I didn't know what those were,
but they're like salty peas.</i>

737
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:21,127
So... I don't know if you've
seen the news lately, but...

738
00:59:21,277 --> 00:59:31,145
There's a war, and also the
economy is dippin' and ebbin', growin'.

739
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:35,233
Bumper, what's goin' on?
Now you're kinda creepin' me out.

740
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,483
Okay, I guess I'll just lay it all out there.

741
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:41,101
The reason I brought you here tonight...

742
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:45,524
it's because I was thinkin' that...
maybe... perhaps...

743
00:59:45,675 --> 00:59:47,775
if you're interested...

744
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,251
This is harder than I thought it was gonna be.

745
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:55,661
I want to date you, that's what I want.

746
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,784
Like for real, like a real couple.

747
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,770
Where we, like, go out in public and
hold hands and ride bikes together.

748
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,490
Or we can, like,
go to an orchard and pick apples.

749
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,410
Or we, like, do one of those, like, build a
bear workshops together and we build bears

750
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,530
and we name one Bumper and
I'll name one Fat Amy,

751
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,650
and yours'll be bigger than mine,
it'll be two,

752
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,600
and we can put 'em on our bed,
that we share.

753
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:24,988
Whaddaya say?

754
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,540
No...

755
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,530
I don't want to do that.

756
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,050
Yeah, that's cool,<i> it was stupid...
it was a stupid idea anyways.</i>

757
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:45,265
Obviously, we shouldn't do that, we should
just go back to how things used to be, and just...

758
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:50,110
go at it or...
on top of all this expensive food I bought.

759
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,560
Are you crying?

760
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,400
No... I'm not.

761
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,750
Bumper, c'mon, you can't be serious.

762
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,640
I can't be tied down by anything.

763
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:06,990
<i>I'm on a walkabout,
I'm a free-range pony that can't be tamed.</i>

764
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,525
- You know.
- Okay.

765
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:14,708
I'm like a firework... Pow! Pow!

766
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,200
- I can't be tied down.
- Okay.

767
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,542
So then that's it,
then I guess that's it, right?

768
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,470
Because I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna keep going on like this.

769
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,233
- Well...
- Fine!

770
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:26,660
Fine, if that's how you feel, then I think...
then I think we're done, I think it's over.

771
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,327
- That's it?
-<i> That's it then.</i>

772
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,500
- Well... so, it's over, then.
- Fine, then it's over.

773
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,950
Fine, then.

774
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,733
No... too late!
You're too late!

775
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,160
I figured when we didn't do the serenade,
the backup plan should be to play her off, is that...

776
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:52,210
Turn around, go back,
I don't want to hear another peep!

777
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,830
I'm sorry.

778
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:02,250
<i>Hey, Guys, my first performance!</i>

779
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,340
<i>Calm down, it's just a chance
for us to rehearse for World.</i>

780
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,890
<i>As far as I can tell,
it's just for a bunch of old people</i>

781
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,480
It's a full house out there.
How did we get this gig again?

782
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,140
They called us.

783
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,683
You know what, Guys,
I know we're trying a lot of new stuff,

784
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:27,470
but I feel like we're gonna get out there,

785
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,476
and we're gonna feel the energy and
we're just gonna nail all of it!

786
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:31,890
Sorry, these braids are so tight.

787
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,809
No, no, no, I don't know, I mean,
I have many, many doubts.

788
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:37,630
because if we fail this,
then we don't win the Worlds,

789
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,450
and if we don' win the Worlds,
they'll be no more Bellas,.

790
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,100
and without the Bellas,
my life... without...

791
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,220
Malaria.

792
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,110
Meaning, Flo

793
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,060
Three, two ...

794
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,950
Hey, everybody, welcome back to Let's
Talk Appella, the portable podcast edition.

795
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:02,170
We are following the story of the embattled
Barden Bellas on their road to redemption.

796
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,590
Trying to crawl their way back
into the public's affection.

797
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:11,330
And if they can just hold off showing
us anymore of their genitalia,

798
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,850
- they make it to the World Championship.
- Well, I can't un-see it.

799
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,970
- It's haunted me ever since.
- Well, here's a picture of it right here.

800
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,063
No! This should not be a screensaver, John.

801
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,440
<i>Stepping onto the stage, the Barden Bellas.</i>

802
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,360
<i>- This is some exciting stuff.
- So exciting.</i>

803
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,006
<i>A lot going on up there.</i>

804
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,270
I think this sound, honestly,
my senses are overwhelmed, Jay... John.

805
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,220
<i>You might want to turn down the theatrics.
Let's hope there are no props.</i>

806
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,849
<i>- Oh, they brought the props.
- And there are the props.</i>

807
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,570
This is more of a circus act
and not an a cappella performance.

808
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:47,021
Gail, it's as if the Barden Bellas
just don't know who they are anymore.

809
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,800
<i>- Look at this.</i>
- She's on fire.

810
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,520
They lit one on fire.

811
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:15,410
<i>Beating D.S.M. seems impossible for this team.</i>

812
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,450
<i>Even these common people can see</i>
that the Barden Bellas have no shot at reinstatement.

813
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,070
They are an embarrassment to a cappella
and all that it stands for.

814
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,160
This is what happens when
you send girls to college.

815
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:29,890
Is it?

816
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,680
- Is that for a class?
- No, it's just that when I get stressed,

817
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:44,500
words just sorta flow right out of me and I
try to channel them in my song writing and...

818
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,520
Are we just gonna ignore
what happened back there?

819
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:50,278
Guys! Hello!
The Worlds are right around the corner

820
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:53,040
and you guys are acting
like we didn't just eat a big bag of "ah".

821
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,460
Why are you yelling at me? I almost
burned to death because of you aca-bitch.

822
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,580
If you almost died it was only because
you were standing in the wrong spot.

823
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,300
No, Flo flipped into me.

824
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,320
Sure, blame the minority.

825
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,940
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

826
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:09,860
I'm not pointing the finger at anybody...
it was Legacy's fault.

827
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,180
Me? But I...

828
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:16,330
Obviously we're not gonna beat Das Sound
Machine at their game, so, we need a new plan.

829
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:21,020
At times like these,
there's only one thing left to do.

830
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,640
Fake your own death and flee the country.

831
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:26,790
Close! We're going on a retreat.

832
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:34,280
<i>Look, I think that the retreat would be a good thing,
you girls need to bond heading into Worlds.</i>

833
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:37,400
- It'll be such much fun.
- I don't know, Mom, no, it's bad.

834
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:40,220
- The girls are yelling at each other.
- No big deal.

835
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:44,040
I remember putting your godmother,
Maggie Pistol, in a chokehold

836
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:46,390
because she insisted that
George Michael was gay.

837
01:06:46,982 --> 01:06:48,169
Who?

838
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:54,080
I'm just worried that my entire Bella career
will be that one terrible performance.

839
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,598
You know, I'll never get to
solo at Lincoln Center, you know.

840
01:06:57,648 --> 01:06:59,220
But you're gonna get to go to Europe.

841
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:02,539
That would have been the
highlight of my college career.

842
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,960
And you girls can win it,
you have to win it.

843
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:10,180
- Just me being a Bella sounds so amazing.
- And it is amazing.

844
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:14,000
It's a sisterhood that is gonna
support you for the rest of your life.

845
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,620
I know you're not feeling it,
but you will.

846
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,770
This won't be the end of the Bellas.

847
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,460
<u><b>BARDEN TREBLEMAKERS ARE GOING</b></u>

848
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:29,910
<u><b>TO BLOW UP LINCOLN CENTER</b></u>

849
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,930
Hi, Benji.
- Emily.

850
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:40,050
Listen, I think that you're missing a word here.

851
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:43,733
<i>Oh, God, no, no, no, no, that's not...
that isn't what I meant.</i>

852
01:07:43,783 --> 01:07:44,940
<i>I knew it, I didn't think so.</i>

853
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:48,160
That's really embarrassing.
And text is usually my forte, so...

854
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,340
- Well, it looks great.
- Well, thank you, that's really sweet...

855
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,530
When my hands aren't covered in... in glitter paint,
you think maybe we can try that again?

856
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,120
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, okay.

857
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:10,040
Well, I'll... I'll look forward to that.

858
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:14,949
- You know, let me know when you're clean.
- I... that's... I will.

859
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:18,230
- Great. -You bet. - Okay. - All right, have a good one.

860
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,350
Girls, move into the bus.

861
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,670
- Okay.
- We go.

862
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,090
Good luck, Benji.

863
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,872
<u><b>BLOW UP @ LINCOLN CENTER</b></u>

864
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:42,410
It must be sweet.

865
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,430
Nice, right?

866
01:08:47,112 --> 01:08:49,150
I need to find somewhere
to charge my laptop.

867
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:54,890
- How did you hear about this place?
- From yours truly, hello, Bellas.

868
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:03,210
Oh, wow, hi, you must be Emily.

869
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:08,100
Welcome to the Lodge at Fallen Leaves.

870
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,720
Where Fortune 500 companies send their
employees to build teamwork skills.

871
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,240
You run this whole place?

872
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:17,160
You know, I realized that I had a knack for
barking orders and bending people's will, so...

873
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,878
I made a career out of it.

874
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,765
Which reminds me...

875
01:09:21,815 --> 01:09:23,730
FALL IN LINE, BELLAS!!!

876
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,820
No slouching, no straggling!

877
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,670
I see you, Jessica.

878
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:32,897
It is with great sorrow and regret...

879
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:37,480
that I had to watch our
once proud organization

880
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:40,630
become a national disgrace.

881
01:09:42,536 --> 01:09:45,450
- Can I have the keys to the minibar?
- Zip it!

882
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:49,870
The World signifies a shot at redemption.

883
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:54,060
You don't have a chance at winning
until you find your sound again.

884
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:56,780
You have totally lost your harmony!

885
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:59,700
So, for the next two days,

886
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,520
you will be doing everything
together until you regain it.

887
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,070
Ladies, get ready to be transformed.

888
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,960
You are surrounded with the
strength of your fellow Bellas,

889
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:14,880
And the support of a proud, female tradition.

890
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:18,500
and a few dozen bear traps,
so don't stray too far from the marked paths.

891
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,020
Okay! Great! Let's go!

892
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:24,540
Well, maybe I'll just start with a shower,
maybe a little foot rub.

893
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:27,560
Fat Amy, there are no guest rooms for you.

894
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,310
Then, where are we staying?

895
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:42,230
I don't understand camping,
we're voluntarily living like dogs.

896
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,120
This is the worst.

897
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:48,873
The air we're breathing right
now is at least 90% fart.

898
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:53,465
That reminds me,
I need to see a man about a horse.

899
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:02,480
Did anyone happen to pack a spare roll
of toilet paper? Or a moist towelette?

900
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,930
Anyone have, like, a tee-shirt, size extra small?

901
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,950
Okay, so out of the tent it is.

902
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,463
- What are we doing here?
- We're bonding.

903
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,560
You seem so tense, do you need a back rub?

904
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:20,180
Several body parts are
rubbing my back right now.

905
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:22,812
You know, Beca, we're very close,
but being under this tree

906
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,386
is only gonna let us discover
everything about each other.

907
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:26,750
Is that right?

908
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:32,301
You know, one of my biggest regrets is
that I didn't do enough experimenting in college.

909
01:11:32,452 --> 01:11:34,855
- You're so weird.
- Bollucks.

910
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,710
I want to go home.

911
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,077
I hope the sun never comes up.

912
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:48,136
Why do I get in trouble, Pillow?

913
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:52,840
- You touching my goodies?
- Yes.

914
01:11:52,990 --> 01:12:00,080
<i>Oh, oh, Guys, I've got a little... it
won't... I just need some help getting it out.</i>

915
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:04,030
<i>Can you sing something,
the pipe's a bit blocked?</i>

916
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:09,850
Thanks, Chloe.

917
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,870
What kinda white shit is this?

918
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:21,090
<i>It's comin' out like fray-yea now.</i>

919
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,980
Up and at 'em, Bellas! Come on!

920
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:34,100
Let's go, let's go!
Let's wake up! Let's do this!

921
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,120
Come on, pick up the pace, Girls.

922
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:41,260
Come on! <i>Today we are going back to the
basics to re-learn how to sing as a group.</i>

923
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,480
While also enjoying doing death
defying team building chest exercises.

924
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:48,330
- What a great idea.
-<i> Okay, so, let's begin.</i>

925
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,606
...lunch!

926
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:36,050
Because he's Asian Jesus.

927
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:28,140
Okay, that was just up the
way from being almost fine.

928
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:31,760
- Chloe, what are we doing?
- We're re-discovering our sound.

929
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,180
Are we?

930
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,812
Because it feels like we're just singing
songs that would never go in our set.

931
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:37,200
<i>Beca, come on.</i>

932
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,620
No! None of us know how to beat Das Sound Machine,
but I know it's not gonna be by doing this.

933
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,640
This is just an exercise in finding harmony, Beca.

934
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:46,460
Sometimes you have break things
down before you build them up again.

935
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,610
I've got more important things to do.

936
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,930
- What can be more important than this?
- Nothing, forget it.

937
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:55,720
No, you don't think that we haven't all realized
you haven't been a little checked-out lately?

938
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,370
C'mon, Beca, just tell her.

939
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,785
I heard that, tell me what?

940
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:02,510
Oh, you misunderstood me, I clearly said...

941
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,199
Listen, I don't want you guys to fight.

942
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,020
You're Beca and Chloe,
Together you're Blowie.

943
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,870
everyone loves to go Blowie.

944
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:19,690
Okay, I've been interning at a recording studio
and a legit music producer wants to hear my work.

945
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,805
God forbid I have something
going on outside this group.

946
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,742
Okay, so why would you keep
something like that from us?

947
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,478
'Cause you're obsessed, you all are.

948
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,350
We graduating and the only person thinking
about life after the Bellas is me.

949
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:35,013
What is so wrong if we focus on the Bellas?
This has been my family for seven years.

950
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,490
Yeah, 'cause you're too scared to leave!
Sack-up, Dude.

951
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,752
- Girl fight!
- Okay...

952
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,430
So, you've been lying to us for the entire year,
and now you're gonna flake out?

953
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,050
Now you're afraid, when the Worlds
are read right after graduation?

954
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,470
Oh, my God, enough about the World...
I am outta here.

955
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,401
Oh, okay, you're just gonna leave now?

956
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:54,357
You'll have to eventually,
Chloe, it might as well be now.

957
01:15:54,673 --> 01:15:56,757
If you all knew what was good for you,
you'd follow me.

958
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:57,940
Beca, the...

959
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,930
Well, well, well, look who needs our help.

960
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,450
Not cool, guys.

961
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,970
No, it's not cool if you're taking
your frustrations out on us.

962
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Emily, that's what you're gonna say to me right now?
Help me, I'm dying, I'm dying.

963
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:24,039
We need to get her down,
we need a ladder.

964
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,329
No, we don't believe in ladders.

965
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,150
They suggest it could be hierarchy that is
counterproductive to my team building program.

966
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,800
What kind of horrible regime are you running here?

967
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:38,440
Seriously, this whole place is, like, full of booby traps.
And guess what, boobs should never be trapped.

968
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:41,505
Unless... the support if you
have lower back issues.

969
01:16:41,656 --> 01:16:44,226
It's okay, if I'm about to die,
I'm sorry,

970
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,258
I didn't mean any of that stuff I said.

971
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:49,950
I love you, I love all of you awesome nerds,
and I love being...

972
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,290
Jessica and Ashley, I don't actually
know which one of you is which.

973
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,710
I'm Jessica.

974
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,308
Don't worry, we're gonna get you down.

975
01:16:58,409 --> 01:17:00,460
Focus up! Get in formation, we can do this!

976
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,680
Everybody, come on, let's focus,
work together as a team.

977
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:05,730
All right, Beca, we got it.

978
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,300
<i>She's alive.</i>

979
01:17:14,157 --> 01:17:16,120
I sleep upside down like a bat.

980
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:27,040
Because everything's changing so fast, and I'm
putting all this pressure on myself, ya know.

981
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,360
Well, I don't wanna fail.

982
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,780
- If you would have just said something.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm weird about that stuff.

983
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,141
I thought I could figure it out on my own,
but I can't.

984
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:40,873
Maybe I don't have
anything original to say.

985
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:43,040
I wish I could do what you do.

986
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,180
Wow, I feel the same way about you.
<i>You're so good, it's intimidating.</i>

987
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,100
All I ever wanted
is to be one of you.

988
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,220
Not a Legacy, but a Bella.

989
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:57,999
You are a real Bella.

990
01:17:58,321 --> 01:18:01,321
You're one of us,
you paid the registration fee.

991
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,180
That's my life, You.

992
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:07,800
Wanna collaborate on something?

993
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,620
Wait, are you being serious?

994
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

995
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,190
- Wow!
- Wow!

996
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,360
Man! Yes!
Who else feels like a winner tonight?

997
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,449
It know it doesn't seem like it,
but I'm afraid, too.

998
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,400
To move on, to graduate.
It's really scary.

999
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,420
Yeah, it actually does seem like it,
because you're barely holding it together.

1000
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,240
Well, it doesn't have to be scary, Chloe.

1001
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:46,829
When I was graduating I never pictured myself
running a retreat in the middle of the woods, but...

1002
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:48,580
here I am.

1003
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,918
Take it from someone who's dealt
with some serious control issues.

1004
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:03,542
Like my dad always said, "In the minefield of
life, you must be prepared to lose both feet. "

1005
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:06,380
And I think you all
know what I mean.

1006
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:08,042
I don't.

1007
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:12,470
Then it's decided.
this year I will graduate.

1008
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:14,690
The Worlds will be my swan song.

1009
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,480
I mean it, I'll pursue my passion.

1010
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:22,109
I'll teach underprivileged children how to sing,
or I'll dance exotically,

1011
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,120
whatever offers the most money.

1012
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,940
Check this out!
I'm moving to Maine to get hitched,

1013
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,690
and all Y'all can come, everybody's invited.

1014
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:40,810
Okay, okay, Guys,
stop asking, I tell you.

1015
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:45,800
So, after I graduate there's
a chance I will be deported,

1016
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:49,850
I will try to re-enter this country,
but I will probably die at sea.

1017
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,970
So, let's live for tonight.

1018
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,090
Lily, any plans?

1019
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,810
I'm just going to travel through time.

1020
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:08,940
You know, when I look back on this,
I won't remember performing and competing,

1021
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:10,850
I'm gonna remember you weirdoes.

1022
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:15,969
It makes me really sad to think
it won't ever be like this again.

1023
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,090
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1024
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:20,310
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

1025
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,274
Yeah, me too.

1026
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,350
Did we just find our sound?

1027
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,170
I think we did.

1028
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,049
My work here is done.

1029
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,010
Thank you.

1030
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:32,514
Fat Amy, you never told us what
you're gonna do after graduation.

1031
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,580
No, I don't have any plans, 'cause you guys
know me, I just love living in the moment.

1032
01:21:40,808 --> 01:21:43,108
- Ashley, what are you gonna do?
- Actually, though,

1033
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:48,520
if we were to stop and really think what
could Fat Amy be capable of in the future,

1034
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,471
I'll tell you guys...

1035
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:54,481
I'd be living somewhere, like,
sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock.

1036
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:59,890
By day I'm a professional jelly wrestler...
for corporate events.

1037
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:05,510
And then, every night it's just me
cuddled-up with my fiancé, Bumper, and...

1038
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:08,754
Wait!

1039
01:22:12,101 --> 01:22:14,347
I'm in love Bumper.

1040
01:22:14,802 --> 01:22:17,472
Okay, I've done something terrible,

1041
01:22:17,623 --> 01:22:20,997
and I'm not talking about crop
dusting Chloe and Beca right now.

1042
01:22:21,148 --> 01:22:22,291
'Pologize for that.

1043
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:27,586
Ya know, I need to go right now,
I'm running to win back my man.

1044
01:22:27,662 --> 01:22:30,321
Screw you judgment.

1045
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,282
Go get him, Fat Amy.

1046
01:22:36,213 --> 01:22:37,483
Guys! What happened?

1047
01:22:37,634 --> 01:22:39,909
Shake it off, Amy.

1048
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:42,016
Somebody bring a S'more.

1049
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,686
I give you our next album cover.

1050
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:48,006
Look at him,
<i>I did it all myself, today.</i>

1051
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:51,926
- I know that I only have one vote,
-<i> You got no vote, you're not in the Group, so...</i>

1052
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:54,046
- Okay, well, that hurts my feelings.
- It's just the truth, isn't it?

1053
01:22:54,096 --> 01:22:58,496
Well, that hurts my feeling with my vote,
I vote "no" to the pig,

1054
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,885
and "yes" to this "gloriousness".

1055
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:03,005
Yeah, it's great,
we'll put it to a vote later.

1056
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:05,455
<i> Bumper, I'm coming.</i>

1057
01:23:45,211 --> 01:23:46,911
Nope, turn it around.

1058
01:23:59,031 --> 01:24:00,631
I don't want to see you.

1059
01:24:07,805 --> 01:24:09,775
I must've misjudged the size of this lake.

1060
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:11,995
Why didn't she just
walk around the lake?

1061
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:14,015
Fat Amy doesn't do anything small.

1062
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:18,333
Yes, I do use my shower shoes,
Yeah, I love you, too, here she is.

1063
01:24:21,165 --> 01:24:22,465
Whatup, Ms. Junk?

1064
01:24:39,885 --> 01:24:40,985
Garu.

1065
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:47,559
What are you doing?
I'm soloing here.

1066
01:24:48,679 --> 01:24:49,879
Whatever!

1067
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:12,968
<i>Get it the house.</i>

1068
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:19,619
I mean, we can do... do you want... do you
fell like you'd want to layer a bunch of voices?

1069
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:23,939
I think in the beginning
it could definitely build,

1070
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:26,229
I think it starts out light, though.

1071
01:26:26,379 --> 01:26:31,302
- Get your cute butt in the video, then.
- Don't tell my boss that we're in it.

1072
01:26:36,142 --> 01:26:38,742
Wow, this is the real deal.

1073
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:42,593
Don't touch anything, Leipzig,
you're very pretty, but you're still clumsy.

1074
01:26:42,982 --> 01:26:44,182
Great.

1075
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:14,706
Okay, so... so you... produced this?

1076
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:17,112
Uh, yes, Emily wrote it.

1077
01:27:17,263 --> 01:27:18,753
Who's own?
- I.

1078
01:27:18,904 --> 01:27:21,104
- This tall drink of water, right there.
- Here... Emily.

1079
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:23,742
Well, um...

1080
01:27:25,202 --> 01:27:26,802
I don't, I don't, I don't like it.

1081
01:27:27,422 --> 01:27:31,822
What it is, is, I don't... I don't like
it when people can do what I can do.

1082
01:27:32,642 --> 01:27:35,342
<i>Ya know, in a matter of speaking,
it's threatening.</i>

1083
01:27:35,862 --> 01:27:37,962
But you just did it.

1084
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,896
The few notes,
that I assume that you're open to,

1085
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:48,502
this is a solid demo
with real potential.

1086
01:27:48,822 --> 01:27:53,512
Yeah, I... I look forward to working together.
It's nice to meet you, what is it?

1087
01:27:53,562 --> 01:27:55,932
- Emily. - Elizabeth? - Emily. - Elizabeth? What?

1088
01:27:56,082 --> 01:27:57,882
Emily, thank you.

1089
01:27:59,402 --> 01:28:03,302
I gotta jump on a call. Yeah, oh, no.
Get in there, get in there, attagirl.

1090
01:28:04,052 --> 01:28:05,727
- Oh, hey.
- There it is, there ya go.

1091
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,922
- Good job, Reggie.
- I'm Reggie.

1092
01:28:10,073 --> 01:28:12,742
I was so nervous,
I didn't know what to say.

1093
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,482
Guys, we're gonna be late.

1094
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:20,802
We're taking a photo with or without you, we're taking a photo with
or without you, we're taking a photo with or without you.

1095
01:28:21,122 --> 01:28:22,483
Everybody get together.

1096
01:28:23,606 --> 01:28:27,415
One-two-three...
Barden High!

1097
01:28:47,082 --> 01:28:50,852
Topic... so, is there a restaurant in this
town that serves something other than fish?

1098
01:28:51,002 --> 01:28:53,772
- Oh, I did see a KFC back there.
- No, all fish. I checked.

1099
01:28:53,922 --> 01:28:55,822
Guys! Over here.

1100
01:28:56,401 --> 01:28:58,301
Oh, Chloe, I'm coming by ya.

1101
01:29:00,683 --> 01:29:03,483
College graduates, spread my wings, Y'all.

1102
01:29:03,986 --> 01:29:05,756
So many fresh things to see.

1103
01:29:05,906 --> 01:29:10,706
I swear, if I wasn't recently locked down,
I would tear a hole through this city.

1104
01:29:11,726 --> 01:29:16,196
This place is so smelly and rainy,
why would Americans ever leave America?

1105
01:29:16,346 --> 01:29:19,546
Culture, design, history.

1106
01:29:20,466 --> 01:29:23,236
- I'm not Copenhagen this place.
- I'm hungry.

1107
01:29:23,386 --> 01:29:26,138
<i>Why don't we go visit Hayden
Christian Andersen's house?</i>

1108
01:29:26,189 --> 01:29:29,667
<i>That guy, he was pretty
crafty in the Star Wars sequels.</i>

1109
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,757
Well, here we are.

1110
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:41,290
Do you think the stage is big
enough for what we want to do?

1111
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,040
- You're kidding, right?
- It's huge.

1112
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:48,460
- You guys think it'll work?
- It'll work for us, that's all that matters.

1113
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,380
Let's go!

1114
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,300
Let's do this thing!

1115
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,596
Everyone knows what it means, right?

1116
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:33,980
- Here it is folks, the grand-daddy of them all.
- The World Championship of a cappella.

1117
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:38,500
Tonight groups from around the globe
duke it out for the title of aca-World champions.

1118
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:42,420
And of course representing America,
the embattled Barden Bellas.

1119
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:46,040
The Bellas making one last attempt
to repair a damaged legacy,

1120
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,960
by becoming the first American team
to claim the title, can they do it, John?

1121
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,980
Theoretically yes, Gail.

1122
01:30:52,131 --> 01:30:55,536
Realistically, absolutely not,
those girls are dead to me.

1123
01:30:55,687 --> 01:30:58,020
So many countries represented
here tonight, John.

1124
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:02,408
We saw in rehearsal an incredible group
from the Philippines, what are they called?

1125
01:31:02,559 --> 01:31:04,359
The Ladyboys.

1126
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:07,780
That wasn't the name of the group, I don't
think, I think that's how they described themselves.

1127
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:11,173
- That's right, they're Manila Envy.
- Manila Envy, you know,

1128
01:31:11,223 --> 01:31:15,100
I spent some time with some Ladyboys...
in the Philippines... myself.

1129
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,419
- That's not surprising.
- Very interesting young men.

1130
01:31:18,469 --> 01:31:20,340
They do amazing things
with their mouths, I presume?

1131
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:23,460
When we go back to the stage,
I'll do a few for you here.

1132
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:26,405
Ya know, we can get to it.
They're right there.

1133
01:31:26,455 --> 01:31:30,300
Maybe when the Koreans are out there,
because no one cares about the Korean groups.

1134
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,950
Love that barbecue.

1135
01:31:39,143 --> 01:31:43,943
- What are you doing here?
- You know, anything to supports the Bellas.

1136
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:51,358
I'm so out of it, I can't speak, I'm so really nervous.

1137
01:31:51,508 --> 01:31:56,918
Don't be, you'll be great,
I mean we heard you guys rehearsing, like, 24/7.

1138
01:31:57,228 --> 01:31:59,852
So, I should probably go find my seat.

1139
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:05,248
But... before I go, I just...
I have something for you.

1140
01:32:14,568 --> 01:32:17,338
I'm so sorry, I thought that was going
in a different direction, that's why...

1141
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:20,556
-<i> No, no, I like it.</i>
- Em, you ready?

1142
01:32:21,128 --> 01:32:23,128
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.

1143
01:32:26,848 --> 01:32:28,248
Okay, well, break a leg.

1144
01:34:28,366 --> 01:34:32,756
Well done! There they go!
The Indian group, The Non Stops.

1145
01:34:32,906 --> 01:34:35,876
Running off stage to take
a few more of our jobs.

1146
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:38,592
I thought the little one was spicy!

1147
01:34:43,646 --> 01:34:48,385
<i>- And coming up next, Das Sound Machine.
- A crowd favorite, John.</i>

1148
01:34:50,577 --> 01:34:54,225
Do you hear that?
They cheer... for us.

1149
01:34:54,697 --> 01:34:58,597
Now, don't cry too hard when you lose,
it makes your eyes puffy.

1150
01:34:59,017 --> 01:35:00,387
Your hands are so soft.

1151
01:35:00,537 --> 01:35:03,129
I'm sorry, I don't speak Loser,
what did you say?

1152
01:35:03,257 --> 01:35:06,727
She actually speaks eight languages,
but Loser is not one of them.

1153
01:35:06,877 --> 01:35:10,153
Everything must come to an end,
even with Bellas.

1154
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:12,117
Take care and lose nice.

1155
01:35:12,615 --> 01:35:15,818
Your sweat smells like cinnamon.

1156
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:16,868
Damn it!

1157
01:35:23,335 --> 01:35:26,635
Das Sound Machine.

1158
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:33,582
<i>They've got the crowd going wild!</i>

1159
01:37:33,732 --> 01:37:34,832
Okay! Channel!

1160
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:42,552
Das Sound Machine, an incredible performance,
once again from the German group.

1161
01:37:42,872 --> 01:37:45,942
I'm telling you, Gail, though,
if the Bellas of old show up tonight,

1162
01:37:46,092 --> 01:37:52,162
this could be the most significant conflict
between America and Germany... in history.

1163
01:37:52,312 --> 01:37:53,812
Rack a book, Jack!

1164
01:37:57,732 --> 01:38:00,528
Pass 'em on to your friends, here ya go.

1165
01:38:00,852 --> 01:38:02,522
Here ya go, Buddy.

1166
01:38:02,672 --> 01:38:07,072
- Thanks, Man, where've ya been?
- You have no idea, Dude.

1167
01:38:07,431 --> 01:38:11,351
- Final performance, Guys.
- We need to get out there and beat D.S.M.

1168
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:13,412
This one's for us.

1169
01:38:13,462 --> 01:38:15,891
Guys,
there's gonna be some haters out there,

1170
01:38:16,511 --> 01:38:20,065
and they're gonna look at us,
Team U.S.A., and be like,

1171
01:38:20,115 --> 01:38:22,331
"Why is the most talented one Australian?"

1172
01:38:23,351 --> 01:38:26,921
Well, guess what, I'm fat,
so that is close enough.

1173
01:38:27,071 --> 01:38:30,241
We are going to show
them who we are,

1174
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:34,661
a bunch of ethnically diverse,
for the most part feminine,

1175
01:38:34,811 --> 01:38:37,759
amazing singers.

1176
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:40,666
Let's just get out there and aca the World.

1177
01:38:42,621 --> 01:38:46,897
John, it's possible we are watching
the last hurrah of the Barden Bellas.

1178
01:38:46,947 --> 01:38:50,311
It's gonna be very hard to pull this off,
and if they don't...

1179
01:38:50,461 --> 01:38:54,861
they are out of business as an
a cappella group... it is over.

1180
01:38:58,381 --> 01:39:02,781
We are Barden University's Bellas.

1181
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:07,583
That's my girl.

1182
01:41:31,833 --> 01:41:36,433
Is it possible,
the Barden Bellas are doing an original song?

1183
01:42:13,984 --> 01:42:18,354
<i>It looks like the Barden Bellas are being
joined on stage by generations of Bellas,</i>

1184
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:20,650
<i>going all the way back to the beginning.</i>

1185
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:43,825
<i>Simple, raw, vulnerable, exposed.</i>

1186
01:43:43,975 --> 01:43:47,223
I've been called a lot of things,
Gail, but let me add one more,

1187
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:50,674
- I'm impressed.
- I thought you were going to say "gay".

1188
01:44:10,116 --> 01:44:15,886
Oh, they have touched every person here,
they've touched me, John.

1189
01:44:16,036 --> 01:44:20,536
Well, everyone has touched you, Gail,
but this is something else.

1190
01:44:34,389 --> 01:44:37,523
<u><b>2015 WORLD A CAPELLA CHAMPIONS</b></u>

1191
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:43,165
It's ceremonial, and you should definitely not
drink it, because it's essentially poisonous...

1192
01:44:43,215 --> 01:44:45,100
- terrible for you. - Okay. - Okay. - Great.

1193
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:49,120
Oh, it smells like cherries and vanilla.

1194
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,440
Okay, repeat after me,
"I", sing your name.

1195
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,170
"I, Emily,"

1196
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,957
promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever.

1197
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:02,091
"promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever."

1198
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,807
And that's it, that's the end of the speech,
it's... nothing weird happens after that.

1199
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:09,040
These are for you,
don't go in the basement, it's haunted.

1200
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,868
Wait, one more thing.

1201
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:16,080
Yes, every Bella must christen the house
by sliding down the staircase.

1202
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,377
- Seriously?
- It's tradition, yeah.

1203
01:45:20,697 --> 01:45:22,497
Don't worry, I'll show you.

1204
01:45:25,217 --> 01:45:26,417
Behold!

1205
01:45:35,137 --> 01:45:36,431
Crushed it!

1206
01:45:37,157 --> 01:45:38,557
Good one.

1207
01:45:39,277 --> 01:45:41,293
Now I'm ready to move on.

1208
01:45:42,097 --> 01:45:43,797
Legacy, you're up!

1209
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:49,316
All right, I'm ready!

1210
01:45:49,398 --> 01:45:51,459
Let's do this!
