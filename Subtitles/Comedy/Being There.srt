00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,557
Yes, I could stay here.

345
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,359
-Does this house have a garden?
-Why, yes. Many.

346
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,636
Good.

347
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,154
Keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner.

348
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,799
Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.

349
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,393
WlLSON: Yes, Doctor.
ALLENBY: Thank you.

350
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,876
Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?

351
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,029
Ever wonder why?

352
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,789
I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?

353
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,034
EVE: No headaches?

354
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,277
No, it's been a fairly good day.

355
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,151
RAND: Better than yours, so I've been told.
EVE: You heard about it?

356
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,673
I may be a shut-in, but....

357
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,271
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

358
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,511
It was nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.

359
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,753
EVE: And Mr. Gardiner
is a very reasonable man.

360
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,109
Reasonable....

361
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,598
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.

362
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,796
Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?

363
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,156
Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.

364
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,148
RAND: Gardiner.

365
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,396
You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?

366
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,234
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.

367
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,829
Yes, sir.

368
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,710
I'll have them set another place.

369
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,270
[Soft, sentimental instrumental music]

370
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,235
My God, Eve, you'll freeze.

371
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,397
EVE: No. I just....

372
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,109
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

373
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,073
How's Mr. Gardiner?

374
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,756
Doesn't seem to be too serious.

375
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,196
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him...

376
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,078
...so I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.

377
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,115
EVE: Here?

378
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?

379
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,716
Not necessary, but helpful.

380
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,232
ALLENBY: Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.

381
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,038
He is different, isn't he?

382
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,918
You know, he's very...

383
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,949
...intense.

384
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,909
Perhaps.

385
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,793
Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.

386
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,158
That's a very small room.

387
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,630
Yes, sir, I guess that's true.
Smallest room in the house.

388
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,950
CHANCE: Yes, I guess that's true.

389
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,592
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital.

390
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,798
CHANCE: Thank you.
BlLLlNGS: Can I help you to the table?

391
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,949
CHANCE: Thank you.

392
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,952
CHANCE: I feel very good in here.

393
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,079
RAND: That's the oxygen.

394
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,512
When I first got sick...

395
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,879
...I had this entire room glassed in...

396
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,839
...so they could pump in
some extra oxygen.

397
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,432
Keeps my spirits up.

398
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,038
You must be very ill.

399
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,790
Aplastic anemia.

400
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,669
The bone marrow doesn't supply
enough red blood cells.

401
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,475
Not a damn thing they can do about it.

402
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,240
They can keep me comfortable.

403
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,713
Prolong my life with steroid therapy...

404
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,518
...and these transfusions.

405
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,635
But what makes my blood boil...

406
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,429
...that is, what there is of it...

407
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,313
...is that this is usually...

408
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,956
...a young person's disease.

409
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,559
Here I am getting along in years...

410
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,510
...and I'm about to die
of a young person's disease.

411
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,794
[Rand makes a disgusted sound]

412
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,273
CHANCE: I've never seen anything like this
on television.

413
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,356
Please, lie still, Mr. Gardiner.

414
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,713
RAND: You'll join us for dinner, of course.

415
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,990
Yes, please. Thank you.

416
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,479
I'm very hungry.

417
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,032
Yes, so am l, my boy.

418
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,158
So am l.

419
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,479
Do you know Raphael?

420
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,838
No, sir. I don't believe I do.

421
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,471
Because I have a message for him.

422
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,709
Yes, sir?

423
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,230
A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.

424
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,311
I still don't believe I know the man,
Mr. Gardiner. Now, please...

425
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,229
...Iie still.

426
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,275
EVE: Is there anyone we could notify
for you?

427
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,235
CHANCE: No.

428
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,112
CHANCE: The old man died and Louise left.

429
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,713
EVE: I'm very sorry.

430
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,395
EVE: I do hope your injury won't prevent
you from attending to business.

431
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,798
Do you need a secretary?

432
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,788
No, thank you.

433
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,671
My house was shut down.

434
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,355
You mean your business was shut down?

435
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,190
Yes.

436
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,434
Shut down and closed by the attorneys.

437
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,510
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I mean.

438
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,752
The businessman today is at the mercy
of kid lawyers from the SEC.

439
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,591
ALLENBY: It's happening to everyone,
I'm afraid.

440
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,389
The way things are going, they'll probably
legislate the medical profession...

441
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,833
...right out of existence.

442
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,873
Yes. Right out of existence.

443
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,957
Yeah, it's a damn shame.

444
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,950
What are your plans now, Mr. Gardiner?

445
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,912
Or may I call you Chauncey?

446
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,473
Chauncey's fine.

447
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,715
So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?

448
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,157
I would like to work in your garden.

449
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,516
I know exactly what he means.
Isn't it wonderful...

450
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,960
...to be with the trees
and the flowers like that?

451
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,591
I never had much feel for it, myself.

452
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,191
I'm a very good gardener.

453
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,516
It's such a pleasant way
to forget one's troubles.

454
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,470
Isn't that what any businessman is?
A gardener.

455
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,510
He...

456
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,799
...works on...

457
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,993
...flinty soil...

458
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,598
...to make it productive...

459
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,156
...with the labor of his own hands.

460
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,992
He waters it...

461
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,836
...with the sweat of his own brow.

462
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,797
He makes a thing of value for his family...

463
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,632
...and for the community.

464
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,159
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...

465
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,673
...is a laborer in the vineyard.

466
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,711
I know exactly what you mean.

467
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,879
The garden that I left was such a place.

468
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,756
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...

469
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,272
...is the room upstairs.

470
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,594
Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.

471
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,479
You've got your health.

472
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,677
For God's sake, man, you can't let those
bastards get you down. You've got to fight.

473
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,196
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.

474
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,479
That's where I'm going, too damn soon.

CHANCE: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

477
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,511
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.

478
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,395
You know...

479
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,189
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...

480
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,959
...in your situation.

481
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,469
I've...

482
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,636
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.

483
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,635
They've been harassed long enough by...

484
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,278
...inflation, increased taxation...

485
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,711
...all sorts of indecencies.

486
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,556
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...

487
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,278
...of our basic freedoms...

488
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,550
...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.

489
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,675
I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.

490
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,313
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?

491

CHANCE: No, Ben.

492
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,157
Reluctant to speak, eh?

493
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,478
I can understand that.

494
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,591
After a man's lost everything...

495
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,390
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.

496
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,874
But, you work on the idea.

497
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,589

Fertilize it.

I will, Ben. Yes.

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,077
CHANCE: Are you going to leave and close
this house when Ben dies?

519
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,799
EVE: Why, I don't think so.

520
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,589
CHANCE: Goodnight, Eve.

521
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,548
EVE: Goodnight, Chauncey.

522
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,636
-'Morning, Mr. Perkins.
-'Morning, Mr. Riff.

523
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,709
-Nice to see you.
-Thanks.

524
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,429
We have an additional guest with us today,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

525
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,231
I see. Shall we set up the communications
in the usual place?

526
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,390
-Of course.
-Okay, let's go to work.

527
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,472
LEWlS: Would you like a car, sir?

528
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,032
Yes, I would like a car.

529
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,229
Yes, sir.

530
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,629
Thank you.

531
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,352
Send up number seven, please.

532
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,111
Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?

533
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,798
It's fine today, Robert.

534
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,713
Shame on you.
Let me be the judge of that.

535
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,793
Please, sit in the chair.

536
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,757
I swear, between you and Benjamin,
I've got my hands full.

537
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,277
Say, that is coming along.
The swelling's gone down considerably.

538
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,713
Your limousine, sir.

539
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,634
Fine. Thank you.

540
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,871
Are you going somewhere?

541
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,349
No.

542
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,110
[Birds chirp in background]

543
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,359
Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.

544
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,077
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.

545
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,070
I know about the President coming.

546
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,918
-You do, do you?
-Yes.

547
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,629
Ben would like me to meet the President.

548
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,798
-He would, would he?
-Yes.

549
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,236
How will I know when it's 10:00?

550
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,156
It's 9:10, now.

551
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,510
And if you don't see a clock...

552
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,030
...I'm sure someone will have the time.

553
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,914
I understand.

554
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,113
I'm going to walk.

555
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,879
Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.

556
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,193
-You're meeting the President, aren't you?
-Yes.

557
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,351
CHANCE: I've watched him on television.

558
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,352
It's very precise, sir.

559
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,269
It's 10:00.

560
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,959
Thank you, Jim.

561
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,634
Mrs. Aubrey, the President is arriving.

562
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,390
[Sirens blaring]

563
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,195
-Up and around this morning, are you?
-I like to walk, Ben.

564
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,197
RAND: That's good news, my boy.

565
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,510
CHANCE: You look much better today.

566
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,439
It's all make-up.

567
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,195
I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.

568
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,554
I didn't want the President to think
I would die while he was talking to me.

569
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,595
I see.

570
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,959
Nobody likes a dying man.

571
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,031
Because nobody knows what death is.

572
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,474
You seem to be an exception.

573
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,633
That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.

574
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,319
You seem to be a truly peaceful man.

575
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,755
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

576
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,675
Nurse Teresa did a very good job there.

577
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,230
[Sirens blaring]

578
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,954
Mr. Rand, the President is arriving.

579
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,999
Just show the President into the library.
We'll be along in a few minutes.

580
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,311
An old habit that goes along with power:
Keep them waiting.

581
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,389
[Rand chuckles]

582
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,473
Not now, Arthur.

583
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,755
But, sir....

584
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,554
I'm going to meet the President...

585
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,238
...on my own two feet.

586
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,394
Shall we go?

587
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,352
That's a very good idea.

588
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,033
RAND: When I was younger,
I had thoughts of public office.

589
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,712
But I found that...

590
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,669
...I was able to contribute more
as a private citizen.

591
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,989
Of course, my...

592
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,115
...wealth provided me
with considerable influence.

593
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,638
But I've tried, believe me, I've tried...

594
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,555
...not to misuse that power.

595
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,356
It's extremely important
that we don't allow ourselves...

596
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,319
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...

597
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,320
...no matter how strong the temptation.

598
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,794
I've been labeled a kingmaker...

599
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,156
...but I've tried...

600
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,752
...to keep myself open
to the voice of the people.

601
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,393
RAND: And I've remained honest to myself.

602
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,798
RAND: That's the main thing.

603
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,394
SECURlTY: Good morning, Mr. Rand.
RAND: Good morning.

604
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,278
Where the hell is he?

605
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,033
RAND: Mr. President.

606
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,515
Ben.

607

PRESlDENT: It's good to see you.
You look terrific.

608
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,078
Thank you, Mr. President.

609
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,068
Your visit has helped to raise my spirits.

610
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,115
I've missed you, my friend.

611
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,680
Come, sit down. Take a load off your feet.

612
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,319
Hello, Mr. President.

613
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,110
Hello.

614
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,791
I want you to meet my very dear friend,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

615
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,278
On television, Mr. President,
you look much smaller.

616
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,469
I must warn you,
Chauncey's not a man to bandy words.

617
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,671
Oh? Really?

618
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,554
PRESlDENT: Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man
who appreciates a frank discussion.

619
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,309
PRESlDENT: Would you be seated?
CHANCE: Yes, I will.

620
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,433
-Ben, I was wondering if you had a chance--
-Yes?

621
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,154
-Did you happen to have a chance to go--
-Yes?

622
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,399
Ben, did you read my speech?

623
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,756
Overall, pretty good.

624
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,314
But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...

625
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,956
...to play around with temporary measures
at a time like this.

626
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,039
Ben, I mean....

627
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,912
RAND: I sympathize with you...

628
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,552
...and I know how difficult it is
to be straightforward.

629
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,392
RAND: But I'll tell you right now, Bobby....

630
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,954
ALLENBY: Hi.
RlFF: Hi. I'm Riff. Secret Service.

631
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,119
Good. Of course.

632
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,995
What you're saying, Ben, is that...

633
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,550
-...you don't think I should take the chance.
-Absolutely not.

634
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,274
Do you agree with Ben, or do you think
we can stimulate growth through...

635
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,158
...temporary incentives?

636
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,073
As long as the roots are not severed...

637
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,348
...all is well.

638
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,718
And all will be well...

639
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,959
...in the garden.

640
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,112
-ln the garden?
-Yes.

641
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,470
In a garden, growth has its season.

642
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,191
First comes spring and summer...

643
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,838
...but then we have...

644
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,557
...fall and winter.

645
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,751
And then we get spring and summer again.

646
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,992
-Spring and summer?
-Yes.

647
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,671
-And fall and winter?
-Yes.

648
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,149
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...

649
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,670
...is that we welcome the inevitable...

650
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,638
...seasons of nature...

651
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,038
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.

652
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,435
Yes.

653
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,110
There will be growth in the spring.

654
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,554
I must admit, that is one of the most
refreshing and optimistic statements...

655
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,710
...I've heard in a very long time.

656
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,791
I admire your good, solid sense.

657
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,874
That's precisely what we lack
on Capitol Hill.

658
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,679

for your time and thought.

with a dying man.

to your friend Chauncey?
