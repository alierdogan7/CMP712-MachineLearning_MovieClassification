throw like that?

52

In the bushes, if you miss, you don't
eat. Isn't that right, Mick?

you can say,
"We didn't do nothin'."

01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,955
Plan was working till you
turned up and shot Mick.

1050
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,927
That's not Mick?

1051
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,605
'Course not.
There's Mick over there.

1052
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:42,146
(GASPS)

1053
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:06,796
Mick's bloody lucky you
can't shoot straight, Wal.

1054
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,772
You ready to go home now?

1055
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,270
I am home.
