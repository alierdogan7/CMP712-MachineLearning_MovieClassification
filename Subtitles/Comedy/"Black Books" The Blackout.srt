00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,790
Fran! Fran! Fran!

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,394
Bernard, Bernard!

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,675
There you are.
Wait till you hear this.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,356
No, me first. I can't hold onto
this one. My story goes first.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,193
- No! I'm not backing down.
- Neither am I.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,157
- You know what that means.
- Count.

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,117
One, two, three.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,273
(Screaming)

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,715
- Say "peanuts".
- Peanuts.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,234
- I want Manny in on this.
- No, he's no good.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,199
He stayed up all night
with his birthday present.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,670
A complete set of The Sweeney
and an espresso machine.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,472
(Phone)

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,949
Hello? What? Do me a favour.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,237
It's a flamin' bookshop.
Course we got Jane Austen.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,919
(Bell)

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,472
Right. OK, my story.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,676
- Imagine, yeah?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,354
- Imagine you're a woman.
- OK.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,750
- And now imagine...
- Wait! I'm still...

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,034
OK. And now imagine
you have a boyfriend.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,839
(Giggling)

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,118
OK? And now imagine
you see that boyfriend...

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,839
with another woman.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,592
(Whimpers)

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,512
- OK! My story!
- It's Peter I'm talking about.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,591
Peter wouldn't do that to me... you.

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,229
He's scum. This morning,
I was getting into my car...

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,509
- I just feel so...
- Awww.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,318
Now, my story.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,959
- You know Gerald and Sarah?
- Gerald, er, your friend...

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,873
Friend? When I first came to London,

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,599
he put me up, he lent me money,

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,114
he helped me find a job, this place.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,634
I was an incredibly
good friend to him.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,156
And even though, even though
I fancied his girlfriend,

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,196
I did not make a pass at her.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,669
Well, once. Twice. A few times.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,070
But not after I realised
just how angry it made him.

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,674
- Once, but only...
- Get on with the story.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,639
Well, they invited me to
a dinner party and I went,

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,757
had a good time, woke up
with a bit of a hangover.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,514
Well, a big hangover.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,160
So I went to the chemist
to get some fizzigood.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,038
- Some what?
- Fizzigood - make feel nice.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,429
- Oh, Alka-Seltzer.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,551
"Soluble."

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,591
Mm. Mm. Make feel nice.

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,956
(Mumbling) Fizzigood feel nice.

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,237
Gerald! Sarah!
Thanks for the dinner party!

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,557
'Completely blanked me.'

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,676
Well, maybe they didn't see you.

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,149
Could something have distracted them?

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,912
Like what?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,389
Gunfire. Was somebody shooting?

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,832
Let's see. Was someone firing a gun?
Was someone firing...?

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,273
No, I don't think so.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,318
Manny, you look like
you could use some sleep.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,516
Yeah, yeah, in a little bit.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,716
The thing is, this bloke behind me,

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,314
behind me, behind me... don't look!

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,075
- I reckon he's got a shooter.
- He's a hundred years old.

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,996
You're wired on coffee and cops.

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,629
And so what? So they blanked you.

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,871
So what? So what? They blanked me.

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,270
That's a powerful
thing in civilised society.

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,952
It's like, it's like...

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,715
when the Mafia send each other
fish through the post.

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,631
You must've done something awful.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,790
Something really awful.
Do you think?

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,273
Oh. You didn't do that thing?
Your Belly Savalas thing?

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,477
No, I didn't do Belly Savalas.

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,517
So, Bernard, being blanked
really made you feel that bad?

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,477
Yeah. Terrible!

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,834
Hmm.

76
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,037
Manny, get some sleep.

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,197
Something really awful.
God, what did I do?

78
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,999
What did I do? Think! Think!

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,036
Get down!

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,838
Thank you. Enjoy.

81
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,388
It's dreadful but it's quite short.

82
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,593
Manny! Come over here.

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,353
You want a case?
I'll give you a case.

84
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,874
Figure out what I did last night.

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,632
OK, the dinner party.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,672
Ooh!

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,079
What?

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,472
Sat on myself.

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,268
All right. Let's start
by reconstructing the evening.

90
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,839
Who else was there?

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,912
Well, Gerald and Sarah, obviously.

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,553
- What's their D-40?
- Well... What?

93
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,315
- What do they do?
- Oh. Gerald's a food writer.

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,552
He had a big hit with
Basic Meals for the Ultra-Rich.

95
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,996
Sarah's an interior designer.
She's on that programme,

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,991
- Pet Surprise.
- Pet Surprise?

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,798
- What's that?
- Oh, you know.

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,917
They take the dog out,
he thinks it's a normal walk,

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,116
but when they come back...

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,869
the kennel has a patio
and French doors.

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,110
Yep. Yeah, yeah.

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,509
Then they take the blindfold off...

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,670
And he's like, "Oh, my God."

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,228
- Right.
- And there were a few others,

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,993
people who talk about salad
for five hours.

106
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,390
(Bernard, drunkenly)
And then I won again.

107
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,836
He was smaller than me,
only eight, but I still won.

108
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,072
I won again and again
and again and again.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,630
So. How much had you had to drink...

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,676
before you turned up?

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,593
- You assume I'd been drinking.
- How much?

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,638
- How much? How much?
- That I'd... have a...

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,631
- How much?
- A couple of bottles.

114
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,188
Right. So you were
in a bit of a state.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,508
No, I was fine.

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,512
Oh, come on! Think!

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,397
(Doorbell)

118
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,629
(Police radio)

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,154
- Hiya.
- Is this yours?

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,879
- Er, yes.
- Misunderstanding.

121
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,555
Not her fault. She's young.
High spirits. Thanks!

122
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,870
Try and keep it indoors.

123
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,430
See what you did? You made
the police come to their house!

124
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,478
Wow. There's more.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,949
Oh, God, Bernard, look at you!

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,430
I'm a happy-go-lucky scamp.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,799
Exquisite gifts, as always.
You're very early, Bernard.

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,917
Oh. You remember Jimbo, don't you?

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,434
I'm not sure. What do you do?

130
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,432
- No, he's our son.
- Oh, thank God.

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,069
I thought you had a disease.
Oh, this is a child.

132
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,912
(Sarah) Gerald?
Can you help me, please?

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,470
Ah, Jim.
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

134
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,791
Come here. We'll do the thing. Ah!

135
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,552
Here.

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,871
Here... there we go.

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,428
Take it. Shh... Take it.

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,229
Now... Actually, Jim,
can I have that back?

139
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,878
Shh. Thanks.

140
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,599
Jim, have I told you
about the old country?

141
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,433
The songs, Jim.
Oh, they'd melt your face.

142
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,592
# Oh, I live in a shoe
on Moore Street

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,035
# I'm a prostitute from Newry #

144
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,031
The child's involved somehow.

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,395
He's done something
and pinned it on me.

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,917
Huh. It's always the children,
isn't it, Bernard?

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,594
Manny, if you have
one more sip of coffee...

148
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,956
(Old woman) Help! Help! Help!

149
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,837
I got it!

150
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,278
- Help! Help!
- Wait! Stop!

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,749
(# Cop show chase music)

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,954
(Music stops)

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,190
(Music resumes)

154
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,318
All right?

155
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,674
(Old woman) And my keys!
My house keys, they were in it.

156
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,672
How will I get into
my house without my keys?

157
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,955
It was a plainclothes policeman?

158
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,429
Yes. Oh, officer, officer...

159
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,515
Bernard!

160
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,392
Bernard!

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,429
No questions, OK?
Can you do my shoelace?

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,829
No can do, neckface.

163
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,998
- What happened to you?
- What happened to you?

164
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,274
You first.

165
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,830
No, come on.
Are you the next Bond villain?

166
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,673
You should have
"Dorset - 5 miles" on you.

167
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,876
Come on, you tell. Tell me.

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,793
Don't mind this.
It's a very dull story. Come on.

169
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,632
No, no. You first, come on.

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,358
- Tell me.
- No.

171
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,556
Oww!

172
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,073
- Tell me.
- Tell me.

173
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,950
- Ah, ah, ah!
- (Laughing) No, no, no!

174
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,476
Ahh! OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

175
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,993
OK.

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,198
You remember when I told you
I saw Peter with that girl?

177
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,872
Mm-hmm.

178
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,918
I couldn't get it out of my head
so I shut the shop,

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,118
went down the beauty parlour
and got myself done.

180
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,034
'When the next thing, who walks
by the window but Peter? '

181
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,471
Then I remembered what you said

182
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,835
about the awesome power of the blank.

183
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,593
'And I knew I might not get
a second chance.'

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,672
So you dealt with this
in a mature, reason...

185
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,478
Shut up. Anyway...

186
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,118
Fran?

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,069
Fran?

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,998
Fran?

189
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,798
Fran!

190
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,233
(Tyres screeching)

191
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,389
(Thud)

192
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,311
You were knocked down and...

193
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,960
No, that's not how I got this.

194
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,031
The way I got this was...

195
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,998
No, it's too embarrassing.
You next, what happened?

196
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,277
- Well, I was...
- (Phone)

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,351
- We're closed.
- We're closed!

198
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,791
(Quietly) Hello? Hello? Hello?!

199
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,758
Yeah, yeah. Hello... Raiders.

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,037
You'd just better watch it!

201
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,877
Or I'll be down your manor
with all the other policemen!

202
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,909
And we'll arrest your arse. Goodbye.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,753
You know, I thought
you might want some coffee.

204
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,751
- No, I've gotta go.
- No, wait.

205
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,718
We need you.
Look, got a favour to ask.

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,109
We got someone
who isn't turning over.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,236
Could you sit in
on the interview?

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,596
- Hey?
- What's with the face fungus?

209
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,389
Er... undercover. Undercover work.

210
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,278
Gotta blend in
with a heavy metal group

211
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,669
who stole some... furniture.

212
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,115
- Right.
- Bastards!

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,555
So anyway, can you help us out?

214
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,757
No, l-I can't, I really can't.
They need me on the job.

215
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,354
Hang on. Who's your governor?
I'll ask him.

216
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,796
- Oh, what the hell.
- Good lad.

217
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,677
- Grab your coffee.
- Right.

218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,716
(Gulping)

219
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,550
OK, so far,
we've been going at him hard.

220
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,555
It might be time he found that
sympathetic ear he needs.

221
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,997
Know what I mean?
So I'm nasty, you're nice. OK?

222
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,559
- (Mumbles)
- What?

223
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,872
- You're not so bad.
- No, no. In the interview.

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,432
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was, er...
making a police joke.

225
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,829
Yeah, right.
It's Barry, by the way.

226
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,230
- Carter.
- Carter? Yeah, lovely.

227
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,198
We'll let him sweat it out
for a few minutes, OK?

228
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Finish your coffee.
It's not bad, is it?

229
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,195
(Squeaking unintelligibly)

230
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,556
Bernard! Come on!

231
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,551
(Bernard groans, cork pops)

232
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,870
So, what happened?

233
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,992
All right. After you left,

234
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,992
I remembered something about
the dinner party.

235
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,516
I did do Belly Savalas.

236
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,273
Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby.

237
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,353
What's that?
I can't hear you, Belly Savalas.

238
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,032
(Pop!)

239
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,076
Who loves you, baby?

240
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,469
Ha ha. What about that, eh?

241
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,475
But I also realised it wasn't
Belly Savalas that upset them.

242
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,596
It was something else.

243
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,875
Something much, much worse.

244
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,038
Oh, you didn't do Cobumbo, did you?

245
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,031
No. I didn't have any cigars.

246
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,229
All right,
so you were knocked down.

247
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,074
Even though I wasn't badly hurt,
I went to hospital for checks.

248
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,833
And Peter insisted on coming with me.

249
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,955
OK.

250
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,031
I blanked him in the ambulance.

251
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,236
How do you blank somebody
in an ambulance?

252
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,357
Come on, Fran. Keep your eyes
fixed on mine. Come on!

253
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,670
Fran? Your eyes on mine.

254
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,830
Keep your eyes fixed on mine!

255
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,717
(Cracking)

256
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,598
Fran! Fran! Hurry, man, hurry!

257
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,638
Did you ever get to tell him
why you were blanking him?

258
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,233
I certainly did.

259
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,551
I spent some time explaining
in very clear terms

260
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,596
why he was a scumbag

261
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,593
and the fancy lady
he was with was a slut.

262
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,872
- It was his sister.
- Yes.

263
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,119
He was comforting her.

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,997
Just lost her job.

265
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,991
Ah. He won't be seeing you again?

266
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,949
He says he wants to see other,
less mad women.

267
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,792
All right, now you, come on.

268
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,633
I want to know how you
became the little teapot.

269
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,234
I don't want to tell it again
for Manny. Where is he?

270
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,876
Remember, I'm nasty, you're nice.

271
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,636
Nogsy.

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,836
You miss me?

273
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,833
I was just thinking, "When's
Inspector Norris coming back?"

274
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,912
Oi! Smart lip doesn't work
with me, Nogsy.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,319
I don't react well to it.

276
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,597
Now, you better start
giving me something solid

277
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,955
or I'll feed you to the sharks.

278
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,718
(Clearing throat)

279
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,597
You have...

280
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,591
beautiful eyes.

281
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,190
You're going away, understand me?
This is the end of the line.

282
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,593
Shall I phone Hong Kong Kitchen
and get us all some crispy duck?

283
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,716
Sorry? Listen.

284
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,918
You better speak up or else
we'll be talking to your missus.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,389
How do you like that, family man?

286
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,359
Hey. When this has blown over,
let's go see Les Miserables.

287
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,720
Have you been to the zoo?
It's brilliant.

288
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,075
What's, er... What's going on?

289
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,912
Carter.

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,913
Listen. I don't know what you're
doing but it's working.

291
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,958
He's getting shaky.
You take over. Offer him a deal.

292
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,952
- What sort of deal?
- You call it.

293
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,999
Don't give away too much.
He's looking at two years minimum.

294
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,878
- I'll be back in ten.
- Huh?

295
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,958
- Ten minutes.
- Oh.

296
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,397
Hey? Right.

297
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,710
I'm locking the door, Nogsy.

298
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,839
It doesn't open again
until you give my partner something!

299
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,795
Yeah, that's definitely locked.

300
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,436
- I'm not a policeman!
- What?

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,193
I'm not,
I've just had too much coffee!

302
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,350
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,510
- What'll I do?
- I want Norris back.

304
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,592
I'll talk to him,
I ain't talking to you!

305
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,159
Ahhhh!

306
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,276
- (Cork pops)
- Ah!

307
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,918
It's a boy!

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,673
So, come on, back to the story.

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,958
I knew I'd done something
heinous so I went to see them.

310
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,508
(Doorbell)

311
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,353
- What do you want?
- To say I'm sorry.

312
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,874
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Oh. Well.

313
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,598
Please accept my gifts.

314
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,478
Maybe then we could
clear the deck somehow

315
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,915
and-and you could actually tell me

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,798
what it was that I actually...

317
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,835
...did.
- (Phone)

318
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,512
(Screams)

319
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,110
Bernard? Fran?

320
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,199
Well, you did it.

321
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,158
I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

322
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,312
Well, you know, Barry,
I'm just a cop.

323
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,197
Ooh.

324
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,156
Just one copper
tryin' to make a difference.

325
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,389
Yeah.

326
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,758
Fell off a chair to some extent.

327
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,992
You know, Barry,
I been doing this job for tw...

328
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,868
20 min... years, since I was... 15.

329
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,679
And you know,
it doesn't get any easier.

330
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,069
So that's why I've made
my decision to retire.

331
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,470
That's right, I'm retiring.
Nogsy was my last case.

332
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,314
I've had 100% success rate,
I'm only getting older and slower.

333
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,836
It's time for this old warhorse
to be put out to pasture.

334
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,276
Well, that's a shame. I been
on the job nearly 20 years too.

335
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,990
And you are the best bloody
copper I have ever worked with.

336
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,755
- It's been a privilege.
- OK, fair enough.

337
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,478
- All right.
- Yeah.

338
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,950
Oh, God.

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,597
(Bernard) Anyway. Where was I?

340
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,478
You went to Gerald and Sarah's
to ask what you did.

341
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,394
- You mean you don't remember?
- Not as such, no.

342
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,313
You don't remember asking
for about the 100th time

343
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,188
where the toilet was,
drunk out of your skull?

344
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,512
You went to the toilet and you
were gone an awful long time...

345
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,989
Get him out.
Get him out. Get him out.

346
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,911
- I will.
- Out. Get him out now.

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,831
- I will.
- Get him out. Out.

348
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,592
Gerald.

349
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,750
- Could I ask you a question?
- What?

350
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,991
You know the thing, the thing
that cleans these things.

351
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,550
- Why is that in your bathroom?
- (Mouths)

352
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,916
I'm not Coco Chanel
but I think that's a bit weird.

353
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,958
Bernard, why don't I call you a cab?

354
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,838
I don't want a cab.
It's only half one.

355
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,356
Anyway, listen. Why do you have
a toaster in your bathroom?

356
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,590
We haven't got a toaster
in our bathroom.

357
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,638
Well, you should put a lock
on the door anyway

358
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,508
because I was on the toilet,
little Jimmy comes in,

359
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,309
he's drinking milk from the
fridge and that's all wrong.

360
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,595
It's unhygienic.

361
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,920
And what was going through your brain

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,231
when you thought,
"Oh, yeah, I'll buy a wicker toilet"?

363
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,039
(Sarah screams)

364
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,111
I thought I did something bad.

365
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,909
So I go to the toilet in your
wicker chair, it's a faux pas.

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,274
Faux pas?

367
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,397
I thought I drank
all the booze or something.

368
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,314
- You did drink all the booze.
- Look at Jimmy.

369
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,029
What? What? What? He looks surprised.

370
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,874
All children look surprised.
Everything's new to them.

371
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,589
Have I told you, by the way,
that he... he, er...

372
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,999
he smokes?

373
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,277
- He does not smoke.
- Well, he's up to something.

374
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,113
I've never said this
because I was being nice.

375
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,952
But your son has the, er...

376
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,316
the cold, dead eyes of a killer.

377
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,198
I come to your house,
I bring a bottle of wine...

378
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,113
- A policewoman.
- Policewoman, bottle of wine,

379
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,952
the point is I made an effort.

380
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,077
And OK,
I was slightly indiscreet.

381
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,230
And I'm sorry! I am.

382
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,915
But you... you blanked me. So...

383
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,070
- (Sarah) So what?
- I think I deserve an apology.

384
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,479
(Both) Out.

385
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,869
I came all the way across town
to apologise,

386
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,191
I don't even have the fare
for a taxi back.

387
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,637
I behaved with dignity, honour
and grace. I'm a bit upset now.

388
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,030
You wouldn't understand -
I'm talking about dignity!

389
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,714
Hence...

390
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,995
So why were you
embarrassed to tell me?

391
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,198
Oh, well, I fell, you know.
It was so... undashing.

392
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,748
And going to the toilet
through a chair,

393
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,149
well, we've all been there.

394
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,592
What happened to you?

395
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,399
Oh, I have had some day.

396
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,552
- What happened?
- Well, it started off...

397
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,710
What happened to you?

398
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,236
Ooh!

399
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,357
(High voice)
That was a particularly bad one.

400
