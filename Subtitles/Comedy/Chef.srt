- 10:00-ish.

- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,204
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,691
- You got this?
- Yes.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,330
He's not gonna flake.
Neither am I.

I slept here for, bro?

Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,683
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

Buckle up, buddy.
Sorry I'm late.

I'm used to it.

Listen, pal, I don't think we have time
to catch a movie today.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,529
Is it 'cause
you're getting reviewed?

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,206
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,771
What'd she say?

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,843
She said you might be
a little worried.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,764
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,207
Well, Mom doesn't know me
that well, OK?

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,567
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
You know what Mommy thinks
I should be doing?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,005
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

37

Who doesn't like food trucks?

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,562
Can you picture me
driving a food truck? I'm a chef.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,688
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,520
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers' market,
pick up some ingredients.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,847
OK. Can I come?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,760
I thought I'd drop you off
at the restaurant.

- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

44

- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see? -No.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,641
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

46
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,665
- I know.
- OK. Good.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,165
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,004
Just orange?
Alright, give me six bunches of those.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,491
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

50

Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,011
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

52

Six of these. Let's see what we got.

53

- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,571
No, you're not
gonna get kettle...

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,566
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,087
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,765
Look at this piece of fruit.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,410
Huh? It's beautiful.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
How could you
even want kettle corn

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
with gorgeous fruit like this
in front of you?

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,370

a piece of fruit?

a big reviewer

who's also some
huge food blogger.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,243
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,607
A guy who writes about food
on the internet.

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,250
I know what a food blogger is.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,643
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,131
they don't like me.

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,170
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,085
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,083
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,571
There was no word for hater.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,802
The most you would say
is that somebody was, like, jealous,

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,291
which didn't really capture it.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,971
- No.
- It's spicy.

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,406
- You like spicy?
- No.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,005
It's not so spicy. Come on.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,606
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,091
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,571
It's part of the United States.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,200
It's part of the Louisiana Purchase
from Napoleon.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,725
Yeah. Um, that was...

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,531
I mean, like, now.
That was a long time ago.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,081
- 1803.
- Whatever.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,164
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,527
Like this andouille sausage.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,081
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,571
Not the same.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,040
When you have it here, it's good
because it reminds you of,

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,885
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,843
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,764
- For real?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,445
I mean, not now.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,931
- But, like...
- When?

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,367
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,801
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,042
Yeah, after review.
That'd be good.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,690
I'm off school next month.

103
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,808
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,291
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,771
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
If it doesn't work out next month,
we'll go later.

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,800
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,441
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Where'd you get a phone?
How come you have a phone already?

110

get the sauce on there, OK?

112
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,324

I gotta watch this too?

ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

How we doing?

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,803
The stock's simmering,
the pig's broken down, bacon are fine.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,680
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

117

at all the tables around.

Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

Let's get out there.

Don't make me get
the fucking ruler out. Thank you.

123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,531
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,523
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

- Baby carrots.

131

I don't know.
He was on his way back here.

132
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
I got him espresso,
bought you five minutes of time.

133
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,765
You should meet him
out on the floor.

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
Stall him for five minutes.
Let me get the staff going. Please.

135
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,402
OK. Fine.
Expect him to come back here.

from coming back here?

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

139
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

Are you, uh... are you planning
on altering the menu?

Yeah, I can't do this right now.

- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,880
That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,446
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

148

Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

149

I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

150
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,611
I don't need guidance right now.
I need space.

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,921
Yeah, I just sent
a private message to somebody.

499
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,845
- To who?
- To that A-hole food critic.

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,083
You could only send private messages
to people who are following you.

501
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,129
I think you might have
posted that publicly.

502
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,726
No, he wrote something nasty about me
and then I hit reply

503
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,564
and it let me
send a message to him.

504
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,485
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.

505
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,130
And it looks like
he re-tweeted it

506
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,129
to all his 123,845 followers.

507
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,930
And he wrote back.

508
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,410
What did he say?

509
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,520
- I don't think I should read it.
- Just...

510
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:48,169
Can you read it to me, please?

511
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,049
Read the reply.

They're goading me
into responding to this prick.

- Don't do that, Chef.

- Don't respond. Take the high road.
- I know.

That's not a good idea.

So get ready for a fight.

I'm gonna go drop Percy off
and come back

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,520
and cook the menu
we should've cooked last time.

all the time.

- Where?
- Online.

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,081
What kind of website could a 10-year-old
get on that has bad language?

553
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,088
- YouTube.
- YouTube has bad language?

554
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,800
Could I at least
come shopping with you?

555
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,171
- No.
- (SIGHS)

556
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,005

Hi, Mommy.

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,529
Come here. I miss you.
Give me a kiss.

559
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,444
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,729
So my publicist said
that she can talk to you.

561
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
- Why don't you talk to her?
- About what?

562
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,450
- About Twitter?
- Everybody's reading what you wrote.

563
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,762
- I don't think you get it.
- Get what?

564
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,082
Let's call her.
Go inside with me and we'll call her.

565
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,409
Yes, please,
tell her to call me immediately.

566
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,927
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.

567
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,242
- Alright, I'm gonna go.
- No, no, she's gonna call right back.

568
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,290
- She was on the other line.
- You're making more of this than it is.

569
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,124
I just don't like to see you
like this.

570
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,123
Like what? I'm fine.
I have to get to work.

571
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,123
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.

572
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Is this about the food truck?
I don't wanna talk about it again.

573
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,764
Why not? You can cook your own food.
You can be your own boss.

574
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,002
I can book you
for all the parties that I'm doing.

575
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,200
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't need any charity

576
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,491
from you or your ex-husband.

577
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,768
- Why are you being so proud?
- Because I'm working.

578
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,251
And despite
what you might think,

579
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,440
I have complete freedom
to cook whatever I want now.

580
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,891
I like my life.

581
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,884
And as far as your publicist goes,
when she calls back, you let her know

582
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,088
that I understand I shouldn't
tweet any pictures of my dick

583
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,890
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself.

584
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,360
OK? I'll see you later.
Thank you.

585
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,960
- I got all this shit in the trunk.
- Want me to do this?

586
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,480
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.

587
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,920
- We're doing it, guys.
- Come on. Let's get everything out.

588
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:51,281
I want the Cambros, the delis out
so we can start plating, OK?

589
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,400
Carl, can you tell me
what's going on for tonight?

590
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,283
No, no, no, how many covers
do we have tonight?

591
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,040
How many? We are overbooked.
But I just printed out all the menus.

592
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,083
Good. It's not the menu
you got printed. It's different.

593
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,924
- That's what I understand.
- We're doing a tasting menu.

594
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,800
- Carl, I have to put the wine...
- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

595
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,723
- I know, but we...
- He's coming. He knows about it.

596
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,291
- Did you see the 'Eater' article?
- I did.

597
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,169
- I'm so excited for you.
- It's all over the internet.

598
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,163
- I love it when you're like this.
- Taste the food.

599
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,200
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

600
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,960
Make them understand
what we're going for.

601
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:16,984
- OK.
- OK?

602
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,440
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

603
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,401
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited. I'm finally happy.

604
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,891
I'm happy, OK?

605
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,000
- Am I allowed to be happy at work?
- (DOOR OPENS)

606
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,281
Carl. Carl. We're staying with
the same menu, right?

607
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,885
I have something really good
planned for tonight.

608
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,371
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

609
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,522
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

610
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,126
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

611
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,120
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

612
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:38,804
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

614
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:44,527
From now on, before you
post anything online, I OK it. Alright?

615
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,011
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

616
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,605
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,001
and they're all coming
to watch me stick it in his ass.

618
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,844
Yeah, and you're gonna twitter
an apology

619
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,243
for calling the most respected critic
in Los Angeles an asshole.

620
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,448
- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

621
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,921
- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

622
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,000
- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

623
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:03,724
You're a cook. You're a chef.

624
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,366
This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

625
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,649
And either you cook the menu
that our customers have come to ex...

626
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,000
- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

627
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,123
The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

628
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
The restaurant
isn't filled with critics!

629
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:19,115
It's filled with people
that've been eating your food

630
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,008
for the last 10 years!

631
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,880
So now, suddenly,
you're gonna be an artist.

632
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,365
Well, be an artist
on your own time.

633
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,851
- Listen to me.
- No sweetbreads!

634
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,286
- Listen!
- No calves' brains.

635
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.

636
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,888
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

637
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,724
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

638
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,281
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.

639
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,647
It's up to you.
End of discussion.

640
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,200
- We got a full house of people... -Yeah.
- ..who are coming tonight... -Yeah.

641
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,402
- ..To eat my food.
- No, it's not your food, Carl.

642
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,403
It's not your food.

643
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,643
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.

644
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,962
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.

645
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,600
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.

646
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,081
I pay for
your entire staff's salary, OK?

647
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,368
So you either cook my menu
or Tony can.

648
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,480
Tony, you've been cooking it
half the time anyway.

649
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,204
Tell the truth. Right?

650
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,000
So you're threatening
to fire me now?

651
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,371
Am I threatening to fire you?

652
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,200
No, I'm telling you
what I'm prepared to do

653
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,845
if you don't cook my menu.

654
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,411
Subject closed.

655
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,131
Well, why don't you

- I've never seen anything like...

there's nothing I could do?

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,370
Is he there?

820
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,291
I'll tell him.

821
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,408
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

822
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,050
Put him on.

823
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,688
Hey, Dad. I understand
if we can't go to New Orleans.

824
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,127
CARL: Oh, man,
thank you so much for saying that.

825
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,648
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

826
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,609
Maybe some other time.

827
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,843
Yes, we will, for sure.
Thank you.

828
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,768
'Bye. (HANGS UP)

Oh, jefecito.

831
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,245
What's up, man?
Look, everybody. Jefe's here.

832
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,289
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

833
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,283
Ketel One for the man.

834
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,044
Oh, dude.
Oh, you're everywhere.

835
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,531
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

836
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,445
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

837
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,931
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

838
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,840
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

839
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,530
- (LAUGHS)
- I am, though.

840
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,480
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

841
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,563
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

842
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

843
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,600
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

844
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:18,966
So you came back to tell me
you got me a gig?

845
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,451
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

846
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,080
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

847
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,685
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

848
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,285
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

849
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,885
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

850
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,804
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

851
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,611
I had been drinking that day.
I... l... l didn't know what to do.

852
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,603
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

853
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,920
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

854
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,082
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

855
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,810
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

856
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,360
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

857
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,891
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

858
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,771
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

859
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,131
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is
it... they're laughing at me or with me?

860
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,169
A little bit of both.

861
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,846
They're laughing with you
and at you at the same time.

862
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,401
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

863
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,005
But it's funny too
at the same time.

864
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,003
It makes you kind of likeable
in a weird way.

865
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,164
Yeah. That guy deserved it.
Everybody knows that guy deserved it.

866
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,084
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

867
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,685
You know,
I'm gonna land on my feet.

868
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,126
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

869
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,200
<i>- I'll</i> get my next gig.
<i>- I'll</i> be there with you.

870
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,049
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

871
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,441
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

872
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,720
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

873
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,090
Riva's right about one thing.

874
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,720
You are ready to run your own kitchen.
So don't blow it.

875
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,211
It's a big opportunity for you.

876
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,760
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

877
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,007
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

878
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,562
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- (CHUCKLES) Two words, man.

879
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,848
You guys.
I love you fucking guys.

880
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,289
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

881
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,851
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

882
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,684
I love both of you.

883
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,171
We love you, man.

884
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,800
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on. (LAUGHS)

885
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,440
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

886
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,400
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

887
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:57,323
(SIGHS) The truth of the matter is
nobody's calling me.

888
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,289
I got no job prospects
whatsoever.

889
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,800
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

890
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,360
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

891
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,971
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

892
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,485
I don't even know
what that means.

893
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,165
I'm everywhere.

894
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,005
- OK? Like, I'm, like... I'm, like, a meme.
- (CHUCKLES)

895
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,527
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

896
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,569
Carl, you need to take a break.

897
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,927
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

898
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,923
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

899
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,162
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

900
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,960
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

901
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,686
You gonna go work for another Riva
in some other restaurant?

902
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,401
You've been miserable here
as long as I've known you, Carl.

903
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,040
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

904
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:37,907
And now it's time for you to go.

905
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,880
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

906
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,490
What's th... Who's this girl?

907
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,369
- Carl.
- (CHUCKLES) What?

908
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,047
- Be real with me.
- I am.

909
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,120
You've been ignoring
a lot of things in your life

910
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,009
that need your attention,
like Percy.

911
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,765
I'm not dad material right now,
if you hadn't noticed.

912
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,968
I'm embarrassing.

913
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,202
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

914
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,522
- Well...
- His friends have...

915
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,331
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

916
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,290
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

917
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,444
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

918
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,921
Why don't you take this time
to get to know him?

919
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,689
I want you to be happy.

920
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,970
You're not happy.

921
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,610
You're never
gonna be happy here.

922
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,210
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

923
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,560
I've never not known
what I was gonna do. I've always known.

924
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
There's always been
the next thing to do.

925
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:45,727
And now that it's all ended,
and I'm, like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

926
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,121
I think that's
a good place to start.

927
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,770
Come here.

928
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,049
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

929
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,563
<i>- I'll</i> hold down the fort. I promise.
- OK. You do that.

930
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,245
Thank you.

931
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,124
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

932
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,964
Percy aqui?

933
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,849
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

934
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,331
- Sure.
- Thanks.

935
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,006
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

936
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,242
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

937
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,731
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

938
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't you
call to say that you were coming?

939
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,321
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

940
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,761
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

941
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

942
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

943
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:44,169
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

944
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,402
Please? Come.

945
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,125
Percy and I are going to Miami
to see my father.

946
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,050
So why don't you come with us?

947
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,487
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

948
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,291
You want me to go...
I can't come with you to Miami.

949
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,090
I don't... I got all...

950
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,765
I don't have any money.

951
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,571
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

952
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,051
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

953
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,202
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

954
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

955
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,931
You know that he's really upset

956
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,606
because he couldn't go with you
to New Orleans, right?

957
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,640
He's hurt. He misses you.

958
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,967
OK. What do you
want me to do?

959
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,407
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

960
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,245
So why don't you come with us

961
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,846
and you take care of him
while I work?

962
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,922
So you need me to come with you
to watch Percy?

963
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,003
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

964
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,811
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

965
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,249
It might be good.
That's where it all happened for you.

966
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,731
That's where Percy was born,

967
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,167
that's where you got
your first job as a chef.

968
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,891
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

969
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,168
You think Percy would be OK
with that?

970
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,924
Percy would love it.

to sous-chef.

- Yeah.

1138

No shit! That's excellent!

1139
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,248
Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

1140
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,760
Thank you, man. That means a lot
coming from you, seriously.

1141
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,161
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

1142
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,924
You're gonna laugh.

1143
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,242
- I got a food truck.
- Get the hell out!

1144
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,641
No shit.
You got a fucking taco truck?

a fucking taco truck.

Yeah, I would assume.
What are you gonna cook?

a lot of work, though.

Is something wrong?

1168

- Did you sleep with him?
- With who?

1169
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,204
With Marvin.
Did you sleep with Marvin?

1170

But of course I did.
He's my ex-husband.

I mean, since we were divorced.
Have you slept...

1172
00:59:48,104 --> 00:59:49,969
Who did you sleep with last,
him or me?

1173

I'm sorry, but this is
none of your business what I did...

1174

- I think it might be.
- ..after I divorce you.

Second of all, I don't ask you
what you do with your hot little waitress.

- That's completely different.
- OK, really.

- And that's not fair.
- Yeah, yeah.

This is somebody you loved
and shared a life with...

1179

Why do we have to
talk about this right now?

1180
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,680
Because I took a business meeting
with the guy.

1181

- This is not the moment.
- It is. I wanna know why.

1182

He's smiling like
he's got something on me.

1183

- I dunno what it is.
- Please, you know him.

1184
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,886
- I do know how him.
- You know how he is. So who cares?

1185
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,440
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

1186
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,443
- I just would like to...
- OK.

1187
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,160
It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

1188
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,847
Just listen. I was very sad.
I was very lonely.

1189
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,082

- OK. That's it. That's enough.

a couple of drinks.

- I get...

Please. I'm not
one of your girlfriends.

we're just good friends.

in there.

Maybe it's a rat.

- I have to work, and I'll be back.

it belongs to the chef, not to the kitchen.

How you doing, little gangster, huh?

everything to be your line cook. Didn't I?

This is a food truck.
You're a sous-chef now.

So? Food trucks
don't need a sous-chef?

What the hell are you doing?
You sending pictures to Morn?

1614
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,808
- I'm posting a Vine.
- A Vine? What's a Vine?

1615
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,167
It's a video. Look.

1616

Hey, come on, man!
Get that out of my face.

- Seriously.
- Christ.

1618
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,211
- It's only six seconds.
- Who'd make a video six seconds?

1619
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,560
- A six-second video.
- Can you believe this generation?

1620
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,802
Unbelievable, man.
Little attention. ADHD.

1621
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,769
- ADHD is right.
- That's nothing.

1622
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,280
I've also been shooting these videos -
one second every day.

1623
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,120
One-second videos?
Now you're joking with me.

1624
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,685
No. You edit 'em all together.

1625

One second of every day.

1626
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,602

Who wants to stop
at Disney World?

1629
01:21:47,073 --> 01:21:49,524
- Oh, yeah, I do.
- Disney World? That's real?

1630
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,320
We shouldn't stop
till we hit New Orleans.

- Hey! Hey, that IS your son.
- That's my boy.

1632
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,560
A kid who'd rather go to New Orleans
than Disney World.

my first beignet.

Every other person you say
'New Orleans' to thinks jazz and voodoo.

1636

(LAUGHS) Yeah, he thinks...

1637
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,000
- Your kid thinks doughnuts. (LAUGHS)
- Doughnuts. Yeah, I know.

1638
01:22:05,024 --> 01:22:07,470
I like that.
Alright, New Orleans.

Here.

01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,811
It's like baby powder.

- Nice.

you could dip your nuts in oil
and make hushpuppies.
