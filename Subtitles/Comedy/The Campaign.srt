Oh.

311
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,126
Which I think is just a chance for us
to share a meal together...

312
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,461
...and talk about the campaign
and its issues...

313
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,381
...and make sure
that everything's gonna be civil, you know?

314
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:13,510
That's a lovely idea, Marty.
We're all so proud of you.

315
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,848
I knew one day
your dad would realize your true potential.

316
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:22,102
Um, boys, put down your utensils. I wanna
talk to you about something real quick.

317
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,564
I wanted to take this time...

318
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:29,693
...to say that we're gonna be under
a lot of media scrutiny.

319
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,822
So if there's anything
that you wanna talk about...

320
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,158
...any kind of secrets...

321
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,994
...or stories or fibs...

322
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,873
...now's the time to put
it on the table, okay?

323
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,959
And if you tell me,
if you tell me and your mom...

324

I said the Lord's name in vain at school.

Mm-hm.

Well, I said I wasn't gonna get angry,

Okay. Good.

330
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:11,109
I went to the petting zoo

Okay. Maybe that's... Hopefully, that's it.

336
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,797
I had a beer with the old biker man
at the end of the street...

337
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,466
...and he let me touch
his old lady's titty.

00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,095
- Oh, God.
- Ugh. "Breast."

339
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:42,683
I go to the mall and hide in a stairwell
and take photos up women's skirts.

340
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,520
I have a whole book of cooter shots
under my bed.

341
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,025
One time I put a firefly in my butthole.

342
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,821
- Why?
- To make my farts glow.

343

Oh, God.

344
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:04,079
I shaved the dog and glued the hair
to my nut sac so I'd look like a grown man.

Oh, God.

I touch myself to Drew Carey

Well, I'm a little nervous. Heh.
I'll be honest with you. Um...

360
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,758
My dad always told me two things
about giving speeches.

361
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,178
One, never say anything bad
about the Jews...

362
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,514
...and two, tell an interesting story.

363
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,766
I have two pugs.

364
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,102
One's named Poundcake
and one's named Muffins.

Good Lord.

366
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,399
Anyway, Poundcake loves
to get underneath the sofa.

367
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,984
And I know exactly why.

368
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,904
Because my wife leaves Milky Ways
underneath the sofa...

369
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,530
...with Hamburger Helper on it.

370
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,618
And Muffins is always yapping at him,
like, "Don't go underneath the sofa."

371
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,952
And Poundcake barks back:

372
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,580
"I am under the sofa,
and I'm having a good time."

373
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,624
And they look at me like, "What?"

374
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,376
The other one's looking at the other one,
going, "What?"

375
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,712
Then I walk in like,
"What are y'all two doing?"

376
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,631
But every day, it's the same thing.

377

Just barking about one of them
being underneath the sofa.
