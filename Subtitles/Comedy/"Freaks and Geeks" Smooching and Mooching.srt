880
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:52,249
UM...CINDY,
CAN I KISS YOU?

881
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,750
OF COURSE.

882
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:57,254
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT LOVE'S
A LOSIN' GAME

883
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:02,255
YOU START WITH FIRE,
BUT YOU LOSE THE FLAME

884
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,262
THE ASHES SMOLDER,
BUT THE WARM'S SOON GONE

885
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,280
YOU END UP
COLD AND LONELY...

886
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,734
OH!
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

887
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:12,235
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES,
BABE

888
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,738
I'LL RISK IT ALL

889
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:17,057
I'LL WIN YOUR LOVE

890
00:43:17,058 --> 00:43:20,894
LL DE MY MIND UP...

891
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:23,346
BILL, YOUR 7 MINUTES
WERE UP 5 MINUTES AGO.

892
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,782
VICKI,
YOUR NIGHTMARE'S OVER.

893
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:28,285

894
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:32,422

895
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,423
[KNOCKING]

896
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:36,509
BILL. BILL.

897
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,813
