Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl

I wasn't finished.

548
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,420
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

549
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:12,056
That "stuff"
would've informed you

550
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,693
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

551
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:18,195
So a roar wouldn't make him
scream, it would make him cry,

552
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,998
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

553
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,833

554
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,835

we can't have that.

recommend that you continue

In high school, I was the

943
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,792
I could sneak up
on a field mouse

We're experts in the ancient

00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,041
It's all about

00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,812

Guys, one slip-up on the

954
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,152
So for this to work,

955
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,254
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have

956
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,355
and bury it deep,
deep down.

957
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,224

what to do, and how to do it.

00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,245
What if we disguised a new

00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,147
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.

970
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,249

the show, but the truth is,

1828
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:09,863
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!

1829
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:11,865
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.

1830
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:14,034
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1831
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:16,169
All I did was catch a pig!

1832
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:17,871
Technically,
I caught the pig.

1833
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:21,041
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?

1834
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:23,577
You pulled off the biggest
Scare this school has ever seen!

That wasn't me!
That was you!

1836
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:27,914
You think I could have
done that without you?

1837
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:29,616
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1838
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:34,921
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.

1839
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:36,022
But you are fearless.

1840
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,061
And if Hardscrabble can't
see that, then she can just...

1841
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,929
I can just what?

1842
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,034
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1843
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:49,970

it seems you made
the front page again.

something together

1847
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,782
that no one has
ever done before.

1848
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,218
You surprised me.

1849
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,891

eye out for more surprises

But as far as the two
of you are concerned

1852
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:17,964
there is nothing
I can do for you now.

wish you luck.

keep surprising people.

there is still one way
