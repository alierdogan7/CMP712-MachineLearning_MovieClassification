170
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,178
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, you gotta
be pretty smart to fool the ol'

171
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,813
Voight-Kampff machine.

172
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,181
ARCHER: In Krieger's lab?!

173
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,283
CHERYL/CAROL: Anywhere,
duh, it's portable.

174
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,685
ARCHER: No no no no no!

175
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:05,187
CHERYL/CAROL: Uh, yes it is.

176
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,654
Yo, Magnum P.U.

177
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:10,325
I need a lead-acid battery, fifty
units of plasma, some bolt cutters,

178
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:14,830
and something called a -- Defrimbulator?

179
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,397
That's a made-up word.

180
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,765
RODNEY: They're all made up.

181
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:20,468
CHERYL/CAROL: [ Laughs ]

182
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:24,394
Mind! Blown!

183
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:28,854
GILLETTE: Yeah, what could go wrong...
ARCHER: Ray's gonna be a cyborg

184
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:30,380
over my dead body!

185
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,040
Or preferably his!

186
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,143
But somebody's!

187
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,306
GILLETTE: What could
possibly, go, wrrngzzzzzz.

188
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,288
PAM: Hey, should I wash my hands?

189
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,538
KRIEGER: I didn't.

190
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,699
ARCHER: Krieger! Krieger!

191
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,168
Krieger open this goddamn door!

192
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,170
Krieger I am gonna count to one!

193
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:04,507
PAM: Oh that's right, he hates robots!

194

KRIEGER: For the -- this! Is a robot!

195
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:08,778
Gillette is a human being!

But he won't be for long if
you don't clamp that artery!

197
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,149
ARCHER: One!

198
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,687
ARCHER: Brett?

199
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,589
What in the hell...?

200
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:20,823
RON: Were those gunshots?!

201
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,160
MALORY: Oh, who knows with these people,
it's one calamity after another.

202

RON: That's, yes, exactly, that's why
you need a nice long relaxing cruise!

203
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:35,538
MALORY: But I really really really
really really don't think I'll enjoy it.

204
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,540
RON: Sure you will.

205
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:42,312
ARCHER: Brett?!

206
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,212
LANA: Archer!

207
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,213
What the shit are you doing?!

208
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:47,417
ARCHER: Um, investigating
a ballistic anomaly.

209
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:48,718
C'mon, walk and talk.

210
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:52,221
I don't even think he's on this floor, but
idiot Brett still managed to get shot.

211
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,357
LANA: Yeah, he's the idiot.

212
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:55,090
ARCHER: Right?

213
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,392
CYRIL: You idiot!

214
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,495
If I hadn't checked the time at that
exact second I'd be dead right now!

215
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:03,098
ARCHER: Which reminds me, Grover Cleveland
called, he wants his watch back.

216
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,235
LANA: Archer --
ARCHER: He left two non-consecutive messages.

217
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,571
CYRIL: This was my
grandfather's, you ass!

218
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,105
ARCHER: I'll buy you another one!

219
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,174
Now how were you holding
it, like, exactly!

220
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:17,580
CYRIL: I -- I dunno, like this I guess...
ARCHER: Okay, sooooo... Boom.

221
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:21,351
C'mon, this is awesome, it's like
we're the Warren Commission.

222
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:23,085
Look look look, check it out!

223
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,554
It's a real magic bullet!

224
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:27,289
LANA: Why the hell were you shooting
at Krieger's door in the first place?

225
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,891
ARCHER: Oh shit, right!

226
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,193
Brett, this might be some kind of record!

227
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,129
So if you can move, don't!

228
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,231
I gotta go stop him!

229
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,733

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
ARCHER: Whom!

231
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:38,267
LANA: Archer!

232
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,101
ARCHER: Krieger!

233
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,838
He's making a gay terminator!

234
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,773
LANA: Aaaaand yep.

235
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,541
Officially confused.

236
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:48,544
CYRIL: Yeah, did he mean
a terminator of gays?

237
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,581
Because Krieger's creepy and
weird, but he's not homophobic,

238
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:56,652
I don't think, so he must've meant...
well, no, aren't terminators asexual?

239
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,088
KRIEGER: Not when I'm done with him...

another human being?

need a rocket launcher?

MALORY: Ron?

261

ARCHER: Seriously, Ron,
why aren't you at work?

262
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,505

the business so I don't have to be!

263

268
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,718
With that city council?

Wait, why were you mad?

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,070

bionic shit to Ray's legs!

291
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:58,939
CYRIL: And Archer, obviously --
LANA: Would rather see Ray dead!

292
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:04,912

Katya, what is his deal with robots?

293

296

DOCTOR: He needs emergency surgery.

what are you doing tonight?

303
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,701
Well, I said I might meet some
people at this thing downtown,

304

heavy on Negroes and jazz, so --

love Negroes and jazz.

306
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:33,541

00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:34,975
Well then I'll just get my coat.

WOODHOUSE: And I'll wait here?

309
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,680
For the ambulance to take your
grievously wounded child to the

310

can go buy some wax for your cross.

gonna try to stop you!

RODNEY: One RPG-7 launcher and two grenades.

of a, uh, situation.

MALORY: Ron!

331

you gave me is going to last for

LANA: Hey, thanks.

337
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,581
RON: Reminds me of the head mechanic
at my dealership in Yonkers.

338
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:44,648
He's a black.

339
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,349
LANA: Wow.

340
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,251
RON: I know, and head mechanic!

341
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:50,388
Now c'mon, babe, let these people do
whatever it is you pay them to do,

342
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,222
and let's go start our weekend.

343
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,058
MALORY: Alright, but
don't miss that flight.

344
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,228
God knows how long it takes to
check in with a rocket launcher.

345
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,765
LANA: Oh, shit!

346
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:04,402
CYRIL: Well calling the
airport's not gonna help.

347
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,739
ARCHER: Oh, and one last thing, Rodney,
when I get back from Rome, you're --

348
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,841
RODNEY: Hang on oooooone second.

349
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:11,409
Armory.

350
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,243
CHERYL/CAROL: Hey will
you bring me a present?

351
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,278
ARCHER: No.

352
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:15,446
RODNEY: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

353
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,080
Ooookay.

354
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,015
You were saying?

355
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,249
ARCHER: I... shit.

356
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,586
Something about an asskicking
with handmade Italian shoes?

357
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,390
RODNEY: Well, think about
it, you've got time.

358
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,892
ARCHER: What do you think you're doing?

359
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,259
RODNEY: What do you think you're doing?!

360
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,064
Obtaining armory materiel under false
pretenses is a fireable offense!

361
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:38,469
ARCHER: Oh my -- I basically just lurch
from one fireable offense to the next!

362
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,971
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh, like the
infamous "Luau Incident."

363
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,308
ARCHER: Jesus Christ, how many times
do I have to apologize for that?!

364
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,510
CHERYL/CAROL: Once would be nice!

365
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:47,578
ARCHER: No.

366
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:48,913
Rodney open this door.

367
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,113
RODNEY: Give me that weapon.

368
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:50,514
ARCHER: Oh.

369
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:51,582
You mean this rocket launcher?

370
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,384
Because I bet it would open the door.

371
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,286
RODNEY: No, that is
inadvisable at this time.

372
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,955
ARCHER: Ya know, if I asked it nicely.

373
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,289
RODNEY: I seriously wouldn't do that.

374
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,093
ARCHER: Yeah, because you're not awesome.

375
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,028
MALORY: Oh, and what
fresh hell is this?!

376
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,297
RON: Whatever it is, they can handle it!

377
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,467
MALORY: They can't even
handle a simple luau!

378
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:14,271
My God, what they did to that pig...Brett?!
BRETT: Heeelp...

379
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,942
BRETT: Nghhh...
MALORY: Great, now I get to slog

380
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,309
my new Delmans through a lake of blood.

381
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,312
I want that all cleaned
up before Monday, mister!

382
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,347
Do you hear me?!

383
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:27,317
RODNEY: No... Because
that room is blast-proof!

384
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,319
ARCHER: Mawp.

385
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,322
Maaaawp.

386
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,492
Mawp.

387
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,794
PAM: What the shit was that?!

388
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:40,297
KRIEGER: Hopefully the last remaining
shred of Archer's eardrums.

389
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,333
LANA: That crazy son of a -- come on!

390
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,637
CYRIL: Why is your instinctive
response to run toward explosions?!

391
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,773
LANA: Mmm... because
I'm not a giant pussy?

392
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,341
CYRIL: Although, somehow,
incredibly single.

393
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,142
LANA: Wh-?!

394
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,344
I go on... tons of dates!

395
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,345
CYRIL: With who?!

396
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,346
LANA: Men!

397
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,015
Men models!

398
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,850
Men who model!

399
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,519
[ High pitched whine ]

400
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,227
CHERYL/CAROL: -- permanent damage
to my earballs because you're too

401
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:09,226
chickenshit to take your candy-ass to
the future and smash the defense grid

402
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,029
so Skynet --
RODNEY: Whoa whoa whoa!

403
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,163
Not cool, man!

404
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,832
That is not at all cool!

405
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,368
CHERYL/CAROL: Rodney you
mind your own dicky beeswax!

406
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,870
You got another one in ya?

407
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,470
RODNEY: Ew.

408
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,305
ARCHER: I don't --
CHERYL/CAROL: Tease.

409
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,909
ARCHER: -- and I'm sorry for that one --
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't be.

410
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,377
ARCHER: -- because I'm just
gonna say it, I think it's

411
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,381
suuuper creepy you get sexually
aroused by physical violence.

412
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,385
CHERYL/CAROL: Well but
also emotional violence.

413
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,319
ARCHER: Wow.

414
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:36,921
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah.

415
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,722
ARCHER: That's even creepier.

416
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,824
So are you gonna open the damn door?

417
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,426
RODNEY: As soon as you
give me that weapon.

418
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:46,089
ARCHER: Wh-? Do you honestly wanna
live through the rise of the machines?!

419
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,908
Which you won't, because no one will?!

420
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,058
RODNEY: I --
ARCHER: It was rhetorical!

421
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,585
So now if you'll excuse me... I
have an entire human race to save.

422
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,854
RODNEY: What is he... hey
that's ISIS property!

423
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,656
ARCHER: What this?

424
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,156
RODNEY: Yes.

425
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,464
CHERYL/CAROL: Take me with you!

426
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,092
ARCHER: Shut up!

427
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,395
CHERYL/CAROL: Ooh, yeah, even
that little bit's enough to get

428
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,831
the engine revved up.

429
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,836
So Rodneeeeeey... Tease!

430
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,807
CYRIL: Jeezy Petes...
CHERYL/CAROL: Cyril what're you doing right now?

431
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,678
CYRIL: I --
LANA: Helping me find Archer, where is he?!

432
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,380
Super.

433
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,148
CYRIL: Are you calling the airport again?

434
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,656
LANA: Cyril shut your goddamn mouth!

435
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,919
CHERYL/CAROL: [ Involuntary
shudder of pleasure ]

436
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,589
KRIEGER: Hey, guess
what's not a good time?

437
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,690
Wait, where?!

438
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,292
PAM: Gotta be somewhere in there...
KRIEGER: Not you!

439
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,594
And did you count right?!

440
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,662
PAM: What, to five?

441
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,730
Dicknuts?

442
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,430
LANA: Krieger!

443
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,399
KRIEGER: Look, you gotta
keep him away from the lab!

444
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,869
We're almost done, if somebody
can find their last beer!

445
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,138
PAM: [ Burps ] I can
promise it ain't my last.

446
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,209
KRIEGER: I mean, I doubt he can find it...
ARCHER: God damn it.

447
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,679
I told 'em, I said -- Maps!

448
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,214
All through the HVAC ducts!

449
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,184
Or just at the, whatever, junctions.

450
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,889
MALORY: I won't even waste however much
dryerase it'll take to write that down.

451
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,658
ARCHER: No, Mother, because you
were too busy wasting it on

452
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,661
"Fourth of Ju-Luau!"

453
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,930
KRIEGER: But still, see
if you can flush him out.

454
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,565
I'd hate to use the nerve gas.

455
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,400
LANA: Do not!

456
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,967
Use the nerve gas!

457
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,705
KRIEGER: And yet incredibly single...
LANA: How the hell do we flush him out?

458
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,240
CHERYL/CAROL: Uh, duh...
REPAIRMAN: Huh?!

459
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,612
LANA: I said, how hot can you make it?

460
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,720
ARCHER: No no no... It's already happening...
LANA: Holy shit, already?

461
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,255
GILLETTE: Yeah, I actually
feel pretty good.

462
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,557
How is that possible?

463
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,492
KRIEGER: It's a proprietary blend.

464
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,262
And barring some sort of massive infection --
PAM: Don't look at me,

465
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,731
found number six!

466
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,265
KRIEGER: You should be
up and around by Monday.

467
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,934
GILLETTE: Well then can I go home?

468
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,303
Cause it's hot as balls up in here.

469
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,406
ARCHER: The thermostat's
becoming sentient!

470
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,273
Oh God!

471
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:07,245
That's how Maximum Overdrive started!

472
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,958
MALORY: Well I'd be lying if I said I cared...
LANA: Wh-?

473
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,827
Malory, Ray can walk again!

474
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,261
GILLETTE: Buh-duh-buh-baaaaa!

475
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,295
MALORY: You mean mince?

476
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,630
GILLETTE: Ya know...
MALORY: Maybe he can mince to

477
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,300
the bank and apply for a twelve
thousand dollar loan for a new furnace!

478
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,236
Why did you idiots leave it
on ninety all weekend?!

479
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,297
ARCHER: Your clothes.

480
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:37,371
Give them to me.

481
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,907
CYRIL: Aaagh!

482
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:43,411
ARCHER: I'm kidding, obviously, I wouldn't
be caught dead in a sweater vest.

483
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:48,464
Now, if you'll excuse me...
PAM: Just like Fourth of Ju-Luau...

484
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,753

slid a pig under him.
