to both of them.

It's true also that the spare tire
they carried...

154
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:03,853

What's the matter, Brad, darling?

174
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,013

a few miles back.

You stay here and I'll go for help.

182
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:51,327
We're in the middle of nowhere.

183
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,485
Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?

184
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,812
Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.

185
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,053
I'm going too.

186
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:09,013
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.

187
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:14,407
Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman...

188
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,807
...and you might never
come back again.

189
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,656
<i>In the velvet darkness</i>

190
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:03,047
<i>Of the blackest night</i>

191
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:06,016
<i>Burning bright</i>

192
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:10,207
<i>There's a guiding star</i>

193
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:15,655
<i>No matter what</i>

194
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,808
<i>Or... </i>

195
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,615
<i>... who you are</i>

196
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,009
<i>There's a light</i>

197
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:32,136
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

198
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,175
<i>There's a light</i>

199
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:42,412
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

200
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:47,932
<i>There's a light, light</i>

201
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,732
<i>In the darkness</i>

202
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:56,607
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

203
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:10,009
<i>The darkness must go</i>

204
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,817
<i>Down the river</i>

205
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:16,612
<i>Of nights dreaming</i>

206
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,854
<i>Flow morphia slow</i>

207
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,247
<i>Let the sun</i>

208
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:26,250
<i>And light come streaming</i>

209
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:29,614
<i>Into my life</i>

210
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:35,612
<i>Into my life</i>

211
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:43,213
<i>There's a light</i>

212
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:47,647
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

213
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:51,014
<i>There's a light</i>

214
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:58,211
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

215
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,177
<i>There's a light</i>

216
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,807
<i>Light</i>

217
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:08,046
<i>In the darkness</i>

218
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:13,212
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

219
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,290
And so...

220
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:26,049
...it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...

221
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:30,609
...and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.

222
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,009
Or had they?

223
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,211
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.

224
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,812
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.

225
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:00,816
Hello.

226
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:05,614
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.

227
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:09,130
This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.

228
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:13,445
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.

229
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,449
Do you have a phone we might use?

230
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:18,449
You're wet.

231
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:23,016
Yes, it's raining.

232
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,006
Yes.

233
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:27,609
Oh.

234
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:36,209
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.

235
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,615
You're too kind.

236
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,806
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?

237
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:03,016
It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

238
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:09,605
This way.

239
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,806
Are you having a party?

240
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:21,250
You've arrived on
a rather special night.

241
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:24,853
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.

242
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,849
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.

243
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:31,807
He's lucky, I'm lucky,
we're all lucky!

244
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:47,447
<i>It's astounding</i>

245
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:50,211
<i>Time is fleeting</i>

246
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:54,094
<i>Madness takes its toll</i>

247
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:57,809
<i>But listen closely</i>

248
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:01,009
<i>Not for very much longer</i>

249
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:05,815
<i>I've got to keep control</i>

250
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,606
<i>I remember</i>

251
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,417
<i>Doing the time warp</i>

252
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,416
<i>Drinking</i>

253
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:16,046
<i>Those moments when</i>

254
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:18,606
<i>The blackness would hit me</i>

255
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,411
<i>And the void would be calling</i>

256
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,170
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

257
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,888
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

258
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:36,091
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

259
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:41,531
<i>-And a step to the right</i>
<i>-With your hands on your hips</i>

260
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:45,331
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

261
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,806
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

262
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,616
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

263
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:55,814
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

264
00:19:57,056 --> 00:20:00,890
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

265
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,452
<i>It's so dreamy</i>

266
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:06,608
<i>Oh, fantasy free me</i>

267
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,534
<i>So you can 't see me</i>

268
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,127
<i>No, not at all</i>

269
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,851
<i>In another dimension</i>

270
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,610
<i>With voyeuristic intention</i>

271
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>Well secluded</i>

272
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,568
<i>I see all</i>

273
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:24,091
<i>With a bit of a mind flip</i>

274
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:27,015
<i>You're into the time slip</i>

275
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:31,614
<i>And nothing can ever be the same</i>

276
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,324
<i>You're spaced out on sensation</i>

277
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:37,414
<i>Like you're under sedation</i>

278
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:42,010
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

279
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:47,214
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

280
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:50,410
<i>I was walking down the street</i>
<i>Just having a think</i>

281
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,176
<i>When a snake of a guy</i>
<i>Gave me an evil wink</i>

282
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,412
<i>He shook a me up</i>
<i>He took me by surprise</i>

283
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,375
<i>He had a pickup truck</i>
<i>And the devil's eyes</i>

284
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:00,851
<i>He stared at me</i>
<i>And I felt a change</i>

285
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,166
<i>Time meant nothing</i>
<i>Never would again</i>

286
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:07,535
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

287
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:12,735
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

288
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:14,455
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

289
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:19,971
<i>-And then a step to the right</i>
<i>-With your hands on your hips</i>

290
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,805
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

291
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:26,445
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

292
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

293
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,805
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

294
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:39,614
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

295
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:01,129
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

296
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:06,369
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

297
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,844
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

298
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:13,406
<i>-And then a step to the right</i>
<i>-With your hands on your hips</i>

299
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,814
<i>Bring your knees in tight</i>

300
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,372
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

301
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,325
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

302
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:27,615
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

303
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:32,889
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

304
00:22:44,616 --> 00:22:46,015
Say something.

305
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:51,055
Say! Do any of you guys know
how to Madison?

306
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:59,852
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.

307
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:03,412
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.

308
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:07,205
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.

309
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,970
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.

310
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:12,406
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.

311
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,607
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.

312
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,455
They're probably foreigners
with different ways.

313
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,290
They may do some more folk dancing.

314
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,725
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

315
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,814
I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.

316
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,407
<i>How do you do</i>

317
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,647
<i>I see you've met</i>

318
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:39,774
<i>My faithful handyman</i>

319
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,246
<i>He's just a little brought down</i>

320
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:45,408
<i>Because when you knocked</i>

321
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:48,409
<i>He thought you were the candyman</i>

322
00:23:49,976 --> 00:23:51,853
<i>Don 't get strung out</i>

323
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:54,007
<i>By the way I look</i>

324
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:57,532
<i>Don 't judge a book by its cover</i>

325
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,926
<i>I'm not much of a man</i>

326
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:01,848
<i>By the light of day</i>

327
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:05,805
<i>But by night I'm one hell of a lover</i>

328
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:09,412
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

329
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,649
<i>From Transsexual... </i>

330
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,774
<i>... Transylvania</i>

331
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,047
<i>Let me show you around</i>

332
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:24,015
<i>Maybe play you a sound</i>

333
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,606
<i>You look like you're both</i>
<i>Pretty groovy</i>

334
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:30,455
<i>Or if you want something visual</i>

335
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:32,812
<i>That's not too abysmal</i>

336
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,207
<i>We could take in an old</i>
<i>Steve Reeves movie</i>

337
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,805
<i>I'm glad we caught you at home</i>

338
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:42,413
<i>Could we use your phone? </i>

339
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,251
<i>-We're both in a bit of a hurry</i>
<i>-Right</i>

340
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:47,208
<i>We'll just say where we are</i>

341
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:50,653
<i>-Then go back to the car</i>
<i>-A pleasure to meet you, Dr, Furter</i>

342
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:53,012
<i>We don 't want to be any worry</i>

343
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:57,006
<i>Well, you got caught with a flat</i>

344
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,854
<i>Well, how about that</i>

345
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:02,406
<i>Well, babies, don 't you panic</i>

346
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,851
<i>By the light of the night</i>

347
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:07,007
<i>It'll all seem all right</i>

348
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,931
<i>I'll get you a satanic mechanic</i>

349
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,208
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

350
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,609
<i>From Transsexual... </i>

351
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:22,212
<i>... Transylvania</i>

352
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:26,167
<i>Why don 't you stay for the night</i>

353
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:28,612
<i>-Night</i>
<i>-Or maybe a bite</i>

354
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:29,652
<i>Bite</i>

355
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,968
<i>I could show you</i>
<i>My favorite obsession</i>

356
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:36,215
<i>I've been making a man</i>

357
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,732
<i>With blond hair and a tan</i>

358
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:42,048
<i>And he's good for relieving</i>
<i>My tension</i>

359
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:45,606
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

360
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:50,056
<i>From Transsexual... </i>

361
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:53,413
<i>... Transylvania</i>

362
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,212
Hit it! Hit it!

363
00:25:55,416 --> 00:26:00,046
<i>-I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>
<i>-Sweet transvestite</i>

364
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:03,208
<i>From Transsexual... </i>

365
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:05,452
<i>... Transylvania</i>

366
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:12,450
<i>So come up to the lab</i>

367
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:16,129
<i>And see what's on the slab</i>

368
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:18,285
<i>I see you shiver</i>

369
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,566
<i>With antici... </i>

370
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,405
<i>-pation</i>

371
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,487
<i>But maybe the rain</i>

372
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,408
<i>Is really to blame</i>

373
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,770
<i>So I'll remove the cause</i>

374
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,375
<i>But not the symptom</i>

375
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,365
Thank you.

376
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,410
Thank you very much.

377
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:01,205
Brad!

378
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:05,608
We'll play along for now and pull out
the aces when the time is right.

379
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,485
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.

380
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:15,606
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.

381
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:20,331
You are...?

382
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:23,807
You are very lucky to be invited
up to <i>F</i>rank's laboratory.

383
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:27,526
Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.

384
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:29,812
People like you, maybe?

385
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,012
I've seen it.

386
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:39,611
Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.

387
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:42,012
Shift it!

388
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:59,812
Is he...? <i>F</i>rank, I mean,
is he your husband?

389
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:04,204
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.

390
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:06,924
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.

391
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,004
Magenta.

392
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,609
Columbia.

393
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:56,406
Go and assist Riff Raff.

394
00:28:58,096 --> 00:28:59,814
I will entertain... .

395
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:07,733
Brad Majors and this is
my fiancée, Janet Vice.

396
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,012
- Weiss.
- Weiss?

397
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,407
<i>Enchanté, </i>

398
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,210
Well, how nice.

399
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:20,249
And what charming underclothes
you both have.

400
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,852
But here, put these on.

401
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,452
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.

402
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:31,051
It's not often
we receive visitors here.

403
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,935
Let alone offer them hospitality.

404
00:29:34,176 --> 00:29:38,613
Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!

405
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:41,051
A reasonable request you have ignored!

406
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:44,413
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

407
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:47,456
How forceful you are, Brad.

408
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:51,894
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.

409
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:58,613
You must be awfully proud
of him, Janet.

410
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,405
Well, yes, I am.

411
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:05,413
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.

412
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:08,608
Oh, well. How about you?

413
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,012
Everything is in readiness, master.

414
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,214
We merely await your word.

415
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:26,328
Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists...

416
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,605
...you are to witness
a new breakthrough...

417
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,853
...in biochemical research.

418
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:37,089
And paradise is to be mine!

419
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,811
It was strange the way it happened.

420
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:46,015
Suddenly...

421
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,215
...you get a break.

422
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:52,807
All the pieces seem to fit into place.

423
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:56,805
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.

424
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:59,656
The answer was there all the time.

425
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:04,208
It took a small accident
to make it happen.

426
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,656
- An accident!
- An accident!

427
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:10,330
That's how I discovered the secret.

428
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,769
That elusive ingredient.

429
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,371
That spark...

430
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,528
...that is the breath of life.

431
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,324
Yes.

432
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:28,127
I have that knowledge.

433
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:31,366
I hold the secret...

434
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:34,528
...to life itself!

435
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:50,491
You see...

436
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,211
...you are fortunate.

437
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:56,368
<i>F</i>or tonight is the night...

438
00:31:56,616 --> 00:32:01,531
...that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.

439
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:42,129
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.

440
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:50,133
And step up the reactor power input...

441
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,975
...three more points!

442
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:15,765
Oh, Brad!

443
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,734
It's all right, Janet.

444
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,852
Oh, Rocky!

445
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:12,731
<i>The sword of Damocles</i>
<i>Is hanging over my head</i>

446
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:17,331
<i>I've got the feeling someone's</i>
<i>Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

447
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:22,768
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

448
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:25,814
<i>My life is a misery</i>

449
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,172
<i>Oh, can 't you see</i>

450
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,249
<i>That I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

451
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,492
<i>I woke up this morning with a start</i>
<i>When I fell out of bed</i>

452
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,772
<i>That ain 't no crime</i>

453
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:43,372
<i>And left from my dreaming</i>
<i>Was a feeling of unnameable dread</i>

454
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,766
<i>That ain 't no crime</i>

455
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:48,530
<i>My high is low</i>

456
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:51,525
<i>I'm dressed up with no place to go</i>

457
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,336
<i>And all I know</i>

458
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:58,535
<i>Is I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

459
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,491
<i>-That ain 't no crime, </i>
<i>-Oh, no, no, no, </i>

460
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:06,375
<i>-That ain 't no crime, </i>
<i>-Oh, no, no, no, </i>

461
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,136
Oh, my baby!

462
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,133
<i>The sword of Damocles</i>
<i>Is hanging over my head</i>

463
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:17,526
<i>That ain 't no crime</i>

464
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:20,967
<i>I've got the feeling someone's</i>
<i>Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

465
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,650
<i>That ain 't no crime</i>

466
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,569
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

467
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,046
<i>My life is a mystery</i>

468
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,935
<i>And can 't you see</i>

469
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:35,373
<i>That I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

470
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:41,135
<i>-That ain 't no crime, </i>
<i>-Oh, no, no, no, </i>

471
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,053
<i>That ain 't no crime</i>

472
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,165
Well, really!

473
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:06,935
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.

474
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:14,928
But since you're such
an exceptional beauty...

475
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:17,526
...I'm prepared to forgive you.

476
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,653
Oh, I just love success!

477
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:27,171
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.

478
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,327
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.

479
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:30,895
He's okay.

480
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,335
Okay?

481
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:40,085
Okay?!

482
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:44,330
I think we can do better than that.

483
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:50,771
Now, Brad and Janet...

484
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:52,927
...what do you think of him?

485
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:54,929
Well... .

486
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:58,726
I don't like men
with too many muscles.

487
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,530
I didn't make him for you!

488
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:07,006
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.

489
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:22,730
<i>A weakling weighing 98 pounds</i>

490
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:25,810
<i>Will get sand in his face</i>

491
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:28,484
<i>When kicked to the ground</i>

492
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,849
<i>And soon in the gym</i>

493
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:35,735
<i>With a determined chin</i>

494
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,372
<i>The sweat from his pores</i>

495
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:44,331
<i>As he works for his cause</i>

496
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,292
<i>Will make him glisten</i>

497
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,532
<i>And gleam</i>

498
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:53,371
<i>And with massage</i>

499
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:58,531
<i>And just a little bit of steam</i>

500
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:04,925
<i>He'll be pink</i>

501
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:08,055
<i>And</i> q<i>uite clean</i>

502
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:12,414
<i>He'll be a strong man</i>

503
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:17,727
<i>Oh, honey</i>
<i>But the wrong man</i>

504
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:22,851
<i>He'll eat nutritious high protein</i>

505
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:25,451
<i>And swallow raw eggs</i>

506
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,368
<i>Try to build up his shoulders</i>

507
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,574
<i>His chest, arms and legs</i>

508
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,367
<i>Such an effort</i>
<i>If he only knew of my plan</i>

509
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:38,847
<i>In just seven days</i>

510
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:43,533
<i>I can make you a man</i>

511
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
<i>He'll do press-ups and chin-ups</i>

512
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:51,006
<i>Do the snatch, clean and jerk</i>

513
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,530
<i>He thinks dynamic tension</i>

514
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,931
<i>Must be hard work</i>

515
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,973
<i>Such strenuous living</i>

516
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:01,366
<i>I just don 't understand</i>

517
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:05,928
<i>When in just seven days</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

518
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:10,812
<i>I can make you a man</i>

519
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,490
Eddie!

520
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:42,255
<i>Whatever happened to Saturday night</i>

521
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,570
<i>When you dressed sharp, felt all right</i>
<i>Don 't seem the same since cosmic light</i>

522
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:51,206
<i>Came into my life</i>
<i>I thought I was divine</i>

523
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:56,325
<i>I'd go for a ride with chicks who 'd go</i>
<i>And listen to the music on the radio</i>

524
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:59,004
<i>A saxophone was blowing</i>
<i>On a rock 'n ' roll show</i>

525
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:03,693
<i>We climbed in the back seat</i>
<i>We really had a good time</i>

526
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:06,450
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

527
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:09,126
<i>I really love that rock 'n ' roll</i>

528
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:12,370
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

529
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:15,289
<i>I really love that rock 'n ' roll</i>

530
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:34,809
Lovely party!

531
00:41:40,656 --> 00:41:43,170
<i>My head used to swim</i>
<i>From the perfume I smelled</i>

532
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:46,135
<i>My hands kind of fumbled</i>
<i>With her white plastic belt</i>

533
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,009
<i>I'd taste her baby pink lipstick</i>
<i>And that's when I'd melt</i>

534
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,054
<i>She'd whisper in my ear</i>
<i>Tonight she really was mine</i>

535
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:57,051
<i>Get in front and put some hair oil on</i>
<i>Buddy Holly was singing his last song</i>

536
00:41:57,296 --> 00:42:00,174
<i>With your arms around your girl</i>
<i>You tried to sing along</i>

537
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,694
<i>It felt pretty good</i>
<i>Really had a good time</i>

538
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:07,934
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

539
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:09,894
<i>I really love that rock 'n ' roll</i>

540
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:13,131
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

541
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:15,970
<i>I really love that rock 'n ' roll</i>

542
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,732
One from the vaults.

543
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,734
Oh, baby!

544
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:16,933
Don't be upset.

545
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:21,331
It was a mercy killing.

546
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:25,132
He had a certain naive charm...

547
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:27,452
...but no muscle.

548
00:44:30,016 --> 00:44:32,576
<i>But a deltoid</i>

549
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:35,774
<i>And a bicep</i>

550
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:40,851
<i>A hot groin</i>
<i>And a tricep</i>

551
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,371
<i>Makes me... </i>

552
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,531
<i>... shake</i>

553
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:49,325
<i>Makes me want to take Charles Atlas</i>

554
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:52,289
<i>By the hand</i>

555
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:55,528
<i>In just seven days</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

556
00:44:55,776 --> 00:45:00,611
<i>I can make you a man</i>

557
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:07,415
<i>I don 't want no dissension</i>

558
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:13,367
<i>Just dynamic tension</i>

559
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:18,934
<i>I'm a muscle fan</i>

560
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:22,327
<i>In just seven days</i>

561
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:27,406
<i>I can make you a man</i>

562
00:45:28,296 --> 00:45:32,335
<i>Dig it if you can</i>

563
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,928
<i>In just seven days</i>

564
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:39,845
<i>I can make you a man</i>

565
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:56,928
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!

566
00:46:11,216 --> 00:46:14,970
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...

567
00:46:15,216 --> 00:46:18,731
...and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.

568
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:22,931
If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.

569
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:27,775
However, the sudden departure
of their host...

570
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:30,769
...and his creation...

571
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:34,053
...into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...

572
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:38,972
...had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.

573
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:42,731
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...

574
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:47,333
...and they were shown
to their separate rooms.

575
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,184
Who is it? Who's there?

576
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,381
It's only me, Janet.

577
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,185
Brad, darling, come in.

578
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,186
Oh, Brad!

579
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,188
Yes, my darling! But what if...?

580
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,386
Everything's going to be all right.

581
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,781
Oh, I hope so, my darling.

582
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:53,582
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?

583
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,108
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?

584
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,183
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?

585
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,706
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never... .

586
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,100
Yes. Yes, I know.

587
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,580
But it isn't all bad, is it?

588
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,780
I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.

589
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,825
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!

590
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,788
Brad. Oh, Brad!

591
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,909
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?

592
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,586
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!

593
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,985
I was saving myself.

594
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,389
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

595
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,782
Promise you won't tell Brad?

596
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,982
Cross my heart and hope to die.

597
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,028
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!

598
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,783
It'll destroy us.

599
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,181
Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.

600
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:37,382
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.

601
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,789
You!

602
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,629
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?

603
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,828
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?

604
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,425
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?

605
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,380
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!

606
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,190
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?

607
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,389
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.

608
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,103
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.

609
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,783
Oh, Janet.

610
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,778
Janet!

611
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,229
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?

612
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:19,383
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.

613
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,621
I thought it was the real thing!

614
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,588
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.

615
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,582
You liked it, didn't you?

616
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:29,027
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.

617
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,979
Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.

618
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,586
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.

619
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,181
You promise you won't tell?

620
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,580
On my mother's grave.

621
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,299
<i>Master, Rocky has broken his chains</i>
<i>and vanished, </i>

622
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,304
<i>The new playmate is loose</i>
<i>and somewhere in the castle grounds, </i>

623
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,781
<i>Magenta has just released the dogs, </i>

624
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,986
Coming!

625
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,266
What's happening here? Where's Brad?

626
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,986
Where's anybody?

627
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,306
Oh, Brad!

628
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:24,785
Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?

629
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,507
Oh, If only we hadn't
made this journey.

630
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,944
If only the car hadn't broken down.

631
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,860
If only we were amongst friends
or sane persons.

632
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,186
Oh, Brad.

633
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,222
What have they done with him?

634
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,386
Brad, how could you?

635
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,981
But you're hurt.

636
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,579
Did they do this to you?

637
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,267
Here. I'll dress your wounds.

638
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,185
Baby, there. Oh.

639
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,988
<i>"Emotion: agitation or disturbance</i>

...vehement or excited mental state. "

641
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:06,783
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.

642
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,620
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...

643
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,385
<i>... there seemed little doubt</i>

<i>... its slave, </i>

645
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,582

<i>I thought there's no use getting</i>

651
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,427
<i>Into heavy petting</i>

652
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,788

<i>And seat wetting</i>

00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,388
<i>Now all I want to know</i>

655

<i>Is how to go</i>

656

<i>I've tasted blood and I want more</i>

657
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,468
More, more, more.

658
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,630
<i>I'll put up no resistance</i>

659
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,020

How did it happen?

695
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,585
I understood you were to be watching.

696
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,822
I was only away for a minute, master.

697
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,780
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.

698
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,823
Master.

699
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,187
Master, we have a visitor.

700
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,379
Hey, Scotty!

701
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,579
Dr. Everett Scott.

702
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,021
You know this earthling...
...this person?

703
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:36,229
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.

704
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,188
I see.

705
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,987
So this wasn't
simply a chance meeting.

706
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,705
You came here with a purpose.

707
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,739
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.

708
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,379
I know what you told me, Brad.

709
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:56,186
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.

710
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,860
He was a science teacher
at Denton High.

711
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,220
And now he works for your government.

712
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,789
He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...

713
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,426
...of that which you call U<i>F</i>Os!
Isn't that right, Brad?

714
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,979
He might be. I don't know.

715
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,188
The intruder is entering
the building, master.

716
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,624
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.

717
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,985
Shall we inquire of him in person?

718
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,106
Great Scott!

719
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,018
<i>F</i>rank N. <i>F</i>urter.

720
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,424
We meet at last.

721
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,828
Dr. Scott!

722
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,300
Brad! What are you doing here?

723
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,780
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.

724
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,548
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.

725
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,826
It was part of your plan, was it not?

726
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:39,745
That he and his female
should check the layout for you?

727
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:44,662
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.

728
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,982
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.

729
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,385
I know Brad is.

730
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,549
I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.

731
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,587
I came here to find Eddie.

732
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,660
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?

733
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,662
What do you know of Eddie?

734
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,230
I know a great deal
about a lot of things.

735
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,428
You see, Eddie happens to be
my nephew.

736
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,983
Dr. Scott.

737
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,582
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

738
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,058
- Janet!
- Brad!

739
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,345
Rocky!

740
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,182
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

741
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,829
- Janet!
- Brad!

742
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,139
Rocky!

743
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,785
Listen! I made you...

744
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,579
...and I can break you just as easily.

745
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,307
Master, dinner is prepared!

746
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,349
Excellent.

747
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:55,986
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.

748
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,987
<i>F</i>ood has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:

749
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,621
The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man...

750
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,101
...and now this meal.

751
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,428
<i>However informal it might appear... </i>

752
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,822
<i>... you can be sure there was to be</i>
<i>very little bonhomie, </i>

753
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,299
A toast.

754
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,226
To absent friends.

755
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,621
To absent friends.

756
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,630
And Rocky.

757
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,982
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

758
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,061
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

759
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,221
<i>Happy birthday, dear Rocky</i>

760
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,301
<i>-Happy birthday... </i>
- Shall we?

761
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:23,023
We came here to discuss Eddie.

762
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,589
Eddie!

763
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,348
It's a rather tender subject.

764
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,021
Another slice, anyone?

765
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,628
Excuse me.

766
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,545
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.

767
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,348
Aliens!

768
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:58,500
Dr. Scott!

769
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,822
Go on, Dr. Scott.

770
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:05,181
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?

771
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,419
Just what exactly are you implying?

772
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,819
It's all right!

773
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,702
That's all right, Brad.

774
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,385
<i>From the day he was born</i>

775
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,823
<i>He was trouble</i>

776
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,429
<i>He was the thorn</i>

777
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,220
<i>In his mother's side</i>

778
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,227
<i>She tried in vain</i>

779
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:44,222
<i>But he never caused her</i>
<i>Nothing but shame</i>

780
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:48,341
<i>He left home... </i>

781
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,662
<i>... the day she died</i>

782
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,026
<i>From the day she was gone</i>

783
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,021
<i>All he wanted</i>

784
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,020
<i>Was rock 'n ' roll porn</i>

785
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,019
Und <i>a motorbike</i>

786
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,019
<i>Shooting up junk</i>

787
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,067
<i>He was a low-down, cheap little punk</i>

788
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:15,225
<i>Taking everyone for a ride</i>

789
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,670
<i>When Eddie said</i>
<i>He didn 't like his teddy</i>

790
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,265
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

791
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:24,229
<i>But when he threatened your life</i>
<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

792
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,823
<i>-What a guy</i>
<i>-Makes you cry</i>

793
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,429
Und <i>I did</i>

794
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:30,663
<i>Everybody shoved him</i>

795
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,822
<i>I very nearly loved him</i>

796
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,630
<i>I said, hey, listen to me</i>

797
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,668
<i>Stay sane inside insanity</i>

798
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:44,825
<i>But he locked the door</i>
<i>And threw away the key</i>

799
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,867
<i>But he must've been drawn</i>

800
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,068
<i>Into something</i>

801
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,346
<i>Making him warn me</i>

802
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,182
<i>In a note which reads: </i>

803
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,823
<i>What's it say? What's it say? </i>

804
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,389
<i>"I'm out of my head</i>

805
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,829
<i>Oh, hurry, or I may be dead</i>

806
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:08,305
<i>They mustn 't carry out</i>
<i>Their evil deeds"</i>

807
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:12,229
<i>When Eddie said</i>
<i>He didn 't like his teddy</i>

808
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,148
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

809
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,384

<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

810
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,223
<i>-What a guy</i>
<i>-Makes you cry</i>

811
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,823

814
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,307
<i>But when he threatened your life</i>
<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

815
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:34,748
<i>-What a guy</i>
<i>-Woe, woe, woe</i>

816
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,427
<i>-Makes you cry</i>
<i>-Hey, hey, hey</i>

817
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,980
Und <i>I did</i>

818
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,859
<i>Hey</i>

819
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,419
Oh.

820
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,863
Oh, Rocky!

821
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,020
How could you?!

822
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,422
This way! This way!

823
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,504
Shut up!

824
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:24,027
<i>I'll tell you once</i>
<i>I won 't tell you twice</i>

825
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,660
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

826
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,141
<i>Your apple pie</i>
<i>Don 't taste too nice</i>

827
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,587
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

828
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,466
<i>I've laid the seed</i>
<i>It should be all you need</i>

829
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,541
<i>You're as sensual as a pencil</i>

830
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,348
<i>Wound up like an E or first string</i>

831
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,024
<i>When we made it</i>
<i>Did ya hear a bell ring? </i>

832
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,668
<i>You got a block</i>
<i>Well, take my advice</i>

833
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:58,823
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

834
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:02,586
<i>The transducer</i>
<i>Will seduce ya</i>

835
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,263
My feet! I can't move my feet!

836
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,468
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.

837
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,026
It's as if we were glued to the spot.

838
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,028
You are.

839
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,661
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.

840
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,384
We're trapped.

841
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,818
<i>It's something you'll get used to</i>
<i>A mental mind fuck can be nice</i>

842
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,826
No!

843
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,142
You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.

844
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,267
This sonic transducer...

845
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:37,742
...it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?

846
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,469
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.

847
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:43,020
It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.

848
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:46,945
But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.

849
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,341
A device capable
of breaking down solid matter...

850
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:53,821
...and then projecting it
through space, and who knows...

851
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:57,460
...perhaps even time itself!

852
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,019
He's gonna send us to another planet?

853
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:03,267
Planet schmanet, Janet.

854
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,748
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

855
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:10,824
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Build your thighs up</i>

856
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,463
<i>You'd better wise up</i>

857
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,746
And then she cried out:

858
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,662
Stop!

859
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:25,585
<i>Don 't get hot and flustered</i>

860
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:30,428
<i>Use a bit of mustard</i>

861
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,224
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

862
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,064
<i>But you'd better not... </i>

863
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,230
<i>... try to hurt her</i>

864
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,779
<i>Frank Furter</i>

865
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,424
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

866
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,349
<i>But you'd better not... </i>

867
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,423

869
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,380
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

870
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:01,464
My God! I can't stand
any more of this.

871
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:06,420
<i>F</i>irst, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.

872
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:10,221
You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.

873
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,264
I loved you.

874
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:14,622
Do you hear me? I loved you.

875
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:18,220
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.

876
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:22,463
You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.

877
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,223
Well, I've had enough!

878
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:28,389
Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.

879
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:41,429
It's not easy, having a good time.

880
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:52,427
Even smiling makes my face ache.

881
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,429
And my children turn on me.

882
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,021
Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.

883
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,858
Maybe I made a mistake...

884
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,829
...splitting his brain
between the two of them.

885
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,265
I grow weary of this world!

886
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,627
When shall we return to Transylvania?!

887
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,223
Magenta...

888
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:21,345
...I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.

889
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:24,024
You have both served me well.

890
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:28,143
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.

891
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:32,827
You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.

892
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,022
I ask for nothing, master.

893
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:40,423
And you shall receive it in abundance!

894
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,621
Come. We are ready
for the floorshow.

895
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:17,499
<i>And so, by some extraordinary</i>
<i>coincidence... </i>

896
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,508
...fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...

897
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,459
...should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.

898
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,541
But it was to be in a situation...

899
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,827
...which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.

900
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:34,308
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement...

901
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,020
...Brad and Janet had both tasted...

902
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,821
...forbidden fruit.

903
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,862
This in itself was proof...

904
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,341
...that their host
was a man of little morals...

905
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,423
...and some persuasion.

906
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,626
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?

907
01:12:55,910 --> 01:13:00,620
And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?

908
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,869
In an empty house...

909
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,943
...in the middle of the night?

910
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,829
What diabolical plan...

911
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:14,029
...had seized
<i>F</i>rank's crazed imagination?

912
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:17,826
What indeed?

913
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,866
<i>F</i>rom what had gone before,
it was clear...

914
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,466
...that this was to be no picnic.

915
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:56,459
<i>It was great when it all began</i>

916
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:01,226
<i>I was a regular Frankie fan</i>

917
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,740
<i>But it was over when he had the plan</i>

918
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:09,029
<i>To start working on a muscleman</i>

919
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,825
<i>Now the only thing that gives me hope</i>

920
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:17,421
<i>Is my love of a certain dope</i>

921
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,138
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

922
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:24,065
<i>Keeps me safe</i>
<i>From my trouble and pain</i>

923
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,264
<i>I'm just seven hours old</i>

924
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:32,388
<i>Truly beautiful to behold</i>

925
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:37,027
<i>And somebody should be told</i>

926
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:41,064
<i>My libido hasn 't been controlled</i>

927
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,219
<i>Now the only thing I've come to trust</i>

928
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:49,629
<i>Is an orgasmic rush of lust</i>

929
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:51,423
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

930
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:55,822
<i>And keeps me safe</i>
<i>From my trouble and pain</i>

931
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,865
<i>It's beyond me</i>

932
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:06,069
<i>Help me, Mommy</i>

933
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,865
<i>I'll be good, you'll see</i>

934
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:13,420
<i>Take this dream away</i>

935
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,545
<i>What's this</i>

936
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,621
<i>Let's see</i>

937
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,226
<i>I feel sexy</i>

938
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:26,229
<i>What's come over me</i>

939
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:29,303
<i>Here it comes again</i>

940
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:36,059
<i>I feel released</i>

941
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,427
<i>Bad times deceased</i>

942
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,747
<i>My confidence has increased</i>

943
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:47,022
<i>Reality is here</i>

944
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:51,269
<i>The game has been disbanded</i>

945
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,820
<i>My mind has been expanded</i>

946
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:58,102
<i>It's a gas that Frankie's landed</i>

947
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:03,621
<i>His lust is so sincere</i>

948
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,741
<i>Whatever happened... </i>

949
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,424
<i>... to Fay Wray</i>

950
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,662
<i>That delicate... </i>

951
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:49,267
<i>... satin-draped frame</i>

952
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:54,429
<i>As it clung to her thigh</i>

953
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,625
<i>How I started to cry</i>

954
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,868
<i>'Cause I wanted to be dressed</i>

955
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:08,228
<i>Just the same</i>

956
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,546
<i>Give yourself over</i>

957
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:15,669
<i>To absolute pleasure</i>

958
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,868
<i>Swim the warm waters</i>

959
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,659
<i>Of sins of the flesh</i>

960
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,629
<i>Erotic nightmares</i>

961
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:29,459
<i>Beyond any measure</i>

962
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:32,861
<i>And sensual daydreams</i>

963
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:37,467
<i>To treasure forever</i>

964
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:42,625
<i>Can 't you just see it</i>

965
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:58,422
<i>Don 't dream it</i>

966
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,429
<i>Be it</i>

967
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:06,225
<i>Don 't dream it</i>

968
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,829

970
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:16,107
<i>Be it</i>

971
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:28,702
<i>Don 't dream it</i>

972
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,384
<i>Be it</i>

973
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:03,420
We've got to get...

974
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,428
...out of this trap...

975
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:10,225
...before this decadence...

976
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,185
...saps our wills.

977
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,620
I've got to be strong...

978
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,419
...<i>und</i> try to hang on.

979
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,867
Or else my mind...

980
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:26,419
...may well snap.

981
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:31,229

<i>Help me, Mommy</i>

985
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,421

<i>I'm going home</i>

01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:34,619
<i>Feeling</i>

1035
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:38,146
<i>Like I'm outside in the rain</i>

1036
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,302
<i>Wheeling</i>

1037
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,145
<i>Free to try and find a game</i>

1038
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:48,029

<i>I'm going home</i>

1050
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:10,308
How sentimental.

1051
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,466
And also presumptuous of you.

1052
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,302
You see, when I said "we"...

1053
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:31,018
...were to return to Transylvania...

1054
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,545
...I referred only
to Magenta and myself.

1055
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,707
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading...

1056
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:38,945
...but you see...

1057
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,909
...you are to remain here.

1058
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,699
In spirit anyway.

1059
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,908
Good heavens, that's a laser.

1060
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,429
Yes, Dr. Scott.

1061
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:53,899
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.

1062
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,622
You're going to kill him?

1063
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,102
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.

1064
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,466
Society must be protected.

1065
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,906
Exactly, Dr. Scott.

1066
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:07,908
Now, <i>F</i>rank N. <i>F</i>urter,
your time has come

1067
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:11,900
Say goodbye to all of this...

1068
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:16,978
...and hello to oblivion.

1069
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:34,705
No.

1070
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,179
No.

1071
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:37,903
No!

1072
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,709
Good God!

1073
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,104
You killed them.

1074
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:12,901
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.

1075
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:15,899
They didn't like me!

1076
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,099
They never liked me!

1077
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,108
You did right.

1078
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,702
A decision had to be made.

1079
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,306
You're okay by me.

1080
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,301
Dr. Scott...

1081
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:48,422
...I'm sorry about your nephew.

1082
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:49,898
Eddie?

1083
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:53,507
Yes, well,
perhaps it was for the best.

1084
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:59,709
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.

1085
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:02,550
We are about
to beam the entire house...

1086
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,429
...back to the planet of Transsexual...

1087
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,707
...in the galaxy of Transylvania.

1088
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,305
Go.

1089
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,698
Now.

1090
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:29,698
Our noble mission
is almost completed...

1091
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,300
...my most beautiful sister.

1092
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:38,302
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores...

1093
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:40,700
...of our beloved planet.

1094
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,508
Sweet Transsexual.

1095
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,303
Land of night.

1096
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:56,105
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.

1097
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,907
To take that...

1098
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:07,707
...step to the right.

1099
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,309
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

1100
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:15,701
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

1101
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:19,103
And our world...

1102
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:24,105
...will do the time warp again!

1103
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:46,421
<i>I've done a lot</i>

1104
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:50,709
<i>God knows I've tried</i>

1105
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:54,346
<i>To find the truth</i>

1106
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,708
<i>I've even lied</i>

1107
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:02,306
<i>But all I know</i>

1108
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:05,542
<i>Is down inside</i>

1109
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:10,147
<i>I'm bleeding</i>

1110
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:18,108
<i>And superheroes</i>

1111
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:21,507
<i>Come to feast</i>

1112
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:25,106
<i>To taste the flesh</i>

1113
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:28,820
<i>Not yet deceased</i>

1114
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:32,699
<i>And all I know</i>

1115
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:35,743
<i>Is still the beast</i>

1116
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,699
<i>Is feeding</i>

1117
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,906
<i>And crawling</i>

1118
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:34,704
<i>On the planet's face</i>

1119
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:38,104
<i>Some insects</i>

1120
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,703
<i>Called the human race</i>

1121
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,899
<i>Lost in time</i>

1122
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:51,104
<i>And lost in space</i>

1123
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:53,706
<i>And meaning</i>

1124
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,338
<i>Meaning</i>

1125
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:16,340
