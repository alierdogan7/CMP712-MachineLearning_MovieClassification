Yes, go out and get food and come back!

684
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
- [crickets chirping]
- [chuckles, hiccups]

685
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,520
[clamoring]

686
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,880
Deep breaths.
You're in a happy place. It's all good.

687
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,680
There's an angry mob outside,
and they're demanding their money back!

688
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,920
I think we all know the right thing to do.

689
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,720
- ["Sabre Dance" resumes]
- [shouting]

690
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,640
Come on, come on!

691
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,200
[Marty] Come on! Hurry up!

692
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,320
- Hop on the train!
- [gasps]

693
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,360
[angry shouting]

694
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,880
[babbles, shrieks]

695
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,720
[Gloria] Come on, guys!

696
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,640
- Mamma mia!
- [Gloria] Hurry up!

697
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
Grazie, Alice.

698
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,720
Just throw us the money!

699
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,440
Ah!

700
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
[excited chattering]

701
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,320
Captain Chantal Dubois. Get up.

702
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm going to have to send you
back to Monaco under maximum security.

703
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,480
What?!

704
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
[gasps]

705
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
It's just a pillow!

706
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,480
Eh, that's the oldest trick
in the book, Comandante.

707
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,280
Every bambino in Italy knows that one.

708
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Maybe, but do they know
about the old escape hole

709
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,080
behind the innocent-looking poster?

710
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,280
[groans]

711
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,400
Or the really old "I'm gonna
hide up on the ceiling" trick!

712
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,560
[clears throat]

713
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
[whistles]

714
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,000
Of course.
The secret tunnel under the bed!

715
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,560
Get this thing out of the way.

716
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,120
[policemen straining]

717
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,320
Let's go!

718
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,840
This secret tunnel is a dead end!

719
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,760
[policeman] There's nothing but bedsprings
and mattress stuffing down here!

720
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,760
[Comandante] Was that the sound
of a cell door closing?

721
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,120
[computer beeps]

722
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,920
Voilá!

723
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,320
[printer buzzing]

724
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,800
[Comandante] Was that the sound
of my HP printer printing?

725
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,800
[Alex groans] This is a disaster!

726
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,920
[Gloria] We blow all
our money on a bad circus,

727
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,720
- and we're not any closer to New York!
- If anything, we're further away!

728
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,040
We could have at least bought a circus
that knew how to circ!

729
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,640
I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

730
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,760
We had enough dough for a plane!

731
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,440
- Are you kidding me?
- You must have some money left over.

732
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,800
I used it to buy teeth
and then have them capped in gold.

733
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,160
Now I can eat apples!

734
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,960
Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.

735
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,400
[Marty] No promoter is sending this show
to America. It's toe up!

736
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
[Gloria] Now it makes sense. No wonder
the circus master was so happy to sell.

737
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,920
Shh!

738
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,920
[Marty] He was happy, all right.
Happy about ripping us off!

739
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,120
[Alex shrieks]

740
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,600
- Where did Alex go?
- I don't know.

741
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,400
[screaming]

742
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,680
Come on! This way!

743
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,200
No, no, no. You come this way!

744
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,400
Alice, watch your head!

745
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,800
[train whistle blows]

746
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,320
Yah!

747
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,200
[gasps]

748
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,200
Alice!

749
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,480
Alice! [shrieks]

750
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,400
- [Alex] I'm fine!
- [shrieks]

751
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,640
Fantastic!

752
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,560
[train whistle blows]

753
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,760
Was that trapeze americano?

754
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,960
- Uh, yeah. Sort of.
- Incredible!

755
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,160
- I hope this is important.
- Come this way, Alice!

756
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,080
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like New York Knicks.

757
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,440
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.

758
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Whoa.

759
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,440
What is this place?

760
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,320
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,

761
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
but there is something you must know.

762
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,760
There was a time
when Circus Zaragoza,

763
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,560
we were a great circus!

764
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,240
Numero uno in all the Europa!

765
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,080
And Vitaly...
he was the biggest star of us all.

766
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,240
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.

767
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

768
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,520
[cheering]

769
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,800
Stefano!

770
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,880
Make the hoop smaller.

771
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,520
- Like this?
- Smaller.

772
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,920
- Like this?
- Good!

773
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,200
[squeals]

774
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,760
[growls]

775
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
- [pops]
- [crowd roaring]

776
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,120
[Stefano] It had never been done before
because it was physically impossible!

777
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,000
And the people... they loved it!

778
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,480
[female] Viva Vitaly!

779
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,920
Smaller!

780
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Ha!

781
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,440
- [pops]
- [cheering]

782
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,800
[Stefano] And the hoop, she got smaller!

783
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
Like the ring

784
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,720
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.

785
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,600
Bravo, Vitaly!

786
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
[Stefano] He would not stop pushing.

787
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,080
And one fateful day...

788
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,720
...he push too far!

789
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,720
Light the hoop on fire!

790
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,320
[gasps]

791
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:47,320
[cheering]

792
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,000
[Stefano] He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.

793
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,360
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.

794
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,360
And he lost everything.

795
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,720
His wife, she run off with a musician.

796
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,280
He lost his dignity... his fame...

797
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,040
...his passion... and his fur.

798
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,040
And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.

799
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,200
Scusi. Vitaly!

800
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,880
- [growls]
- [shrieks] Nothing!

801
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,880
His only passion now is the borscht.

802
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,600
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.

803
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,480
So when he lost his passion,

804
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,720
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

805
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,400
- This is why we need your help.
- What sort of help?

806
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,520
You can teach us to do new circus.
Americano style!

807
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,960
We find a new passion.

808
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,080
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to US and A!

809
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
[chair squeaking]

810
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
A!

811
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,720
I know. It is stupido idea.

812
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,760
We are a lost cause.

813
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,640
No, no, this isn't stupido.
This could work!

814
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,520
- What?
- What you just said.

815
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,720
- [gasps] What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

816
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,840
- What?
- Your stupido idea!

817
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,880
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

818
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,200
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

819
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,880
Some say I'm even slightly below.

820
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,480
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

821
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,160
I call it Phase 4-7B,
wherein, in order to get home,

822
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,440
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!

823
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,880
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

824
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,760
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

825
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,520
- [angry shouting]
- I missed.

826
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,560
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

827
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,120
Circus has been same for generations!

828
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,320
We make good,
classic family entertainment.

829
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,120
Aha! But last few generations,

830
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,480
families... not so entertained.

831
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,160
[clears throat]

832
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,640
That's right.
Families not so entertained

833
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,360
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

834
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,440
It's missing passion.

835
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,240
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

836
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,040
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

837
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,160
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

838
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,120
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

839
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,880
But those days are over.

840
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,080
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

841
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,880
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

842
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,880
Circus is not about the acts you do.

843
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,600
Circus is in here.

844
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,000
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?

845
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,760
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

846
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,160
[scoffs] You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

847
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,480
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,

848
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,680
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

849
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,040
and completely flipped the paradigm.

850
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,360
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

851
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,640
And one of them
completely in the nude.

852
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,680
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

853
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,800
Take off their clothes?

854
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,640
- No. They got rid of the animals.
- [Stefano] What?

855
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,120
- Say it ain't so!
- [Gia] Che stupida! No animals...

856
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,360
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!

857
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,760
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

858
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,760
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

859
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,040
I mean, they cannot... [clears throat]

860
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,400
I think you understand what I'm saying!

861
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,320
- Yeah!
- Yes!

862
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Uh... No!

863
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

864
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,800
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

865
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,240
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

866
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
- [cheering]
- [roaring]

867
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,280
We'll make an all-animal circus!

868
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,720
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

869
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,000
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

870
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,840
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

871
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,680
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

872
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,600
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

873
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,600
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?

874
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,360
Fur power!

875
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,160
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

876
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,840
You and me, baby! An act together!

877
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,880
I love it!

878
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,160
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!

879
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,360
- Uh, dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

880
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,440
[humming] Me and you! We got this!

881
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,760
[stammering] But I can't dance.

882
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,720
- [chanting] Fur power!
- Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

883
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,880
Ah! I do not trust this lion.

884
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,560
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

885
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,880
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

886
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,760
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.

887
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,240
You know our circus is in trouble.

888
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,640
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.

889
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,760
Circus always stay together.

890
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,920
[sighs] OK. I do one hoop.

891
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,000
[squeals]

892
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,840
I want a hug, too!

893
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,240
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

894
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,600
[laughing]

895
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,760
[engine rumbling]

896
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,200
[tires squeal]

897
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,200
Attention! I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

898
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,640
[monitors beeping rhythmically]

899
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,520
[slow instrumental intro begins]

900
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,920
[singing "Non je ne regrette rien"]

901
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
[man shrieks]

902
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,120
[music slows, softens]

903
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,880
[singing finale]

904
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,920
[music crescendos]

905
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,320
[song ends]

906
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,600
[yodeling]

907
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,480
[Mort giggling]
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

908
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,480
[Stefano] More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

909
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,320
Are you really going
to shoot yourself out of that thing?

910
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,360
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

911
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,880
to be a human cannonball!

912
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,720
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.

913
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,040
Is it dangerous?

914
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,800
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!

915
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,520
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

916
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,560
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

917
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,640
Sí. That's means yes!

918
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
Ready for launch?

919
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,000
Ready for launch!

920
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,840
Fire in the hole!

921
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Wait!

922
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,520
[screaming]

923
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,400
[groans]

924
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
Mamma mia!

925
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,120
Help me!

926
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,320
[Stefano's voice echoing]

927
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,120
Rico! Get the cannon ready!
Same charge!

928
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,160
- [Skipper] Fire in the hole!
- Oh!

929
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,640
[screaming]

930
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,560
Oh, oh! [shouting gleefully]

931
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,360
- ["Born Free" playing]
- All right! [laughs]

932
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,560
Oh! Whoo!

933
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,600
Yeah!

934
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,280
[howling]

935
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,600
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

936
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,400
Whoo! I was flying! I was effin'-L-Y-in'!

937
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm proud of you, but... [whimpers]

938
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,280
...I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

939
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.

940
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,920
Here, wrap this around you.

941
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
All right, I got you! I got you!

942
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,480
- [shouts happily]
- [howling]

943
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,120
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

944
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,800
- I'm going to fly, baby!
- Oh, yes! What a triumph!

945
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,160
- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!

946
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,040
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

947
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,120
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.

948
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,600
He's got us pegged.

949
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,520
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

950
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,080
- [buzzes]
- [screams]

951
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,760
Oh, that was great!

952
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,720
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

953
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,880
- [Freddie] I want to try that!
- Jonesy! Jonesy!

954
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,920
Whoo! Hey. Hi.

955
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,320
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.

956
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,400
Oh, thanks.

957
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,760
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

958
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,800
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

959
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,720
- I know they don't rhyme.
- Trapeze is my passion!

960
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,360
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

961
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,000
You can teach me!

962
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,440
- What?
- Teach me.

963
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,360
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

964
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,120
So that kind of rules that out.

965
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,200
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.

966
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,280
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

967
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,640
"Show me"? What are we, five?

968
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,560
I am five, yes.

969
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,600
[stammering, sighs]

970
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,320
- [dance music plays]
- [Melman] Dancing.

971
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,200
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

972
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,880
I mean, the music
totally throws off my timing.

973
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,760
You want excitement? Ha-ha!

974
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,400
Check it out.
Who's on a tightrope, huh? Huh?

975
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Who's on a...

976
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,560
- [screams]
- [Gloria humming]

977
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,320
- I'm on a tightrope! I'm on a tightrope!
- [gasps]

978
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,800
Melman! Oh, my gosh!

979
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,560
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

980
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,400
- I'm coming right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

981
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,680
- Melman?!
- [yelling]

982
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,920
Ah! Ah! Ah!

983
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,240
Calm down, Melman.

984
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,600
I'm going to fall
and break all of my neck! Ah!

985
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,360
Just look at me. Look at me.

986
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
- All eyes on me.
- OK.

987
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,600
- Come to me.
- [stammering] I can't.

988
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,680
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

989
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,280
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

990
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,000
Maybe because you've never tried.

991
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,280
No, I have tried.

992
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,480
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

993
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,280
You practiced? For me?

994
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,240
Yes, but it's no use.

995
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,000
I never know
what to do with my arms.

996
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,160
- [shouting]
- Hold it.

997
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,840
That part is so easy, Melman. OK?

998
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,960
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.

999
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,280
See? Two steps forward.

1000
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,120
One step back.

1001
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,960
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

1002
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,920
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

1003
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,560
- Whoo-hoo! I'm dancing!
- [Gloria laughing]

1004
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,560
[Stefano screaming]

1005
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,800
OK. [exhales] Whoo! All right.

1006
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,080
So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?

1007
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,200
Uh, this is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

1008
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,520
OK, how do we begin?

1009
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,880
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

1010
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,400
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.

1011
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,680
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. OK.

1012
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,560
- Do you need a push?
- No.

1013
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,920
Just watch and learn!

1014
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,080
[♪ Peter Asher:
"Love Always Comes as a Surprise"]

1015
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,640
- Like that?
- That's one way of doing it, sure.

1016
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
[shouting]

1017
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,560
Wow! You use a net!

1018
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,440
Yes! Trapeze americano. We use the net.

Wow!

00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,240
[Marty howling]

1027
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,560

[cheering]

1029
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,000
E bravo! Bravissima!

1030
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,000
Hey, Vitaly,
maybe you even do two hoops, no?

1031
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,000
Psst. Señorita Bell-bottoms.

1032
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,480
Tenemos una problema grande.

1033
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,920
¿Qué? ¿Qué grande problema?

1034
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,040
Oh, no! She's onto us!

1035
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,680
Shh! Don't make it
any easier on the psycho.

1036
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,560
- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

1037
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,880
But we're not ready.
We're in the middle of rehearsals.

1038
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,320
Then why don't you lilt over,

1039
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,600
grab your peduncle,
and kiss New York good-bye?

1040
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,880
Are you sure we are ready?

1041
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,720
Of course we're ready! Born ready!
Ready steady! Come on, let's go!

1042
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,120
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1043
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,040
[Skipper] All right, you heard the cat.
Move it! Come on! All aboard!

1044
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,160
Grab your luggage
and drain your bladders.

1045
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,360
It's going to be a long ride!

1046
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,240
[Julien] Whoa!

1047
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,800
All right, everybody,
let's blow that promoter away!

1048
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,240
- [Melman] London, here we come!
- [Marty] Sunshiny London, yes!

1049
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,800
[audience cheering]

1050
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,240
[crowd chanting]
Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly!

1051
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
[gasps, panting]

1052
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,200
[bells chiming]

1053
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,320
[Skipper] Come on, come on, come on.
Where is he?

1054
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,000
Bingo!

1055
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,760
If that's not a red-blooded
American promoter, I don't know what is.

1056
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,400
We need to get this show on the road.
Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.

1057
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,920
The eagle has landed!

1058
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,600
Roger that.
Oh, and keep an eye out for Dubois.

1059
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,600
Aye, aye, guvnor!

1060
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,160
The promoter is in the house!

1061
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,040
- New York is closer than ever!
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

1062
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,440
First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!

1063
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,000
- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.

1064
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,920
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

1065
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,680
- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

1066
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,480
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen Vitaly?

1067
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,640
- [Stefano weeping]
- Hey.

1068
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,360
Stefano, why the sad little face?

1069
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,240
Vitaly... he will not go on!

1070
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,320
- What?
- I tried everything I could.

1071
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,360
- [weeping]
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1072
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,040
Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

1073
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,640
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.

1074
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,880
- Vitaly, what are you doing?
- You missed.

1075
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,160
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?

1076
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,040
They have good show without me.

1077
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,400
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

1078
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,040
You get fake foot, then you walk.

1079
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,640
- I don't want fake foot! OK?
- [groans]

1080
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,320
What happened to "circus stick together,"
huh? "The show must go on."

1081
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,800
Clichés.

1082
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,160
Come on, man.
Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

1083
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,480
What other guy?

1084
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,680
The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!

1085
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,360
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.

1086
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,600
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?

1087
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,920
That Vitaly is no more.

1088
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,760
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,

1089
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,360
but your friends
haven't given up on you.

1090
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,920
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,

1091
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,680
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

1092
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,400
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?

1093
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,320
[groans] It is impossible.

1094
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,960
[sighs]

1095
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,400
It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

1096
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,960
That is why I loved it.

1097
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,440
Because I did the impossible!

1098
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,120
I was once a brave tiger.

1099
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,320
And if I go down in flames... [laughs]

1100
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,720
...so be it!

1101
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,520
You know, I think
I might have an idea for you.

1102
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,000
Light the hoop on fire!

1103
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,920
[pounding heartbeat]

1104
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,800

Mamma mia, Santa Maria, Santa Maria...

Mamma Maria, mia Santa,
Santa Mia Farrow...

1108
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,640
Come on, you got it.

1109

- [gasps]

1110

[cheering]

1111
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,600
[laughing] Yes!

1112
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,600
All right, what are you waiting for?
We got a show to put on.

1113
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,520
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!

1114
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
[♪ Katy Perry: "Firework"]

1115
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,880
[excited chattering]

1116
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,760
Look!

1117
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,920
[laughing]

1118
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,240
We're going to America! Whoo!

1119
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,640
Today!

1120
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,480
That's what I call crack-a-lackin'
to the mack-a-lackin'!

1121
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,120
- We did it, Alice!
- Yeah!

1122
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,480
Maybe I am
average intelligence after all!

1123
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,760
Perhaps even slightly above.

1124
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,320
No, I don't think so.

1125
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,000
Ha! Hair conditioner.
Great idea, my friend!

1126
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,640
Feel. Go ahead. Soft like kitten, no?

1127
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,400
- Look at that.
- Slippery but not flammable.

1128
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,640
You smell like peaches and herb!

1129
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,600
- [squeals]
- Wow!

1130
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,480
Gia and Alex, the trapezing cats!

1131
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,960
We did pretty good.

1132
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,760
You will flip, and I will catch.

1133
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,040
And sometimes I will flip,
and you will catch.

1134
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,760
And then we will both flip,
and we'll travel the whole world!

1135
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,760
Flipping and catching,
and I will flip you...

1136
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,960
[harmonizing]

1137
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,440
[Gia continues indistinctly]

1138
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,480
Uh... You know, the thing is...

1139
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,360
- I may not always be around.
- Where are you going?

1140
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,760
- Well, I'm... I'm... I'm...
- [horn honking]

1141
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,040
Bravo, bravo!

1142
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,200
What a heartwarming performance,
Monsieur Circus Master.

1143
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,360
It brought tears to my eyes.

1144
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
[chuckling] No, not really.

1145
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,960
[over phone] Monsieur, we both know
the lion does not belong to you.

1146
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,720
[gasps] It's that horrid woman!

1147
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,640
He is a fugitive from justice.

1148
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,480
You will turn the lion over to me

1149
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,200
so that I may put him where he belongs.

1150
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,760

- On my wall.

1151

[officers grunt]

1153
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,480
- What?
- [Skipper] Incoming!

1154
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,760
- Whoo!
- [Skipper] Outgoing!

1155
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,760
Wait!

1156
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,680
[screaming]

1157
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,560
[Skipper] Up high! Whoo-ha!

1158
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,240
Down low. Too slow.

1159
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,000
- Well done, Private.
- Did I do good?

1160
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,720
[Skipper] Nah, not really.

1161
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,240
Man, that was close!

1162
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,760
[Gia] Alex?

1163
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,240
You are from a zoo?

1164
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,480
Yes. Yes. But wait, there's more.

1165
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,320
- More?
- Or less. There's less.

1166
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,440
You were never circus?

1167
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,520
We had to say we were circus.

1168
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,320
Or you'd never have let us on the train!

1169
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,960
After all we have
been through together...

1170
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,600
...you want to go live in a zoo?

1171
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,640
- Gia, I...
- You used us.

1172
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,200
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...

1173
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,760
Trapeze americano,
you make that up, too?

1174
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,360
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.

1175
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,880
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.

1176
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,120
Balloons to the children of the world
was not real, either?

1177
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,440
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.

1178
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,640
I was shot out of a cannon!
I could have died!

1179
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,320
But I thought it was
your lifelong dream.

1180
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,240
For all I know,
your name is not even Alice.

1181
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,200
No, Stefano, but it never really was.

1182
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,680
I don't feel safe! [whimpering]

1183
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,400
Gia, I...

1184
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,320
We trusted you.

1185
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,240
My tears are real!

1186
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,760
You are not!

1187
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,000
I can't believe you lied
to all us circus folk.

1188
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,000
- [Julien] Me? Stay with the circus?
- [Sonya roars]

1189
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:02,280
I am a king! I want to rule New York!
We should talk.

01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,640
Whoa!

1191
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,680
Stop it! No means no!
Or in your language... Aah!

We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.
