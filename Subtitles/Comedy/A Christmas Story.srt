1
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,252
<i>Ah, there it is. My house.</i>

2
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,557
<i>And good old Cleveland Street.</i>
<i>How could I ever forget it?</i>

3
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,127
<i>And there I am,</i>
<i>with that dumb round face and...</i>

4
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,027
<i>that stupid stocking cap.</i>

5
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,834
<i>But no matter. Christmas was on its way.</i>

6
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,933
<i>Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...</i>

7
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,866
<i>around which the entire kid year revolved.</i>

8
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:42,498
<i>Downtown Hohman was prepared</i>
<i>for its yearly bacchanalia of...</i>

9
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,229
<i>peace on earth and good will to men.</i>

10
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,885
<i>Higbees' corner window</i>
<i>was traditionally a high-water mark...</i>

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,949
<i>of the pre-Christmas season.</i>

12
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,528
<i>First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff,</i>
<i>jostled in wonderment...</i>

13
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,433
<i>before a golden tinkling display...</i>

14
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,898
<i>of mechanized, electronic joy.</i>

15
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,281
<i>Wow, there it is.</i>

16
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,788
<i>The holy grail of Christmas gifts.</i>

17
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,757
<i>The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...</i>

18
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,986
<i>air rifle.</i>

19
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,863
<i>And there he is.</i>

20
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,854
<i>Red Ryder himself.</i>

21
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,599
<i>In his hand was the knurled stock</i>
<i>of as coolly deadly-looking...</i>

22
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,663
<i>a piece of weaponry</i>
<i>as ever I had laid eyes on.</i>

23
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,372
<i>For weeks, I had been scheming</i>
<i>to get my mitts on one of these...</i>

24
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,179
<i>fearsome blue-steel beauties.</i>

25
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,618
<i>My fevered brain seethed</i>
<i>with the effort of trying to come up with...</i>

26
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,558
<i>the infinitely subtle devices</i>
<i>necessary to implant...</i>

27
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,825
<i>the Red Ryder range model</i>
<i>air rifle indelibly...</i>

28
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,497
<i>into my parents' subconscious.</i>

29
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,734
Ralphie!

30
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,236
Randy!

31
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,234
Down here in two minutes!

32
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,607
And I mean two minutes!

33
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,142
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

34
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,781
Cut it out.

35
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,774
<i>My mother, grabbing for her copy</i>
<i>of</i> Look <i>magazine...</i>

36
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,480
<i>would find herself cleverly trapped</i>
<i>into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.</i>

37
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,721
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

38
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,517
What's that?

39
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,823
Well, for Christ's sake,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...

40
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,022
the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

41
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,724
'<i>'</i>Four Eyes'<i>'</i> Shottenhoffer,
a utility infielder.

42
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,958
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

43
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,435
That's nice.

44
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,504
Ralphie, on the double!

45
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,371
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

46
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,139
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.

47
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,738
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

48
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,814
They write the silliest things
in the newspapers.

49
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,848
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.

50
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,049
That's not like that politics slop.

51
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,823
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

52
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,328
Victor. His name is Victor.

53
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,726
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

54
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,033
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

55
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,573
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

56
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,010
Could be worth $50,000.

57
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,911
What kind is it this time?

58
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,478
Name the great characters
in American literature.

59
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,712
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

60
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,223
<i>Meanwhile, I struggled</i>
<i>for exactly the right BB gun hint.</i>

61
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,727
<i>It had to be firm, but subtle.</i>

62
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,989
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

63
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,739
<i>They looked at me as if</i>
<i>I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.</i>

64
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,576
<i>I could tell that I was in imminent danger</i>
<i>of over-playing my hand.</i>

65
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,315
<i>Casually, I switched tactics.</i>

66
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,076
Hey, Dad!

67
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,651
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got you for Christmas.

68
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,522
A new furnace.

69
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,919
That's a good one, Dad.

70
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,561
<i>My old man was one</i>
<i>of the most feared furnace-fighters...</i>

71
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,397
<i>in northern Indiana.</i>

72
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,499
Hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.

73
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
Yeah. I'm running late already.

74
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,966
<i>Round one was over.</i>

75
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,970
<i>Parents, one.</i>

76
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,170
<i>Kids, zip.</i>

77
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
<i>I could feel the Christmas noose</i>
<i>beginning to tighten.</i>

78
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,887
<i>Maybe what happened next</i>
<i>was inevitable.</i>

79
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,548
Ralphie, what would you like
for Christmas?

80
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,885
<i>Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.</i>

81
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:44,019
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

82
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,198
No. Shoot your eye out.

83
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,032
<i>Oh, no! It was</i>
<i>the classic mother-BB gun block.</i>

84
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,995
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out."</i>

85
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,868
<i>That deadly phrase uttered</i>
<i>many times before by hundreds...</i>

86
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,944
<i>of mothers was not surmountable...</i>

87
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,036
<i>by any means known to kid-dom.</i>

88
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,014
<i>But such was my mania,</i>
<i>my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...</i>

89
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,382
<i>that I immediately began</i>
<i>to rebuild the dike.</i>

90
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,583
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.

91
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,692
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

92
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
<i>I couldn't believe my own ears.</i>
<i>Tinkertoys?</i>

93
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,862
<i>She'd never buy it.</i>

94
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,129
BB guns are dangerous.

95
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,792
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

96
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,508
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.

97
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,616
<i>Mothers know nothing</i>
<i>about creeping marauders...</i>

98
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,781
<i>burrowing through the snow</i>
<i>toward the kitchen...</i>

99
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,386
<i>where only you, and you alone,</i>
<i>stand between your tiny...</i>

100
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,293
<i>huddled family and insensate evil.</i>

101
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,404
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys...

102
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,911
would be coming for us in the end!

103
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,044
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got OI' Blue<i>...</i>

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,154
What've we got here, folks?

105
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,158
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

106
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,790
Well, just me and my trusty old...

107
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,592
Red Ryder carbine-action
200-shot range model air rifle.

108
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,659
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

109
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,132
Well, I think I better have a look here.

110
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,245
Oh, no!

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,018
It's OI' Blue!

112
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,722
Oh, no!

113
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,117
Cheese it, boys!

114
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,902
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

115
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,674
Okay, Ralphie!

116
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,845
You win this time, but we'll be back!

117
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,258
<i>Adiós</i>, Bart.

118
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,624
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies!

119
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,037
And don't you forget it!

120
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,663
<i>Well, son, you saved us!</i>

121
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,766
<i>We were goners for sure!</i>
<i>And you saved us!</i>

122
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,616
Oldsmobile!

123
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,544
A pile of junk!

124
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,984
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

125
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:03,859
<i>Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.</i>
<i>My father was an Oldsmobile man.</i>

126
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,224
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the Equator!

127
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,263
- Little pitchers<i>...</i>
- Hold it!

128
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,174
It's a clinker!

129
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,114
That blasted, stupid furnace.

130
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,520
Dadgummit!

131
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,252
Damn skates!

132
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,362
For Christ's sake,
open up the damper, will you?

133
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,132
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?

134
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,130
Blasted!

135
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:02,516
<i>In the heat of battle,</i>
<i>my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...</i>

136
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:07,124
<i>that as far as we know is still hanging</i>
<i>in space over Lake Michigan.</i>

137
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,937
<i>Preparing to go to school</i>
<i>was like getting ready...</i>

138
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,474
<i>for extended deep-sea diving.</i>

139
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,864
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!

140
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,660
<i>My kid brother looked like</i>
<i>a tick about to pop.</i>

141
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,532
What?

142
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,568
What is it?

143
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,201
What is it?

144
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,478
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!

145
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,620
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

146
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,083
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

147
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,456
Wait up!

148
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,221
So what are you doing?

149
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,898
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?

150
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,535
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking...

151
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,004
your tongue to metal light poles
in winter...

152
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,474
and he says it will freeze right to the pole
just like I told you.

153
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,734
Baloney.

154
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,779
What would your old man know
about anything?

155
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,145
He knows because he once saw a guy
stick his tongue...

156
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,811
to a railroad track on a bet
and the fire department had to come...

157
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,754
to get the guy's tongue off the track
because he couldn't get it off.

158
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,586
Come on, guys, wait up!

159
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,148
Come on, guys!

160
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,857
Come on, guys, wait up!

161
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,500
I can't get up!

162
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,567
I can't get up!

163
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,571
Help!

164
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,272
I can't get out! Help me!

165
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,339
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

166
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,244
I can't get up!

167
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,515
Come on.

168
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,918
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

169
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,190
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

170
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,590
Come on, you're all right!

171
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,803
Miss Shields!

172
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,862
All right, everyone...

173
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,600
take your seats, please.

174
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,446
Good morning, class.

175
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,850
Good morning, Miss Shields.

176
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,089
Open your books to Page 32.

177
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,025
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner<i>...</i>

178
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,132
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

179
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,538
- Says who?
- Says me.

180
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,510
Well, I double-dare you.

181
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,173
<i>The exact exchange and nuance...</i>

182
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,773
<i>of phrase in this ritual is very important.</i>

183
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,579
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

184
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,655
That's dumb.

185
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,691
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

186
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,383
You're full of it.

187
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,054
Well, I double dog-dare you!

188
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,827
<i>Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.</i>

189
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,494
<i>What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?</i>

190
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,127
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>the coup de grâce of all dares...</i>

191
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,605
<i>the sinister triple dog-dare!</i>

192
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,768
I triple dog-dare you!

193
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,246
<i>Schwartz created</i>
<i>a slight breach of etiquette...</i>

194
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,976
<i>by skipping the triple-dare</i>
<i>and going right for the throat.</i>

195
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,382
All right, all right.

196
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,428
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!

197
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,160
<i>Flick's spine stiffened,</i>
<i>his lips curled in a defiant sneer.</i>

198
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,672
<i>There was no going back now.</i>

199
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,301
This is nothing.

200
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,308
Stuck? Stuck!

201
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,476
Stuck! Stuck!

202
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,483
Jeez!

203
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,059
It really works!

204
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,560
Look at him!

205
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,305
Ralphie, come back!

206
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,775
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!

207
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,403
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!

208
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,853
Where's Flick?

209
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,925
Has anyone seen Flick?

210
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,825
<i>Flick? Flick who?</i>

211
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,024
He was at recess, wasn't he?

212
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,159
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

213
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,210
I said has anyone seen Flick?

214
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,209
Yes, Esther Jane?

215
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,881
Oh, my God!

216
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,236
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

217
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,084
Wow, it's the cops!

218
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,603
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.

219
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,876
But, he has refused to say who.

220
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,115
But those who did it know their blame.

221
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,319
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

222
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,521
is far worse than any punishment
you might receive.

223
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,964
Now, don't you feel terrible?

224
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,907
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

225
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,076
That's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

226
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,576
<i>Adults love to say things like that.</i>
<i>But kids know better.</i>

227
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,489
<i>We knew darn well</i>
<i>it was always better not to get caught.</i>

228
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,857
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

229
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,758
I want you to write...

230
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,027
a theme.

231
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,936
'<i>'</i>What I want for Christmas.'<i>'</i>

232
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,798
<i>The clouds lifted.</i>

233
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,743
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning<i>...</i>

234
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,906
<i>I saw a faint gleam of light</i>
<i>at the other end of...</i>

235
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,847
<i>the black cave of doom.</i>

236
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,944
<i>I knew that when Miss Shields</i>
<i>read my magnificent, eloquent theme...</i>

237
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,820
<i>that she would sympathize</i>
<i>with my plight...</i>

238
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,088
<i>and everything would work out, somehow.</i>

239
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,911
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

240
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,710
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.

241
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,410
It just caught me off-guard.

242
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,112
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!

243
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,721
Baloney.

244
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,426
Scut Farkus!

245
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,632
<i>Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.</i>
<i>We were trapped.</i>

246
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,609
<i>There he stood, between us and the alley.</i>

247
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,737
<i>Scut Farkus, staring out at us</i>
<i>with his yellow eyes.</i>

248
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,312
<i>He had yellow eyes!</i>
<i>So help me God, yellow eyes.</i>

249
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,529
<i>Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.</i>

250
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,092
<i>Mean. Rotten.</i>

251
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,570
<i>His lips curled over his green teeth.</i>

252
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,073
<i>Randy lay there like a slug.</i>

253
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,201
<i>It was his only defense.</i>

254
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,176
- Say '<i>'</i>uncle.'<i>'</i>
- Uncle!

255
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,053
Louder!

256
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,897
<i>In our world, you were</i>
<i>either a bully, a toady...</i>

257
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,627
<i>or one of the nameless rabble of victims.</i>

258
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,894
All right.

259
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,660
Who's next?

260
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,825
<i>In the jungles of kid-dom,</i>
<i>the mind switches gears rapidly.</i>

261
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,725
<i>Weeks ago I had sent away</i>
<i>for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

262
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,826
<i>secret society decoder pen.</i>

263
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,070
<i>Oh, skunked again.</i>

264
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,766
<i>No matter. Today I had serious work to do.</i>

265
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,569
'<i>'</i>What I want for Christmas.'<i>'</i>

266
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,772
'<i>'</i>What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...

267
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,712
'<i>'</i>and this thing which tells time.'<i>'</i>

268
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,281
Wow, that's great.

269
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,376
'<i>'</i>I think that everybody should have
a Red Ryder BB gun.

270
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,352
'<i>'</i>They're very good for Christmas.

271
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,483
'<i>'</i>I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present.'<i>'</i>

272
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,786
<i>Oh, rarely had the words poured</i>
<i>from my penny pencil...</i>

273
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,661
<i>with such feverish fluidity.</i>

274
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,630
I've won! I've won!

275
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,079
<i>The Bumpus hounds.</i>

276
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,048
<i>Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,</i>
<i>had at least...</i>

277
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,987
<i>785 smelly hound dogs.</i>

278
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,358
<i>And they ignored every other human being</i>
<i>on earth but my old man.</i>

279
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,629
I won!

280
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,028
I won!

281
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,297
- What?
- A major prize!

282
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,532
I won!

283
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,367
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

284
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,641
<i>Tonight, he's coming tonight.</i>
<i>Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!</i>

285
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,375
What does this mean here?

286
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,245
It means it's coming tonight!

287
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,251
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

288
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,152
He said the telegram was late,
the prize was already there...

289
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,417
he was going to send it on tonight.

290
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,925
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

291
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:35,296
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral<i>...</i>

292
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,038
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

293
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,301
Or it could be a bowling alley.

294
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,071
A guy down in Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

295
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,942
How are they going to deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

296
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,782
They could send the deed,
for cripesake. I mean...

297
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,419
I didn't expect they were going
to send the whole damn bowling alley.

298
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,322
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.

299
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,322
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

300
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,397
<i>Every family has a kid who won't eat.</i>

301
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,799
<i>My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily</i>
<i>in over three years.</i>

302
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:23,012
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it!

303
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,249
Starving people would be happy
to have that.

304
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,349
Can I have some more red cabbage?

305
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,492
Stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

306
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,095
You better stop fooling around with it
and eat it or you'll be sorry.

307
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,839
Can I please have some more?

308
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,436
<i>My mother had not had a hot meal</i>
<i>for herself in 15 years.</i>

309
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,641
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

310
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,843
I hate meatloaf.

311
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,612
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

312
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,787
Where's my screwdriver
and plumber's helper?

313
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,225
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

314
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,554
<i>My mother was more subtle.</i>

315
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,362
How do the little piggies go?

316
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,501
That's right. Oink, oink.

317
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,902
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

318
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,974
Show me how the piggies eat.

319
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,210
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

320
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,203
Oh, my.

321
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,645
Mommy's little piggy.

322
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,397
It's here.

323
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:30,904
Are you Parker?

324
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,569
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?

325
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,906
I don't know.

326
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,638
What's in it?

327
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,580
Here. Bring it in.

328
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,050
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

329
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,611
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

330
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,814
That's right.

331
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,083
Right.

332
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,957
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.

333
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,155
A little more. Little more.

334
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,255
That's it.

335
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,730
Watch the lady.

336
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,140
Thanks a lot, guys.

337
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,545
Merry Christmas.

338
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,516
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.

339
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,111
'<i>'</i>Fra-gi-ley.'<i>'</i>

340
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,655
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says '<i>'</i>fragile.'<i>'</i>

341
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,484
Oh, yeah.

342
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,261
Here we go.

343
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,265
They did a job on this, you know?

344
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,842
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

345
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,313
There could be anything in there!

346
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,549
Jesus!

347
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,891
Maybe they forgot.

348
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,961
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

349
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,104
- Would you look at that?
- What?

350
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,539
Would you look at that?

351
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,635
What is it?

352
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,746
It's a leg!

353
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,342
But what is it?

354
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,685
Well, it's a leg.

355
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,419
You know, like in a statue.

356
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,979
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!

357
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,319
Yeah, statue!

358
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,050
Ralphie!

359
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,431
<i>My mother was trying to insinuate herself</i>
<i>between us and the statue.</i>

360
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,691
Holy smoke, would you<i>...</i>

361
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,736
Do you know what this is?

362
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,271
This is a lamp.

363
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,170
<i>It was indeed a lamp.</i>

364
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,109
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

365
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,976
I don't know.

366
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,509
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

367
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,284
<i>The old man's eyes boggled...</i>

368
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,012
<i>overcome by art.</i>

369
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,057
I know just the place for it.

370
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,117
Right in the middle
of our front room window!

371
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,778
Jesus, God.

372
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,050
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.

373
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,391
Let's see<i>...</i>

374
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:39,129
This goes to the radio
and this goes to the<i>...</i>

375
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,722
Well, it's just one too many.

376
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,693
Well, let's see.

377
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,003
<i>The snap of a few sparks,</i>
<i>a quick whiff of ozone...</i>

378
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,533
<i>and the lamp blazed forth</i>
<i>in unparalleled glory.</i>

379
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,270
Look at that! Will you look at that?

380
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,643
Isn't that glorious?

381
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,180
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

382
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:06,991
Turn off all the lights.

383
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,992
I wanna see what it looks like
from the street.

384
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,858
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?

385
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,748
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.

386
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,048
Just a little<i>...</i> More to the right.

387
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,116
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

388
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,491
Right there. That's wonderful.

389
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,255
Parker, what is that?

390
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,232
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?

391
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,096
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.

392
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,502
A major award?

393
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,100
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.

394
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,577
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.

395
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,908
I won it.

396
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,878
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,712
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

398
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,551
<i>The entire neighborhood was turned on.</i>

399
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,523
You should see what it looks like
from out here!

400
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,661
<i>It could be seen</i>
<i>up and down Cleveland Street.</i>

401
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,697
<i>The symbol of the old man's victory.</i>

402
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,992
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

403
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:25,558
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

404
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,570
<i>Holy smokes, it was 6:45.</i>

405
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,868
<i>Only one thing that</i>
<i>could've dragged me away...</i>

406
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,936
<i>from the soft glow of electric sex</i>
<i>gleaming in the window.</i>

407
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,657
<i>Kids, it's</i> Little Orphan Annie <i>time.</i>

408
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,390
<i>Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.</i>

409
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,329
<i>I could still taste it.</i>

410
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,865
Hey, you turned the light off!

411
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,989
<i>I knew I was handing Miss Shields</i>
<i>a masterpiece.</i>

412
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,758
<i>Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,</i>
<i>would excuse me from theme writing...</i>

413
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,387
<i>for the rest of my natural life.</i>

414
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,866
You call this a paragraph?

415
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:39,437
Margins! Margins! '<i>'</i>F'<i>'</i>!

416
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,176
My life's work down the drain.

417
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,980
A semicolon, you dolt!

418
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,142
A period.

419
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,214
'<i>'</i>F'<i>'</i>!

420
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:52,755
Oh, I should weep
if I have to read one more '<i>'</i>F'<i>'</i>!

421
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,950
Ralphie Parker.

422
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,237
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

423
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,270
Listen to this sentence.

424
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:21,050
'<i>'</i>A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass
in the stock...

425
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,016
'<i>'</i>and this thing which tells time.'<i>'</i>

426
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,319
Poetry.

427
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,859
Sheer poetry.

428
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,425
Ralph, an '<i>'</i>A+.'<i>'</i>

429
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,456
My Ralph!

430
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,702
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

431
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,037
'<i>'</i>A+'<i>'</i>!

432
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,968
Is there something you want, Ralph?

433
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,275
I'm just turning in my theme.

434
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,113
Well, you can take your seat now.

435
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,350
Take your seat.

436
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,471
Come on, you guys.

437
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,183
Get in the car. Get in the car.

438
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,250
If we don't hurry
we're going to miss all the good trees!

439
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,885
<i>My mother was about to make</i>
<i>another brilliant maneuver...</i>

440
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,963
<i>in the legendary battle of the lamp.</i>

441
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:18,933
<i>The epic struggle which followed lives</i>
<i>in the folklore of Cleveland Street...</i>

442
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,333
<i>to this very day.</i>

443
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,202
Don't want to waste electricity.

444
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,136
'<i>'</i>Don't want to waste electricity.'<i>'</i>

445
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

446
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,643
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.

447
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,985
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.

448
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,583
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.

449
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,053
This here tree is built to last.

450
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,959
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

451
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,362
Okay. Now here's a tree.

452
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,301
This here is a tree.

453
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,774
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.

454
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,572
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.

455
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,514
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

456
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,780
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?

457
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,154
Listen, Christmas only comes
once a year. Why not?

458
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,423
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2...

459
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,620
because I can see you're a man
who knows his trees.

460
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,096
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

461
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,894
No, that's them balsams.

462
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,697
<i>The old man loved bargaining</i>
<i>as much as an Arab trader...</i>

463
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>and he was twice as shrewd.</i>

464
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,972
You know, Dew Lock just bought
one of those brand new...

465
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,270
green plastic trees.

466
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,906
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

467
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,448
green pipe cleaners.

468
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,177
This is a very nice tree.

469
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,787
I'll throw in some rope
and tie it to your car for you.

470
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,322
You got a deal.

471
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,354
Deal.

472
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,939
Damn it. Blow out!

473
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,946
Not again.

474
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,590
Four minutes!

475
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,183
Time me.

476
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,159
<i>Actually, my old man loved it.</i>

477
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,562
<i>He always saw himself in the pits</i>
<i>at the Indianapolis Speedway...</i>

478
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,656
<i>in the 500.</i>

479
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,641
<i>My old man's spare tires</i>
<i>were actually only tires...</i>

480
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,903
<i>in the academic sense.</i>

481
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,671
<i>They were round.</i>
<i>They had once been made of rubber.</i>

482
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,212
Ralphie, why don't you
go help your father?

483
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,281
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.

484
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,758
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.

485
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,118
<i>It was the first time that</i>
<i>it had been suggested that...</i>

486
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,561
<i>I go help my father with anything.</i>

487
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,465
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.

488
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,666
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

489
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,840
Yeah, that's it.

490
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,841
Here. Hold this.

491
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,009
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

492
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,019
- How?
- Like this.

493
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,988
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

494
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:29,048
There's four of them. And we got it!

495
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,894
There it is.

496
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,327
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty<i>...</i>

497
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,564
There we go.

498
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,135
<i>For one brief moment</i>
<i>I saw all the bolts silhouetted...</i>

499
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,730
<i>against the lights of the traffic.</i>
<i>And then they were gone.</i>

500
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,605
Oh, fudge!

501
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,215
<i>Only I didn't say "fudge."</i>

502
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,148
<i>I said the word.</i>

503
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,583
<i>The big one.</i>
<i>The queen mother of dirty words.</i>

504
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,323
<i>The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.</i>

505
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,292
What did you say?

506
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,926
That's what I thought you said.

507
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,199
Get in the car.

508
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,130
Go on.

509
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,472
<i>It was all over. I was dead.</i>

510
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,338
<i>What would it be?</i>
<i>The guillotine? Hanging?</i>

511
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,314
<i>The chair? The rack?</i>
<i>The Chinese water torture?</i>

512
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,809
<i>Mere child's play</i>
<i>compared to what surely awaited me.</i>

513
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,920
Everything go all right?

514
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,335
Eight minutes.

515
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,977
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?

516
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,013
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

517
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,415
Ralphie!

518
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,425
<i>Over the years,</i>
<i>I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.</i>

519
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,725
<i>My personal preference is for Lux,</i>
<i>but I found Palmolive had a nice...</i>

520
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,991
<i>piquant, after-dinner flavor.</i>

521
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,593
<i>Heady, but with just a touch</i>
<i>of mellow smoothness.</i>

522
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,407
<i>Lifebuoy, on the other hand...</i>

523
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,276
You ready to tell me?

524
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,544
All right. Where did you hear that word?

525
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,622
<i>Now I had heard that word at least</i>
<i>10 times a day from my old man.</i>

526
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,089
<i>My father worked in profanity the way...</i>

527
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,627
<i>other artists might work in oils or clay.</i>

528
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,425
<i>It was his true medium. A master.</i>

529
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,899
<i>But I chickened out. And I blurted out...</i>

530
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,036
<i>the first name that came to mind.</i>

531
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,365
Schwartz!

532
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,665
I see.

533
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,920
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

534
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,914
Mrs. Schwartz,
do you know what Ralph just said?

535
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,695
No.

536
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,487
He said<i>...</i>

537
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,990
<i>Not that!</i>

538
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,463
Yes, that.

539
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,572
- Do you know where he heard it?
<i>- Probably from his father.</i>

540
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,163
No! He heard it from your son!

541
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,230
<i>What?</i>

542
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,579
<i>What'd I do, Mom?</i>

543
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,321
<i>Why? I didn't do nothing!</i>

544
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,023
<i>Another shot of mysterious,</i>
<i>inexorable, official justice.</i>

545
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:58,364
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!

546
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,470
Get right into bed,
and I don't want to see any lights on.

547
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,507
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading!

548
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,599
I'll come in, and if any lights are on<i>...</i>

549
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,611
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!

550
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,132
<i>Three blocks away,</i>
<i>Schwartz was getting his.</i>

551
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,173
<i>There has never been a kid</i>
<i>who didn't believe...</i>

552
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,243
<i>vaguely but insistently,</i>
<i>that he would be stricken blind...</i>

553
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:46,213
<i>before he reached 21.</i>
<i>And then they'd be sorry.</i>

554
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,791
Why, it's Ralph!

555
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,894
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?

556
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,236
Why, he's carrying a cane!

557
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,796
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

558
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,739
Why, he's blind!

559
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,641
Blind? Oh, my God!

560
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,442
Ralph, is it something we did?

561
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,383
What brought you to this lonely state?

562
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,622
Ralph, please tell us no matter
how it hurts. What did we do?

563
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,254
Look, I can't.

564
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,226
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

565
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,362
What brought you to this?

566
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,034
Soap poisoning.

567
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,244
Oh, how could we do it?

568
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,978
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

569
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,390
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.

570
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,152
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

571
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,026
I feel awful!

572
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:32,919
Thank you, Heather.

573
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,787
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:36,388
Thank you, Flick.

575
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,584
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

576
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,680
I just thought that you'd be getting tired
of the same old stuff.

577
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,055
<i>Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.</i>

578
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,653
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

579
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,898
Merry Christmas.

580
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,901
Happy New Year.

581
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

582
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,462
<i>The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine,</i>
<i>in order to get...</i>

583
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:59,008
<i>the Ovaltine inner seal to send off</i>
<i>for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

584
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,603
<i>secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.</i>

I got it. '<i>'</i>Master Ralph Parker.'<i>'</i>

586
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,878
My decoder pen!

587
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,723
All right!

596
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,558

The Black Pirate Ship<i>. Now it's time...</i>

599
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:59,460
<i>for Annie's secret message</i>
<i>for you members of the secret circle.</i>

600
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,330
<i>Remember, kids, only members of...</i>

601
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,467
<i>Annie's secret circle</i>
<i>can decode Annie's secret message.</i>

602
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,771
<i>Remember, Annie is depending on you.</i>

603
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,875
<i>Set your pins to B-2.</i>

604
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,377
<i>Here is the message.</i>

605
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,017
<i>12. 1 1. 2...</i>

606
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,555
<i>I am in my first secret meeting.</i>

607
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,387

<i>16. 23...</i>

609
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,989
<i>Pierre was in great voice tonight.</i>

610
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,829
<i>I could tell that tonight's message</i>
<i>was really important.</i>

611
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,291
<i>... 3. 25.</i>

612
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:35,565
<i>That's a message from Annie herself.</i>
<i>Remember, don't tell anyone.</i>

613
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,345
<i>Ninety seconds later</i>
<i>I'm in the only room in the house...</i>

614
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,711
<i>where a boy of nine can sit in privacy</i>
<i>and decode.</i>

615
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,778
<i>Ah! "B." I went to the next.</i>

616
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,416
<i>"E." The first word is "be"!</i>

617
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,985
<i>"S." It was coming easier now. "U."</i>

618
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,390
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

619
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,795
I'll be right down, Ma.

620
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,300
Gee whiz.

621
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,898
'<i>'</i>T. O.'<i>'</i>

622
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,342
<i>"Be sure to." Be sure to what?</i>

623
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,174
<i>What was Little Orphan Annie</i>
<i>trying to say? Be sure to what?</i>

624
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,373
Ralphie! Randy has got to go!
Will you please come out?

625
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,180
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

626
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,020
<i>I was getting closer now.</i>

627
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:28,091
<i>The tension was terrible. What was it?</i>

628
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,388
<i>The fate of the planet</i>
<i>may hang in the balance.</i>

629
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,986
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

630
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,558
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

631
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,663
<i>Almost there! My fingers flew.</i>

632
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,431
<i>My mind was a steel trap.</i>

633
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,937
<i>Every pore vibrated.</i>

634
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,001
<i>It was almost clear.</i>

635
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,199
<i>Yes!</i>

636
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,611
Ovaltine?

637
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,084
A crummy commercial?

638
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,250
Son of a bitch!

639
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,987
<i>I went out to face the world again.</i>

640
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,565
<i>Wiser.</i>

641
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,980
Red cabbage?

642
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,017
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

643
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,921
You filthy system!

644
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,649
I hate it!

645
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,452
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

646
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:49,537
<i>What happened next</i>
<i>was a family controversy for years.</i>

647
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,582
What was that? What happened?

648
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,261
What happened?

649
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,520
What broke?

650
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,562
I don't know what happened.

651
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,898
I was watering my plant and...

652
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,967
I broke your lamp.

653
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,816
Don't you touch that!

654
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,951
You were always jealous of this lamp.

655
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,160
Jealous of a plastic leg?

656
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,422
Jealous!

657
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,826
Jealous because I won.

658
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,224
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

659
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,495
Jealous of what?

660
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,035
That is...

661
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:00,065
the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!

662
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,001
<i>Now it was out.</i>

663
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,709
Get the glue.

664
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,545
We're out of glue.

665
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:13,186
You used up all the glue on purpose!

666
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,425
<i>The old man stood quivering with fury...</i>

667
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,961
<i>stammering as he tried</i>
<i>to come up with a real crusher.</i>

668
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,625
<i>All he got out was:</i>

669
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,995
Not a finger!

670
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,970
<i>With as much dignity as he could muster...</i>

671
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,636
<i>the old man gathered up the sad remains...</i>

672
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,270
<i>of his shattered major award.</i>

673
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,946
<i>Later that night, alone in the backyard...</i>

674
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,183
<i>he buried it next to the garage.</i>

675
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,448
<i>Now I could never be sure...</i>

676
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,518
<i>but I thought that I heard</i>
<i>the sound of taps being played...</i>

677
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,089
<i>gently.</i>

678
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,224
Know what I'm getting my old man
for Christmas?

679
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,094
- What?
- A rose that squirts.

680
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,224
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

681
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,928
- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
- A Flit gun?

682
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,435
Stop right there!

683
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:43,579
<i>Ordinarily, if Dill so much as</i>
<i>said "hi" to you, you felt great...</i>

684
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,607
<i>warm inside.</i>
<i>But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.</i>

685
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,546
I can't now, Grover.
I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

686
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:53,788
Hey, come here! Get over here!

687
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,158
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

688
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,593
You! Come here!

689
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,556
Who, me?

690
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,697
- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!

691
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,891
<i>I left Flick to certain annihilation.</i>

692
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,427
<i>But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.</i>

693
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,874
Uncle! Uncle!

694
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,870
All right, class.

695
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,909
I have your Christmas themes for you.

696
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,316
I'm pleased.

697
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,115
In general, you did very well.

698
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,819
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

699
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,057
<i>This is it.</i>

700
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,630
<i>"C</i>+<i>"? No, it can't be.</i>

701
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,470
C+?

702
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,664
C+!

703
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,677
<i>Oh, no!</i>

704
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,512
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out"?</i>

705
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,823
<i>My mother</i>
<i>must have gotten to Miss Shields.</i>

706
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,582
<i>There could be no other explanation.</i>

707
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,989
You'll shoot your eye out.
You'll shoot your eye out.

708
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:13,297
<i>Was there no end to this conspiracy</i>
<i>of irrational prejudice...</i>

709
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,668
<i>against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?</i>

710
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:20,070
These multiplication questions
were most missed in our last math test.

711
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,734
Would you answer in unison, please?

712
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,946
<i>I was surrounded by happier kids</i>
<i>who were all going to get...</i>

713
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,606
<i>what they wanted for Christmas.</i>

714
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,211
...fifty-six.

715
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,406
Hey, four-eyes!

716
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,043
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

717
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,711
Maybe you'd like another one!

718
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,250
Listen, jerk.

719
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,794
When I tell you to come, you better come!

720
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,468
What? Are you going to cry now?

721
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:23,435
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

722
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,297
Cry!

723
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,239
<i>Deep in the recesses of my brain...</i>

724
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,744
<i>a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.</i>

725
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,620
<i>Something had happened.</i>

726
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,788
<i>A fuse blew</i>
<i>and I had gone out of my skull.</i>

727
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,342
I'm telling my dad!

728
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,838
Hey, Ralphie!

729
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,815
Beat him up! Beat him up!

730
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,568
Did you hear what he said?

731
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,612
<i>I have since heard of people under...</i>

732
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:41,377
<i>extreme duress speaking</i>
<i>in strange tongues.</i>

733
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,142
<i>I became conscious</i>
<i>that a steady torrent of obscenities...</i>

734
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:49,621
<i>and swearing of all kinds</i>
<i>was pouring out of me as I screamed.</i>

735
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,026
Ralphie!

736
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,785
We're going home. Come on.

737
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,876
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

738
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,814
Put your head down in here.

739
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,411
Come on, get down in here.

740
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,078
Settle down.

741
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:58,121
I want you to go in there
and lie down in your room for a while.

742
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,355
Ralphie, just settle down.

743
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,831
Here, dry off.

744
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,038
All right, calm down.

745
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,606
All right. Now go lie down.

746
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,921
<i>The light was getting purple</i>
<i>and soft outside.</i>

747
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,896
<i>Almost time for my father</i>
<i>to come home from work.</i>

748
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,878
What's the matter? What you crying for?

749
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,290
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

750
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,359
No, he's not.

751
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,859
Yes, he is, too.

752
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,520
No, he's not.

753
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,828
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

754
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,226
Why don't you come on out of there?

755
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,967
Would you like some milk?

756
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,572
You would?

757
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:30,412
Here you go.

758
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,778
All right?

759
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,219
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

760
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,201
<i>I heard the car roar up the driveway,</i>
<i>and a wave of terror broke over me.</i>

761
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,468
<i>He'll know what I said,</i>
<i>the awful things that I said.</i>

762
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,509
Get out of here!

763
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:01,446
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy<i>...</i>

764
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,446
Hey, Bumpus!

765
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,986
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

766
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,149
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.

767
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,673
Well, what happened today?

768
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,712
Where's your glasses?

769
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,812
Did you lose your glasses again?

770
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,118
Ralphie.

771
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,548
Remember, you left these
on the radio again.

772
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,624
Now try not to do that anymore.

773
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,219
So what else happened today?

774
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,130
Nothing much.

775
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,664
Ralphie had a fight.

776
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,230
A fight?

777
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,767
What kind of a fight?

778
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,265
You know how boys are.

779
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,810
I gave him a talking to.

780
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:07,580
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

781
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,214
Oh, yeah.

782
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,411
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

783
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,622
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

784
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:21,185
<i>I slowly began to realize</i>
<i>I was not about to be destroyed.</i>

785
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,031
The Chicago Bears.

786
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,123
The terror of the midway.

787
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,594
<i>From then on, things were different</i>
<i>between me and my mother.</i>

788
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,934
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

789
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,237
But Bears, never.

790
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,203
<i>Strange.</i>

791
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:43,213
<i>Even something as monumental</i>
<i>as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...</i>

792
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,976
<i>as it came to be known...</i>

793
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,748
<i>was pushed out of my mind</i>
<i>as I struggled for a way out...</i>

794
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,657
<i>of the impenetrable BB gun web...</i>

795
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,785
<i>in which my mother had me trapped.</i>

796
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,221
Santa!

797
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,660
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

798
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,027
<i>Of course! Santa.</i>

799
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,394
<i>The big man. The head honcho.</i>

800
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:02,865
<i>The connection.</i>

801
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,733
<i>My mother had slipped up this time.</i>

802
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,524
Mickey!

803
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,142
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

804
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,245
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!

805
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,333
Mom, this is just
the same old dumb parade as last year.

806
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,631
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom...

807
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,665
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!

808
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,079
There he is!

809
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,311
Santa!

810
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,117
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

811
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,095
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.

812
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,427
Come on, Ralphie.

813
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,172
Merry Christmas!

814
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,250
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

815
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,561
Ralphie, look over there.

816
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,661
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

817
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,605
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?

818
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,837
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.

819
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,506
Come on.

820
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,116
Let's go.

821
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,647
Young man.

822
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:33,948
Hey, kid.

823
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,884
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.

824
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,526
The line ends here. It begins there.

825
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,659
Merry Christmas!

826
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,960
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

827
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,308
Come on.

828
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:03,015
<i>The line waiting to see Santa stretched</i>
<i>all the way back to Terre Haute!</i>

829
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,552
<i>And I was at the end of it.</i>

830
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,949
I like Santa.

831
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,525
<i>Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.</i>

832
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,627
<i>Moments before zero hour,</i>
<i>it did not pay to take chances.</i>

833
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:26,701
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

834
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,002
My pretty<i>...</i>

835
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,373
What a tasty little boy.

836
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,550
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

837
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,083
I like <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

838
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,296
I like the Tin Man.

839
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:56,597
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute
past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

840
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,299
Come on up on Santa's lap.

841
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:04,846
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?

842
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,036
Billy.

843
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,309
Come on, Randy.

844
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:12,081
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?

845
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,122
Get him off my lap.

846
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,053
Quick, get me a towel.

847
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,892
I hate the smell of tapioca.

848
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,872
<i>Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00</i>
<i>and our store is closing.</i>

849
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,208
<i>9:00! Great Scott!</i>
<i>The store is gonna close!</i>

850
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,838
Santa can't wait all night.

851
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,507
Come on up on Santa's lap.

852
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,418
Get moving, kid.

853
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,456
Quit dragging your feet.

854
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,134
Get him out of here.

855
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,618
Come on, kid.

856
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,187
Come on up.

857
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:44,035
And what's your name, little boy?

858
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,616
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

859
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:55,317
Listen, little boy, we got
a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

860
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,495
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

861
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,956
<i>My mind had gone blank.</i>

862
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,328
<i>Frantically I tried to remember</i>
<i>what it was I wanted.</i>

863
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,959
<i>I was blowing it, blowing it.</i>

864
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,065
How about a nice football?

865
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,201
<i>Football. What's a football?</i>

866
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,039
<i>Without conscious will,</i>
<i>my voice squeaked out:</i>

867
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,376
Football.

868
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,508
Okay, get him out of here.

869
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,385
<i>A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?</i>

870
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,821
<i>Wake up, stupid, wake up!</i>

871
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,726
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine-action 200-shot...

872
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:40,893
range model air rifle.

873
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,667
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

874
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,205
Merry Christmas.

875
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,723
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

876
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,271
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

877
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,273
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

878
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:23,106
Did he ask you if you'd been
a good boy all year?

879
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:24,240
No.

880
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,207
Don't worry, he knows.

881
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,440
He always knows.

882
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,849
Merry Christmas.

883
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,123
Okay, down you go.

884
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,554
Bye, Chris.

885
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,203
That's fine.

886
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,568
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

887
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,106
Well, the green string is out.

888
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,478
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

889
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,843
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

890
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,112
I'm not color blind.

891
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,378
I'm not color blind, either.

892
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,550
There, see, I told you it was green.

893
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,191
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

894
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,066
Hold it right there!

895
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,466
A fuse is out.

896
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,668
<i>The old man could replace fuses</i>
<i>quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.</i>

897
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,369
<i>He bought them by the gross.</i>

898
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,012
Oh, Ralph.

899
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,684
My, isn't that pretty?

900
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,151
That son of a gun.

901
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,318
Yeah. No.

902
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,120
That star is crooked.

903
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,328
That star is perfectly straight.

904
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,925
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.

905
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:57,764
It's just<i>...</i> Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.

906
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,370
Perfect.

907
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,081
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

908
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,143
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up
this house...

909
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,247
just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

910
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,985
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

911
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,585
a little while ago,
going up the other side of the street.

912
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,994
All right, you two, upstairs.

913
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,158
Go on the double, on the double.

914
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:38,771
Okay, let's get them.

915
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,203
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

916
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,016
<i>Santa Claus had come!</i>

917
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,791
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

918
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,595
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

919
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,157
What's in here?

920
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,527
It's hard.

921
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,931
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

922
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,313
Does this raise?

923
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,727
Merry Christmas.

924
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,534
Merry Christmas, you two.

925
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:46,034
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

926
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,535
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.

927
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,511
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

928
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,007
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

929
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,217
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?

930
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:58,816
Well, give Randy a present.

931
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:03,085
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you
right over there.

932
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,625
She always sends you
such wonderful presents.

933
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:08,690
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

934
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,075
<i>Christmas had come. Officially.</i>
<i>We plunged into the cornucopia...</i>

935
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:34,020
<i>quivering with desire</i>
<i>and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.</i>

936
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,589
Didn't I get a tie this year?

937
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,030
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.

938
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,998
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

939
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:56,041
I don't want to.

940
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,079
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

941
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,848
<i>Aunt Clara had for years labored</i>
<i>under the delusion that...</i>

942
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:07,446
<i>I was not only perpetually four years old,</i>
<i>but also a girl.</i>

943
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:11,824
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

944
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,129
Oh, isn't that sweet?

945
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:22,366
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...
- I don't want to!

946
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,871
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present!

947
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,340
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.

948
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:40,182
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.

949
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,882
Now, let me see what can I find.

950
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:45,651
I see something! Randy.

951
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,657
This is for you, honey.

952
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,464
And this is for Daddy.

953
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:54,096
Here.

954
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,034
From me to you.

955
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,137
Thanks a lot.

956
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,772
I wonder what it could be?

957
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,771
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

958
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,244
Well, it's a blue ball!

959
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,682
It's a bowling ball.

960
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,951
Thank you, darling.

961
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,185
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.

962
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:19,792
Ralphie.

963
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,020
We're waiting.

964
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,755
Oh, come on, Mom.

965
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,860
Right now!

966
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:39,573
<i>lmmediately my feet began to sweat</i>
<i>as those two fluffy little bunnies...</i>

967
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:43,015
<i>with the blue button eyes</i>
<i>stared sappily up at me.</i>

968
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,448
Come down here so I can see you better.

969
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,086
<i>I just hoped Flick would never spot them...</i>

970
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,523
<i>as the word of this humiliation</i>
<i>could easily make life...</i>

971
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,427
<i>at Warren G. Harding School</i>
<i>a veritable hell.</i>

972
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:58,855
Isn't that cute?

973
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:03,163
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

974
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:04,870
Shut up, Randy.

975
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,967
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

976
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,873
- He does not!
- He does, too.

977
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,642
He looks like a pink nightmare.

978
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,307
Are you happy wearing that?

979
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,640
Do you want to take it off?

980
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,081
You tell the kid to take it off.

981
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:22,123
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

982
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,851
Take it off!

983
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,362
My God, will you look at that mess?

984
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,199
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.

985
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,934
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.

986
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,408
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but<i>...</i>

987
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,036
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.

988
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,606
Did you have a nice Christmas?

989
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:48,316
Yeah, pretty nice.

990
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,883
Did you get everything you wanted?

991
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,514
- Well, almost.
- Almost?

992
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,249
Well, that's life.

993
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,619
Well, there's always next Christmas.

994
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,227
That's funny.

995
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,928
What's that over there behind the desk?

996
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:06,899
Where?

997
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,799
Behind the desk,
against the wall over there.

998
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,971
Why don't you go check it out?

999
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,955
What did we put over there, honey?

1000
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,520
Santa Claus probably put it.

1001
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,233
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.</i>
<i>I could hardly wait to try it out.</i>

1002
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,665
Do you know how to load it?

1003
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,371
That's right.

1004
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:30,949
Be careful.

1005
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,852
Don't. They run all over.

1006
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:40,956
Close her up. Close it up.

1007
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,726
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1008
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,300
- Sure.
- Okay.

1009
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:47,894
But outside.

1010
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,868
I still say those things are dangerous.

1011
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,967
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.

1012
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,347
I had one when I was eight years old.

1013
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:03,474
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!

1014
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:08,688
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1015
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,283
Be careful, Ralphie!

1016
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:16,055
<i>Now it is well known throughout</i>
<i>the Midwest that the old man...</i>

1017
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,996
<i>is a turkey junkie.</i>

1018
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:23,167
<i>A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.</i>
<i>A few days before Christmas...</i>

1019
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:27,401
<i>his eyes would begin to gleam</i>
<i>with a wild and ravenous light.</i>

1020
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:35,679
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1021
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,598
<i>Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!</i>

1022
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,324
<i>You'll shoot your eye out, kid.</i>

1023
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:58,068
<i>You'll shoot your eye out,</i>
<i>you'll shoot your eye out!</i>

1024
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:02,204
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!

1025
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,336
<i>She hadn't seen! She didn't know!</i>

1026
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,574
<i>My eye's all right.</i>
<i>The BB must've hit my glasses.</i>

1027
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,679
<i>My glasses! Oh, no!</i>

1028
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,413
<i>Where are my glasses?</i>

1029
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,819
<i>Few things brought such swift</i>
<i>and terrible retribution...</i>

1030
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,894
<i>on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!</i>

1031
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,494
Stop!

1032
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:39,179
Oh, no!

1033
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,913
<i>Oh, no! Pulverized.</i>

1034
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:59,961
<i>For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.</i>
<i>They'll never know the lens is gone!</i>

1035
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,470
<i>Randomly, my mind evolved</i>
<i>a spectacular plot.</i>

1036
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,834
<i>Let's see, an icicle!</i>

1037
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,542
<i>Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!</i>

1038
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:15,077
<i>It would work. It had to work.</i>
<i>Quickly, I whipped up some tears.</i>

1039
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,120
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?

1040
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,420
What happened? Let me see that.

1041
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:29,259
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1042
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:36,866
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1043
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,532
Wake up, Randy.

1044
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,646
Oh, God.

1045
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:51,877
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1046
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:56,084
And I tried to get out of the way, but I<i>...</i>

1047
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:01,928
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1048
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:03,958
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1049
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,159
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

1050
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:15,808
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.

1051
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,773
You stay away from that turkey!
It's got an hour to cook.

1052
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,040
You'll get worms!

1053
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,710
But what about my glasses?

1054
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,620
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them...

1055
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:31,522
until we get you some new ones.

1056
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,262
<i>I had pulled it off!</i>

1057
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,530
But I left my gun outside.

1058
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:43,702
When you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun.

1059
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,270
Hold that on there.

1060
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,365
<i>Life is like that.</i>

1061
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:52,779
<i>Sometimes at the height of our reveries,</i>
<i>when our joy is at its zenith...</i>

1062
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,782
<i>when all is most right with the world...</i>

1063
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:59,250
<i>the most unthinkable disasters</i>
<i>descend upon us.</i>

1064
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:16,260
Oh, turkey!

1065
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,316
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1066
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:53,132
<i>The heavenly aroma still hung heavy</i>
<i>in the house. But it was gone.</i>

1067
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:56,300
<i>All gone. No turkey.</i>
<i>No turkey sandwiches.</i>

1068
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,404
<i>No turkey salad. No turkey gravy,</i>
<i>turkey hash, turkey à la king...</i>

1069
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,812
<i>or gallons of turkey soup.</i>

1070
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:02,611
<i>Gone.</i>

1071
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:03,946
<i>All gone.</i>

1072
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,579
All right.

1073
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:10,956
Everybody upstairs.

1074
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,489
Get dressed.

1075
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:16,152
We are going out to eat.

1076
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:44,915
No! Not, '<i>'</i>ra ra ra ra ra.'<i>'</i> '<i>'</i>La la la la la.'<i>'</i>

1077
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,122
Sing like this:

1078
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,059
Try again.

1079
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,274
Stop!

1080
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,812
Sing something else.

1081
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,456
No!

1082
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:25,624
Stop!

1083
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,765
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1084
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:39,243
Oh, I'm sorry.

1085
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,744
It's a beautiful duck.

1086
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,813
It really is.

1087
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,248
But you see<i>...</i>

1088
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:51,554
What?

1089
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,594
It's smiling at me.

1090
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,259
Okay?

1091
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:03,102
Beautiful!

1092
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,666
<i>That Christmas would live</i>
<i>in our memories...</i>

1093
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:12,212
<i>as the Christmas when</i>
<i>we were introduced to Chinese turkey.</i>

1094
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,639
<i>All was right with the world.</i>

1095
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:38,902
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1096
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,709
Is that beautiful!

1097
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:31,921
<i>Next to me in the blackness</i>
<i>lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.</i>

1098
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:35,025
<i>The greatest Christmas gift</i>
<i>I had ever received...</i>

1099
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:36,562
<i>or would ever receive.</i>

1100
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:41,395
<i>Gradually, I drifted off to sleep,</i>
<i>pranging ducks on the wing...</i>

1101
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:43,994
<i>and getting off spectacular hip shots.</i>

1102
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:18,688
