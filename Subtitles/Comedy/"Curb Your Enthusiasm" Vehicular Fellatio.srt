I am so sorry that you had to
make such a long trek up here.

18
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,647
I'm sitting here suffering with
cancer and you had to walk up

<i>Some little stairs.
Sorry about that, l.D.</i>

20
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,052
- What was you doing, anyway?
- I actually was opening up

21
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,555
One of those vacuum-Sealed
packaging and i cut myself on it.

22
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,991

got me this gps--

23

Look at this.  Look at this.
I can't open those packages.

24
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,930
- Bam!  There it is.
- Why would you manufacture a product that you can't open?

25
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,633
L.D., i've got an
appointment tomorrow at noon

26

But how does it affect your driving?

38
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,362
I don't think the doctor
would want me to drive,

39
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,597
So i would prefer for you to take me.

40
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,299
The doctor didn't say
anything about driving.

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,701
- L.D., i have an appointment at noon.
- Should we call the doctor

42
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,770
And maybe ask about the driving?

43
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,972
- Just to-- - L.D., do
you know what it feels like

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,908
- To have cancer?
- I know wt it feels like

45
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,144
<i>To be with someone who has cancer.</i>

46
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,746
Ooh, so that's why you
should have compassion

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,514
And tomorrow at noon
take me to my appointment.

48
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,950

Trying to, you know-- Maybe you
could give him a call on his birthday?

66
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,365
- He's a big "seinfeld" fan?
- Big "seinfeld" fan!

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,133
- Fucking loves the show, man.
- Wow.

68
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,868
Got a fine-Ass wife.
Wife fine as hell--

69
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,804
I don't know why the guy so
depressed with a wife that damn fine.

70
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,039
- Really?  Really?
- Sick fine.  I'm talking sick fine.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,507
- Gorgeous?
- Sick meaning "good."

72
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,509
- I got it.  Yeah.  Yeah.
- You get that shit, right?

73
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,144
I've never seen the damn show myself,

74
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,946
But he fricking swears by it.

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,816
- Well... all right, fine.
- You'll give him a call?

76
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,617
- I'll call him later. - If you
can give him a fucking call--

77
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,252
Leave the phone number on my dresser.

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,355
I'll leave the number for you.
He's gonna fucking flip out,

79
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,523
Him and his fine-Ass fucking wife.

80
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,995
Well, my next guest
is, to say the least,

81
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,631
A maverick in the field
of cancer treatment.

82
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,068
Her newest book is titled
"walking out on cancer."

83
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,537
Please say hello to dr. Karen trundle.

84
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,007
<i>- ( Tv audience applauds )
- Dr. Phil: now, dr. Trundle,</i>

85
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,609
<i>How does somebody walk out on cancer?</i>

86
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,813
<i>Trundle: i do believe that a
patient's personal relationships</i>

87
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,982
Can contribute to their cancer,

88
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,786
Just like living next to a toxic
waste dump can actually cause cancer.

89
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,955
<i>If i determine that a patient of mine</i>

90
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,758
<i>Is in a toxic relationship
with their spouse,</i>

91
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,694
I will counsel them
to leave that spouse.

92
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,597
When we're talking about a toxic spouse,

93
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,732
We're talking about what?

94
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,035
Well, someone who is impatient,

95
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,836
<i>Someone who's obnoxious,</i>

96
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,272
<i>Someone who is petty and argumentative,</i>

97
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,741
<i>And obsesses over meaningless details</i>

98
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,044
<i>At the expense of a
harmonious relationship.</i>

99
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,147
Okay, so you're telling me
if you met with a new patient

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,817
And you saw that they were
married to a person like that--

101
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,688
I would counsel them to
leave and to never look back.

102
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,124
<i>( Dr. Phil chuckles ) and that's
how they walk out on cancer?</i>

103
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,060
<i>We've got a couple of
your patients here--</i>

104
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,129
Drink it up. You're doing great.

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,534
Attagirl! Good job!  Good job!

106
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,102
- Thanks, l.D.
- Good job.

107
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,172
Hey, i heard about this great doctor

108
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,209
And i took the liberty of
making an appointment for you--

109
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,545
For us, actually,
because i have to go too.

110
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,580
So what wrong with the doctor i've got?

111
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,149
The doctor you have is perfectly fine

112
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,851
But get a second opinion.

113
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,455
- Where'd you find out about this doctor?
- A friend of mine.

114
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,723
<i>- A friend of
yours? - Mm-Hmm.</i>

115
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,491
<i>- Who?
- Phil.</i>

116
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,627
- Phil who?
- Phil kreel...ton.

117
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,897
<i>Okay, all right. Second opinion.</i>

118
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,366
I'm gonna trust you on this one, l.D.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,134
<i>I've got a very good
feeling about this doctor,</i>

120
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,903
And when i get a feeling...

121
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,973
<i>- you've got a feeling.
- ...i get a feeling.</i>

122
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,776
Thanks for the look out, l.D.

<i>Larry-- Oh,

127
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,961
I'm a friend of leon's. He
told me to give you a call.

128
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,430
<i>- He said it was your birthday.
- Oh, man!</i>

129
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,565
<i>I can believe you're calling me.</i>

130

<i>- Happy birthday, alton.
- That's amazing.</i>

131
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,437
<i>Man, "seinfeld" is one of my
favorite shows of all time.</i>

132

Oh, great. Anyway, so happy birthday.

133
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,278
<i>- Thank you.
- And, you know, leon said you were a little depressed.</i>

134
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,281
<i>- Yeah.
- Although then he said your wife was beautiful,</i>

135
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,517
So i don't know what you have
to be depressed about, really.

136
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,119
<i>What-- What do you
mean about my wife?</i>

137
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,322
<i>- What? - My w-- Why is 
he talking about my wife?</i>

138
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,559
He's not talking about your wife.
 He just said she was beautiful.

139
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,327
<i>Yeah, okay.  Well, i
know she's beautiful</i>

140
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,263
<i>But why is leon telling you
that my wife is beautiful?</i>

141
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,231
<i>- He's complimenting her.
- That's not a compliment!</i>

142
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,267
<i>That's like another man
looking at another man's woman.</i>

143
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,903
<i>- He didn't say she was ugly.
- I knew it was like that!</i>

144
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,771
<i>I've seen them together
at the house talking,</i>

145

<i>- Always laughing.  I knew it!
- All right, you know what?</i>

<i>- I'm gonna take off.
- Yo, is he there?!</i>

<i>- Anyway, it's great talking to you.
- Put him on the phone!</i>

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,895
- Really?
- More dangerous than cell phones in my opinion.

166
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,464
- What about handjobs?
- Any kind of job is dangerous.

167
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,899
It has to affect the
driver. I can't deny it.

168
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,734
I think it should be illegal, frankly.

169
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,102
By the way, why do they call it a job?

170
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,705
Is it so hard? Is it a lot of work?

171
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,640
- Well, tugging, sucking.
- Tugging.

172
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,043
It's a lot of work. I
wouldn't want to do it.

173
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,312
It is a job.  No wonder
why they don't like it.

174
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,281
Oh, look who finally comes over.

175
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,949
- Hey.  Hello.
- Hi.  Beverly.

176
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,551
Hi.  Larry.  Hi.

177
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,253
Where have you guys been, huh?

178
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,121
- Huh?  Oh, you know-- -
Just talking, catching up.

179
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,090
- We're sitting here for like an hour...
- Yeah, sorry.

180
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,892
- ...There's no bread, the service sucks.
- No bread.

181
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,927
Don't you guys want a drink?  No drinks.

182
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,863
I'd love a drink. What-- What
is that? That looks interesting.

183
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,367
- That drink. - Mmm mmm
mmm-- Pomegranate surprise.

184
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,202
- Pomegranate juice,
blueberry juice. - Uh-Huh.

185
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,338
Here, have a try.

186
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,407
You're gonna love it--
Antioxidants, tequila.

187
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,910
It's fabulous.  Mmm.

188
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,779
<i>- Mmm mmm.
- Lewis: look at  the salt on that rim.</i>

189
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,615
- Here.  Come on, give it a try.
- No no.  No, thanks.

190
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,084
- I think you'll like it
- I don't think so. Thank you.

191
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,286
- Take a little sip.
- No!  No.

192
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,322
I don't like to take sips.

193
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,224
I don't. I don't take bites either.

194
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,926
No bites, no sips.  Yeah.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,295
<i>- Oh, hey, bread.  Fabulous.
- Susie: finally.</i>

196
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,763
- Look at this.
- About time.

197
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,598
I'm starving.

198
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,835
<i>Susie: thank you, lar. Very nice of you.</i>

199
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,370
A pleasure.  Pleasure.

200
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,338
- I've got the next one, buddy.
- Do you?

201
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,973
You going to michael york's party?

202
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,676
Michael york's party. You know,
i really love michael york,

203
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,113
But the guy-- He lives in the
boondocks. I'll never find the place.

204
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,048
What about that nav system we gave you?

205
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,783
Great gift, and thank you so much.

206
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,685
I couldn't open-- I
couldn't open the package.

207
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,521
<i>- Susie: what do you mean? - It
comes-- It's entombed in this plastic.</i>

208
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,923
I was stabbing it with
a knife. It's impossible.

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,625
There's a tab. You pull the tab.

210
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,694
- No, there was no tab, susie.
- No perforation?

211
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,531
- No, no perforation-- Nothing.
- Just get an x-Acto knife

212
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,099
- Or a box cutter, okay?
- There you go.

213
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,068
<i>- A box cutter?
- Jeff: yes.</i>

214
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,704
Who am i, mohamed atta?
I gotta buy a box cutter?

215
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,074
- I mean it's crazy.
- We're late.  We're gonna go see "last tango in paris,"

216
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,810
- My favorite film, for the hundredth time.
- Oh my, "last tango in paris."

217
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,211
What a piece of crap.

218
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,047
( Mimics brando )
"put butter up my ass."

219
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,715
I mean, is that supposed to be a movie?

220
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,984
Pretention masquerading as art--
That's what you've got there.

221
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,654
You know nothing about foreign films
or anything. It's all about you.

222
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,756
- We've gotta go. We're gonna miss the film.
- Have you seen it?

223
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,459
- Susie, nice to meet you.
- Bye, beverly.  You too.

224
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,362
- Oh, larry.
- Ah!

225
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,532
What's the problem with you?

226
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,600
- What?
- Since you arrived,

227
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,336
<i>You've just been... weird.</i>

228
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,005
- What?  No. - Yeah, i was just
so looking forward to meeting--

229
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,674
- Oh! - I-I'm--
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,211
Holy
sh--

231
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,347
What the fuck did you do?

232
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,415
She wanted you to have a little
drink. You wouldn't take it.

233
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,018
She wanted to kiss you goodbye
like an aunt in brooklyn

234
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,786
At a seder. You can't even do that?

235
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,588
What is she, a leper, for christ's sake?

236
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,091
- All right, you want to know why?
- Yes, i want to know why.

237
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,194
- ( Silent )
- Come on, tell me the truth. Don't lie to me.

238
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,628
- You know, don't lie.
- No, 'cause i have--

239
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,630
Okay, i have a cold sore and
i didn't want to kiss her.

240
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,966
- You have a cold sore?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,169
And i was-- I
was embarrassed.

242
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,306
- So why didn't you tell her?
- I was embarrassed.

243
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,208
<i>- I'm sorry. -
Lewis: uh-Huh.</i>

244
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,744
I'll never get laid again.

245
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,146
Just tell the whole restaurant.

246
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,120
Larry!

247
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,024
<i>- ( Bells ring )
- Hey, larry!</i>

248
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,993
Larry!

249
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,363
- You got x-Acto knives?
- Sure, right here.

250
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,099
Oh, okay. Can i see that red one?

251
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,503
- Sure thing. - Jeez, i can't
open the vacuum-Sealed packaging.

252
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,606
- It's impossible. You can't open it.
- Oh yeah.

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,007
- I'll take this one.
- Okay.

254
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,842
<i>- ( Bells ring )
- Larry.</i>

255
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,377
Why'd you tell alton
i was fucking his wife?

256
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,079
What?  Come here. What are you saying?

257
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,747
You told alton i'm fucking his wife?

258
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,251
No, i said that you said
that his wife was beautiful,

259
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>And that's all i said.
That's all i said.</i>

260
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,888
When you said that shit to him,

261
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,623
That's implying that i'm fucking her.

262
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,225
- Well, just tell him that you're not.
- But i am!

263
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,760
- You are?
- I'm tapping that ass!

264
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,729
I've been kung-Fuing
that ass for a while now.

265
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,631
- What is wrong with you? - Said,
fucking that ass-- They're the same thing.

266
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,499
Why do you fool around
with married women?

267
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,368
- Ass is ass, larry.
- Ass is not ass.

268
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,470
- Ass is fucking ass, larry. It's what the fuck i do.
- No, it's not.

269
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,372
Well, you don't have to tap every ass.

270
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,007
Do you?  Do you have to tap every ass?

271
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,675
What the fuck we gonna do right now?

272
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,678
- What do you mean "we"?
- Alton's gonna fuck somebody up.

273
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,514
I have nothing to do with
this! I'm not tapping anybody!

274
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,149
You're tapping! I'm not tapping!

275
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,518
You are combined in this
shit with me now, god damn it.

276
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,554
We are lego. We are a
fucking lego set right now.

277
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,056
<i>We are fucking interlocked
together. We fucked her.</i>

278
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,491
Get away from me. Get out of here.

279
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,593
- Fix this shit.  Fix it!
- I'm not fixing anything.

280
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,129
$10.

281
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,035
First of all, loretta, i want to say

282
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,571
How sorry i am to hear
about your diagnosis,

283
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,474
But i want you to know that we're
gonna get you through this...

284
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,175
- Thank you, dr. Trundle.
- ...without a doubt.

285
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,744
( Sputtering )

286
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,345
And there's something that's
happening tomorrow night.

287
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,981
I'm actually giving a talk
on coping strategies...

288
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,717
- you ever do that? - ...for
newly-Diagnosed patients and i think--

289
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,653
It's like how horses do it, right?

290
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,023
And i can see why they
do it. It feels good.

291
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,760
How long have you all been
together?  This seems...

292
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,395
it's been
about a--

293
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,330
...like a fairly new relationship.

294
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,532
- It's been about
a year no-   - Ab?

295
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,067
How-- How would you
describe these artifacts?

296
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,769
<i>What is it exactly?</i>

297
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,438
<i>- That's african art.
- African?</i>

298
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,274
- Really? Hey--
African. - Yes.

299
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,910
What, i'm supposed to have a
connection to her 'cause i'm black?

300
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,845
Duh!

301
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,016
Mr. David, please have a seat,

302
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,285
- So i can just finish up the history here.
- Sure.  Okay, sure.

303
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,690
So are you all in what you would call

304
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,426
A happy, healthy,
committed relationship?

305
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,128
A happy and a healthy new year to you.

306
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,465
<i>- A happy and a healthy-- - No, we're
talking about our relationship right now.</i>

307
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,269
- Okay, yes. - We-- We
get along most of the time.

308
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,538
Who's this guy? Is that your husband?

309
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:36,175
- Yes.
- Oy, he's got some healthy head of hair, this one.

310
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,211
Yes, he was blessed follicly, yes.

311
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,247
Oh, he was blessed. So, what?  I'm
unblessed. Is that what you're saying?

312
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,582
No, i wasn't referring to you at all.

313
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,150
Bald people are not blessed?

314
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,652
This has nothing to do with you.

315
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,221
We don't belong on the same
planet as the blessed hairs?

316
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,925
Now, as i was saying, the type
of relationship that you have,

317
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,960
Do you feel that your relationship is...

318
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,730
<i>- larry: ooh.
- ...in a comfortable, easy place?</i>

319
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,565
We have differences
and things like that...

320
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,567
<i>- larry: oh yeah.
- ...but overall we get along pretty good.</i>

321
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,569
You know, the
cancer, how much--

322
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,771
( Sings commercial jingle )

323
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,908
<i>- You remember that commercial?
- ( Forcefully ) no.</i>

324
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,443
<i>- Ever see that one?
- I have a great idea:</i>

325
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,712
There are some great
magazines right outside.

326
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,048
- Right, since he can't focus.
- I would like to discuss with loretta

327
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,284
Some very intimate, personal
things that, as a woman,

328
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,620
In terms of self-Image, i think
would be better discussed...

329
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,722
- that would so work for me too.
- ...just in our company.

330
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,958
Yeah, maybe you'll find
a magazine out there

331
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,526
- That'll work for you.
- I understand.

332
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,661
- All right. Thank you.
- Discuss, you two, you sit, you talk.

333
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,363
You'll have coffee. You'll discuss.

334
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,666
Discuss.  You'll talk. You'll
do this. You'll do that.

335
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,069
- Have some girl time.
- You enjoy yourselves, have a good discussion.

336
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,038
I'll be out there. You'll be here.

337
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,006
We'll
talk-- Lat.

338
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,941
( Grumbles )

339
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,281
You're gonna need to hear
something very difficult right now.

340
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>- ( People chatting )
- ( Sighs )</i>

341
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,024
- 6:00.
- Ah.  Mr. Trundle?

342
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,728
- Yeah.
- I saw your picture on your wife's desk.

343
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,065
Oh, right. Take care then.

344
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,334
- Okay.
- All right.

345
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,570
- ( Grunts )
- Larry?

346
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,874
Larry david. Dean.  Dean weinstock.

347
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,143
- Oh my god.  Hey. - Yeah, used
to be your next-Door neighbor.

348
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,779
- Yeah.  Hey.
- Hey, man.  It is so good to see you.

349
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,514
- Hey hey.
- ( Glasses crunch )

350
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,249
- Whoa!
- Oh, christ!

351
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,986
- Oh my god. - These
are-- Are broken.

352
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,488
- Oh, dear.
- Thank you.

353
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,358
- Oh, man.
- It is just so good to see you, man.

354
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,992
- That's awesome.
- Good to see you.

355
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,061
- It's great.
- I'm sorry about your glasses.

356
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,197
Don't worry about it.
I'll send you a bill.

357
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,400
Tell me, how's cheryl?  How's--
Where'd you guys move to?

358
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,503
Wha-- What-- You'll what?
You'll send me a bill?

359
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,473
- Is that what you said? - Yeah, these
are-- I don't think these can be fixed.

360
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,708
- Wait a second.
- Yeah?

361
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,945
<i>- You're gonna send me a bill?
- Just for the glasses.</i>

362
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,547
- Why?
- 'Cause they're like $219.

363
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,917
I-- I didn't
break your glasses.

364
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,919
It was the hug that broke 'em.
It wasn't you specifically...

365
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,955
- okay, yeah.
- ...but you were the one who instigated the hug.

366
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,590
I didn't inst-- I
instigated the hug?

367
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,325
Yeah, i came in
for like a shake--

368
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,294
No, i came in for a shake and then
i saw you make a move for the hug,

369
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,865
- So i went in.
- I kinda remember i said the "hey."

370
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,900
I think you're mistaking
my "hey" for a hug.

371
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,769
Even if i did initiate the hug...

372
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,437
- yes?  Yeah?
- ...which i didn't,

373
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,640
That still doesn't make me
responsible for your glasses.

374
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,308
They're your glasses.
They're around your neck.

375
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,145
With all due respect, i feel
like you didn't recognize me

376
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,681
Then i did the "hey,"then i did,

377
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,883
Then you came in and, because
you were so embarrassed

378
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,820
And so mortified that
you did not recognize me,

379
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,755
You overcompensated by a superstrong hug

380
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,458
- That broke my glasses.
- Okay, that's an incredibly idiotic theory.

381
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,959
I think, because you're a needy person,

382
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,795
You wanted me to like
you, so you hugged me.

383
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,496
First of all, i'm not a needy person.

384
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,599
Okay?  That's number one. I
have no needs at all, okay?

385
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,602
I wasn't overcompensating. I don't
like you.  Why would i want to hug you?

386
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,671
- All right.
- I'm not paying for your glasses.

387
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,673
I'm not asking you to
pay for the glasses.

388
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,409
I'm asking you to replace
these glasses that you broke.

389
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,346
I'm still paying for them
even if i replace them,

390
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,780
Am i not? What's the difference?

391
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,949
I don't know if you know an
optometrist.  I don't know.

392
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,352
- No, i don't know any optometrists.
- Well, i didn't think you did

393
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,320
So, in that case, that's
why i'm invoicing you.

394
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,190
Okay, you send me the invoice. I'm going
to rip it up into tiny little pieces

395
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,626
- And i might even pee on it. -
Why-- Why are we fighting in here?

396
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,995
We're fighting because you're a
moron. That's why we're fighting.

397
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,932
You know i have cancer, right?

398
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,368
You know that's why i'm here.

399
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,904
I don't want to have a fight with you.

400
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,607
In fact, my doctor said to
not have any fights at all.

401
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,378
Okay,
i'll--

402
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,382
I'll pay for the glasses.

403
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,417
You'll replace the glasses.

404
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,688
I'll pay for the glasses.

405
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,557
I appreciate you
accepting responsibility.

406
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,893
It feels good, right?

407
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,838
I got a pretty good
vibe from that doctor.

408
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,908
<i>Pretty pretty</i>

409
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,844
Pretty pretty good.

410
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,379
Yeah, she's pretty smart.

411
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,815
<i>Yeah.  Yeah, what did
you guys talk about?</i>

412
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,452
She told me there's certain things
i've got to do to make sure i get well.

413
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,087
Well, you got to do 'em,
you've got to do 'em.

414
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,922
<i>- Yeah.
- If that's what she said,</i>

415
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,824
You've got to listen to the doctor.

416
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,026
Because without your
health, you're nothing.

417
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,162
Some people are nothing
even with health.

418
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,464
I fall into that category sometimes.

419
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,499
A nothing-- A big
nothing-- And i have health.

420
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,902
I would like to go to
her lecture tomorrow.

421
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,805
You know what? I'll
drive you. How about that?

422
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,176
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

423
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,747
What can i do for you?

424
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,582
You killed another relationship.

425
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,452
- I did?
- That's right, and a very special one, too.

426
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,420
This is maybe the most
special one i ever had.

427
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,222
Really? The last one was special.

428
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,557
I made a mistake on that one.

429
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,891
There have been quite
a few special girls.

430
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,126
I've made mistakes. Not this one.

431
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,294
This one's more special?

432
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,628
<i>This is the most special.</i>

433
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,397
- No question about it?
- No question about it.

434
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,800
<i>Is she the most special out of all
the special girls you've taken out?</i>

435
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,802
- I think she might be.
- Really?

436
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,537
That's right, and she needs an apology.

437
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,539
Okay?  So come on.

438
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,242
What do you want me to say?

439
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,245
I don't-- Tell her the
truth-- You know, the thing.

440
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,148
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

441
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,485
<i>You'd better get me out of this.</i>

442
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,689
Hey, beverly.
I-- Honestly,

443
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,292
I am so sorry about what
happened in the restaurant

444
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,795
But,
um--

445
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,764
- What's wrong?
- Would you back up, please?

446
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,166
You're right on my neck here.
Just back up a little bit.

447
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,168
- You're breathing down
my neck. - Sorry, i'm--

448
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,103
Anyway, i'm really sorry.

449
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,305
About not kissing you in
the restaurant. That was bad.

450
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,942
But jeff told me that you
gave lewis a blowjob in the car

451
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,878
Before you got to the
restaurant, so that's why--

452
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,281
- What?!  Jeff said-- Jeff
said what? - What did you say?

453
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,418
Blowjob?  What the fuck
are you talking about?

454
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,753
What is this?  What, am i
in grade three or something?

455
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,522
Look, i haven't had a
blowjob in about five years,

456
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,223
- So i was excited, so it slipped out.
- I know!  I can tell!

457
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,559
You're not gonna have one for
another fucking five years!

458
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,227
( Tires screech )

459
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,631
Why the fuck would you do
something like that, huh?

460
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,533
- What?  You told me to tell the truth.
- Are you fucking crazy?

461
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,767
- Tell the truth?
- Yeah.

462
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,869
I thought the truth was
that you had a cold sore

463
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,738
For christ's' sake! That's
what the truth would have been!

464
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,606
What? No no no. I made up the cold sore

465
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,642
'Cause i didn't want to kiss
her!  Anyway, you went like this!

466
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,178
That's the sign for blowjob.
That's a blowjob sign.

467
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,413
- No, it's cold sore. It's "i'm choking."
- That's cold sore?

468
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,248
That's an i'm-Eating-
Corn-On-The-Cob thing.

469
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,284
That's a blowjob, buddy,
where i come from.  Yeah.

470
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,753
Why couldn't you just kiss
her goodbye like a human being?

471
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,255
Kiss her goodbye?  She's got your semen
on her lips. I'm not gonna kiss her.

472
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,392
- She had my semen on her lips.
- Yes!  Yeah, secondhand semen.

473
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,294
You can't be a homosexual by proxy.

474
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,029
It's probably in the
fucking constitution.

475
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,497
I think you can be gay by proxy.

476
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,899
- Christ.
- Anyway, sorry.

477
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,568
How am i going to get home by the way?

478
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,336
<i>Eh, you take a bus.</i>

479
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,477
Can i tell you something? I'm
very excited about this lecture.

480
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,345
- Why?
- Come on.

481
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,881
How often do you get to
listen to somebody this smart?

482
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,584
Not even smart,
brilliant. She's brilliant.

483
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,452
I get it. You were impressed.  Okay?

484
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,088
Enough with the dr.
Trundle and the brilliance.

485
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,058
<i>I get your point, okay?</i>

486
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:09,061
Hey, dr. Trundle's husband.

487
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,131
Yeah.  I remember him from the picture.

488
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,034
Yeah, right. Yeah, i saw him
yesterday in the reception area.

489
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:17,970
- Really?
- Yeah.  He's probably on his way to the lecture.

490
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,271
Yeah.

491
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,508
<i>Is that dr. Trundle?!</i>

492
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,677
<i>Go--
It--</i>

493
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,679
L.D., is she giving him a blowjob?!

494
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,248
- That's what it looks like.
- Oh my gosh!

495
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,383
<i>- Wow.
- Loretta: oh no.</i>

496
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,086
Oh, no no no no no no no no no, l.D.

497
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,954
- I want you to turn this car around.
- What?

498
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,057
- Turn the car around!
- So what?  So she's giving him a blowjob.

499
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,259
- What's the big deal?
- No no no!  I can't trust a woman like that

500
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:43,395
To cure my cancer, doing
something like that in the car!

501
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,298
- Are you kidding me?
- She must've been doing it for therapeutic reasons.

502
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,034
- I want you to take me home, l.D.
- The lecture!

503
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:52,204
L.D., turn this car around.

504
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,282
- Hi.
- Hi.

505
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:06,652
Could you please give this to dean
weinstock? He's a patient here.

506
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,888
- Sure.  Okay.
- It's a check for his glasses.

507
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:12,124
- Mr. David.
- Hello.

508
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,126
Hi, what a surprise.

509
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,729
- You here alone?
- Yeah.

510
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,099
I would love to talk to
you. Do you have a minute?

511
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,236
- Sure.
- Great.  We'll go back to my office.

512
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,872
- Melissa, would you hold all the calls, please?
- Sure, dr. Trundle.

513
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,440
This way.

514
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,410
Come on in.

515
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,214
I wanted to tell you
how disappointed i was

516
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,684
That you and loretta were
not at the lecture yesterday.

517
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,487
<i>And i think the reason
that you weren't there</i>

518
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,455
Was because you recognized

519
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,658
That i am going to recommend
that she leave the relationship.

520
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,627
That terrifies you and that's why

521
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,329
<i>You didn't want her to be there.</i>

522
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,365
No no, that's the furthest
thing from the truth.

523
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,501
I have a lot of experience with this,

524
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:58,103
And i find that men
often have this reaction.

525
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,005
It's certainly understandable.
It's very threatening.

526
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,775
But the fact is we're
talking about a woman's life

527
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,977
And i'm saying something that
you just don't want to hear.

528
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,814
It's not true. I reject your hypothesis.

529
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,516
Why didn't she come to the lecture?

530
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,851
- You really want to know why?
- Of course i do.

531
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,387
Okay, i'm going to tell you.

532
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:19,291
We were driving to the
lecture, we were on our way...

533
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,226
- mm-Hmm.
- ...and then

534
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:24,063
I noticed your husband
in the car ahead of us.

535
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,300
Then you picked your
head up off of his lap

536
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:32,905
And loretta decided that she
didn't want anything to do

537
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,874
With a doctor who
would, you know, do that.

538
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,676
Who would do what?

539
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,445
Come on.

540
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,047
Oh my god.

541
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,849
My husband was driving the car,

542
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,719
And yes, i dropped my cell
phone on his side of the car,

543
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,487
And i was looking for the cell phone.

544
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,489
An awful long time to
look for the cell phone.

545
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:54,026
<i>You are so ridiculous.
You are so juvenile.</i>

546
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,594
- I don't know.
- You are exactly the kind of man

547
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,663
- I'm talking about in this book.
- Me?!

548
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,198
Yes.  You are a tiny,

549
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,034
Little, insecure, infantile mind

550
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,769
Of about a
12-Year-Old!

551
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,338
- I think you blew him.
- Oh my god!

552
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,140
- You think i blew him?
- ( Yelling )

553
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,443
You have nothing better
in your mind than that?!

554
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,879
You're out of control!
Get him out of my office!

555
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,292
Oh shit. Oh shit.

556
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,395
- My shoes are in there.
- Alton's here!

557
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:32,664
- What?
- Alton's at the front door!

558
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,101
You brought his wife here? You idiot!

559
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,372
- I know, man. I'm sorry.
- You see?

560
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,975
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing, right? She's not here.  See?

561
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,744
I didn't-- I didn't mean
to run up all in here

562
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,213
Yeah, you come up here, rushing
up here to a white man's house--

563
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,916
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. Just forgive me.

564
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,651
- I'm-- - All
right, brother.

565
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,087
- Boy!  Shit.
- I'll see you next week though, okay?

566
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,989
- All right.
- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

567
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,098
( Sighs ) it's okay.  He's gone.

568
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,500
( Sighs ) thank god.

569
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:10,169
( Sighs )

570
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,406
( Gasps ) what the hell?!

571
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,845
Okay.  Now come on. Get
in the car. Get in the car.

572
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,081
We getting the hell out of here
and we ain't never coming back.

573
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,783
You got me twisted, l.D., okay?

574
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,752
Give your ass a little bit
of a taste of chocolate,

575
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,253
And next thing you know,
you cheating on me?!

576
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,055
<i>That's right. I saw your ass,</i>

577
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,726
You cheating, no-Good,
bald-Headed motherfucker!  I'm out!

Fuck you, larry david!
That's some bullshit!

579
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,470
Somebody got on your ass. What happened?

580
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,373
They're gone. We had a big fight.

581
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,441
They're not coming back.

582
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,210
- What?
- Yeah.

583
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,645
- Huh.
- How do you like that?

584
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,547
That's some shit right there.  Mmm.

585
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,883
So, um...

586
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,386
i guess this means you'll be...

587
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,655
going upstairs, eat this
fucking chinese food...

588
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,724
in my fucking room.

589
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,503
Hey, lewis, it's me.

590
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,138
I'm on my way to michael york's.

Maybe i'll see you there.

592

Otherwise, i'll talk to you tomorrow.
