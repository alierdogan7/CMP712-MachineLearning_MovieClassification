1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:06,067
Andy got back from
London two days ago,
and he still has jet lag.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,103
It's really annoying.
We're on totally
different schedules.

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,766
<i>Last night he mowed the lawn</i>
<i>at 2:00 in the morning.</i>

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,346
Andy! Andy!

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,104
Get me a beer?
All right.

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,077
As soon as I wake up
he goes down, hard.

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,543
This has to stop.
(SNORING)

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,986
Babe, wake up.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,317
That's my spaghetti,
Chewbacca.

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,382
Babe!

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,825
(CLANGING)

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,590
You hungry, Champion?

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,057
(GASPS)

14
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,158
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,094
(GROANS)

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,231
Oh, man,
I fell asleep again?

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,334
Andy, you have got to stay up
and get on a regular schedule!

18
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,572
Were you about to spray me
with the hose
inside the house?

19
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,242
Yeah.

20
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,510
I kind of want you
to do it now.

21
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,777
Okay.

22
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,911
(SCREAMING)

23
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,252
Okay, okay, okay.

24
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,892
(SCREAMING)

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,884
Okay, just a reminder, guys,
today is Leslie's last
day as a city councilor,

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,783
so everyone be
extra supportive.

27
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,011
Already done.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,890
When she walked
past me this morning,
I gave her a kind nod.

29
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,060
Heartwarming.
Also, I want to
get her a present

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,597
to cheer her up
on her last day.

31
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,654
Any ideas?

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,798
A " Sorry You Lost
Your Dream Job" gift?

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,025
Um, that's a tough one.

34
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,364
Stay away from wine.
Wine is crying juice.

35
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,962
Well, I mean, you know her
better than anybody.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,804
What does she really want
more than anything
in the world?

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,477
A nice candle!
I'm screwed.

38
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,842
Andy, no!
(GASPS) No!

39
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,814
Oh, my God.
Andy!

40
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,350
I'll be right out.

41
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,111
(SIGHING)
Well, this is the Pawnee
City Council Chambers.

42
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,188
Your new home
away from home.

43
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,451
Well, technically,
my home away
from home is in Zurich.

44
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,222
Frank Gehry designed it.
But this is nice too.

45
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,430
Today is my last day
as City... Excuse me.

46
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,523
(CLEARS THROAT)

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,966
Let me try this again.
(HOARSE VOICE)
Today is my last day as...

48
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,627
Today is my last...

49
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,135
Today is my last day...
You know what,
you get the idea.

50
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,668
<i>My old friend</i>
<i>Ingrid De Forest</i>
<i>won the recall vote,</i>

51
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,369
<i>and she's taking my place</i>
<i>on Monday morning.</i>

52
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,912
<i>But you know, Iuckily for me,</i>
<i>I've processed all my feelings</i>

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,048
<i>and I've gone through</i>
<i>the five stages of grief,</i>

54
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,017
<i>denial, anger,</i>
<i>Internet commenting,</i>
<i>cat adoption, African dance,</i>

55
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,512
cat-returning-to-
the-adoption-place,

56
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,886
watching all the episodes
of <i>Murphy Brown</i> and
not giving a flying fart.

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,259
How many
stages is that?

58
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,227
I don't know.
The point is
I'm fine now.

59
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,325
This must be hard for you.

60
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,024
It's like what
Sir Ian McKellen
said to me

61
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,160
the day I sold my boat
to Karl Lagerfeld,

62
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,503
"Parting is such
sweet sorrow."

63
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,570
Oh, my God.
What is your life?
(LAUGHS)

64
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,071
If it makes any difference,
your work here was
a real inspiration to me,

65
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,645
and I am going
to do my best
to continue your legacy.

66
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,614
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,447
(EXHALES)

68
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,083
Leslie?
(GASPS) I'm sorry.

69
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,618
Was I singing
<i>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</i>
out loud?

70
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,758
No. But,
would you like to?

71
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,394
I studied opera
at the Sorbonne.
I'd be happy to harmonize.

72
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,933
(SINGING) <i>Goodbye...</i>
<i>Goodbye...</i>

73
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,534
Nah.
No.

74
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,630
And finally,

75
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,262
here is a check
for the entirety

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,035
of the purchase
of Rent A Swag.

77
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,634
And here is a personal note
from my client,
Dr. Saperstein.

78
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,748
"Dear Tom, I win.
You suck.
Turn note over.

79
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,778
"You still suck.
Turn note over."

80
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,920
Okay, Saperstein couldn't
even face me himself?

81
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,181
He had to send in
his lackey.

82
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,720
My client isn't
at this meeting because
he doesn't have to be.

83
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,122
Successful people,
Mr. Haverford,

84
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,160
use their money
to get others
to work for them.

85
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,891
Mmm, that's
an interesting idea,
lawyer dude.

86
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,762
What if I give you five bucks
to put a bag of poop
in Saperstein's car?

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,026
No.

88
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,432
Ballpark me,
how much would it cost?

89
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,596
$10,000.

90
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,802
Counter-offer,
why don't you just
do it for the story?

91
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,375
Goodbye, Mr. Haverford.

92
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,905
DR. SAPERSTEIN: Is it done?

93
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,547
Well, how many times
did he turn the paper over?

94
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,950
Oh, that is disappointing.

95
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,816
So, look at this baby.

96
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,719
That is the most
symmetrical fetus
I've ever seen.

97
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,156
This could be a superhero.

98
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,591
Dr. Saperstein.
Yes.

99
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,122
I know that
we should hate you

100
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,595
because you destroyed
our friend's business,

101
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,596
but we love you so much.
We love you.

102
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,823
I'm lovable.

103
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,796
So, do you want
to know the sex?

104
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,664
Oh, my God...
Should we?

105
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,831
No, right?
Or maybe yes?

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,464
Is there an option
other than yes or no?

107
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,105
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna write it down.

108
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,503
Then I'm going to
put it in an envelope,
seal it,

109
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,444
and when
you're ready, <i>voil√†.</i>

110
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,141
That'll be fun.

111
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,343
It's like the Oscars.
(LAUGHING)

112
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,345
Let's get some food.
I'm starving.

113
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,853
Wait, no,
I have to pee.

114
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,389
Wait, no,
I have to barf!

115
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,784
Actually, all three.

116
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,084
Being pregnant is great.

117
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,656
And finally,
Larry's share
of the profit.

118
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,591
Whoa! Good to be Larry.

119
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,156
No, it's not,
you boring grandpa.

120
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,499
Meanwhile,
Tommy's riding high,
$32,000.

121
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,131
I'm basically a millionaire.

122
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,603
What are you going to do
with the money, Tom?

123
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,607
Glad you asked.
A horrible man recently
gave me some great advice.

124
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,835
For years,
I've been coming up
with my own ideas

125
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,804
like some sort
of non-rich idiot.

126
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,948
Now I'm going to
let people come to me

127
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,984
and invest my scrilla
in the best idea I hear.

128
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,746
That sounds like
an efficient use
of the free market.

129
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,613
I would wish you
the best of luck,

130
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,551
but I believe
luck is a concept

131
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,025
invented by the weak to
explain their failures.

132
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,590
Come hear the ideas
with me, Ron.

133
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,562
I could use your wise,
grandfatherly advice.

134
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,724
Do you think everyone here
is a grandfather?

135
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,631
Basically,
if you're older than me,
you're a grandpa.

136
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,100
And if you are a grandpa,
you're dead.
That sounds right.

137
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,662
Uh, oops! This check is
made out to "Lenny,"

138
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,640
which I think is
a typo for "Larry,"

139
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,869
which isn't even
actually my name.

140
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,806
(LAUGHS) Well,
tell it to the bank,
Lenny.

141
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,974
Am I... Am I Lenny now?

142
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,207
I'd like to order
a singing telegram.

143
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,119
Well, my wife lost her job,
so maybe something sad
and slow?

144
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,748
Do you know anything
from the <i>Requiem for</i>
<i>a Dream</i> soundtrack?

145
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,356
This is a bad idea.
I'm hanging up now, bye.

146
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,289
LESLIE: Well, Ingrid is
settled into my office,

147
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,023
and this box contains
the last of my stuff.

148
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,188
Although I might have
left some salt packets
in my desk.

149
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,562
Maybe I should
go back for those?

150
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,498
Honey, it's okay.
There'll be
other salt packets.

151
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,830
But not the kind that
snaps in half maybe.

152
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,699
Okay, I know
I'm a broken record,

153
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,899
but getting away
from the City Council

154
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,569
is absolutely the best thing
for you. Trust me.

155
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,248
<i>This is Perd Hapley,</i>
<i>talking to you now about</i>
<i>what's going on, today.</i>

156
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,348
<i>We're live at City Hall,</i>
<i>where City Councilman Dexhart</i>

157
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,945
<i>is addressing</i>
<i>his latest sex scandal.</i>

158
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,388
<i>Recently, certain allegations</i>
<i>have come to light</i>

159
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,517
<i>about my inappropriate</i>
<i>conduct.</i>

160
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,488
<i>I am here to set</i>
<i>the record straight.</i>

161
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,798
<i>I totally</i>
<i>did all of it.</i>

162
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,733
Another sex scandal?
This guy is unbelievable.

163
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,096
How does
he find the time?

164
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,104
<i>I also engaged in</i>
<i>inappropriate texting,</i>

165
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,109
<i>"sexting,"</i>
<i>and "Tex-Mexting,"</i>

166
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,872
<i>which is where you send</i>
<i>photos of your junk</i>

167
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,208
<i>from the restroom</i>
<i>of a Chili's To Go.</i>

168
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,304
Hmm.
Ew.

169
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,510
<i>Does this</i>
<i>make me a "bad boy"?</i>

170
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,014
<i>You tell me.</i>

171
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,086
<i>No, really, tell me.</i>

172
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,852
<i>It gets me off when</i>
<i>women tell me that.</i>

173
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,189
He's reading this.
He wrote this down.

174
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,990
<i>I sent these texts</i>
<i>to roughly 100 women,</i>

175
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,361
<i>under the</i>
<i>following pseudonyms,</i>
(CLEARS THROAT)

176
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,996
<i>"Enrique Shockwave,"</i>
<i>"Willie Dynamite,"</i>
<i>"Lee Harvey Teabag."</i>

177
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,363
Well, at least
you won't have to deal
with that guy anymore.

178
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,866
You're right.
Not after someone beats him
in the next election.

179
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
Someone who is
smart and hard-working

180
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,609
and who knows the job
because she's
done it already

181
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,412
and is also blonde
and named Leslie
and loves you!

182
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,278
Is it you?

183
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,652
Yes, it is.
I'm going to run again.

184
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,916
I'm going to beat Dexhart!

185
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,549
<i>...and "Anthony Weiner."</i>

186
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,360
Another City Council campaign?
Leslie, think about
what you're saying.

187
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,126
I did. I challenge you to
find one flaw in my plan.

188
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,429
Well, for one,
we don't even live
in Dexhart's district.

189
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,867
Not yet,

190
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,766
but we can go and
rent a second apartment,

191
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,671
and we can spend 51%
of our time there,

192
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,505
and then I'll file
the campaign form
from that address.

193
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,338
I don't want to
spend 51% of our time
in his district,

194
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,008
it's basically
a dumping ground
for old shipping containers.

195
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,413
Oh.
It's like a raccoon
shanty town.

196
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,782
Oh, it's not that bad.

197
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,014
And also,
Dexhart fights dirty.

198
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,053
He's never lost an election
because he runs brutal,
scorched earth campaigns.

199
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,556
So what?
I've got plenty of dirt

200
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,094
on that scumbag,
I say bring it on.

201
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,095
So, I'm going to
start my negative PR blitz
against Dexhart and...

202
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,862
Look, I just think
we need to take
a deep breath,

203
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,425
think about if
this is really worth it.

204
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,837
Anything is worth
me getting back
on City Council.

205
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,842
Okay, let's see which one
of these lucky visionaries
is gonna make me rich.

206
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,312
Greg Phillips?

207
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,244
Hi, guys. Thanks
for meeting with me.

208
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,874
Enough chit-chat.
What's your pitch, kid?

209
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,714
Come on, time is money,
money is power,

210
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,012
power is pizza,
pizza is knowledge,
let's go.

211
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,583
Okay, so, my idea
is for an abacus,
but on your phone.

212
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,990
I call it
a"phone-bacus."

213
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,095
Son, you just
described a calculator.

214
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,366
But you're talking
about it, right?

215
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,735
Three words,
Automated Word Counter.

216
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,798
Get out.

217
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,033
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Two words.</i>

218
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,097
No.

219
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,199
<i>One word.</i>

220
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,274
As you may know,
I do like to tinker
with things in my garage.

221
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,506
I'm gonna hit the can
while he's up.

222
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,878
So, I think I have
discovered a way

223
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,183
to generate clean,
renewable energy.

224
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,516
(WHIRRING)
I think it's going to...

225
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,615
(SNEEZING)

226
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,059
Ugh! Gross!
God, Larry,
you sneezed all over us!

227
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,187
I'm not going to
buy that thing.

228
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,696
It's covered in
a gallon of your boogers!

229
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,027
LARRY:
I totally understand.

230
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,363
(SNEEZING)

231
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,835
Ah, jeez!

232
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,401
I would be thrilled
if we have a girl.

233
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,434
Aw, tiny dresses, braids,
glitter on everything?
Forget it.

234
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,208
And also girls<i>'</i> names
are so cute.

235
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,508
Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly...

236
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,585
Olive, Rosemary, Chicken.

237
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,450
Fifty burritos.
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

238
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,285
Miss, hi, I'm pregnant,
and I'm a little bit crazy,

239
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,755
so if you don't
bring our appetizers out
in the next 30 seconds,

240
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,122
I'm going to
plunge your face
into the deep fryer.

241
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,658
And also two waters,
please, but no hurry.

242
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,392
Thank you.

243
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,830
Leslie,
I don't know if there's
a story in these emails.

244
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,963
They're iffy,
but Dexhart has been
elected eight times.

245
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,701
I don't think
the voters care.

246
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,800
His poll numbers
are actually up
since the scandal broke.

247
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,238
Well, that's just
because people

248
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,973
found out he was
Miley Cyrus<i>'</i> cousin.

249
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,208
He is?
Morning, Leslie.
Sweet Jugs.

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,712
What? He's kinda cute.

251
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,519
Oh, God, Shauna, no.

252
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,749
I just feel like
I could fix him,
you know?

253
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,121
(EXHALES)

254
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,822
This sucks!
We heard 100 pitches
and they're all terrible.

255
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,390
Change of plans.

256
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,590
You guys are
my idea factory.
April, go!

257
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,534
Okay, I got one.
"Macaroni and Poison,"

258
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,095
it's like mac and cheese,
but with a special ingredient.

259
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,196
Ron?

260
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,536
Every socket set
I've ever bought

261
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,201
only goes up to half inch.

262
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,068
I'd love
a couple larger sizes,

263
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,581
take it all the way
up to five-eighths.

264
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,373
Andy?

265
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,748
Bears bouncing on
trampoline roads.

266
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,716
There's a chance
that I might
have dreamed that.

267
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,215
Okay, time to head
back to the office.

268
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,154
I've missed
an entire day of work,

269
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,162
so at least some good
came from this.

270
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,323
BEN: What are you doing?

271
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,694
Well, they couldn't
make a banner in time
for my press conference,

272
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,465
so I am cobbling
together a banner

273
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,096
from all the other
discarded banners.

274
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,937
"Second chunce four Lesle

275
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,504
"Perv Dexxxhrt
equals birthday mouse?"

276
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,108
Rat.

277
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,514
Well, that's
the closest thing
I could get to a rat.

278
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,753
(SIGHS) Leslie,
listen to yourself,

279
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,345
loopholes,
scorched earth policies...
This isn't you.

280
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,688
I cannot believe you aren't
supporting me on this.

281
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,691
Dexhart has a sex scandal
the same day
I'm leaving office?

282
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,456
That is not a coincidence,
this was meant to be.

283
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,461
You know what?
Why don't we gather
everyone in here,

284
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,766
you explain to them
what you're thinking,
and we get some feedback.

285
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,165
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Now you're talking!

286
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,841
I would be thrilled
if we had a boy.

287
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,806
I have perfected the art
of shaving the human face,

288
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,277
and I would love to be
able to pass that on.

289
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,873
Toy trucks,
superhero costumes,

290
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,712
tiny little acorn penis...
Forget it.

291
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,315
A weird image,
but one that does not
diminish my enthusiasm.

292
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,147
Well, Ann Perkins,
are you ready to find out
the sex of our baby?

293
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,152
I'm ready.

294
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,818
We are having a...

295
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,261
"Distributions."

296
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,432
That's what it looks like,
"Distributions."

297
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,058
Let me see that.

298
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,103
It says "Congratulations."
I think.

299
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,270
Then it says,
"I leg Smurf."

300
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,534
Are we having a Smurf?

301
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,805
We are having
an "eleven-jewel toilet."

302
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,142
I can't tell what's words
and what's punctuation.

303
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,339
The suspense is killing me!

304
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,439
I'm calling Dr. Saperstein!

305
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,174
I'm calling Domino's.

306
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,252
Do you think Domino's delivers
to this restaurant? I hope so.

307
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,452
Oh, no. He's out for
the rest of the day.

308
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,280
I have literally never
been more stressed out.

309
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,254
Good, you guys are here.
Okay, everybody,
gather around.

310
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,320
I have a big announcement.
I am officially

311
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,093
seeking re-election
to the Pawnee City Council.

312
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,327
I am going to be
running for Dexhart's seat,
and the campaign starts now!

313
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,839
Oh, I love
the sound of silence
before a big cheer.

314
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,344
That's what's happening,
right?

315
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,036
Leslie, no offense,

316
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,708
I've heard a lot of
bad ideas today,
this is the worst.

317
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,618
April?
I would love it

318
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,984
if you ran an insane campaign
and basically turned
into the Joker.

319
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,120
But that means
you probably
shouldn't do it.

320
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,515
Andy?

321
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,923
I don't know, Leslie.
It seems risky,

322
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,485
and I'd hate to
see you go through
another tough fight.

323
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,554
But I could be wrong,
I haven't pooped
in three days.

324
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,259
Okay. Ron, you have always
given me sage counsel,

325
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,125
and your words
carry great influence.

326
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,966
So, what do you
think I should do?

327
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,538
I do not think
you should run again.

328
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,105
What the hell
do you know, dum-dum?

329
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,109
All of you, look,
this is my only option.

330
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,970
I am running again
with or without you.

331
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,237
Leslie, you're running
for office again?

332
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,873
What a great idea!
How can I help?

333
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,711
(SIGHS)

334
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,555
Well, no one else brought me
any good business ideas,

335
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,090
so I decided to
take care of it myself.

336
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,819
Talking Tissue!

337
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,552
Every time you pull one out,
you get a little message
to hype you up.

338
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,162
TOM:
<i>Blow that nose, playa!</i>
No.

339
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,627
(SIGHS) This stinks!

340
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,596
I'm just gonna have to
go back to my same job
that I've had forever.

341
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,229
Yeah, I get
why you're bummed out.

342
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,362
I mean, look at me,

343
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,909
I'm younger than you,
and I already have
my own department.

344
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,241
Plus I'm married,
and I make more
money than you.

345
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,443
Whatever.
You just merged your
department with Parks

346
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,504
and then made up
your own title.

347
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,278
Yeah. It's awesome.

348
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,143
<i>I'm empty, yo!</i>
<i>Fill me up!</i>

349
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,650
Do that again.

350
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,090
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

351
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,323
What could you possibly need
at 6:00 in the morning?

352
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,298
We couldn't read your writing,
and we need to know
the sex of our baby.

353
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,732
I'm watching cartoons
with my son.

354
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,598
Daddy, an Elmer Fudd
one is on.

355
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,264
Stop it.
What's up, beautiful?

356
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,968
Jean-Ralphio.
I live in the guesthouse.

357
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,943
What do you say
you and I get together
in a special way?

358
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,736
I'm pregnant.
The more the merrier.

359
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,781
With my baby.
You can come too, beautiful.

360
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,313
Look at that,
I guess sometimes
I call men "beautiful" too.

361
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,444
I guess I'm...

362
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,988
(SINGING)
<i>...open-minded as hell!</i>

363
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,124
<i>I think you're</i>
<i>pretty good-looking</i>

364
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,386
Thank you.
Can you just read that

365
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,893
and tell us what
the sex is, please?

366
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,321
Wow.

367
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,194
It looks like
the chicken that wrote this
had a stroke on the paper.

368
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,060
Listen, I kind of remember,
but I don't want to say
anything that's wrong.

369
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,166
Give me 15 minutes.
I will get dressed,
we'll go down to my office.

370
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,333
Okay.

371
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,433
Have a good day at
work today, Daddy.

372
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,238
Also, if you
don't know already,

373
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,041
there's a malfunction
with the TV

374
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,878
where it keeps
ordering porno...
Like a ton of porno,

375
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,349
like how can someone watch
that much porno
in one sitting,

376
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,408
only when you're
out of the house,

377
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,383
so if you see it
on the bill
that's why. Okay?

378
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,454
"And therefore,
with your help,
we can make our future bright.

"I believe I still have
a lot to offer this city."

380
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,125
BEN: I'd swap
those two lines.

381
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,027
Always helps to end
on the call to action.

382
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,701
I'm sorry if it felt
like everyone piled on.
We were just being honest,

383
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,299
but if you really
want to do this,
of course we'll support you.

384
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,142
Thank you.
I'm sorry I stormed out.

385
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,810
You know, I've been thinking
for weeks

386
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,679
of what to get you
as a " last day
in City Council" present.

387
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,115
I finally figured it out.

388
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,283
You remember Jen Barkley,
political consultant
and power broker.

389
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,653
Hey, Jen.
What brings you
back to Pawnee?

390
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,123
Ben bought one hour
of my time.

391
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,523
I heard you need
some consulting.

392
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,618
Well, uh, I guess.

393
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,129
I mean, how are you?
How's your family?

394
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,165
Okay, I get paid
$1,200 an hour.

395
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,325
Do you really want to
spend any of that time

396
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,699
talking about my mother
and her 19-year-old
Korean husband?

397
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,032
Well, that does
sound fascinating,
but you're right. Let's talk.

398
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,539
Okay, getting a chair.

399
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,174
Ron!

400
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,837
That's how I enter rooms now.
It's more dramatic.

401
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,346
Why did you enter at all?

402
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,348
Because I have
some huge news.

403
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,377
You're looking at Pawnee's
new Business Liaison.

404
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,249
I don't like French words.

405
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,690
I do like the word
"business."
You may continue.

406
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,552
April created a new
position for herself,
and I want to do the same.

407
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,161
The town could use
more private sector money
after the merger,

408
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,724
so as Business Liaison,
I would find companies
looking to move or expand,

409
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,531
and convince them
to do it in Pawnee.

410
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,562
Now this is a good idea.

411
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,568
You've come
a long way, son.

412
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,773
And while
I've got you here...

413
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,911
Talking Tissue.
Go for it.

414
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,281

<i>life is what</i>
<i>you make of it!</i>

415
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,215

You got it!

416
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,822
<i>Clear them sinuses,</i>
<i>playboy.</i>

417
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,756
<i>Someone's got the "sniffies."</i>
<i>Tell your mama you love her.</i>

418
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,293
<i>Step up your</i>
<i>vitamin C game, bro.</i>

419
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,922
So they recall me after
all I've done for them!

420
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,122
Ridiculous.

421
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,665
But Dexhart now has
another sex scandal.
Of course he does.

422
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,893
And the plan is
I'm going to run
for his seat

423
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,164
because how do I lose
to a guy like that?

424
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,703
That's a great idea,
right?
It's a terrible idea.

425
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,368
I knew it. Wait, what?

426
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,408
First of all, you could
lose to a guy like that.

427
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,706
Terrible people
defeat great people
all of the time.

428
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,109
I should know,
those terrible people have
paid me so much money,

429
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,614
I have a condo on
every Virgin Island.

430
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,214
Now, you might win.
You're smart, Ben is smart,
you might win.

431
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,917
But why would you want to?

432
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,918
Because it's my dream job.

433
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,149
Then dream bigger.

434
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,625
Look, you love this town,
it's being run by
monsters and morons?

435
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,252
Get a better job,

436
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,025
rise above their heads,
affect change at
a higher level.

437
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,563
Don't be the kid that
graduates high school,

438
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,226
hangs out in
the school parking lot.

439
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,168
Be the woman who moves away,
climbs the ladder,

440
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,567
and then
confidently comes back

441
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,039
and has sex with
her hot old English teacher

442
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,164
just for kicks.

443
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,708
Is that what you did?

444
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,104
Yeah, Mr. Baker.
Sex was pretty good,
thanks to me.

445
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,510
Look, Pawnee has
done you a favor.

446
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,976
You've outgrown them.

447
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,684
You've got talent,
you've got name recognition,

448
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,113
which means that
you have a bright,
wide-open future

449
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,022
with a thousand options.

even Congress,

all of these are
doable for you.

00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,264
And you can trust me.

453
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,301

you will legally
owe me $1,200,

Okay, great
to see you, Leslie.

464

Those five words
are on me.

465
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,014
Should I move this back?
Don't answer that.

you're thinking,

a press conference

What are you hoping for?

470
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,198
I will honestly be
happy either way.

471

Me, too. Boy or girl,
it doesn't matter.

472

Because it will literally
be the greatest child
who has ever lived.

you have no preference?

Yes!

I thought you didn't
have a preference!

479
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,656
I didn't. I just really
wanted it to be a boy.

00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,909
<i>Thank you.</i>

496
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,171
There you have it,
a shockingly un-shocking
press conference,

497
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,875
in which
a recently-unemployed woman
said nothing of importance.

498
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:23,144
I'm Perd Hapley
and I just realized
I'm not holding my microphone.

499
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,754
Jen Barkley telling me
I had a future

500
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,451
was the best present
I could've gotten.
Thank you.

501
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,516
You're welcome.

502
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,128
But I did get you
one other present

503
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,561
to take your mind off
of all this.

504
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,259
Aw, you are the sweetest
man in the world.
Where is it?

505
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,764
Well, it's not here.

506
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,263
We have to go get it.

507
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,166
(FRENCH SONG PLAYING)

508
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,275
LESLIE: <i>In times of stress,</i>
<i>or moments of transition,</i>

509
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,319
<i>sometimes it can feel</i>
<i>like the whole world</i>
<i>is closing in on you.</i>

510
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:01,118
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>you should close your eyes,</i>
<i>take a deep breath,</i>

511
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,185
<i>listen to</i>
<i>the people who love you</i>
<i>when they give you advice,</i>

512
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,457
<i>and remember</i>
<i>what really matters.</i>

513
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,657
And if you have
the ability to go to Paris,
by all means, go to Paris.

514
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,594
I found one.
Oh, great.

515
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,635
Right here.
Yeah?

516
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,702
Mmm-hmm.
