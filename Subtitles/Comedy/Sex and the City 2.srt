there was an island...

and some beads.

CARRIE: The last two years
weren't exactly the best time...

854
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,100
...to put an apartment on the market.

855
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,643
So we didn't.

856
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,562
And from time to time,
I'd come here to write.

00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,569

-Hello?
-What time did you wake up?

860
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,631
I don't know, about 6.

861
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,803
I'm worried about the Vogue article,
so I wanted to get started.

00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,014
You haven't written over there in a while.

00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,099
Yeah, I know. I know. I just--

864
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,769
I don't know, I thought it would be easier
to work here. No distractions.

-Okay.
-Anyway, it's due Thursday...

what I'm writing yet, so, um....

868
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,405
You're going to stay there?

869
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,949
Just two days.
You know, just to bang it out.

870
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,785
-Is that all right?
-Whatever you need.

-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

...and not think about anything
but writing.

And I did think about nothing but writing.

880
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,564
Until the next day, when I could think
about nothing but food.

881
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,234
And as long as I was going to break
to eat anyway, I thought:

882
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,819
"Why not call the girls?"

883
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,238
One week in Abu Dhabi,

-Yes, sweetie, just like Jasmine.

-It is exciting. When are you gonna go?
-I don't know. When can you all be free?

889
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,845
You didn't think I was going
without my gals.

890
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,348
-What?
-I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

891
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,017
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

892
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,977
-Get out of town.
-My point exactly.

893
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,564
And we are being flown
on the sheikh's own airline.

894
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,525
-He has his own airline?
-Mm-hm.

-Oh, that is one chic sheikh.
SAMANTHA: Super, super, super first class.

00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,867
-Oh, my God.
SAMANTHA: All expenses paid for...

00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,954

00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,352

Yes, yes, but you have a husband.

-Yes, but--
SAMANTHA: But what? What's the problem?

911
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,323
I mean, we haven't been
anywhere together...

912

...since Carrie and Big's wedding blowup

to talk to you about.

Remember when you took those
two days away to finish your article...

00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,163
-...and then we had that great night?
-Mm-hm.

944
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,582
Maybe we should think
about doing that every week.

945
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,377
Hear me out.

946
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,966
After you took those two days
at your old apartment, I started thinking:

947
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,551
What if I got a place?

948
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:10,139
-You want your own apartment?
-No, not my own apartment.

949
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,766

two days a week...

...lie around, watch television,
do the shit I wanna do that bugs you.

And then the other five days...

952
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:23,235
...I'd be here and available
for dinners and sparkle or whatever.

953
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,407
So you're telling me that you want
two days off a week from our marriage.

954
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,451
And you'd have the same two days.

955

00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,538

Do the things you wanna do without me.

958
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,585
But I don't wanna do things without you.

Carrie, come on, I know you.

960
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,798
Can you honestly tell me you didn't enjoy
those two days to yourself?

961
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,470
Two days, yes,
but I don't need it every week.

962
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,849
Are you saying you need it every week?

963
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,269
I don't know, it was just an idea.
Something to think about.

00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,814
Marriage doesn't work like that.

965
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,818
I thought we were supposed to be
making up our own rules.

966
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:15,245
So two days, then four days,
then what, no days?

967
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,083
-Is that where this is heading?
-I never would've brought it up if I thought...

968
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,461
...it was gonna make you think I want out.
Look, I knew two years ago:

969
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,630
I am exactly where I wanna be.

00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,465

a little easier for us to live together.

I mean, we're married...

973
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,889
...but we're still us.

974
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,059
Is this because I'm a bitch wife
who nags you?

975
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,398
I feel like I'm disappointing you
all the time.

976
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,692
No, you're not disappointing me.

977
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,987
Well, something is.

978
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,498
So, what would I tell the girls?
"Big and I are taking two days a week off...

979
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,668
...to make our marriage work better"?
They'd never understand.

980
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,586
I don't care if they understand.

981
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,213

-Hi.

Allow me to properly introduce myself.
My name is Rikard Spirt.

1551

01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:58,942
-In Danish, yes.
-So your name is Dick Spirt?

1553
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,530
Could you be any more American?

You know, I'm just realizing, it wasn't
my tone of voice that my boss didn't like.

1593
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,919
It was the fact that I had a voice.

I slept hard.

1655
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:51,187
You needed it.
Being a mother kicks your ass.

1656
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:54,524
Yes, but the benefits make it worth it.

1657
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,946
Okay.

-Mm-hm.

-You can say it to me. I'm a mother too.
-Say what?

All the things you're thinking, but you

Okay. I'll go first.

...and I do love him more than words...

01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:29,475
...being a mother is not enough.

01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,071
Okay.

01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:11,100
I have been watching you.
I don't know how you're doing it.

1676
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:14,604
Sometimes I go in the other room
and I close the door...

1677
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:17,106
...and I just let her scream.
Isn’t that awful?

01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:19,525
No, that's survival. Take a sip.

1679
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,448
And can I tell you something else?

1680
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:26,699
I feel guilty.

1681
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:30,703
I feel so guilty, because all I ever prayed
for was to have a family.

1682
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,456
And now I have these two beautiful girls.

1683
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:34,790
And?

1684
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,794
-They're driving me crazy.
-Take a sip.

1685
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,633
And I feel like I'm failing.

1686
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,844
I just feel like I'm failing all the time.

1687
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:48,137
You're not failing.

1688

01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:05,874
I'm so sorry
about this unfortunate situation.

1861
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:08,752
Ladies, if you don't mind waiting outside.

1862
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,963
I'm her attorney. I'm gonna stay.

1863
01:56:11,547 --> 01:56:13,048
-Sure.
-We'll be right outside.

1864
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:24,226
-It's all right.
-So, what is the severity of the situation?

1865
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:30,065
The gentleman who reported the incident
is very conservative...

1866
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,735
...and has insisted the offending event
be recorded.

1867
01:56:34,195 --> 01:56:37,114
Offending event? It was kissing.

1868
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:40,242
I understand your feelings.
But we will need your passport.

1869
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:43,286
My passport? You gotta be kidding me.

1870
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,915
It's just to make a record.
To satisfy the complaining gentleman.

1871
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:52,421
This is outrageous.

1872
01:56:52,588 --> 01:56:53,588
I know. I know.

1873
01:56:54,757 --> 01:56:57,092
It was just a kiss.

1874
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,428
Thank you.

1875
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:15,277
I guess I really missed who I used to be...

1876
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:18,989
...and Aidan was such a big part
of that and--

1877
01:57:19,407 --> 01:57:22,200
Yes, I wanted the flirting,
and, yes, I wanted the attention.

1878
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:23,994
But I didn't want the kiss.

1879
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:26,788
The minute I kissed Aidan
I remembered who I used to be.

1880
01:57:26,956 --> 01:57:31,293
Someone just running around New York
like a crazy person...

1881
01:57:31,961 --> 01:57:34,504
...trying to get the one man I loved
to love me back.

1882
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:37,507
And now he does love me...

1883
01:57:37,675 --> 01:57:42,471
...and he wants to sit on a couch
in New York City with me.

1884
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:50,020
And I really hope my past hasn't
screwed up my future.

1885
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,399
And what's so bad
about a couch anyway?

1886
01:57:58,237 --> 01:58:01,531
Oh, my God. I'm having a mid-wife crisis.

1887
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:09,664
I should never have said anything to him.

1888
01:58:09,832 --> 01:58:13,919
The New Yorker was right to slap
a big piece of tape across my mouth.

1889
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:21,551
And I'm sorry for that thing I said
about your marriage earlier.

1890
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,345
I'm sorry too.

1891
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,263
For what?

1892
01:58:25,765 --> 01:58:29,184
For having an attitude
about that two-day idea.

1893
01:58:30,019 --> 01:58:33,230
I've had two days away,
I've gotten a little sleep...

1894
01:58:33,397 --> 01:58:37,025
...and I am finally starting
to feel like myself again.

1895
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:40,112
I think there's really something to it.

1896
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,032
Maybe.

1897
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:49,663
Well, let's just hope Big
doesn't want seven days off.

1898
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:55,585
And as morning arrived,
so did Samantha's release.

1899
01:58:55,753 --> 01:58:57,671

I am sorry it took me so long to arrive.

Well, you're here now, Mr. Mahmud.

1901
01:58:59,715 --> 01:59:02,467
I never got word
until I arrived at my office.

1902
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:05,053
I'm sorry that you had to come
all the way out here.

1903
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:07,973
-Well, it is all settled now.
-Thanks to you.

1904
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,976
-Good to see you again, ladies.
-Thank you so much.

1905
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,353
I'm starving.

1906
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:16,565
Hello? What's for breakfast?

1907
01:59:16,732 --> 01:59:20,068

1908
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:23,071

01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:28,243
-Hello?
-Miss Jones, please.

1911
01:59:29,036 --> 01:59:30,495
Samantha. It's the front desk.

1912
01:59:33,082 --> 01:59:35,417
-This is Samantha Jones.
-Miss Jones.

1913
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:37,252
This is Beydoun at the front desk.

1914
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:40,088
I will need a credit card number
for the room charges.

1915
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:43,008
Beydoun, there must be some mistake.

1916
01:59:43,176 --> 01:59:47,429
I am a guest of Sheikh Khalid.
There is no room charge.

1917
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:50,432
Yes, I have a record of that.
But not from today on.

1918
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:54,436
What are you talking about? I have
a meeting with the sheikh on Tuesday.

1919
01:59:54,604 --> 01:59:59,065
Ah, yes. I have a note here
from Mr. Mahmud.

1920
01:59:59,233 --> 02:00:01,985
That meeting is no longer as well.

1921
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,114
That sneaky bastard
has canceled the meeting...

1922
02:00:06,282 --> 02:00:08,700
...and he wants us to pay
for the room from now on.

1923
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:12,454
We have you booked into the Jewel Suite
until Wednesday.

1924
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:14,956
The charge is 22,000 per night.

1925
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:18,877
The room is $22,000 a night.

1926
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,713
-What?
-We can't pay that.

1927
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:24,299

your hotel bill in the UAE is jail.

1930
02:00:33,976 --> 02:00:35,644
In precisely one hour.

1931
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:41,566
We have an hour to pack
and get the fuck out of Abu Dhabi.

-No, no. I had it right here.

02:17:33,828 --> 02:17:37,039
...she was also fun at work.

2193
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:43,045
And that July 4th,
on an East Hampton sand dune...

2194
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:48,509
...Samantha learned that good things
do come to those who wait...

2195
02:17:48,677 --> 02:17:54,515
...when she and Rikard
resumed their date in the land of the free...

2196
02:17:56,393 --> 02:17:58,394
...and the home of the hormones.

[SAMANTHA MOANING]

2198
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:09,488
And Charlotte learned that she never
really had anything to worry about.

2199
02:18:09,656 --> 02:18:15,202
Turns out, her hot nanny preferred
the company of other hot nannies.

2200
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,454
SAMANTHA: Stanford, here's a refresher.
-Yes, please.

2201
02:18:17,622 --> 02:18:20,833
-Happy birthday.
-What are you doing? You drank it all?

2202
02:18:21,001 --> 02:18:23,043
And as Rose turned 3...

2203
02:18:27,507 --> 02:18:31,135
...and our marriage grew out
of the terrible twos...

2204
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:36,223
...Big and I found less and less need
to escape to the other apartment.

2205
02:18:39,936 --> 02:18:42,771
But we kept the option open.

2206
02:18:42,939 --> 02:18:46,400
Just in case someone
needed those two days off.

2207
02:19:02,375 --> 02:19:04,793
As for me, I began to think of marriage...

2208
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:08,756
...much like the Real Housewife
of Abu Dhabi's veil.

2209
02:19:08,923 --> 02:19:14,136
You have to take the tradition
and decorate it your way.

WOMAN [ON TV]:
--trying to make up my mind for me.

2211
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:22,936
MAN:
Well, stop it and do as I tell you.

2212
02:19:24,105 --> 02:19:26,315
WOMAN: Leopold.
-Never take a stubborn woman...

2213
02:19:26,483 --> 02:19:29,443
...they're a curse. My mother
warned me against stubborn women.

2214
02:19:29,611 --> 02:19:30,611
WOMAN:
Leopold.

2215
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:33,655
MAN: Now, stop following me
or I'll call the police.

2216
02:19:37,786 --> 02:19:41,789
CARRIE: Because while movies may be
wonderful in black and white...

2217
02:19:41,956 --> 02:19:44,124
...when it comes to relationships...

2218
02:19:44,292 --> 02:19:48,587
...there's a whole range of colors
and options to explore.

2219
02:19:48,755 --> 02:19:52,216
And that's where I am today.
