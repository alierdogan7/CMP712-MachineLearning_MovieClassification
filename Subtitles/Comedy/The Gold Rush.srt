1
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,931
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska
was the hope and dream of men,

2
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,853
the ruthless siren
of the Far North,

3
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,157
beckoning thousands
to her icy bosom.

4
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,430
Beckoning thousands
to her unknown regions.

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,518
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier
to the gold fields.

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,154
Over this Pass men faced
untold misery and hardship.

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,254
Many lost their lives.
Some fell by the wayside,

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,098
others lost courage
and turned back.

9
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,179
But the brave went on.

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,553
Far into the icy north,
deep into the silent nowhere,

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,354
came an undaunted lone prospector.

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,914
And somewhere in that nowhere
was another lone prospector.

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,549
With cheerful optimism
our little Columbus descended,

14
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,593
then stopped, stepped,
slipped and slid.

15
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,155
"Now let me see,"
thought the little fellow.

16
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,271
"Before I know where I am,
I must get there."

17
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,934
There in that frozen wilderness
a dream came true,

18
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,935
and a lone voice shrieked
into the solemn sky,

19
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,133
"Eureka! I've found it,
a mountain of gold!"

20
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,650
But the elements laughed,
roared and thundered.

21
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,877
In that raging nowhere
was a lone cabin,

22
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,556
and another lone man,
Black Larson,

23
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,955
an unmitigated,
predatory scoundrel.

24
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,916
Out of the lashing storm
came the Little Fellow

25
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,396
to find shelter and perhaps
a little hospitality.

26
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,272
There he sat,
resting his weary bones

27
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,813
as the icy wind howled
through the knothole.

28
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,639
"Come here," said Larson.

29
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,593
"What are you doing?"

30
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,519
"Eating, obviously."

31
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,955
"Get out."

32
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,108
"Go on!"

33
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,634
"Get out!"

34
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,533
The wind also was giving
Big Jim his troubles.

35
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,929
Big Jim was the noble type.
He had suffered.

36
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,735
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.

37
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,578
"Get out," said Black Larson.

38
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,014
"Or I'll fill you both
full of lead."

39
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,356
"Now then,
the pair of you, get out!"

40
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,995
"Out!"

41
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,712
That kind of noise
Jim don't tolerate.

42
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,595
"I'll stay right here, understand?"

43
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,330
"Right here," said Big Jim.

44
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,256
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here,"
said the Little Fellow.

45
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,254
"Understand? We stay right here."

46
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,909
And stay they did,

47
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,634
for days and nights.
The cabin moaned and groaned.

48
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,030
Two men walked and never talked,
hunger gnawed their bones.

49
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,098
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.

50
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,537
"I must have food!"

51
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,578
"What are you eating?"
said Black Larson.

52
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,369
"Nothing."

53
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,695
"Open your mouth!"

54
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,952
"Liar! It's that candle."

55
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,798
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."

56
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,396
"If I thought you were holding out
on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"

57
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,708
"One of us must brave that storm,
if we're to get food."

58
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,552
"Come here, the pair of you."

59
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,298
"We'll cut the cards
and the low man goes."

60
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,811
"You're the man," said Jim.

61
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,673
"Goodbye, good luck."

62
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,155
"Don't forget
to bring home the bacon."

63
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,798
Somewhere in that nowhere,
the law was looking for Black Larson.

64
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,455
Desperate with hunger
and here it was Thanksgiving Day.

65
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,333
Nevertheless there was something
to be thankful for.

66
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,549
"Not quite done yet,
give it two more minutes."

67
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,618
"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.

68
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,557
After scouring the country for food,

69
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,035
the Little Fellow had to admit
he had seen nothing,

70
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,071
not even a field mouse.

71
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,312
From the pangs of hunger,

72
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,795
Big Jim was becoming delirious,
hysterical.

73
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,956
In fact he was a pain in the neck.

74
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,634
"Food, food!" he thundered.

75
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,158
"I can put another shoe in the pot."

76
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,635
"No, no, anything but that!"

77
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,835
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.

78
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,998
"What's the matter?"
said the Little Fellow.

79
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,156
"I thought you were a chicken."

80
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,955
"Well, build up the fire,"
said Big Jim.

81
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,668
"What's the matter with you?"
said the Little Fellow.

82
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,156
"Come, my pretty bird,"
said Big Jim.

83
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,759
"Don't be childish."

84
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,250
"Hey, quit it.
Don't be foolish, it's me!"

85
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,491
"You!" said Jim.

86
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,832
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."

87
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,508
"You're telling me,"
said the Little Fellow.

88
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,731
"You go inside. I'll take the gun
in case you lose it."

89
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,309
Chicken or no chicken,

90
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,114
the Little Fellow looks appetizing
to Big Jim.

91
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,048
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled
onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.

92
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,571
Then came the parting of the ways,

93
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,852
Big Jim to his mine,
our hero to his fate.

94
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,334
"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.

95
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,656
"It's been a great pleasure
knowing you."

96
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,611
Treachery awaited Big Jim
at his mountain of gold.

97
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,778
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes

98
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,698
of Black Larson

99
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,856
and saw there the soul of a skunk.

100
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,951
Caught in a maelstrom
of desperate deeds,

101
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,879
Black Larson swept on
to impending doom.

102
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,036
And out of a dream
in that frozen waste, a city grew.

103
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,277
And humanity warmed it with living,
loving and desiring.

104
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,949
Georgia.

105
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,258
Jack was a ladies' man.

106
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,888
Georgia was quick and impulsive,

107
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,692
proud and independent.

108
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,316
In the evening Georgia worked
as a dancehall girl.

109
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,551
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.

110
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,796
Perhaps that's why she resented him.

111
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,618
Out of the night
came the Little Fellow,

112
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,539
towards the dancehall,
that beacon light of pleasure,

113
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,771
that retreat of lost dreams.

114
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,531
"Georgia,
why aren't you nice to Jack?"

115
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,215
"I believe he really likes you,"
said the girl.

116
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,090
"He likes everybody,"
said Georgia quite audibly.

117
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,575
"I'm bored with this place,"
she continued.

118
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,295
"I'd give it all up if I could find
someone honest and worthwhile."

119
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,134
"Don't worry,
I'll find him someday."

120
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,593
Then she turned

121
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,439
and looked and looked

122
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,318
and looked.

123
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,032
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"
thought Jack.

124
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,434
"Get down off that high horse."

125
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,278
"Me and you are gonna dance."

126
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,612
"Hey there, pan out a tune."

127
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,835
"Just a moment,
I said we're gonna dance."

128
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,758
"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.

129
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,393
To show her utter contempt for Jack,

130
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,910
she picked out the most deplorable
looking tramp in the dancehall.

131
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,913
"Hey you, come here."

132
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,875
"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"

133
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,076
"You see, I'm very particular
about whom I dance with."

134
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,731
And there he stood,
the dauntless cavalier, guarding...

135
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,214
her sanctuary.

136
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,656
"If you wanna make a hit
with your lady friend,"

137
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,772
"you should put your hat
on straight, like this!"

138
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,017
"Take that you... Ouch!"

139
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,928
"Huh! Very good."

140
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,415
"Didn't know me own strength,"
said the Little Fellow.

141
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,432
Hank Curtis' cabin was
a stone's throw from the dancehall.

142
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,029
Hank was a mining engineer
who lived alone

143
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,508
and occasionally went
on long expeditions

144
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,675
into the Far North.

145
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,359
Hank was kind and human,

146
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,198
and our hero cold and hungry,

147
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,960
and the beans smelled good
and the coffee was steaming hot.

148
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,470
So the Little Fellow
devised a way of getting breakfast.

149
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,473
Big Jim recovered from the blow
he received from Black Larson

150
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,113
but lost his memory.

151
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,296
Hank's partner arrives.

152
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,695
Both are ready to leave
on a long expedition.

153
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,016
Hank informs his partner
that the Little Fellow

154
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,370
is to look after the cabin
while he's away.

155
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,798
"Goodbye," said Hank.
"And don't forget to feed the mule."

156
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,510
Since that night in the dancehall
the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia,

157
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,280
but an incident
was to bring them together again.

158
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,214
There she stood,
her loveliness lighting the room,

159
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,012
filling his soul
with the music of romance

160
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,778
for which he was so ill-fitted.

161
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,097
As she introduced her friends,
his heart began to sing.

162
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,314
As they warmed up by the stove,
he excused himself to get firewood.

163
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,709
And in that cabin
his secret was revealed,

164
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,353
his love for Georgia.

165
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,471
And the girls giggled and laughed,

166
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,432
perhaps in order to hide their pity.

167
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,949
For in the world of the dancehall
it wasn't wise for the girls

168
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,513
to reveal their hearts.

169
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,492
And so they thought
they'd have a little fun with him.

170
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,591
There in the gloaming they sat,

171
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,030
their faces alight with mischief,

172
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,914
but all the while
his heart was singing.

173
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,760
And so she fooled and flirted
and stroked his hair.

174
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,190
He knew she was fooling,
but he was happy.

175
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,789
For she was near him,
holding his hand,

176
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,399
smiling at him.

177
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,623
"Nice place you have here,"
said Georgia.

178
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,366
"I hope you will invite us again."

179
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,605
What if she were fooling?

180
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,005
He was enjoying
the warmth of her attention.

181
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,599
And the lady was enjoying
the warmth of his chair.

182
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,805
And now she was leaving.

183
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,887
The light of her loveliness
would be gone.

184
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,842
And he would be left
with an emptiness,

185
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,405
to return to his bleak,
lonely existence.

186
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,725
"Pardon me,"
said the Little Fellow,

187
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,763
"But, uh..."
He was lost for words.

188
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,148
"Would you really like
to come again?"

189
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,944
"Of course," said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"

190
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,005
"We'll come for dinner
New Year's Eve," said the ladies.

191
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,199
"Very well," said Georgia.

192
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,560
"We'll come to dinner
New Year's Eve."

193
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,442
Of course at that moment
Georgia would forget her gloves!

194
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,178
For the next few days the Little
Fellow hustled and shoveled

195
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,540
in order to buy
that New Year's dinner.

196
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,038
The eve of a new year.
New hopes and new dreams.

197
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,880
And there was Georgia, caressing him
with her smiles and tender glances.

198
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,320
And the girls called for a speech.

199
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,009
But he was too happy to speak.

200
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,122
All that mattered
was Georgia was there. Georgia!

201
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,639
So he muttered and stuttered
and finally said,

202
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,920
"I can't make a speech
but I'll do a dance."

203
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,439
And a dance he did, with the rolls.

204
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:12,805
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

205
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:17,526
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

206
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:24,669
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

207
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:30,422
<i>And days of auld lang syne</i>

208
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:37,320
<i>For auld lang syne
My dear</i>

209
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,283
<i>For auld lang...</i>

210
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,846
In the midst of all their revelry
the vague memory

211
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,200
of a promise crept
into Georgia's mind.

212
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,605
"Let's go up and visit
the Little Fellow," she said.

213
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,843
"We'll have some fun
with him," said Jack.

214
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,564
"We'll send Georgia in first,
then give him a scare."

215
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,119
"Oh, forget it," said Jack.

216
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,560
"How about giving me
a little attention?"

217
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,248
A day or so later
in the Recorder's office,

218
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,361
Big Jim tried to convince
the assayers

219
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,367
that he had a mountain of gold.

220
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,662
"Where is this place?" they said.

221
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,259
But Big Jim's memory
had failed him.

222
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,938
All he knew was
that it was near the cabin.

223
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,278
"The cabin, that's it!"

224
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,119
"If I could find my way to the cabin
I could find the mine."

225
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,242
"But I can't remember."

226
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,224
"Hey!" said Jack,
"Georgia's been looking for you."

227
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,465
The Little Fellow knew otherwise.

228
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,343
How dare that cad mention
her name so lightly?

229
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,781
For two pins
he'd give him another thrashing.

230
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,665
However being a little underweight
he would ignore the insult.

231
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,019
But it was true.
Georgia had been looking for him.

232
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,345
Georgia had written him a letter.

233
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:29,249
And as he went looking for Georgia,
so Big Jim went looking for him.

234
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,063
"You, you!" said Big Jim.

235
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,563
"You! The very man
I've been looking for!"

236
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,840
"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"

237
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,369
"Answer me, I say!"

238
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,084
"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"

239
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,999
"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"

240
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,300
"At last I shall find
my mountain of gold."

241
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,068
"To your feet man, quick!"

242
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,589
"You're coming with me!"

243
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,305
"Take me to the cabin
and I'll make you a millionaire!"

244
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,763
"Georgia! Just a moment,"
said the Little Fellow.

245
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,704
"Georgia, you don't have to explain.
I understand."

246
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,787
"I love you.
I'll take you away from this life."

247
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,708
"I'm going away, and when I return,"

248
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,263
"I shall come back."

249
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,462
Exhausted and footweary,
they arrived at the cabin.

250
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,207
"Ah!" said Big Jim,
"it won't be long now."

251
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,846
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow
we'll start for the mine.

252
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,282
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat."

253
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,522
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop,"
said the Little fellow.

254
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,064
Then fate - it's always fate -
played its little joke,

255
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,943
and again the elements laughed,
roared and thundered,

256
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,948
but through it all
our heroes soundly slumbered.

257
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,627
Then came the dawn.

258
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,044
The Little Fellow awoke,

259
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,241
blissfully ignorant
of what happened the night before,

260
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,726
but feeling definitely conscious
of "the morning after".

261
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,548
"Oh well, may as well tidy up
and get breakfast."

262
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,747
"This is the worst liver attack
I've ever had."

263
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,069
"Feel that rocking?"

264
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,585
"It's the stomach."

265
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,083
"It's not the stomach."

266
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,967
"Let's go to the other side."

267
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,523
"We'll see how far it
will go over."

268
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,824
"Something
must be missing underneath."

269
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,066
"I'll go outside
and see what it is."

270
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,921
"Now," said Big Jim,
"don't get excited."

271
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,406
"Take it easy, don't move,
don't breathe!"

272
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,142
"I said don't breathe, stupid."

273
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:27,487
"You can be most annoying
at times."

274
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,819
"If you'll only be cool, be calm,"
said Big Jim,

275
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,668
"We have nothing to worry about."

276
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:51,564
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower?"

277
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,809
"Now listen,
I've got a very good idea."

278
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,927
"Hold your hands like this,
then I can get out first."

279
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,788
"You see what I mean?"
said Big Jim.

280
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,458
"Your mind is chaotic.
You have no psychology."

281
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,342
"You have no control."

282
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,819
And Big Jim discovered his claim!

283
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,501
"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.

284
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:39,541
"We shall be millionaires!"

285
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,039
And so they were.

286
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,149
Now they were homeward bound

287
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,625
and they were leaving the hardship
and toil of Alaska

288
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:10,349
to live in the land
of milk and honey.

289
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,269
To live, laugh and indulge themselves
in the lap of luxury.

290
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:16,030
They were famous,
and sought after by the press.

291
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,865
In their cabin deluxe

292
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,140
they were welcomed
and waited upon.

293
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,445
The reporter wanted to write
the Little Fellow's life story,

294
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,959
"From Rags to Riches",
and he graciously consented.

295
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,029
And Big Jim was manicured.

296
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,619
"Not the nails," said he,
"the corns."

297
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,363
The reporter thought of a good idea,

298
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,686
to have the Little Fellow pose
in his mining clothes.

299
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,687
It would make a human story.

300
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,425
Georgia...

301
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:44,239
There she was in the steerage.
Neither knew of the other's presence.

302
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:47,487
Georgia overheard the officer say
there was a stowaway aboard.

303
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,309
"You!" said Georgia.

304
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,660
"I thought I'd never see you again."

305
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,588
And then she mistook him
for the stowaway.

306
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,642
The officer was going
to put him in irons.

307
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:46,762
But Georgia pleaded for him
and said she would pay his fare.

308
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,522
"Heck!" said the Captain.
"That's no stowaway."

309
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:01,290
"That's Big Jim's partner,
the multimillionaire."

310
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,940
Then of course there were apologies.

311
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,021
The Little Fellow
gathered himself together.

312
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,028
James, the valet, was told
to prepare for an extra guest.

313
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,648
"Pardon me," said the reporter,
"but who's the lady?"

314
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,723
"Buzz buzz buzz!"

315
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,160
"Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations."

316
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,208
"This will make a great story,
and with a happy ending."

317
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,459
And so it was.

318
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,109
A happy ending.
