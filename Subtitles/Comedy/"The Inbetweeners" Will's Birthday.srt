1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,950
'To the untrained eye, it may
look like another day at school.

2
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,830
'Actually, it was a very special
week.

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,230
'Or, in Neil's case, a very special
needs week.'

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,629
Bollocks, no way is that right.

5
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,269
You all right, Neil? What are you
playing?

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,549
Oh, behave. That's well too hard.

7
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:34,949
Brain Training?

8
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:37,549
Stupid thing. Why's that wrong?

9
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:38,669
What's it say your
brain age is Neil?

10
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,349
I got it up to 12 a minute ago.

11
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:43,109
12? 12 years old?

12
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,589
Have you caught Downs
syndrome or something?

13
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:46,869
Has it asked if Santa is real?

14
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,949
Don't listen to them Neil.
He does exist.

15
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,309
Yeah, and he's just sorted out

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,109
our Saturday night with the
gift of gash.

17
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,029
Sexy soiree? That sounds sexy.

18
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:58,109
Fucking hell, is that Louise Graham?
She doesn't normally look like that.

19
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,589
Oh, she'd definitely get it.
Right in the bumhole.

20
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:01,989
Lucky girl.

21
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,509
This is amazing, we have
been invited to a cool party.

22
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,749
Kind of. I nicked
this out of Sadie Cunningham's bag

23
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,989
in registration.
Thought we should try and go.

24
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,549
Oh, so it's another cool party

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,389
we're specifically not invited too?
Good job, Jay.

26
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,509
Erm, isn't there something
else on Saturday anyway?

27
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:18,788
Don't think so.

28
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,188
It's my birthday.

29
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,868
I'm having a dinner party.

30
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:25,428
I sent you the invites
a month ago.

31
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:27,788
Is that really happening?
I thought it was a joke.

32
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,868
It's a joke that we've
got to go to a dinner party

33
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,068
rather than a sex party.

34
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,708
Two things...
One, it won't be a sex party -

35
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,188
it's Louise Graham we're talking
about. Two...

36
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,628
Even if it is you were invited
to my party first.

37
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:41,308
Just cancel yours, Will, you can
have your birthday any weekend.

38
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:45,148
Thanks, Neil. Simon you don't want
to go to Louise Graham's do you?

39
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:49,228
Me? No, god no. No. Not unless you're
going to cancel yours?

40
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,268
I'm not.

41
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:52,308
Sure. Sure.

42
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,028
Oh, except my French exchange
bloke arrives today

43
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,788
and I'm meant to look after him
all week.

44
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:57,828
Bring him along.

45
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:00,108
It'll be nice to have some
sophistication at the party.

46
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,748
I don't know if he's sophisticated.

47
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:05,588
Some friend of my mum's asked if we'd
have him. He might be a massive twat.

48
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:06,988
He's the French version of you!

49
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,908
Don't forget you have to bring
a girl.

50
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,547
I'd like it to be a
proper dinner party.

51
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,467
Can I ask your mum? No.

52
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,987
'So, after school we went
to say bonjour to Patrice.'

53
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,507
What's France like then Patrice?

54
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,947
Cool. And are French birds dirty?

55
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,387
Quoi?

56
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,467
He doesn't get any, he's all greasy.

57
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,707
Birds don't go for
that, French or not.

58
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:29,387
IN FRENCH

59
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,987
Pardon?

60
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,387
I thought you said that.
You'll be OK here(!)

61
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,427
What did he say?

62
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,587
Do you not speak any French?

63
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,267
No. That's why my mum was keen

64
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,467
for him to come over - to teach me a
bit. I've picked up "clope" so far.

65
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,787
What? Cigarette. He smokes.

66
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:53,027
Simon. You have porn?

67
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,507
Oh, for fuck's sake, I
keep saying... No I don't.

68
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,307
Internet?
No.

69
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,947
You can't get any
porn on the internet?

70
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,826
That's not the internet, Si.

71
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,986
Are you trying to get porn on the
washing machine?

72
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:05,106
My mum and dad have got a
filter on it. I can't see any.

73
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:08,026
That's fucking tragic.

74
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,466
What are you, 11?

75
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,146
Yeah, all right, mate.

76
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,266
See you later.

77
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:19,226
He seems a bit weird. He asked if
I'd tried the "sleeping beauty".

78
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,226
Oh, it's good that. You know it?

79
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,906
Yeah. You sit on your arm
till your hand goes dead.

80
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,146
Ten, fifteen minutes
is normally enough.

81
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,306
When you wank it feels
like someone else is doing it.

82
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,106
How do you know these things?

83
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,626
Everyone knows the
"sleeping beauty", that's old.

84
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,026
Is it?

85
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,666
Yeah, my mate's brother invented it.
He and his mates

86
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,226
used to be called the Dead Hand
Gang.

87
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,466
They had a gang
based on masturbation?

88
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,546
Nothing gay about that(!)

89
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:44,786
Yeah, well he's in the air
force now so how gay is that?

90
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,226
Still quite gay.

91
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,346
'So, my dinner party guest
list was shaping up nicely.

92
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:50,945
'Four idiots and a racist
Frenchman.'

93
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:53,465
It's going to be tricky to get girls
to come to your party.

94
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,505
Because you forgot and it's short
notice?

95
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,305
No, cos Louise
Graham's quite popular.

96
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,665
Most people will be at hers.

97
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:01,025
Please say you'll at least try to
bring girls.

98
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,145
This birthday can't be as depressing
as last year's.

99
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:05,305
What, because you got that
briefcase?

100
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,825
No - my father left my mother.

101
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,145
I'll see what Carli's up to.

102
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,785
Not being seen dead with you in a
million years is what!

103
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,065
Oh, I'm sorry, Russell Brand,
who are you bringing again?

104
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:17,065
Don't worry about me. I'm up to
my neck in sluts at the moment.

105
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,945
Maybe I'll bring my new fuck buddy.

106
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:20,985
That little barmaid
from the Fox and Hounds.

107
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,545
You've pulled a barmaid? Nice.

108
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,585
Has she got special
dietary requirements?

109
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:26,705
I've never cooked
for an imaginary woman before.

110
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,785
I know she's not allergic to nuts.
My nuts.

111
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:31,505
Brilliant. Or my cock.

112
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,385
She only eats small portions?

113
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,065
I didn't hear your mum complaining

114
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,985
although her mouth was full.
Good one(!)

115
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,305
Just drop us off here, Si.

116
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:40,145
Don't you want a lift to school?

117
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,344
This is close enough.

118
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,304
We don't want to be seen
getting out of this shit heap.

119
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,824
No offence, see you later.

120
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,224
Actually I might get out too.

121
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,464
Fine, see you at school.

122
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,744
Do you want to get in the
front Patrice? No.

123
00:04:57,744 --> 00:04:58,984
Great..

124
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:02,504
'They say the quickest way to a
man's heart is through his stomach.

125
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:05,264
'I was hoping it would be a way
into my female guests' knickers.'

126
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,304
What about a chicken casserole?

127
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:10,544
Why are you even asking? If it was
up to me we'd all have Big Macs.

128
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,104
Did you not see Super Size Me?

129
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,304
Yeah. It just made me
really want a Big Mac.

130
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,664
Oh, shit, Charlotte's online.

131
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,384
You asked her along yet?

132
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,824
No. I don't know if I should.

133
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,624
Go on, it'll be great.
Message her now.

134
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,504
Really, do you think so?

135
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,064
Yeah, it's cool, just say, "Hi".

136
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,304
All right.

137
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:29,344
Done it.
Oh, wow, she's come straight back.

138
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,943
She says, "Hi, whassup".
Smiley face. Urgh.

139
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:33,143
Ask her out.

140
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:36,063
No, can't just jump in, not the
way things have been with us.

141
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:37,423
Have to charm her a bit first.

142
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:40,943
I've written "Just hanging out
with Si and his French exchange".

143
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,703
She thinks you're handsome?!

144
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,903
Oh, no. She means Patrice.

145
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:49,943
Thank god.
Ugh, I'm a div.

146
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:52,263
Hmm, another smiley face.

147
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,143
Can't bring myself to send
a smiley back,

148
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,303
but I could
write "lol" if I absolutely had to.

149
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:57,663
Do that.

150
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,103
It's going well, mate, ask her out.

151
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,183
It's going well isn't it?

152
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,303
Definitely.

153
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,223
"It's my birthday.
Come for dinner?"

154
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,623
That pause isn't good.

155
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,343
Calm down, it's only been a second.

156
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:20,383
She was straight
back every time before.

157
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:23,342
Holy shit. She's gone offline
rather than answer

158
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,942
whether or not she'll
come to my birthday?

159
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,302
Maybe the connection dropped?

160
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,342
Nope, it was back and forward,
back and forward.

161
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:31,262
Then a question about
dinner and she's gone.

162
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,822
Brilliant, thanks a bunch(!)

163
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:34,462
Look, she didn't say, "No"
did she?

164
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:35,822
No. But she did hang up.

165
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,782
I'm sure she'll be there.

166
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:40,302
Well, not sure, but y'know.

167
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:41,982
Oh, hello, Simon. Oh.

168
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,302
Bonjour.

169
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,262
Oh, my goodness, you're French.

170
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:49,382
This is Patrice, he's my
sort of French exchange,

171
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,942
Patrice this is Will's mum.

172
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,422
Hello.

173
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,822
Well, erm, I'm just
going to play tennis.

174
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,462
Ha, don't know why I mentioned that.

175
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,062
Bye then.

176
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,382
Au revoir, Patrice.

177
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,662
Au revoir.

178
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,781
Your mother is very sexy.

179
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,861
Sorry?

180
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,541
She has the sex.

181
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,861
He's a strange one isn't he?

182
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,141
Yep, but he's French,
they're all weird aren't they?

183
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,741
Oh, god, please don't be racist.

184
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,941
That's not racist, I'm just saying
that he barely says anything

185
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,221
and when he does speak it's always
about sex.

186
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,701
Just like all French people.

187
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,141
The next day was my birthday.

188
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,221
Mum was serving me
up her speciality -

189
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,821
scrambled eggs and disappointment.

190
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:48,221
Happy birthday, petal. Thanks, Mum.

191
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,861
Here's your present.

192
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,621
It's nothing big because I'm saving
up for something special

193
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:53,981
next year, when you can drive.

194
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,741
Next year? I can drive this year.

195
00:07:56,741 --> 00:08:00,061
I thought you had to be 18 to drive?
No, it's 17.

196
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh, right.

197
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,020
Sorry, your father used to deal
with things like that.

198
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,300
Oh, thanks, Mum. Calvin Klein.
It is...

199
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,900
It's a tight vest top.

200
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,420
Don't you like the colour? Is this
the only present you got me?

201
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,660
What's wrong with it?

202
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,860
When have you ever seen me
wear something like that?

203
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,340
You'll look cool.
All the boy bands wear them.

204
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,740
I'm not in a boy band.

205
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,420
Fine. Fine. I've got a
receipt. You can exchange it.

206
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm sorry. I've ruined your big day.

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,100
I got it wrong about the driving
and about this.

208
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,220
No, Mum, sorry.
I suppose it's not too bad.

209
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,020
You don't want me to exchange it?
No, I'll wear it.

210
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,340
Tonight?

211
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,140
Errm, not tonight.

212
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,580
You hate it. I'll change it.

213
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,260
No, fine.

214
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,340
I'll definitely wear it tonight.

215
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,299
Patrice spends an awfully long
time in the shower doesn't he?

216
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,659
Yeah, about him. As it's Will's
birthday tonight,

217
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,099
could you look after Patrice?

218
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:04,579
No, you're meant to be learning from
him, Simon. Anyway we're going out.

219
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,139
Can't you take him with you?

220
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,859
It's a special night out for us.
We don't really need a 17 year old

221
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:10,219
French boy tagging along.

222
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,379
Things haven't got that
bad in the bedroom yet!

223
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:14,459
Jesus Christ.

224
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,339
He'll have more fun with you
and the boys.

225
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,419
He doesn't. He just sits around
rolling cigarettes and shrugging.

226
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,499
Must be useful having a handsome
Frenchman in tow to meet the ladies?

227
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:23,979
He's not handsome.

228
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,819
Patrice is handsome.

229
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,259
Aye aye! I'd better watch it!

230
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,619
Looks like your mother is lining up
a toy boy!

231
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,019
Oh, god.

232
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,699
Chance would be a fine thing.

233
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,539
Oh, not you too.

234
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,499
Remember, gorgeous. What I lack
in energy

235
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:37,779
I make up for in experience.

236
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,619
Oh, god, you two are disgusting.

237
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,778
Oh, come on, Simon, you used to
look at far worse on the internet.

238
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:51,258
'Elsewhere on the internet,
the dead hand gang

239
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,698
'was enrolling its latest recruit.'

240
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,258
Jay, Neil's here for you.

241
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:01,098
What? He's early.
Don't come in, I'm getting changed.

242
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,658
MOANING FROM COMPUTER

243
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,658
Are you OK? It's just a film.

244
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:09,618
A normal film.
I'm getting changed. Get out.

245
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,458
MOANING CONTINUES

246
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,938
What film's that, then?

247
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:15,138
Oh, right.

248
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,658
'Whilst I was making my final
preparations, including putting on

249
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:23,498
'shit music girls would like,
Patrice had been busy too.'

250
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:28,538
I just had a really nice, er
tug, thinking about your mother.

251
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:31,258
I think some went on the floor.
Sorry.

252
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,337
Great, thanks, Patrice.

253
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,817
I'll get it. It could be Charlotte.

254
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,057
Well, it's not
going to be Charlotte.

255
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,457
Cheer up, it might be. She's got
the details, you said so yourself.

256
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,657
All right, gays.

257
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,657
'Happy birthday to me.'

258
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:58,281
'It was 8.30pm on my 17th birthday,
and my party was in full swing.'

259
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,841
Where's your plus one then, Jay?

260
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:06,081
Not coming. She got a modelling job,
had to fly to Paris.

261
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:09,041
Barmaid by day, supermodel by night.
Sounds likely.

262
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,121
Where's Little Miss
Stuck-up Cock-tease?

263
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,041
Do you mean Carli?

264
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,240
Yep.

265
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,560
Oh, yeah, I don't
think Carli will make it.

266
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
Why not? Is something up?

267
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,640
No, it's nothing like that.

268
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
I just sort of didn't
invite her in the end.

269
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,120
You really are a bollockless
little twat, aren't you?

270
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,320
So there are going to
be no women here then?

271
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
None at all?
I don't know why I bother.

272
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
Well, I wouldn't say
there will be no women...

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Yeah, not no women!

274
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
So there are some women coming?

275
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,120
Maybe, maybe not.

276
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,280
Look, it's very clear from your
smirking faces and tone of voice

277
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
that actually
there are some women coming.

278
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,400
We got you a special birthday treat.

279
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,120
Did you?

280
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
Stripper!

281
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,840
What?

282
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,800
Have you really booked a stripper?

283
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,880
Yeah!

284
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,360
She was only 150 quid!

285
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,680
How did you pay for that?

286
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,000
We'll have a whip-round
when she gets here.

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,600
A whip-round?
Round who? The five of us?

288
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,120
We don't have 30 quid each!

289
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,239
No, if we all put in... Wait...

290
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,799
Oh, shit, yeah.

291
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,359
Brilliant. So just to confirm,

292
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:15,239
until an angry stripper turns up,
we are without any female company?

293
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,199
Thanks guys,
this is a great birthday.

294
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,399
If you're gonna cry about it,
I'll get some local snatch in.

295
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,319
What about them birds
we passed outside?

296
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,039
Yeah, they were all right.

297
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,919
Yes, please, drag some random
girls off the street for me(!)

298
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,199
Or we could go to
Louise Graham's party?

299
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,799
Yeah, why aren't we there? It's
got to be better than this shithole.

300
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,519
Thanks very much. More wine?

301
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,999
I bet it's crawling with clunge.

302
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,599
And I bet it's not!

303
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,999
Oh, yeah, and you'd know?

304
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,399
I've put lots of effort into this.
made a really nice coq au vin...

305
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,079
Cock of what?!

306
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,959
You don't help yourself, do you?

307
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,399
Oh, yes, I see.
"coq au vin", very mature.

308
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,359
It actually means chicken in wine,
doesn't it, Patrice?

309
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,719
Quoi?

310
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,238
Well, it does.
And it doesn't mean cock up my arse,

311
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:58,518
or cock on my head, or...

312
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,318
You got some cock
in the back of a van?

313
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:02,798
Or that I got
a cock in the back of a van.

314
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,678
Look, all I wanted was a
civilised and sophisticated birthday.

315
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:09,398
Just something a bit different
from the usual parties,

316
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:12,118
maybe even the sort of party
that girls are impressed by.

317
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:15,598
OK, so there aren't any girls here,
but why don't we at least attempt

318
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,558
to have a sophisticated conversation?
I know it's a tall order,

319
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:21,198
and I'm not expecting sparkling,
but give it a go, eh?

320
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:23,358
As it is my fucking birthday!

321
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,558
How much Lego
can you stuff up your bum?

322
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,118
Oh, for Christ's sake!

323
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,238
Not now, just when you was younger.
How much?

324
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,438
You are grim, mate.

325
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,678
Why were you sticking
Lego up your bum?

326
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:42,598
Not a lot, just like a
rectangular one and a long one.

327
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:43,798
< Couple of singles, maybe.

328
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,837
Fine, fine, let's see if those girls
outside want to come join us then.

329
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:49,037
Yes!

330
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,277
Are you sure, mate? I thought
you wanted this to be special?

331
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,757
Why fight it?
Charlotte's not coming, is she?

332
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:58,077
And a skilful raconteur like
Neil is wasted on just us.

333
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:00,877
Nice one. Now I get a proper
three-course meal,

334
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:03,757
blowie, shag and anal.

335
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,317
'So we headed into the night,

336
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,077
'and found Jay's three courses
sitting on a fence.'

337
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:09,077
'Allo, 'allo. Here they are.

338
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,517
Nice. >

339
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,917
They look a bit rough.

340
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,677
Are they drinking in the street? >

341
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,037
Dirty.

342
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:18,397
Not quite the sophisticates I had
in mind, but at least they're female.

343
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,917
You going over then, Jay?

344
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:20,917
Nah, Si should.

345
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,437
What? Why me?

346
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:23,397
Alphabetical.

347
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,197
You got that bent look girls go for.

348
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,957
Fine, if you're going to be rude,
you go then.

349
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,357
Sorry for being "rude"(!)

350
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,157
Just go, Si, it's freezing out here.

351
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:32,837
< Come on, Si. For me, yeah?

352
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,516
For my birthday?

353
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:36,956
God, all right then.

354
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,076
Hi, there.

355
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,196
What did you fucking say?

356
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:43,516
Erm, hello.

357
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,996
And what?

358
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,116
Um, I wanted to ask you to a party?

359
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,436
I'm 13.

360
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:49,676
Oh, right.

361
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,996
And she's 11, you nonce.

362
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,876
Yep, there's been a mistake, so...

363
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,076
Like looking at little girls, do ya?

364
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:58,116
Like getting them to parties
where you can touch them, do ya?

365
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:59,796
No, God, no. Look, I'm going now.

366
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,556
< Paedo!

367
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:02,476
You fucking paedo!

368
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:04,516
< Yeah, run, you paedo.

369
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,796
Fucking hell, don't do that,
Patrice.

370
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:08,236
I'm going to get my
fucking brother on you.

371
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,516
< That's it, run away, paedo boy.

372
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:11,436
Keep going, paedo!

373
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:13,476
< Keep walking, you fucking paedo!

374
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:14,556
Nice one, Si.

375
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:16,076
Me? It was fucking Patrice
who wound them up.

376
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,076
You tried to nonce them up.

377
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,556
I'm not in the mood for this,
just warning you.

378
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:23,316
"Ooh, watch out, Uncle Simon might
give me a special cuddle."

379
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:25,195
Oh, fuck.

380
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:25,915
What's for pudding, Will?

381
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:28,715
A middle-aged woman demanding
150 quid.

382
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,675
Oh, shit. What are we going to do?

383
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,275
I think we should go...

384
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,275
Yes, fine, I give up. Let's try to
get in to Louise Graham's.

385
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,275
What about your dinner party?

386
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:41,315
Forget it. You can lead a horse
to water but can't stop it sticking
Lego up its bum.

387
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,435
For Christ's sake,
Patrice, don't do that!

388
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,915
< God, Si, he's a nightmare!

389
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:49,515
We can't have him scare all the muff
away at the party, let's ditch him.

390
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,075
< I'm looking after him,

391
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,995
I can't leave him stranded
in a strange country.

392
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,955
He comes from a strange country.

393
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,555
Si, for once, Jay is right.
Patrice is weird and boring.

394
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,995
Do you really think girls will be
impressed when we turn up with that?

395
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:04,315
Probably not.

396
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:06,835
Let's just leg it while his back
is turned.

397
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,075
It's now or never, Si.

398
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,075
OK, fuck it, come on then.

399
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,795
'So we ran away. Yep, ran away.

400
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:17,394
'Something I hadn't done since John
Cook discovered wedgies in Year 8.'

401
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,234
I've got a stitch.

402
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:20,434
That should be enough.

403
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:23,354
He's behind us!

404
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:24,514
No way! >

405
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,154
Run!

406
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,834
He's chasing us!

407
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,474
Fucking hell,
he doesn't give up easily, does he?

408
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:34,874
What does he think is happening?!

409
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,674
I think he's caught us up.

410
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:37,714
Yeah, good spot, Neil.

411
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:39,194
Simon, why we run?

412
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,034
Erm, yeah, dunno.

413
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,074
You don't know?

414
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:43,034
Yeah.

415
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,314
So we stop?

416
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:46,114
Yeah, probably. Good idea.

417
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,354
Shall we go to that party then?

418
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:56,994
'So after trying and failing to
outrun a boy in Cuban heels,

419
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,994
'we headed for Louise Graham's party,

420
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,034
'which we definitely wouldn't
get into.'

421
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,434
Who's gonna ask if we can come in?
Will?

422
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,754
I don't even know her!

423
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,833
I stuck chewing gum in her
hair in Year 8.

424
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,793
Great. Anyone else fucked her off?

425
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,033
Out the way you Kwik Shit Shitters,
I'll sort this.

426
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,513
BUZZER

427
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:15,673
DOOR OPENS

428
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:18,993
Yeah?

429
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,553
Hello, Louise. I'm Will.

430
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,593
You can't come in,
there's too many already.

431
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:26,873
Look, we'll be no trouble, I promise.
I mean, look at us.

432
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,753
One of you can come in.

433
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:31,073
One, five, there's hardly
any difference,

434
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:32,153
perhaps we could negotiate...

435
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:33,673
Him.

436
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,273
He can come in. >

437
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:38,833
Oh, right, well the thing is, Simon
will have to come in, too,

438
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,513
he's supposed to be looking after...
Great.

439
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:44,953
So we can add Patrice to the growing
list of people more popular than us.

440
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,833
Fucking John's in there!

441
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,473
And he's with a girl!

442
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:50,353
He's got his hand on her tit!

443
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:51,833
This is too tragic. >

444
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,033
And Charlotte Big Jugs is in there.

445
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,393
Where?

446
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:56,512
Right. Time for Plan B.

447
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:59,712
Oh, right, there's a Plan B,
is there?

448
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,632
Plan A was so brilliantly devised
I wouldn't have thought we'd need
a Plan B!

449
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,512
What is it? Climb over her fence?

450
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:07,912
It's a bit higher than I imagined.

451
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:10,512
Don't shit yourself.
It's only a fence, it won't bite.

452
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,792
Yes, Jay, except I'm not worried
about it biting,

453
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,752
I'm worried about breaking my neck.

454
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,872
Come on, it'll be a laugh,
climbing and that.

455
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,592
Will it?
There must be another way.

456
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:22,232
Ah, it's full of clunge.
Give us a push, Neil.

457
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,272
I'm just not made for climbing.

458
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,552
Maybe one of these panels is loose.

459
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,912
There's a gap here!

460
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:39,152
Come on, Will. Hurry up!

461
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,112
Oh, please, no!

462
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,272
Why's he always gotta be different?

463
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:46,151
Just fucking hurry up,
you twat, everyone's looking.

464
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:47,711
What's going on?

465
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,591
Oh, hi, Louise.

466
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,511
As I was saying, it's quite important
we look after Patrice...

467
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,351
Have you just crawled
through my dog's shit?

468
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,911
Yes, I have. But ask yourself why?

469
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,111
That you've excluded us
from this party

470
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,511
because of some vague rules about
popularity is ridiculous.

471
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:06,031
Although it looks like we climbed a
fence and crawled through dog shit,

472
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:08,751
what we've done is challenged
your social apartheid.

473
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:10,751
You weren't invited
cos I don't know you well.

474
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,911
That makes sense too, I suppose.

475
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:15,271
God, if you're that desperate
then you can stay.

476
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,511
But take that jacket
off before you go inside.

477
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:21,231
Sweet, nice one!

478
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,991
She's right about
the jacket though, it stinks.

479
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:26,951
Oh, mate, that is rank.
It's all up your sleeve, look.

480
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,151
Oh, Christ!

481
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:32,111
What the fuck is that?

482
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:33,991
Oh, my God.

483
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,591
It was a present from my mum,
all right?

484
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,910
And you've worn it?

485
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,430
She been getting gift ideas
from Neil's old man?

486
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,470
Oi, my dad's not bent.

487
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,670
Honestly, that is not a good look.

488
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,150
Well, we've just gatecrashed a
party that Big John was invited to,

489
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,110
so none of us are winning
the cool prize.

490
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,470
But you are losing by a mile.

491
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,950
Not for long.
I'm going to find Charlotte.

492
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,790
Upstairs getting fucked,
most likely.

493
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,910
I've told you she's not like that!

494
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,150
I'll check upstairs first, though.

495
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,070
'The best thing about your birthday

496
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,750
'is everyone has to do exactly
what you want.

497
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,910
'With this in mind,
I went to find Charlotte.'

498
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,430
Nice T-shirt(!)

499
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,470
Yeah, good look, briefcase.

500
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,430
Someone's stolen your sleeves.

501
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,670
Yep, nice one.

502
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,950
Where's the rest of Take That?

503
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,070
Retro, but a good one.

504
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,350
Come on! Let me go first,
you know I'm desperate.

505
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,550
Ha-ha! Unlucky.

506
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,590
Don't be a cock!

507
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,390
No, don't.
Seriously, come on, I'm bursting!

508
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,790
Look, come on!

509
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,829
Oh, hi, Jay, are you queuing?

510
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,709
Yeah! I might piss my pants
any minute.

511
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,709
Oh.

512
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,909
Won't be too long,
been in there a while.

513
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,149
Oh, right.

514
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:44,429
So, didn't know you were
friends with Louise.

515
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:48,109
Oh, no, we're not,
we climbed the fence. It's cool!

516
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:50,029
Right.

517
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:52,109
Carli, hi.

518
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,269
Hi, Simon, how are you?

519
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,869
Good, yeah. OK.
Yeah, pretty awesome.

520
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,069
Jesus Christ, Simon, what the
fuck have you done in there?

521
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:00,829
What?

522
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,469
Have you been eating cat food again?

523
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,669
Oh, God, you've left skids
down the bowl too.

524
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,389
Carli, I didn't.
I only went in for a piss.

525
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:11,229
Oh, God, I can taste it.

526
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,109
Jay!

527
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,469
I might go upstairs.

528
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,309
No, don't. It was a wee.

529
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,829
It was only a wee!

530
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:18,668
I promise I didn't leave skids!

531
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:23,388
It doesn't smell at all, you fucker,
it was a wee. Why did you do that?

532
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,548
Funny.

533
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,948
'OK, so things weren't going
exactly to plan.

534
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:29,708
'But if I could just find Charlotte,

535
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,508
'I was confident it would
still be a birthday to remember.

536
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,108
'And I was right.'

537
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,188
Oh, hi, Charlotte, there you are.

538
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:40,188
Will! Um, could you go away?

539
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:41,788
Time out, fella!

540
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:44,708
You're not alone now.

541
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,348
Oh, Patrice...

542
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,628
Salut.

543
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:48,668
Salut.

544
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:50,588
Um, are you two...?

545
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,188
Seriously, what are you doing?

546
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:54,188
I thought we could hang out a bit.

547
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,828
Not right now, maybe.

548
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:59,028
Will, I don't know why you're doing
this. And what are you wearing?

549
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:00,988
I've got a bottle of champagne
at home,

550
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,468
and I remembered when we first met we
had champagne, as it's my birthday

551
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,708
I thought maybe...
Is he touching you, now?

552
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,907
Look, maybe we'll
have a drink later.

553
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:14,067
Yeah, later, course.

554
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,987
Oh, Will?
Could you turn the light off?

555
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:19,227
No, leave on.

556
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:21,147
OK.

557
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:23,707
'Great.

558
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:27,027
'And I'd rather hoped the singlet
was the worst birthday surprise.

559
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:31,547
'Meanwhile, my mates were
making the most of finally
getting into a cool party,

560
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:34,227
'by standing in a corridor,
not talking to anyone.'

561
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,067
All right? Did you find Charlotte?

562
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,827
Um, yeah. Yeah, I did.

563
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,027
Where is she then?

564
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,907
Upstairs being fucked by Patrice.

565
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:41,867
Knew it.

566
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:42,747
Ooh, unlucky!

567
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,027
Can you make him stop, please, Simon?

568
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:46,507
As a birthday present?

569
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:49,747
Um, not really.
Sorry, that's just too weird.

570
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,027
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

571
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:52,987
Shall we go then?

572
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,427
Oh, hi, Mark, I'm just off
but if you were looking
for Charlotte,

573
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:58,786
I think she's upstairs.

574
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:00,626
Fuck off, you prick.

575
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,746
Have a fun night!

576
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,666
'So, ironically, it was Donovan who
gave me the best gift this year,

577
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,426
'a savagely beaten French kid.'

578
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:08,986
What if Donovan kills him?

579
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,066
Good.

580
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,826
Mum'll go mental if
Patrice is hurt.

581
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,546
What's she gonna do,
get you a shitter car?

582
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:14,706
Fair point.

583
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:17,386
Fuck him,
you never see him again, so what?

584
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,626
I'm meant to
stay at his at half term.

585
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,026
Do you want to go to France?

586
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:20,306
Not really.

587
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:21,826
Well, shut up then.

588
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:25,586
What about me? It's my birthday
and I saw Patrice trying to mount
Charlotte!

589
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:26,746
The fucking baguette-eating
dickhead frog.

590
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:27,826
That's a bit racist.

591
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,866
He's made me racist.

592
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,306
Did you get to see her boobies?

593
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,346
No, Neil.

594
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:34,706
Funnily enough through my tear-filled
eyes, I couldn't see any tits.

595
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,866
Bad luck.

596
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:39,786
Oh, God, what if my birthdays just
get worse and worse from now on?

597
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,266
What'll happen next year?
You get AIDS?

598
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,186
I'd have to have sex for that.

599
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:44,186
Or fuck a monkey.

600
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:45,826
Technically that still counts.

601
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:48,106
Or drink from the
same cup as Neil's dad.

602
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:49,905
Oi, my dad does not have AIDS.

603
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:53,625
Your dad is so AIDS,
he's the one who gave it to monkeys.

604
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,425
Take that back.

605
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:56,105
That's what the monkeys said to him.

606
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:57,585
Come on, mate,
let's get back to yours.

607
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,185
I'll let you beat me at Pro Evo.

608
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,825
I can beat you anyway.

609
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,305
Well, we'll see, won't we?

610
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:03,665
That's them. Fucking paedos!

611
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:04,905
Run!

612
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:06,025
Again? Oh, good(!)

613
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,025
Split up, he can't get us all!

614
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:09,825
He's got a fucking cricket bat!

615
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:10,945
Neil, go away!

616
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,625
This is the tin hat.
Worst birthday ever!

617
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,305
'So my birthday, or dog shit,
singlet, heartbreak day,

618
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,025
'as I've come to think of it,
was over.

619
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,265
'It's fair to say it
hadn't been the best.

620
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,585
'But I had learnt
one important life lesson.

621
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:25,185
'If you go round to Neil's,
don't play with his Lego.'
