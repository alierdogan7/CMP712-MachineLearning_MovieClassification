00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,957
<i>Adi... -  Although going to the
court is beneficial to <i>her...</i>

2
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,631
In just 4 hearings the matter
will become <i>clear...</i>

3
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,967
And she will know what she
genuinely <i>deserves...</i>

4
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,766
<i>...and</i> what she should expect
from this company!

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,434
Look, I don't think we should
jump to any conclusions!

6
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,774
We are meeting here because we are
considering Mrs. Khanna's demands.

7
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,574
Consider? Who gave you
the authority <i>to...</i>

8
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:07,664
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

9
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:08,866
- Good morning, sir.

10
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,520
Hello, Mr. Kashyap.
Nice meeting you.

11
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,061
Sir. Photographs please

12
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,186
Congratulations!

13
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:38,274
Passengers, attention please,
this is the <i>train...</i>

14
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:43,288
...boarding to delhi
from Chatrapati Shivaji <i>Terminus...</i>

15
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:47,019
<i>...from</i> platform no.5 at 5:05.

16
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,028
Hey, hurry up.

17
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,638
Mister, hold this luggage!
- Let me get in!

18
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,174
Give it! Give it!

19
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,300
Give it to that gentlemen!

20
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,707
Ma'am, you quickly get in!

21
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,177
You don't worry about me!

22
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:07,645
Just load the luggage inside!
Quickly! Here!

23
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,772
Ma'am, I told you in the
beginning <i>itself...</i>

24
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,247
<i>...you</i> have luggage enough
for two coolie's!

25
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,379
<i>Here...</i> Hold the frame carefully!
Its Babajii's frame!

26
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,710
Is there more luggage?

27
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,721
Don't worry! No matter how much
more luggage there is. Let it come.

28
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:16,847
Here!
- Here! Here! Hold this!

29
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:17,981
This is really risky!

30
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,989
Ma'am, you please look ahead!
- Yes, I am!

31
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,255
You just quickly load the luggage!

32
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,668
Come on! Come on! - Give me
your hand! Give me your hand!

33
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:30,794
Come on!

34
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,928
Oh God!

35
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,198
This was the limit, I
crossed the line today!

36
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,137
Do you know what?

37
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,739
Till date I have not missed
a single train!

38
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:47,747
Thank you, Babajj! You saved
me from breaking my record!

39
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,217
I am inside now.
- Yes

40
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:53,750
<i>...</i> You can leave my hand <i>now...</i>

41
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:55,956
I am not that beautiful!

42
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,097
I prefer travelling in
a Non-AC compartment.

43
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,760
But my <i>family...</i> they
say 'you are a girl! '

44
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,701
As if I don't know that I am a girl!

45
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,297
Mister, is this A1?
- Yes!

46
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,765
Thank you!

47
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,310
Now what is the connection
between AC and a girl?

48
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:12,769
I don't understand that!

49
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:16,909
I am not travelling alone
for the first time!

50
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,783
That too in this train! This
is like my second home!

51
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,783
17, 18, ...here it is

52
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:30,987
Please show me your ticket.

53
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,131
Hello! I am talking to you!

54
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,801
Hey! This is my seat. 23!

55
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:43,732
Strange. Hey, mister!

56
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,077
This seat is mine! 23!

57
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,482
Nobody likes to take
the passage seat

58
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,954
But I always insist
on the passage seat.

59
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,821
The reservation uncle gets
very alarmed and worried

60
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,898
But my logic is <i>that...</i> my journey
doesn't end with this train!

61
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:09,892
I am going to Bhatinda.

62
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,294
My house is there.
My family is there.

63
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,169
Everybody has a family.
I have one too.

64
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,171
Everybody says that Mumbai
is a crowded city.

65
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:17,766
What do you mean by crowded?

66
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,311
People like us form the crowd!

67
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,838
They are a part of the crowd!
Still they crib!

68
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,315
I am leaving Mumbai! Forever!

69
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,177
Do you know when I came here?

70
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,786
When Mumbai was Bombay!

71
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:28,980
Hostel! Hostel! Hostel!

72
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,986
St Teresa's boarding school
hostel in Shimla!

73
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,321
Missionary hostel for college
girls in Bombay Central!

74
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:35,987
I swear! Henceforth I will never
live in a hostel again!

75
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:39,194
I hope the road digging
stops before the monsoon.

76
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,458
Otherwise do you know
what will happen?

77
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,994
Anyway! What happened?

78
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:18,094
What are you doing?!

79
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,567
<i>...last</i> time a kid fell and <i>died...</i>

80
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:23,900
It's really dangerous!

81
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,909
Are you dumb? You can't talk?

82
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:33,910
Or are you shy?

83
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:35,581
Or are you just insolent?

84
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:40,450
Something is surely the matter!

85
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,460
I have asked three <i>times...but</i>
still no answer!

86
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,588
Ticket please!

87
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:47,264
It's on the berth! I will
just give it to you!

88
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,999
Excuse me, mister! Ticket please!

89
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,401
Hello, mister! First
come inside! Come on!

90
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,935
Show me your ticket!

91
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:04,472
He wants to see your ticket. Ticket!

92
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:07,617
Where is your ticket?
- I don't have a ticket.

93
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,879
Actually you see what
happened is <i>that...</i>

94
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,891
<i>...his</i> plan was made at
the very last minute.

95
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,955
So there was no time
to buy a ticket.

96
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,089
By the way the train
is quite <i>empty...</i>

97
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,958
So you can give him a ticket now.

98
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:20,957
There is no problem, right?

99
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,563
Mister! Are you convinced
or shall I say more?

100
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:28,365
Ticket for where?

101
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,369
Hello!

102
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,106
Where is this train going?
- What?

103
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:43,318
Last stop. Delhi. Give
him a ticket to Delhi.

104
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:49,054
Look. I might as well tell you.
A tragedy has occurred with him.

105
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:51,521
He is going through bad times.

106
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,927
So that's why <i>he...</i> Delhi!

107
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,938
Oh Mister! What's the matter?

108
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,473
Are you doing drugs?

109
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:12,548
Look, if there is any problem,
then you can tell me.

110
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,544
I don't mind! Tell me!

111
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,219
All my friends tell
me their problems!

112
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,957
And I solve it!

113
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,017
Do you know? I am that
kind of a girl!

114
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,559
Like an agony aunt whose articles
you find in the magazines?

115
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,022
I'm just like that!

116
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,223
Tell me! What's the matter?

117
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,358
Tell me what is your problem?

118
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,436
Tell me! Don't feel shy! What
is your problem? Tell me!

119
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:32,695
You are my problem!

120
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,371
You are talking non-stop!

121
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,965
Don't you understand that I am not
interested in talking to you?

122
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,169
I don't want to talk to you!

123
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:41,509
I don't want to know whether you
are going to Bhatinda or Benaras!

124
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,310
Whether you lived in some
hostel or some brothel!

125
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,645
I just don't care! All right!

126
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,584
So just please! Please! Leave
me alone! All right!

127
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,530
That thing about brothel
was not right!

128
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:03,592
Yeah! <i>I... Iook... I...</i>

129
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,131
I know! You are clearly very
upset about something!

130
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,132
That's why you got
upset with me too!

131
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,400
And you started talking nonsense!

132
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,604
But it's okay! I don't feel bad!

133
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,672
Actually nowadays I don't
feel bad about anything!

134
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,074
Do you know why?

135
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,415
Because I am going to
get married! Very soon!

136
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,554
Listen! I am eloping!

137
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,087
The guy is not Sikh so
my family won't agree!

138
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:27,021
But what can anybody do
after the marriage?

139
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,754
We will go and fall at their feet!

140
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,153
They will have to forgive us!

141
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,094
I like mountains a lot! Really!

142
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:35,430
Since childhood I had this
craze for marriage! By God!

143
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,298
What is the difference between
hill and mountain?

144
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,769
I could never understand.

145
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,563
I was just waiting for my
college to get <i>over...</i>

146
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,165
And his travel agency to open up!

147
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:50,039
But you don't find good
shoes there. That's <i>why...</i>

148
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,336
Hang on!

149
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,409
Hey! The train is leaving!

150
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:27,683
Listen! Hero!
- What's his name?

151
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,611
Hey, mister!
- His name is mister!

152
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:31,350
Look here!
- Is he with you?

153
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,823
Oh God!
- Listen!

154
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:35,685
Listen!

155
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:38,421
Where are you going, ma'am?
The train is leaving!

156
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,692
The train is leaving!
- Ma'am!

157
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:42,492
Ma'am!

158
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,295
Ma'am!

159
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:46,699
Hey, black pant!
- Ma'am!

160
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:52,171
Hey, Mumbai guy! Listen!
The train is leaving!

161
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:53,636
Hello!

162
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,584
Are you mad? The train
is leaving! Come on!

163
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,179
What?

164
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,315
Go to hell!

165
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,796
Ma'am, what have you done?

166
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,125
Where are you running away?

167
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:18,670
Who will pay the compensation?

168
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,137
Leave me! The train is leaving!

169
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,200
Stop! Somebody pull the chain!

170
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,670
Stop!

171
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,545
Such a fat woman!

172
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,885
Even a blind man could
see such a big basket!

173
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,215
And this crazy girl!

174
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:42,359
Now I don't know in which corners
my tomatoes are lying!

175
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,629
I will pick it up from here! You
pick it from there! - Okay!

176
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,628
You stupid weirdo!

177
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:52,762
Which world do you live in huh?

178
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:54,901
I have missed my train
because of you.

179
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,573
My entire luggage has gone!
I have lost everything!

180
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,175
And now I am stuck in these
clothes and <i>slippers...</i>

181
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,578
<i>...</i> on this God forsaken platform
called Barnagar?

182
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,247
What will I do now?

183
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:06,910
Did I tell you to get
down from the train?

184
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,919
Can't you mind your own business?

185
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:13,181
Oh! So It's my mistake! Shameless!

186
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:16,727
I was helping you! You
should be thanking me!

187
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:18,591
And instead you are
showing me attitude!

188
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,723
Okay! Thank you! Thank
you for helping me!

189
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,326
Now will you please leave me alone?

190
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,330
Leave you alone?

191
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,265
I see! It's not so easy!

192
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,601
I have missed my train
because of you!

193
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,942
So now you will take me to Bhatinda!

194
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:38,615
To my house! Along will my
entire luggage! You see?

195
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:40,810
I am not going to spare you!

196
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:44,949
Don't have any doubt! I am
a Sikh girl from Bhatinda!

197
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:54,299
Hey! He is running away!
Nab this man!

198
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,835
Thief! Thief! Thief!

199
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:58,695
Thief!

200
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:00,238
Hey!
- Move!

201
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,705
Nab that thief!

202
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,432
Shameless! Throw away your uniform!

203
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:09,639
Ma'am!

204
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,717
Hey!
- Hurry up!

205
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,327
Yes! Come on! Come on! Come on!

206
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,804
Yes! God heard your prayers!
Now come on, move!

207
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,339
What are you doing?

208
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,010
How will we catch the
train like this?

209
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:47,883
You can't catch the train anyway.

210
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:53,358
Ratlam is the next station.100
kms away.

211
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,027
What do you know what you are?

212
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,028
He is mad! He is totally mad!

213
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,304
Stop the car!
- What?

214
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,698
Stop the car!
- What happened?

215
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,369
What happened?

216
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,310
O God! Couldn't you
hold it for sometime!

217
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,718
Get in! Come on!

218
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:25,052
Hey! What? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

219
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,391
Stop! Stop! Stop!

220
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,932
Don't disturb! There
will be an accident!

221
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,324
Mark <i>Three...</i> this a Mark
Three Ambassador.

222
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,065
Mister! Please stop! Stop!

223
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,341
Everything is shaking!
The car is shaking!

224
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,467
Everything is shaking!

225
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,601
You don't be tense! Listen to me!

226
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,408
This man is no ordinary man!
Look at his <i>style...</i>

227
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,539
He has lots of money!

228
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:52,743
I bought this car by
selling my <i>land...</i>

229
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:55,082
No good can be done by this!

230
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,880
Look, we all are in this situation
because of <i>him...</i>

231
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,883
If anything <i>breaks...</i> he
will pay for the damage!

232
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,090
You don't worry! I will
ensure that he pays!

233
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:05,421
Stop the car! Stop the car!

234
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,966
If anything happens to this car,
then everything will be ruined!

235
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,091
Nothing will happen!

236
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,571
Hey! My fare!

237
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,642
Where are you running away? My fare!

238
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,507
Give me my fare!

239
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,919
Hey! Where are you running away?

240
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,048
Hey! They are running away
without paying my fare!

241
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,050
'Passengers pay attention.'

242
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:39,658
The train on Platform no. 1
is 2137 Punjab Mail to Delhi.

243
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:40,990
The train will stop at
Ratlam for 10 minutes

244
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,124
Get in!
- What about you?

245
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:45,802
Look, don't try to help me anymore!

246
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,667
I am fine <i>alone...</i> All right!

247
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,799
My fare! Give me my fare!
- Stop!

248
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,933
You are running away!
- Hang on!

249
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,469
Ma'am, you were <i>saying...</i>

250
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,673
Money. I need to borrow some money!
I want to buy water!

251
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:00,942
I will return it in the train!

252
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,478
Do you have more? Its
full fare right?

253
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,549
Look, I am paying you alright.
You quietly stand here! Got it?

254
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:09,690
Water! I am breathless! By God!

255
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,422
Cold drinks have their own
place but <i>finally...</i>

256
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:13,829
<i>...only</i> water can
quench your thirst!

257
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,163
Its <i>said...</i> best things
in the world are free!

258
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,039
But now even water is no
longer free! How much?

259
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,498
14 rupees!

260
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,509
Why? Railway prices are cheaper!

261
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,768
Ma'am, this is the rate!
- Is that so?

262
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,980
Shall I ask the consumer
court what's the rate!

263
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:30,907
You are trying to fool me!

264
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,849
For 2 rupees you are
arguing so much!

265
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,452
If 2 rupees are nothing, then
why are you stealing?

266
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,454
Stealing?
- Then what?

267
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,990
And you are saying
that I am arguing!

268
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,516
Return my money!

269
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:43,719
Here!

270
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:09,011
Stop!

271
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,757
Stop! Somebody pull the chain! Stop!

272
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:20,563
Stop! Stop!

273
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,730
Hey, look at <i>her. -  She is alone.

274
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,264
Hey, let's go and ask her.

275
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:08,741
The next station is Kota. I
will call the station master.

276
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,549
He will keep your luggage there.

277
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,150
Nothing else can be done.

278
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,961
But how will I reach there? Shit.

279
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:27,097
Who told you to get
down from the train?

280
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,967
You should have been alert!

281
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:34,230
Now what will you do?

282
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,101
Zest of youth! You don't understand!

283
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,237
You don't understand!

284
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,982
<i>Look...</i> life is like
a railway <i>track...</i>

285
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:50,319
1 inch bend. And a distance
of many <i>miles...</i>

286
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:55,319
Your small mistake
can ruin your life!

287
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,657
Yes! I too have missed many <i>trains...</i>

288
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,598
But at that time I was a man!

289
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:10,064
I mean I am still a <i>man...</i>
<i>but...</i> you are a girl.

290
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,941
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

291
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,605
Yes! Do you know? Do you know?

292
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:18,741
What all things could
happen with you?

293
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,677
I will tell you! <i>Look...</i>

294
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,153
Excuse me! I want to ask <i>you...</i>

295
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,020
What you are <i>saying...</i> do
you charge money for it?

296
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,219
Or is this free education?

297
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:30,760
No, this is for free.

298
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,358
Good! Because I don't
have any small change!

299
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,964
Look, old man! Stop this nonsense.
And do your work!

300
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,160
Call Kota! The rest is my <i>problem...</i>

301
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,035
I will handle it!
<i>You...</i> Quickly call!

302
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:46,302
Come on! Come on!

303
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,041
A 23 Seat Number passenger's
<i>luggage...</i>

304
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:06,856
Your water!

305
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,794
I am not a thief! It's really bad!

306
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:13,268
What happened? What happened?

307
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:14,866
This poor girl missed her train!

308
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,337
There is no train till morning!
- O God!

309
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,279
Is she alone?
- Yes!

310
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,079
Now what will she do?

311
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:26,411
Exactly! Do you know?

312
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,881
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

313
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,684
Listen, don't try to act smart!
Got it? Get lost!

314
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:36,090
Am I a bomb that I will explode?

315
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,694
Try to understand, ma'am!

316
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,694
Before somebody tries to
take undue <i>advantage...</i>

317
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,428
<i>...I thought...</i> I will help you.

318
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,431
Don't let her stay here
at night <i>alone...</i>

319
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,105
You will have to take some trouble.

320
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,232
<i>But...</i> take her somewhere.

321
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,308
Yes. There is no other option.

322
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:58,306
Don't try to act too smart!
Got it? Get lost!

323
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,242
This is the limit! Nobody
appreciates decency!

324
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,720
Tell me! I am taking you to
the right place and <i>you...</i>

325
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:04,847
Shut up!

326
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,450
I will give you a slap
if you talk too much!

327
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:14,465
Let her slap you. At least
she will touch you.

328
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,994
Fine! If this is what makes
you happy, then slap me.

329
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,731
Fulfil your wish. Slap me.

330
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:26,802
Slap me!

331
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,146
Where are you going? Today I wont
leave before you slap me!

332
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,212
Mister!

333
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,417
Hey!

334
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,286
Oh no!

335
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:10,515
Hey! Come!

336
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,053
Come on! Come on!

337
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,526
Just one <i>man...</i> Full night!
My place! Come on!

338
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:28,330
I am not that!

339
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,332
What?

340
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:34,870
That!

341
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,411
Listen! If you want money,
then I will give it to you!

342
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:44,079
Why are you acting pricey?

343
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,221
Come on! Come!

344
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,218
Listen!

345
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,558
You drunkard! You come here
everyday! Get lost!

346
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,088
Come!

347
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,563
Why are you making me run around
at night? Listen to me!

348
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,366
I will pay you!

349
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,565
She is acting so smugly! Listen!

350
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:11,042
Thank you, Baba! Thank you!

351
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,375
O God! God knows what would
have happened today!

352
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,921
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

353
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,258
You missed the train again?

354
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,058
And who is this joker on the bike?

355
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,135
Hi! I am Geet!

356
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,600
Aditya!
- Aditya! Pleased to meet <i>you...</i>

357
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:41,873
<i>Infact...</i> I have never felt as
pleased meeting <i>anybody...</i>

358
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:44,279
<i>...as</i> I feel after meeting you today!

359
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:47,943
Because you are the one who has
started all these problems!

360
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,287
<i>Remember...</i> I told you not
to have any <i>doubt...</i>

361
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,891
I will not let you go! You
will escort me home!

362
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,158
I have seen that you have
money in your <i>wallet...</i>

363
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:02,094
We will stay in some
hotel till morning

364
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:04,235
Then we will go to Kota. Collect
the luggage.

365
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,430
And then all the way
to Bhatinda! Come on!

366
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:11,640
Come! You can give me this
look while walking too!

367
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,968
Come on! Come on! Come on!

368
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,914
Ratlam! Come on! It's the limit!

369
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:26,656
What does this mean? I am roaming
in the lanes of Ratlam!

370
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:30,918
From the train I would watch
these houses, these lanes!

371
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,987
Life is so strange! Right?

372
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:35,524
You are having a lot of fun, right?

373
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:37,192
As if we have come for a picnic.

374
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,335
You should be kept in a museum!

375
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:42,201
People should be charged
for seeing you!

376
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:47,141
What's the matter? And where
should you be kept?

377
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:50,014
You are in the train but you don't
know where the train is going!

378
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,011
You get down on some
unknown station!

379
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,949
Then you drive the car
like a crazy <i>man...</i>

380
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,954
...almost killing <i>me...</i>
you reach here.

381
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:01,350
And <i>here...</i> you are walking
in the dark lanes!

382
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,485
Alone! In the lanes of Ratlam!

383
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:07,959
What is your problem? Tell me!

384
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,159
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

385
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,299
You don't share your problems
with anybody!

386
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:18,238
Right! Are you Bachchan's
fan? Angry young man!

387
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:25,113
Today you will be very happy!
Agnipath! Agnipath!

388
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:29,986
Tell me! Who is your favourite hero?

389
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:33,719
Tell me! This is not a secret!

390
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:37,990
Where have I come? What
am I doing? Why?

391
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,667
Come on! Please!

392
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,407
Do you accept credit card?

393
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,013
No credit! Only cash!
- Credit card!

394
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,217
What's the tariff?
- What?

395
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,017
How much do you charge for
a room for a single day?

396
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,554
Do you need the room per hour?

397
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,028
Just answer what I
am asking you! OK?

398
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:18,433
How much for a room for a day?

399
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:20,095
Why do you need it
for the whole day?

400
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,230
We don't have to stay
here the whole day!

401
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:24,707
Listen, let me talk! - Yes. You
are talking a lot of sense.

402
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,101
As it is we have less money!

403
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,645
We will take the room
on a per hour basis!

404
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,236
Geet! You are not understanding
what he <i>is...</i>

405
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,782
Be practical! Why do
you feel ashamed?

406
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,574
We need it just for a few hours!

407
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,110
We will take the room
on per hour basis!

408
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,122
How many hours?

409
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,586
<i>2...</i> 2 hours will be enough?

410
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,197
Fine! To be on the
safe side 3 hours!

411
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:50,666
3 hours are more than enough!

412
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,468
3 hours!

413
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:01,470
Ok.

414
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:15,218
Where did you find her?
- In the train!

415
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:19,161
In the train? You met
her in the train?

416
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,691
Nice idea!

417
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:26,637
Listen, how is the girl?

418
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,103
Hot! Beauty!

419
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,112
Thanks! 3 hours!

420
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,722
What were you whispering to him?

421
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,118
You are such a cartoon!
Do you know that?

422
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,124
Possible! But I know karate!
- So?

423
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,861
I am just informing you!
I am brown belt!

424
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:06,133
I see! I see! I see!
You know karate.

425
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:11,148
Meaning if I tried to rape <i>you...</i>
then you will use karate on me!

426
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,342
Right?

427
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:15,743
Possible! I mean yes! Absolutely!

428
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:20,283
I just look like <i>this...</i> But
I have beaten many people!

429
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:26,289
Don't worry! I won't rape you!

430
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:30,566
You can't do it!
- I don't want to do it!

431
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,164
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't!

432
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,237
Are you trying to provoke
me to rape you?

433
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:36,704
No! I am just trying to clear it

434
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,574
So that you don't get
any wrong signal!

435
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,701
I hugged you at the station.

436
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,905
And I said let's go to some hotel.

437
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,375
I don't know what you
must be thinking.

438
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:46,250
That too a man like you!

439
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,583
A man like me? Meaning?

440
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,245
Girls must be hovering
around you in Mumbai!

441
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,648
Those kinds of girls!

442
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,591
But let me tell you that I
am not that kind of a girl

443
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:57,252
Don't even think of it!

444
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,925
My thinking is orthodox!
One man woman!

445
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,797
And I have a boyfriend! Anshuman!

446
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:07,265
One and only! Forever and ever!

447
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,197
You will be happy to know that
I too am a one woman man

448
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,333
All right?

449
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:14,670
Look at this!

450
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:19,750
Show! Show! Show! Wow! She
is really beautiful!

451
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:21,476
You are very lucky!

452
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:26,953
No! I am not lucky!
- What?

453
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,822
Oh! So this is the problem!
This girl has dumped you!

454
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,771
Life has dumped me!
- What do you mean?

455
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,767
O God! The famous silence!

456
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,313
What is this great secret of yours?

457
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,972
I have told you everything!
Why can't you tell me?

458
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:57,653
Anyway! Look! Look at this photo!

459
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,256
This girl has ditched you.
Right? Hold this!

460
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:04,786
Burn it!

461
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:06,787
Come on, Geet! You can't be serious!

462
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,459
I am damn serious! Burn
the photograph!

463
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:09,864
What childishness is this!

464
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,459
Listen to me! Do this childish
deed! Burn this!

465
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:15,529
You will feel really good! Burn her!

466
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:17,666
Here!

467
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:21,278
Burn it! Burn it! No tension!

468
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:24,339
Burn it!

469
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,486
Okay! Now go to the bathroom!

470
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:39,892
And flush her out of your
life forever! Go!

471
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:05,380
Do you feel better?

472
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,383
You know what?

473
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:11,056
Doing this foolish <i>thing...</i>

474
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:13,320
I am actually feeling nice!

475
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,524
I am actually feeling better!

476
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,391
You were right!

477
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,065
See? And shall I tell you the truth?

478
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,871
You are not bad looking!
You are handsome

479
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:25,600
You seem to be rich too!

480
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:28,011
You will find much better
girls than her!

481
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:29,745
She was nothing compared to you!

482
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,746
Thank you. That's very kind.

483
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,751
I am telling you! Am I not a girl?

484
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:40,620
Any girl will be smitten by you!
You are of that type!

485
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:42,956
Look, I am getting married
to Anshuman and all that

486
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:46,360
But if he had not been in my
life then you never <i>know...</i>

487
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:51,961
Maybe I would have been smitten
too! Just imagine!

488
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:58,101
You like yourself a lot, don't you?

489
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,769
A lot! I am my favourite!

490
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:04,906
What happened?

491
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,384
I wish I too could
have been like you.

492
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:09,444
That is very difficult.

493
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:12,781
But you will find a better
<i>girl...</i> that's for sure!

494
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:15,449
Why don't you only find
a good one for me?

495
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,121
Tell me something. Do you like me?

496
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,392
What?
- Look! Look at me!

497
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,924
What kind of question is this!
Geet, don't be stupid!

498
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:25,060
Tell me!

499
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:28,405
Quickly open the door! Run!

500
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:30,464
Wear your clothes! And quickly run!

501
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,800
Give me the full amount!
- Hello! What happened?

502
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,810
There is a raid! There is a raid!

503
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:38,473
Come on! Come on!

504
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,608
Come on!

505
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:40,742
Come on! Come on!

506
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:43,413
Come on! Run!

507
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,422
Hey! What is going on?

508
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,424
We will have to run!
- Why?

509
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:48,550
Police!
- Police!

510
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,752
Come on!

511
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,020
Come on!

512
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,488
Quickly! Hurry up!

513
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:57,433
Everybody quickly run!
I will open the back door!

514
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:58,969
Listen!

515
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,504
What is going on? What happened?

516
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,843
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

517
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:10,506
What happened? Why are we
acting like smugglers?

518
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:13,446
Next time get some suitcase
to show to the police

519
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:14,644
That you belong to a good family

520
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,448
But I missed my luggage
in the train!

521
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,045
For the first time I am
seeing a train girl

522
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,919
Why don't you book a compartment
in the train?

523
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,982
Like those meant only
for two <i>people...</i>

524
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,118
I will tell you next time! Come on!

525
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:24,719
Come on! Come on! Come on!

526
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:30,525
What was he saying?
- Run! Run!

527
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,069
Please, Babajii! This is the limit!

528
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,470
Please don't give any more
excitement for this night!

529
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,209
Now please make this night boring!

530
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:54,549
The bus will leave in the
morning at 6 o'clock.

531
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,767
Are you feeling sleepy?
- No! What about you?

532
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:16,576
<i>That...</i> Why were you asking me
whether I like you or not.

533
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:21,575
Yes! Tell me! Do you like me?
- But why?

534
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,911
There is no answer for this why!

535
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,718
Do you like me? Nice, sweet, great?

536
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,258
Tell me quickly!
- Yes!

537
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,518
Yes?
- Yes!

538
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,725
If you like me, then you
will like my sister too.

539
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:39,267
Roop. My cousin. She
is just like me!

540
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:44,940
Listen to me. I am going
to elope every soon

541
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:48,738
With Anshuman! You
and Roop too elope!

542
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,072
Your problem too is the same.
Grandpa won't agree!

543
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:55,279
And then all four of us will live
together in the mountains.

544
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:56,747
We will have great fun!
What do you say?

545
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:03,288
Why don't we do this?
We both will elope.

546
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,755
We both will get married.
And live in the mountains.

547
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,091
Look, it's a convenient option.

548
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,758
If we don't go to Bhatinda now,
then we are eloping anyway.

549
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:14,971
<i>Look...</i> if you marry Roop then
I will be your sister-in-law.

550
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,097
Half wife.

551
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:17,835
What will I do with just half?
I want you completely.

552
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:22,307
You will get complete Roop.
And me partly.

553
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,108
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's
a bargain offer!

554
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:30,250
Yes. Half free with one!
Free! Free! Free!

555
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:35,116
That makes sense! But if I marry
you, the offer is still valid.

556
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,653
I am talking to you about
an alliance with my sister

557
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,328
And you are flirting with me!

558
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,792
Do you always talk nonsense?

559
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,267
Or today is a special occasion?

560
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,605
No! I always talk nonsense! You?

561
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,608
This is my first time! Actually
I have never met a girl like you.

562
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,669
Come to Bhatinda! I will
introduce you to one!

563
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:32,707
When we started walking.

564
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,650
The paths too started moving.

565
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:45,395
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

566
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:49,064
Come. Let's get lost.

567
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,728
Let's get lost somewhere.

568
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:57,667
<i>Come...</i> Let's walk for miles.

569
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:02,005
Where to go? It should be unknown.

570
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,811
When we started walking.

571
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,881
The paths too started moving.

572
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:18,890
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

573
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:43,720
Sitting like this, how will
we discover a new path.

574
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:48,123
You too walk. And I too will walk.

575
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:52,390
Only then will these distances
bridge someday.

576
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,333
Sitting like this, we
discover a new path.

577
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,461
Come <i>...We</i> both should have
no bond with anybody.

578
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,472
<i>Come...</i> Let's walk for miles.

579
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:08,810
Where to go? It should be unknown.

580
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:13,149
When we started walking.

581
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:17,082
The paths too started moving.

582
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:25,957
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

583
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,181
I don't like it without you.

584
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:52,119
I don't like it without you.

585
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,182
On opening the eyes, slumber says.

586
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,854
What fervour is this?

587
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:03,392
Here and there. God knows where.

588
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:07,198
This fervour is taking me.

589
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:15,945
Come. We will find
a way in this world.

590
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:19,547
Let's walk for miles.

591
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:23,881
Where to go? It should be unknown.

592
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,950
When we started walking.

593
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:32,226
The paths too started moving.

594
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:41,032
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

595
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:58,112
You are <i>great...</i>

596
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,255
I have never heard anybody
sing so well!

597
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,858
You should have been a singer!

598
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,593
A person doesn't always
get what he wants.

599
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,858
Why? I think that whatever a person
really, actually <i>wants...</i>

600
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:15,929
<i>...is</i> what he gets.

601
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:21,072
You know there was a time
when I really <i>wanted...</i>

602
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,077
There was no greater passion
in my life than music!

603
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:27,874
Your life is over now?

604
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,880
You are talking as though are dead!

605
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,015
Its not over <i>but...</i>

606
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,292
Now <i>music...</i> can't happen anymore.

607
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,887
Why? Why can't you do it?
What is your helplessness?

608
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,091
Tell me!

609
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:48,633
O God! Don't tell me! Fine!

610
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,301
But don't become an angry
young man again. Please!

611
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,968
Okay.

612
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,982
I will start the conversation
- Of course!

613
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:10,325
The water is so nice right?
- Yes!

614
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,059
Have you ever jumped in
such a lake before?

615
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:18,128
Geet, I think we should be leaving!

616
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:19,931
We should try it! We
will have great fun!

617
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,528
Hang on! Hang on! I wanted
to ask you something.

618
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:24,203
Have you ever consulted
a physiatrist?

619
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:26,539
O shut up!
- No! You need one, Geet!

620
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,943
Shut up! And let's jump! - Okay!
Just relax! Just listen to me!

621
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,482
Just think! We might not get the
chance to do such a thing again!

622
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,144
I don't want to do such a thing
ever! Have you gone mad?

623
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,017
You have tried being childish
right? You had great fun

624
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,683
Now try madness!
- Geet, relax! Listen to me!

625
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,027
It was so much fun!

626
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:55,038
You need a physiatrist!

627
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,037
Don't look here!

628
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,974
Have you heard Dharamraj
Kashyap's name?

629
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,717
The industrialist? Of course!
He died last year! Why?

630
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:14,515
I am his son!

631
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:28,731
<i>You...</i> are <i>Aditya...</i> Kashyap!

632
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:31,532
Yes!

633
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,202
Now you know me.

634
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,681
You are the Kashyap!

635
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:43,413
It was your mother that ran
away with another man?

636
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,423
Shit. Sorry.

637
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:54,161
Yes! It was my <i>mother...</i> who
ran away with another man.

638
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:58,024
Actually I heard it in the
news in this <i>language...</i>

639
00:45:58,102 --> 00:46:01,367
So it came out that way. I am
really sorry. Really, really!

640
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:07,442
No, Geet! I will have to hear it!
Why you are you saying sorry?

641
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,444
If somebody's mother
can be so <i>cheap...</i>

642
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,244
<i>...if</i> she can do such a
derogatory deed <i>then...</i>

643
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,118
Mr. Kashyap! You shouldn't talk
so disrespectfully about her

644
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,449
Why? That woman destroyed
my entire family

645
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:24,252
Because of her I will feel <i>ashamed...</i>

646
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:25,659
<i>...in</i> front of everybody all my life!

647
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,462
So why shouldn't I talk
disrespectfully?

648
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:32,796
Because she was in love!
- Love? Are you serious!

649
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,268
<i>Look...</i> she is your mother.

650
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,132
So it's difficult to understand
this about her.

651
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:40,075
But when somebody is in <i>love...</i>

652
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:41,805
<i>...then</i> nothing is right or wrong!

653
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,806
Who told you all this?

654
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:46,208
In which stupid novel did
you read all these lines?

655
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:49,152
Everybody says so! All
is fair in love!

656
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,279
Everybody lies! It's
all hogwash! Got it?

657
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,615
Yes! Yes!

658
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:02,091
Listen! You are so rich!

659
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,227
Elope with my sister! Everybody's
life will prosper!

660
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,165
<i>You...</i> are an original piece!
Do you know that?

661
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:13,701
There is no other girl like you!

662
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:25,513
She has come!

663
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,647
Coming!

664
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:31,185
Hi, Amrik!

665
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:34,322
She has come! She has come!
Geet has come, aunt!

666
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:38,329
So what's the plan?
- Let's see!

667
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,528
You come inside with me!

668
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:44,131
No, no! No, Geet! <i>I...</i> I will leave.

669
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:46,200
Where will you go?

670
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:49,737
I will be okay! Don't worry!

671
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:53,883
No! You come inside with me!

672
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:56,350
I can't let you go
like this! Come on!

673
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,552
Geet, really <i>I...</i> I got to go!

674
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:01,557
Look, my family is here! Don't
create a scene in front of them!

675
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:04,160
You stay here for sometime.
I want to talk to you.

676
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,752
Then you can leave! Come on!
- Geet!

677
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:08,222
Hi, mother!

678
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:10,893
Geet!
- Hi, sexy aunt!

679
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:14,360
The authorities in the hostel
didn't look after my niece well!

680
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:15,496
She has become so thin!

681
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:17,231
How are you?

682
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,170
Come! Come! Come on!

683
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,240
Uncle!

684
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,509
Greetings, grandpa!

685
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:31,245
Who is this guy?

686
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,919
He is my friend, grandpa.
- What kind of friend?

687
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:38,318
Grandpa, that is not so!
- What?

688
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,727
I <i>mean...</i> he is just a friend.
- Then why did you bring him home?

689
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,261
<i>Grandpa...</i> he is the one
who has brought me home.

690
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:50,739
I missed the train at
a station in the night.

691
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,266
If he had not been <i>there...</i>

692
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:56,211
You know. A girl travelling alone
is like an open treasure box.

693
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:59,606
I didn't even know him.
We met on the train.

694
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:02,617
Still he has travelled
so far with me.

695
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:05,211
To Bhatinda! To escort
me home safely!

696
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:06,818
No other kind of friendship?

697
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:11,226
Because in my <i>age...</i> in a
glimpse I get to <i>know...</i>

698
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:14,423
<i>...what</i> is going on between
a boy and a girl.

699
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:18,223
Grandpa, please. You
are embarrassing me.

700
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,428
Embarrassing you?

701
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:21,636
If you had any <i>shame...</i>

702
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:23,638
Then would you have come home
wearing such clothes?

703
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:25,240
If you can come home wearing
such <i>clothes...</i>

704
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,504
then in Mumbai you must
be roaming around naked.

705
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:32,306
What's his name?

706
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:36,651
Aditya!
- Aditya what?

707
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:38,653
Aditya Kumar!

708
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:42,316
Yeah!

709
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:46,320
What work do you do?

710
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:49,664
<i>I...</i> am a musician.

711
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,463
Dear, I am indebted to you!

712
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,400
Now you will have to stay
here for a week. With <i>us...</i>

713
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:02,268
So that we can thank you properly
- Okay!

714
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:04,678
May God protect you!

715
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,807
People in Mumbai don't eat much!

716
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:08,943
That is true!

717
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,816
Enough! Enough! Enough! Please!

718
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:12,287
Please! My stomach will
blow apart! Please!

719
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:15,814
What nonsense! Have you ever heard
of somebody's stomach blowing up?

720
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:18,418
Then what? It's really strong!

721
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,430
<i>No...</i> Geet! Geet! Geet!
Please save me!

722
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,628
You people didn't give
him buttermilk?

723
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:27,700
He has come to Punjab and
nobody gave him buttermilk?

724
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:28,829
I will get it!

725
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:29,964
What are you doing?

726
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,304
I have some work with
you! Come inside!

727
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:34,310
You have saved my sister!
I can do anything for you!

728
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,902
I made a mistake by
saving your sister!

729
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:38,038
Henceforth I won't save
anybody's sister!

730
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:43,514
Son, you go ahead. I will
get a night dress for you.

731
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:48,320
Okay. O God Amrik! I will die!

732
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,860
Nothing will happen! Come on!

733
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:53,920
You don't understand!
My stomach will tear!

734
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:56,856
You go and check whether the
guest room is open or not.

735
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:02,596
What happened?

736
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:04,732
There is a problem.
- Now what happened?

737
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,332
I had told you that here <i>nobody...</i>

738
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,742
...knows about <i>Anshuman...</i>

739
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:13,745
Geet! What are you doing?

740
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:18,751
Good that you came! Aditya,
she is my sister Roop!

741
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:21,950
Roop, he is Aditya! You
have to elope with him!

742
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,952
Geet! Think for a second
before you start talking.

743
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,488
And what were you doing inside?

744
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:33,364
Possessive! Already you
are feeling jealous!

745
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:36,371
Don't worry! We were not doing that!

746
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:40,637
He is a one woman man! He
will be faithful to you!

747
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:43,770
The room is open!
- So take him!

748
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,440
Why are you making
him stand here? Go!

749
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:53,981
Listen. You look there!
It's a secret!

750
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,456
Tomorrow morning get up early!

751
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:59,724
There is an old tractor in the
<i>field...We</i> will meet there!

752
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,924
Why?
- Bye! Goodnight!

753
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,465
Goodnight!

754
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:39,425
Wow! Today you are looking
very stylish!

755
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:42,029
You haven't seen anything <i>yet...</i>

756
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:43,838
Just wait and <i>watch...</i>

757
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:49,173
That's great! You speak
Punjabi so fluently!

758
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:50,707
That's my style too!

759
00:52:51,048 --> 00:52:53,846
From where did you learn how
to speak Punjabi so fluently!

760
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,977
<i>My...</i> my mom was a Punjabi!

761
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,514
Oh Yes! So why don't
you talk in Punjabi?

762
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:03,458
Just like that!
- You should do it, you know.

763
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:07,520
You woke me up at 5 in the
morning for this chit-chat?

764
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:11,466
No! There is a problem!
- What happened?

765
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:14,993
Manjeet is coming!
- Who is this Manjeet now?

766
00:53:15,072 --> 00:53:19,008
Manjeet Mann! They had shifted
to Patiala a few years ago!

767
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:22,536
Grandpa and the rest have fixed
my marriage with Manjeet!

768
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:25,008
And they are coming today to see me!

769
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:26,140
Hold on! Hold on!

770
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:27,608
Your opinion won't be taken
into consideration?

771
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:28,742
They will get you married
just like that?

772
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:32,220
Actually there is a twist
in the <i>tale. -  Go ahead.

773
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:35,549
These <i>Mann's...</i> they are
our old family friends.

774
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,823
Manjeet and I have been
together since childhood.

775
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,486
Everybody said that
we will get <i>them...</i>

776
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,225
...married when they will grow up!

777
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:46,032
I would feel nice to hear
that I will marry Manjeet.

778
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:49,834
While playing family, I never
let Roop be Manjeet's wife!

779
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:53,499
When we were 8 years old,
Manjeet and I <i>would...</i>

780
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:55,511
...stand on this tractor and
hold hands and say that

781
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,706
we will build our house
on those fields

782
00:53:58,115 --> 00:53:59,241
Then I grew up

783
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:02,116
And I considered this Manjeet
episode as a joke!

784
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:03,577
But yesterday I came to
know that my <i>parents...</i>

785
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,246
<i>...have</i> not grown up.

786
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:07,649
They are serious! Everybody
is serious

787
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:09,248
And now I am in trouble!

788
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:12,720
So now what?

789
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:13,922
I am running away!

790
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:17,658
You always talk of running away!
Don't even think of that!

791
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,531
It's really a cheap thing to do!

792
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:21,798
There is so many risks and
other problems <i>involved...</i>

793
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:23,597
There is no other option!

794
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:24,936
There are countless options!
- Like?

795
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:28,000
<i>Like...</i> tell your parents
about Anshuman!

796
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,737
They won't agree!

797
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:32,741
In fact they will trap me here
by emotionally blackmailing me!

798
00:54:33,016 --> 00:54:34,142
Bad option!

799
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:36,546
Look, if you can't explain
to your <i>parents...</i>

800
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,281
<i>...then</i> forget Anshuman!

801
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:40,614
Next option!

802
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:43,285
Don't marry anybody!
- Next!

803
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:49,225
Get Manjeet and Roop married!
- Next!

804
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,965
In the court prove that
Manjeet is impotent!

805
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:54,764
He is not impotent! Next!

806
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:57,231
How do you know? Hang on! Hang on!

807
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,906
How do you know that Manjeet
is not impotent?

808
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,636
You can tell!

809
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:07,647
You can tell? Did you and <i>he...</i>
- Next!

810
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:11,720
Did he tell you that?
- Next!

811
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:15,790
Did you see him with somebody?
- Next!

812
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:29,133
Mr. Dhillon! Great to see <i>you...</i>

813
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:30,664
All are fools!

814
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,666
Look, how happy they are!

815
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,338
What do they know that
I am going to elope!

816
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:39,211
Don't come too close to me.
They will misunderstand.

817
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:42,880
I am not going to marry here!

818
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,279
All these wrestlers will bash me up!

819
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:48,887
Endure it for me, beloved!

820
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:50,888
Let go of my shirt!
What are you doing?

821
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:55,358
This is a nice idea! To
stop this marriage!

822
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:57,099
This is the right option!

823
00:55:57,634 --> 00:55:58,828
You stay away from me! Got it?

824
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,297
Hello!

825
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,038
Hello!
- How are you?

826
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:13,182
Fine! Long time!
- 3 years almost!

827
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,845
After Jaspreet's marriage.
- Yes!

828
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,050
<i>And...</i> how are things in Mumbai?

829
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:24,650
You people too can talk!
There is no punishment!

830
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:26,856
She says to talk!

831
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:29,061
Aditya!
- Yes!

832
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,191
Listen!
- Yes!

833
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:35,933
Daarji's <i>calling...</i>

834
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:41,274
Come! Come! I will introduce him!
- Who is he.

835
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:44,806
He is Aditya! He is a musician!

836
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,281
You won't remember everybody's name!

837
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:49,208
So meet the main guest.

838
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:50,944
Manjeet Singh Mann!

839
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,083
Hi, Manjeet!
- How are you?

840
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:55,415
Sit!
- No, no!

841
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:58,217
He is a really nice singer!
- I see!

842
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,220
Shouldn't he be singing a song
on this happy occasion?

843
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:02,697
Yes! Why not?

844
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:05,826
No, no! She is just joking!
- No, no! I am serious!

845
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:07,430
Am I laughing? Look!

846
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:09,772
Ladies and Gentlemen!

847
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:13,436
My friend Aditya from Mumbai!

848
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:18,306
He is going to sing
a song for you all!

849
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:19,712
Uncle, no, no! Please!

850
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:20,841
Please!

851
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,715
So I want all of you to keep quiet!

852
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:25,311
Listen! Please!

853
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:29,385
<i>Look...</i> sit down everybody!
- Dear! - Yes!

854
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:30,784
Now you do sing!

855
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:34,124
Let me also see what Mumbai
people can do! - Okay!

856
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:46,902
Come! Come! Very good! Hey,
fellow! Get a chair!

857
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:48,802
Come!

858
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:51,873
Come! Sit! Sit!

859
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:55,409
Start!

860
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,488
Why are you all looking
at me like this?

861
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,294
I will get nervous!

862
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:11,891
No problem! Look here and
there! Here and there!

863
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,026
Don't look at him!

864
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:17,167
I am starting! You all
too please join in!

865
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,764
No problem!

866
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,906
We all too will join in!
We are Punjabis!

867
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,036
We need an opportunity
to start celebrating.

868
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:26,781
Okay! Silence! Silence!

869
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,976
Settle down! Sit comfortably!

870
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:46,199
A capricious, bubbly girl.

871
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,397
Her mesmerising eyes
are like daggers.

872
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:54,075
And her beauty is lethal.

873
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:59,405
When her beauty created rampage,
the discussion started.

874
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:03,810
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

875
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:07,550
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

876
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:20,169
A capricious, bubbly girl.

877
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,837
Her mesmerising eyes
are so piercing.

878
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,100
And her beauty is lethal.

879
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:27,972
Her deadly beauty is the
point of discussion.

880
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:33,978
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

881
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:37,844
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

882
00:59:58,408 --> 01:00:01,935
Whenever that girl
comes to the window.

883
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:03,878
Some see her and die.

884
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:06,006
And some die without seeing her.

885
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:10,284
When she would pass the lanes,
there would be festivity.

886
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:13,947
Every lover used to
celebrate and dance.

887
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:18,019
And the feast would begin.

888
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:24,030
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

889
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:27,965
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

890
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:48,323
My youth is yours in any case.

891
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:51,986
You need not try to steal my beauty.

892
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:55,993
My youth is yours in any case.

893
01:00:56,266 --> 01:01:00,066
You need not try to steal my beauty.

894
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:04,137
You need not try to steal my beauty.

895
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:08,070
Since childhood she had a beloved.

896
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:12,006
His task was to keep the
other lovers at bay.

897
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:16,078
The one whom he had to make
the queen of his heart.

898
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:20,084
She was crazy for somebody else.

899
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:25,090
One story ended and another began.

900
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:30,029
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

901
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,031
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

902
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:46,179
A capricious, bubbly girl.

903
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,576
Her mesmerising eyes
are so piercing.

904
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:50,243
And her beauty is lethal.

905
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,388
Her deadly beauty is the
point of discussion.

906
01:01:56,526 --> 01:02:00,053
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

907
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:04,130
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

908
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:08,132
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

909
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:12,072
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

910
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:21,415
We mainly deal in fertilizers.
- Okay.

911
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:24,086
And now we are going to enter
pesticide market too.

912
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,212
Is that so?
- Uncle is <i>planning...</i>

913
01:02:25,288 --> 01:02:26,346
Hang on!

914
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:29,749
Hit here! Come on! Hit!
Hit! Hit! Hit!

915
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:33,085
Superb!
- Go! Your papa is calling you!

916
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:36,431
O God!
- Now what are you going to do?

917
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,038
Is he coming?
- Who?

918
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:46,035
Manjeet!
- Yes!

919
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:49,311
Is he looking here?
- Yes! You stay away!

920
01:02:53,383 --> 01:02:54,441
Did he see?

921
01:02:57,053 --> 01:02:59,248
Manjeet, she is just playing
a drama! Stand straight!

922
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,449
O no! Manjeet!

923
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:10,260
Look, Manjeet! What you are
<i>thinking...</i> that's not true!

924
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,597
She is playing a charade!
Ask her! Tell him!

925
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,734
Yes, yes! He is right, Manjeet!

926
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,199
There is nothing between
us! I swear!

927
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:22,807
We are just by-the-way friends.
Tell him, Aditya!

928
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:25,547
Nothing had happened between
us even in Mumbai!

929
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:28,277
Nothing at all! Tell him!

930
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:32,612
Papa said he didn't call me!
- He is lying! I will come!

931
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:37,751
Listen, brother!

932
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:42,094
You are mistaken! There is nothing
between me and Geet!

933
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:44,099
We didn't even meet in Mumbai!

934
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:46,493
She was just playing a charade!

935
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:49,162
I might not be smart
like city people!

936
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,641
But I do have eyes! I can see!

937
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:55,304
She did all this to show you!
- Why?

938
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,243
<i>Because...</i>
- Tell me!

939
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,179
Why would she want to show me this?

940
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:02,246
You better ask her that!

941
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:04,586
As it is you both have known
each other since <i>childhood...</i>

942
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:36,810
Don't shout!

943
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,153
Are you mad? What
are you doing here?

944
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:42,885
Congratulations! You
ruined everything!

945
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:44,683
I had such a nice plan in place!

946
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:47,229
By now Manjeet would have
returned to Patiala!

947
01:04:47,297 --> 01:04:49,891
Now he says that he will
talk to me alone!

948
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,293
So I am going!
- Where?

949
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:54,364
What do you mean where?
I am running away!

950
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:58,163
<i>Geet...</i> don't ever do that! Okay!

951
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,768
I am doing it! Everything
is planned!

952
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:03,368
I have come say bye to you!

953
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:06,238
You are leaving now?
As in right now?

954
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:08,774
Yes! You stay here for a few days!

955
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:11,319
After that you go back
to Mumbai! Okay!

956
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:13,719
Hang on! Hang on! You
are running away!

957
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,724
And I should stay here!
- So?

958
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:20,185
Tomorrow Manjeet will open his
mouth and these <i>people...</i>

959
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:22,197
<i>...who</i> already think you and
I are having an <i>affair...</i>

960
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:24,199
<i>...they</i> will tie me with
their buffaloes!

961
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:27,202
Great! Then you come with me too!

962
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:31,797
If we run away together then their
suspicion will be confirmed!

963
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:35,603
Big deal! What difference
does that make to you?

964
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:39,272
Correct! What difference
does that make to me?

965
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:40,740
Come on!

966
01:05:53,229 --> 01:05:56,357
Listen! Did you tell Roop that
we are running away? - Why?

967
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:00,293
O God! Run!

968
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,428
Geet!

969
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:07,300
Geet!

970
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:09,436
Geet!

971
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:14,774
Geet!

972
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,309
What are you doing?

973
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:18,980
I will return in two days!
I will call you tomorrow!

974
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:20,988
And please! You are under my oath!

975
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:22,315
Don't tell anybody! Okay?

976
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:25,988
Papa! Uncle!
- What's the plan?

977
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:27,786
Geet is running away!
- There are many options! - Options?

978
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:29,856
We can either go to the railway
station or the bus stand!

979
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:31,324
But how will we reach there?

980
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,266
Let's see! We might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road!

981
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:35,668
Unbelievable, man!
- Come on!

982
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:36,796
This is your plan?

983
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:38,272
Let's see, we might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road?

984
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:39,467
Do you have any brains?

985
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:42,272
Did I know that Roop will see us?
Now why are we standing here?

986
01:06:42,345 --> 01:06:43,403
Let's go!
- Wait!

987
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:45,405
Why are you looking there? Run!

988
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:46,675
Not there! Here! Come on!

989
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:48,341
I am not going back!

990
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:49,680
You have created enough nuisance!

991
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:52,277
Now do as I say! Come on! Come on!

992
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:53,822
But why are we going back?
- Just shut up and run!

993
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:03,359
Where did they go?
- Towards the road!

994
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:04,898
You let them go? You
didn't stop them?

995
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,434
Satya, go and check! Hurry up!

996
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:08,361
Call the guys!

997
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:12,299
There is a staircase for
going to the terrace.

998
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,036
Why the terrace?
- Will you tell me?

999
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:16,369
Come on!

1000
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:19,906
Hey, quickly open the garage!
Take the jeep out!

1001
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,040
Found them?

1002
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:22,443
Where will they go?

1003
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:24,843
Where did you see them?
- They left from the gate!

1004
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:25,979
What happened?

1005
01:07:26,322 --> 01:07:30,053
I knew it! In the first
glance I recognized him!

1006
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:32,520
Raj, get my wallet from the room.

1007
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,722
I found out what is going
on between them!

1008
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:37,395
But you people are very
intelligent, aren't you?

1009
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,392
You people don't heed me!

1010
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:42,930
Where are you? Open the garage!

1011
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:44,397
Come on!

1012
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:51,071
What are we doing here?

1013
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,944
Look, Roop saw us going
towards the front gate!

1014
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,751
They would have easily caught
us in their jeeps and bikes!

1015
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,752
Now they will go out! They
will call other people too!

1016
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:00,880
They will search everywhere!

1017
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:02,083
But they won't search the house!

1018
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:06,487
So now we will wait here!

1019
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:09,354
Then at the right time we will
leave from the <i>backyard...</i>

1020
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,696
<i>...and</i> reach the taxi stand
on the other side.

1021
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:12,826
Got it?

1022
01:08:13,903 --> 01:08:16,428
You had even planned to elope
with that photograph girl?

1023
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:17,964
Come on, Hurry up.

1024
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:20,635
Have faith in God!

1025
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:24,778
She told us everything!
Why did she hide this?

1026
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,974
All this is that Aditya's doing!

1027
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:29,578
He only has corrupted Geet's mind!

1028
01:08:29,652 --> 01:08:31,779
Listen! Carefully!
- It's all his doing!

1029
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:32,912
You have high BP!

1030
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,389
He stayed with us! He
even ate with us!

1031
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:36,584
Don't get so angry!

1032
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:38,388
If I catch him, I won't spare him!

1033
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:39,587
We will thrash him!

1034
01:08:39,662 --> 01:08:41,459
I will thrash him black and blue!

1035
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:54,471
Where is your boyfriend meeting you?

1036
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:56,469
In Manali!

1037
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:00,080
He is not coming to
Bhatinda to meet you?

1038
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,542
Actually I have not been
able to speak to him!

1039
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:04,811
No man!

1040
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:07,418
Please don't tell me that
the man doesn't even <i>know...</i>

1041
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:08,821
<i>...that</i> you are running away for him!

1042
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:13,019
What are you doing, Geet?

1043
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,554
Why are you playing with your life?

1044
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:17,956
Because it's my favourite
game! Life!

1045
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,493
What's yours? Football? Badminton?

1046
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,501
I know! Car racing! Right?

1047
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,439
You <i>know...</i> I used to think <i>that...</i>

1048
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:25,565
...there are many problems
in my life!

1049
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,443
Now how to get out of this problem?

1050
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:31,777
You are so selfish! You are
thinking only about yourself!

1051
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:32,906
What about me?

1052
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:36,179
What about you? This is your
life! It's your plan!

1053
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:38,579
You are going to elope!
What am I doing here?

1054
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:40,588
I mean, I am taking the risk of
running away with the girl!

1055
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:41,987
People are looking to murder me!

1056
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,719
And I don't even get
the girl! Great!

1057
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:46,522
I told you to elope with Roop!

1058
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:53,601
You are having fun! Right?

1059
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:02,739
Uncle has gone to the
railway station!

1060
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:04,878
Has asked should we
inform the police?

1061
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:07,006
No! Don't inform the police!

1062
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,483
You have to go to school!
So go to sleep!

1063
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:11,478
Fine! I will check the bus stand!

1064
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:12,879
Take my cell along!

1065
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:19,757
Don't worry! Everything
will be fine! Just watch!

1066
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:24,632
You are consoling me, Geet?

1067
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:28,493
I will just take a flight
and go away from all this!

1068
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:29,696
What about you?

1069
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:31,097
The way you are handling your <i>life...</i>

1070
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:32,504
<i>...you</i> can get into a
grave problem, Geet!

1071
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:34,236
Do you realise that?

1072
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:37,512
Life is not just about fun
and merriment, Geet!

1073
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,707
You have to be serious in life too!

1074
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,041
Aditya, you were very
serious in life!

1075
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,246
What was the use?

1076
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:48,183
You got into a grave trouble too!

1077
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:52,526
What is going to happen
in the <i>future...</i>

1078
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,654
...nobody can control that.

1079
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,589
So I do what my heart tells me!

1080
01:10:58,134 --> 01:10:59,931
In the future I don't
want to blame anybody!

1081
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:02,594
That my life got ruined
because of you!

1082
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,538
No matter what my life <i>becomes...</i>

1083
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,935
I will know it's like
this because of me!

1084
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,067
So I will be happy!

1085
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,274
Too much philosophy, right?

1086
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,543
These <i>moments...</i> which we
are spending <i>together...</i>

1087
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:20,953
<i>...its</i> really a lovely time.

1088
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:24,957
Just watch! In the future we
will remember this and laugh!

1089
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,581
I will return very soon!

1090
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:48,641
Soon as I get married
and with <i>Anshuman...</i>

1091
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,583
<i>...I</i> will fall at their feet!

1092
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:53,587
They will scold me, taunt me.

1093
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:56,182
Then they will give their consent.

1094
01:11:58,794 --> 01:11:59,852
Let's go.

1095
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:04,262
Tell me the truth. What
I am doing. Is it right?

1096
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:11,869
No! What you are doing is not right.

1097
01:12:13,809 --> 01:12:16,607
But you only had <i>said...</i> that
when somebody is in <i>love...</i>

1098
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:18,943
...there is no right or wrong.

1099
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:20,940
All is fair.

1100
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:28,617
And if today I can understand
my <i>mother...</i> then don't worry.

1101
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,284
In the future your parents
will understand you.

1102
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:44,297
Come on!

1103
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:08,658
There is some reason.

1104
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:12,132
That I am enjoying
my life like this.

1105
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:16,730
What is in the breeze?

1106
01:13:16,806 --> 01:13:20,207
That a slight intoxication
has entered me.

1107
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:25,669
Don't ask what has happened to me.

1108
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:29,081
Coming in your path.

1109
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:32,677
Don't ask what I will get.

1110
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:37,958
Coming in your arms.

1111
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:44,894
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1112
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:46,700
O God!

1113
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:53,106
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

1114
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:27,800
I have broken all the
bondages of the world.

1115
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:30,806
I won't break my promise.

1116
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:36,148
You are half the part of
the tale of my heart.

1117
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:38,432
I am the other half, beloved.
