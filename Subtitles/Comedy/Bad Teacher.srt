00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,757
Regular mouth.

1028
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,724
TRISTAN: Atticus Finch
is a good lawyer

1029
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,977
because he's a good
person who's a lawyer.

1030
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,689
ELIZABETH:
Stupid point. Misspelled.

1031
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,867
Is this English?

1032
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:58,713
Are you fucking kidding me?

1033
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,590
Pathetic.

1034
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,140
This is why the Japs are overtaking us.
And, believe me, I don't mean you.

1035
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,427
But we're working
really hard.

1036
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,103
You're not working hard
enough. I need results.

1037
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,601
Class dismissed.

1038
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,700
I need that test.

1039
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,502
(ON PHONE)
Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey.

1040
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,959
Unfortunately, I'm not
gonna make it in today.

1041
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,384
Tom Sawyer!

1042
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:47,844
My grandmother took a turn for the
worse and it looks like she's dead,

1043
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,885
so I'm off to the funeral.
Wish me luck.

1044
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,849
Yo, Bitch Tits.

1045
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,183
I'm not gonna ask you again, dude.
I need those coupons mailed today.

1046
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,226
Consider it already done.

1047
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,446
Hi.
Back here. Come on.

1048
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:10,075
This is GHB. You take one
capful before you go to sleep.

1049
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,452
And you won't believe the difference
it'll make in your workouts.

1050
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,543
You'll look even more amazing.
What are the side effects?

1051
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,705
Diarrhea, heart palpitations,
nothing major.

1052
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,799
Just don't take it during the day,
you'll be out like a light.

1053
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,086
Out like a light.

1054
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,508
Hey, Bitch Tits,
you send out those coupons?

1055
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,882
I was not told about
any coupons.

1056
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,636
Well, I can't wait
to get buff.

1057
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:37,519
How about you send me some JPEGs,
so I can monitor your progress?

1058
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,898
You got it, boss.
(CLICKING TONGUE)

1059
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,062
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST: Good afternoon,
Illinois Standardized Testing.

1060
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,442
How may I direct
your call?

1061
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,815
ELIZABETH: Hi, my name
is Marjorie Goodman

1062
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,571
and I'm calling from
The Chicago Tribune.

1063
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,573
Who could I speak to
regarding

1064
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,997
the allegations of racial bias
on your standardized tests?

1065
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,037
Please hold.

1066
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,718
Marjorie?

1067
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:09,884
You must be Carl.

1068
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,182
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

1069
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,927
Of course. Sure.

1070
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,688
Hey. So did you find the place okay?
It was a good drive?

1071
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,811
Great drive.

1072
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,814
Listen, Carl, I know
that you're a very busy man,

1073
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,861
so I'm just gonna
get right down to it.

1074
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:29,943
I've been speaking to
various black citizens

1075
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:34,531
who allege that your tests are biased
towards white people and Orientals.

1076
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,207
Okay. Let me tell you
something right away.

1077
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,585
A, Orientals test better.

1078
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:44,840
B, every couple of years, we
get these cockamamie charges

1079
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,713
coming in from various parts
of the state. Let me...

1080
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,840
You should hear the things
that they call me.

1081
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:52,966
Racist, I'm fagatron,
I'm faggy Hitler, dick-breath.

1082
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,180
Okay? But I am not a racist.

1083
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,437
I voted for Obama.
You can quote me on that in your article.

1084
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,223
You know what I think
would help, Carl?

1085
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,443
For me to see one
of this year's tests.

1086
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,779
Oh. (SCOFFS) Sure, I can get you one easy.
No problem.

1087
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,151
Great. Great.

1088
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,484
On the day after the
schools administer them,

1089
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,568
I will shoot one
right over to you.

1090
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,913
I was hoping to see it sooner.
I'm on a bit of a deadline.

1091
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,788
So, no, that is absolutely
classified, unless...

1092
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,126
Unless you have one of these
bad boys right here.

1093
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,914
Wow. You know, Carl?

1094
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,292
Enough business for one night.
Don't you think?

1095
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,793
Tell me about it. Yeah.

1096
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,429
I think I'm gonna have another
drink before I hit the road.

1097
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,429
You know, it's like the freedom and
the wind in your hair, and the...

1098
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,644
Obviously, the image
that I wanna...

1099
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,230
But then the other side is,
like, mopeds are scary, so I...

1100
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,108
Count me out. But you seem
like such a wild man, Carl.

1101
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,442
Yeah, I mean...

1102
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,943
What turns you on, Carl?

1103
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,654
Everything.

1104
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,778
You wanna know
what turns me on?

1105
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,621
Sex in an office.

1106
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,118
Getting fucked really hard
against a wooden desk.

1107
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:05,954
Mine's metal.

1108
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,293
Even better.

1109
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,593
And voilà. So...

1110
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,971
This is the desk.

1111
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,929
Do you have anything
to drink?

1112
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,312
Yes, I do.

1113
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,811
Voilá!

1114
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:29,646
Ooh. White wine in
the office. Bad boy.

1115
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,988
Do you have any music, Carl?

1116
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,611
I have the Internet radio.

1117
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,652
I love Internet radio.

1118
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,198
You've come to the right
place, because I have that.

1119
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,793
See, I am not a whiz
at this computer here.

1120
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:49,464
It's relatively new,
and Grace, who is...

1121
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,297
...works with me on Mondays
and Wednesdays, and Thursdays,

1122
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,970
and I share her with
Greg across the way.

1123
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,508
Greg, across the hall, is actually
the guy who got me into spinning.

1124
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,222
Oh, here we go.

1125
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,023
Shall we toast?

1126
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,147
To new friends.
And new lovers.

1127
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,361
Mmm-hmm.

1128
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,496
I'm gonna take off my shoes.
Is that okay? Whatever, man.

1129
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,707
I'm gonna go hit the ladies' room.
Okay.

1130
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,458
There's a handicapped one,
it's way closer.

1131
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,926
Use the handicapped one,
it's way closer.

1132
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,730
(YAWNING)

1133
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,205
(SLURRING) I took off
my shoes.

1134
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,703
Oh, Carl.

1135
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,956
I wanna fuck you up
against the desk.

1136
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,875
I wanna fuck you
against the desk!

1137
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,548
Carl, I'm gonna need you
to pass the fuck out.

1138
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:19,756
Marjorie. I am going to
rock your vagina.

1139
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,214
(GROANING)

1140
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:26,766
That wine is good.
Marjorie, let's do this.

1141
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,605
Fuck me.

1142
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,640
(WHIRRING)

1143
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,780
Hello, titties.

1144
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:43,992
If anyone has any information
regarding the missing Annie wig,

1145
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,114
please let me know ASAP.

1146
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,910
Come on, guys.
There's a wig missing.

1147
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,712
Because if that
wig isn't found,

1148
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,633
you can bet your bottom dollar, the
sun will not come out tomorrow.

1149
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:01,388
Back to you, Wally.
Okay. Thank you, Amy.

1150
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,636
I'm sure everybody wants to get
home, so I'm gonna be quick.

1151
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,431
Four score and
seven years ago...

(LAUGHING)

1154
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,811
God damn it, Sandy.
Sandy's so funny.

1155
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,200
I have here the results
of the state exam.

1156
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:26,743
And I'm happy to announce that the
John Adams Middle School, that's us,

1157
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,165
scored in the top 5%
of the whole state.

(SCREAMING)

1159
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:33,666
Nice.

1160
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,505
Good job, guys.

1161
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:39,168
And I wanna single
out one of our own

1162
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,262
who showed that
with hard work and dedication,

1163
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:45,682
one teacher can
make a difference.

1164
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,599
And this teacher is
now $5,700 richer,

1165
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:54,308
with the highest scores in Cook
County, that's the whole county,

1166
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,270
I want everyone to give
a big round of applause

1167
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,525
to Elizabeth Halsey.

1168
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,788
Well done.
Thank you.

1169
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:15,211
Congratulations, Miss Halsey.

1170
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,122
Thanks, dude.

1171
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,296
Well, if it isn't
Professor Smartypants.

1172
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,629
Don't mess with me.
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

1173
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:29,389
Hey. Elizabeth,
I am so proud of you.

1174
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,142
I mean, if someone told me at the
beginning of the year that you...

1175
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,315
You would get the bonus,

1176
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:41,488
well, I think I would've said to whomever
it was, "No way. Absolutely not."

1177
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:45,318
And now, here we are.

1178
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,028
We should go out and
celebrate. Your treat?

1179
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,868
Yeah, unfortunately,
Elizabeth,

1180
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,372
Scott and I have to go over the
itinerary for the Springfield trip.

1181
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,541
Yeah. We're the chaperones,
we're going together.

1182
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,875
We're dating, so it'll
also be romantic.

1183
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,636
How fun.
Yeah.

1184
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,088
You're not seeing
anyone now, right?

1185
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,428
Got my eye on someone,
but he's dating a major cunt.

1186
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,727
Pardon my French.

1187
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,230
No, no.
She sounds terrible.

1188
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,272
Almost done.

1189
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,686
Okay, so that's endorsed.

1190
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,567
And put the rest on these.

1191
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,864
Split it.
All righty.

1192
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,068
Book it.

1193
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,312

1222
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,146

message to the kids.

I think you're the one who might
be in some kind of trouble.

Did you or did you not give
her a copy of the state test?

1241

(STAMMERING) No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

1242
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,599
No, I did give her some
quotes for her article.

1243
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,183
What article?

1244
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,857
Her article for the Tribune.
She's a reporter there, right?

1245
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,528
Test tampering? At JAMS?

1246

said, Wally, she stole the Annie wig.

You know, when President
Lincoln abolished slavery,

1258
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,159
it was not a popular opinion.

Hmm.

slavery so, so much.

RUSSELL: Hey. All right, guys.

1366
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,552
Come on, settle down.
Okay.

1367
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,301
Let's see how Mary Todd's
doing with that butter.

1368
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,888
Okay, that's enough.
We get it, you're crying.

1369
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,595
She just laughed at me
and called me gross.

1370
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:06,057
Well, yeah, did you hear your speech?
Come on, let's go back.

1371
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,858
No. No, I'm not going back.

1372
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,231
Come on.
Just leave me alone.

1373
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,067
ELIZABETH: Shit.

1374
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,864
Garrett.

1375
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,157
Get your ass back here.

1376
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,544
We done running?

1377
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,091
Everything okay in here?

1378
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,002
It's okay. I'm his teacher.

1379
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,258
Okay. Take your time.

1380
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,346
She's never gonna like me, is she?
Are we still on this?

1381
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,893
She's my everything.

1382
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,687
Okay, here's the deal, man.
I cannot keep sugar-coating this for you.

1383
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:53,237
This girl is never gonna be
interested in you. Never.

1384
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:58,660
You clearly have a rich interior life,
with the poems and the whatever,

1385
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:02,238
but she wants a guy like
Ian what's-his-face.

1386
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,666
Ian Mendelbaum, the
rapper? He's an idiot.

1387
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:09,211
Yeah, he's a fucking moron.
But she doesn't care.

1388
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,916
She's superficial and her
priorities are all fucked up.

1389
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,545
She likes him because
he's hot and popular, dude.

1390
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,598
You are sensitive.

1391
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,516
Yes, thank you.

1392
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,385
It's not a compliment.

1393
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,469
Oh.

1394
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:29,231
You have some rough road ahead of you.
Seventh grade is not your moment.

1395
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,984
Yeah. Eighth grade
will be better.

1396
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,436
Probably not.

1397
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:37,899
I'm thinking college.
That's your window. Be ready.

1398
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,163
If I go back out there,
everyone's gonna laugh at me.

1399
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,295
Maybe this will help.

1400
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,500
What are you doing?

1401
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,960
I'm giving you a gift.

1402
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,045
Woah!

1403
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,261
We are gonna change
the news cycle.

1404
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,347
Trust me on this.

1405
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,353
I thought it would be heavier.
Don't be weird.

1406
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,401
And take this off, and never
fucking wear it again.

1407
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,228
What, are you crazy?

1408
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,613
Everything okay with Garrett?

1409
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:23,785
No, it's not.

1410
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,247
I found him hooking up with an
eighth grader from another school.

1411
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,042
She was jerking him off.
Yeah.

1412
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:31,915
I'm gonna give him detention
when we get back.

1413
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,413
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.

1414
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,466
Garrett probably made out with a
kid from an all boys' school.

1415
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,964
Yeah. And he was
wearing this.

1416
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,301
What?
Awesome.

1417
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,223
GARRETT: Yep. It's real.
BOY: Let me see it.

1418
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,763
That's a nice thing
you did.

1419
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,191
I don't know what you're
talking about. Really?

1420
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,566
'Cause I couldn't help but notice
that you're not wearing a bra.

1421
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,942
And those kids over there
are playing with one.

1422
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,155
Lots of people
don't wear bras.

1423
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,537
Definitely. Lots of teachers.

1424
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,408
Well, if you must know, I was helping
a student through a tough time.

1425
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:14,667
I'm going through such a tough time.
Can I have your panties?

1426
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,922
I'm not wearing any.

1427
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,429
Amy. What are you doing here?

1428
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:29,761
Scott, talk to the hand.

1429
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,937
Amy.
I know everything.

1430
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,361
Carl Halabi?
The state test?

1431
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:41,530
The blatant disregard
for the school syllabus?

1432
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,322
And let's not forget, the
sleeping with my boyfriend.

1433
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,455
Scott, your phone accidentally
called me last night.

1434
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:54,911
I can't believe you'd let her
take advantage of you like that.

1435
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,621
You are too trusting.

1436
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,130
I am.

1437
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,003
I didn't know what
was happening.

1438
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,835
I hope you haven't spent
that bonus check or anything,

1439
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,295
because you're about
to give it back.

1440
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:09,680
And then some.
Jail time. Jail time.

1441
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,312
Did you ever think that maybe...
Save it, doll face.

1442
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:17,688
You can explain it all tomorrow to the
principal and the superintendent,

1443

with the principal

1444

office and scare the shit out of him.

my mission again.

couple bucks for gas.

very school who use drugs.

1534
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,368
They do. They do use drugs.

1535
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:25,245
They do.
They do.

1536
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,540
They do.

1537
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,335
Wally, do you remember
how I told you

1538
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:32,210
there are teachers here
who use and abuse drugs?

1539
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:35,589
God damn it.
And I'm hearing about this now?

1540
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,925
POLICE OFFICER: What is it, Axel?
Where is it, boy?

1541
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,510
No, no, no.
That's my class.

1542
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,470
Axel's barking up
the wrong tree there.

1543
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:49,015
Ma'am. Please,
don't touch the dog.

1544
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,149
Your dog is mistaken.

1545
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,186
POLICE OFFICER:
What do you got, Axel?

1546
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,112
AMY: He's not gonna find
anything in here.

1547
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,497
It's clean.
Ha! I told you.

1548
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,415
Maybe there's a false bottom.

1549
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,130
That is not mine.

1550
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,262
This isn't even my desk.
It's hers.

1551
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,891
Don't worry, Amy.
We'll get you the help you need.

1552
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,025
You monster!
Whoa, lady.

1553
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,312
Calm down, lady.
Fucking damn it.

1554
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:41,116
What the fuck?
I stole her desk!

1555
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:46,413
You can check my urine.
Check it! Check my urine!

1556
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:51,039
WALLY: Well, it's been another
great year here at JAMS.

1557
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,752
With summer around the corner,

1558
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,331
it's time to say goodbye not
only to another school year,

1559
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:57,586
but also to one of our own.

1560
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,298
Amy Squirrel.

1561
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:05,383
After six short years, Amy is
transferring out of the district.

1562
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,058
Speech, speech.
Well...

1563
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:13,149
Uh, Wally, thank you for those
kind words, and thank you all.

1564
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:17,691
My decision that I made myself
to leave was super difficult,

1565
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:22,525
but when the superintendent personally asks
you to work at one of the worst schools

1566
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:26,612
in the state, well,
you say, "Yes."

1567
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:32,709
And, boy, I am looking forward to
bringing my brand of zany energy

1568
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,414
to those underprivileged students
at Malcolm X High School.

1569
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:39,879
Thank you.

1570
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:46,261
Hey, Elizabeth. Listen,
since Amy's transferring,

1571
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,683
maybe the two of us
can start over.

1572
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,853
Hey, there. Scott Delacorte.
And you are?

1573
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,814
Leaving.

1574
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:16,662
Elizabeth.

1575
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,085
Here.

1576
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:23,673
Sign my yearbook.
Hold my ball sack.

1577
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:31,177
I'm gonna write my number down just in
case you need a lift after the surgery

1578
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,852
or just, like, an extra
set of hands to make sure

1579
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,601
the implants are
settling properly.

1580
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,147
Thanks.

1581
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,772
Hey, you're not gonna teach
again next year, are you?

1582
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,195
I don't know.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

1583
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,740
I'm just saying maybe you should
consider doing something else.

1584
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:49,570
Like, anything else.
Like, any other job in the entire world.

1585
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,321
Hmm.

1586
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:57,745
You know, the two of us?
It's never gonna happen.

1587
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:01,297
Clearly.
I mean, how would that even work?

1588
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,375
Where do you even live?

1589
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,711
In some weird apartment
with some creepy roommate?

1590
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:10,265
No, my creepy roommate moved out,
so now it's just me and the dogs.

1591
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,301
How many dogs do you have?
Four.

1592
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:13,852
Four dogs?
Yeah.

1593
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,179
Four Dobermans.

1594
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:18,147
Any family money?
Yeah, you bet.

1595
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:22,603
We're talking like three
figures. Almost 700 bucks.

1596
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,198
So, basically, if I was gonna go out with
you, I would be making the conscious choice

1597
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:30,948
to be dating a gym teacher who
lives in a shack with four dogs.

1598
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:35,992
I prefer to think of it as two
people with amazing bodies

1599
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,452
sharing those bodies
with each other.

1600
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,500
Giving each other
the gift of these bodies.

1601
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,714
Anyway, actually,
none of this really matters.

1602
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,304
I sort of started
seeing somebody.

1603
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:51,756
Oh.

1604
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:57,729
Really? Congratulations.
I didn't realize that, so...

1605
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,523
Yeah.
I feel stupid.

1606
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,267
So...
I'm just fucking with you.

1607
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,488
I guess I deserved
that one.

1608
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,031
Yeah, you most certainly did.

1609
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:12,403
I think it's about time you realize
that the whole world doesn't just...

1610
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,086
See you around,
gym teacher.

1611
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,516
Hey. Let's do that again.

1612
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,364
Hey, Elizabeth.

1613
01:32:57,447 --> 01:32:59,324
Hey, Lynn.
How was your summer?

1614
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:02,953
It was great.
I went to the zoo almost every weekend.

1615
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,959
Wow, that sounds great.

1616
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,250
You didn't get
your tits.

1617
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:11,553
Yeah, I thought about it and, you know,
realized I don't even need them.

1618
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,881
Plus, they're really
expensive, you know, per tit.

1619
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:16,057
Yeah, and you gotta
get two of 'em.

1620
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:21,638
And I met a guy.
Tell me everything.

1621
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:23,564
Did you find your
Prince Charming?

1622
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,105
Something like that.

1623
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:33,158
Hey, you wanna grab lunch later?
Sure, yeah, my treat.

1624
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,235
You got it last time.
We'll split it.

1625
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:36,945
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1626
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:44,537
Hey. You in the cape.
You're up first, let's go.

1627
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,641
