00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,600
[ Woman ] Do you know
the expression "a man's man" ?

2
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,770
A man's man
is the leader of the pack.

3
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,780
The kind of man other men
look up to, admire and emulate.

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,740
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

5
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,370
[ Chuckles ] just doesn't get
what women are about.

6
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,870
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
I probably never
should have married him.

8
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

9
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,260
So, this is Nick Marshall's office.
Wanna peek ?

10
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,300
Don't worry.
He never gets in before 10:00.

11
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,180
He'll send you on more errands than
anyone in the entire company...

12
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,180
'cause he can't do
anything for himself.

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,180
He's like this total bachelor and the least
politically correct guy in the universe.

14
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,520
He's the king of all
the T&A ads we do.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,770
You want babes in bikinis ?
He's your man.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,400
My dad ? How can I
best describe him ?

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,530
He's always been...
like an uncle to me.

18
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,780
Yeah, Uncle Dad.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,030
Although,
Nick was a charmer.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,290
Completely irresistible
at first,

21
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,130
which feeds into
the whole "man's man" thing.

22
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,130
You know about
Nick's mother, right ?

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,920
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

24
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,300
you understand Nick.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,930
[ Woman ] Nick was actually
born and raised in Las Vegas.

26
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,060
Nick's mother was a real,
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

27
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,900
When other boys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,320
Nick was backstage
hanging with the girls.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
He was their mascot,
their little pet.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
They couldn't get enough
of those baby blues.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
- Bang ! Bang !
- [ Laughs ]

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,500
If you ask me, I'd say Nick's
mother just about killed it...

33
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,840
for every woman
Nick would ever meet.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,010
She had a lot of sugar daddies
in her life,

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,890
but only one true love--

36
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,720
the boy
with the family jewels.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,770
17, 18, 19, 20.
Let me see that, kid.

38
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,770
And since Nick
didn't have a father,

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,400
his mom made sure he was always
surrounded by strong male role models.

40
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,400
- Come here, huh ?
- [ Screams ]

41
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,160
- Men her little boy could really look up to.
- Now you're ready, huh ?

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,660
Keep countin', kid.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,410
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

44
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,500
So, what can you expect ?

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,840
You don't have to be Freud
to figure out...

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,050
this was one cockeyed way
to enter the world.

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,910
[ Groaning ]

48
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,460
Oh !

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,630
Don't you ever knock ?

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,260
It's almost 10:00. You gotta go
to work, and I gotta vacuum in here.

51
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,090
And don't forget - Another one
who wears vanilla perfume.

52
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,260
Don't you know any women
who don't want to smell like candy ?

53
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,970
- Toss me my lighter, could you babe ?
- Babe ?

54
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,180
What am I,
a little pig ?

55
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,390
I don't have time
to make you no onion bagel,

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
so please do not start
to beg, okay ?

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,020
And just for the record, I don't like
finding these things in your sofa.

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,530
What kind of woman
wears underwear like this ?

59
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,860
Hey, my mother wore
underwear like that, alright?

60
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,030
Just put them somewhere,
will you, babe ?

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,160
Well, "babe" is gonna put it
in the trash where it belongs.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,160
- So, your mother should excuse me.
- [ Sighs ]

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,370
Did you ever consider dating
a woman who wears real underwear?

64
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,880
You know, the kind that covers the entire
bottom the way it's supposed to ?

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,790
- No. But if I ever do, should I give you a call ?
- Oh !

66
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm gonna go clean
the kitchen.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel, could you ?

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,050
Light cream cheese, tomatoes.
Capers if we have any.

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,010
Please! Come on.
You know I can't think on an empty stomach.

70
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,350
Okay. All right. But only because
you didn't call me that pig name.

71
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,390
Okay, you got it, babe.

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,490
Mr. Marshall,
how are you doing today ?

- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry !

I absolutely
did not mean to do that.

- Here. Let me get that for you.
- It's okay.

No, I'm mortified.
I can see your hands are full.

- So, when do you find out ?
- Um, today, I think.

87
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,290
Unless I didn't get it, and then
I will just never find out.

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sure I didn't get it. They were
looking for an "earth mother" type.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,630
I overheard the director
say I was more space cadet.

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

- Is that true, can you ?
- Oh, better be true.

Oh, Lola, my love. When are you
gonna let me buy you dinner ?

Nick, I don't know why you don't
believe me. I'm not your type.

Trust me on this one. Cappuccino,

I like to think so.

- Next.
- You know, rumor has it...

about this now.

nothing happened after
you put her in the cab, right ?

be in bed early.

Not to worry. I'll make us a lunch

As a matter of fact,
it gets harder and harder.

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,950
- At least that's how I feel inside.
- You do, really ?

816
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,700
- [ Sighs ] All the time.
- Me, too, all the time.

817
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,950
So, let's just take it slow
and see how it goes.

818
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,660
Slow is good.

819
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,670
Slow is really good.

820
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,250
- Yeah.
- Are you free tonight ?

821
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,630
So, you don't think I'm gay ?
You're saying you never said that ?

822
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,000
- Right, I never said that.
- But that doesn't mean you didn't think it.

823
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,180
Is it the hair ? The highlights
happen to be natural.

824
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,680
- Morgan, I have a meeting.
- And you don't think I'm overpaid either, right?

825
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,060
- You never said that.
- I don't think I ever said that.

826
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,310
Okay.

827
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,310
[ Thinking ]
Who has he been talking to ?

828
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,310
- Morning.
- Morning.

829
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,320
Well, then check your E-mail.
I sent it over--

830
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,440
Hi, Annie.
How's the boyfriend in Israel ?

831
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,570
Oh, by the way, I want to thank you
for picking up that wine.

832
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,120
That's above and beyond.
I appreciate it so much. Thank you.

833
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,780
Uh, can I get you
a cup of coffee or, um,

834
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,830
some water
or any kind of beverage ?

835
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:09,170
No, but thank you. If I'm thirsty,
I know where the coffee room is.

836
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,840
That's right, guys, don't help.
Just walk right past me.

837
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,840
Why don't you step on
my hands, you big--

838
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,340
- Here you go. How you doing ?
- Oh.

839
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,180
Oh, fine.
Thank you, Mr. Marshall.

840
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,180
- You're welcome, um--
- Erin.

841
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,680
Erin. You be careful,
all right, Erin ?

842
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,890
Yeah, sure.

843
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,900
Heavy.

844
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,530
What do you know ?
There is life on this planet.

845
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,740
Breakfast Tuesday sounds great.
Absolutely.

846
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,410
Thanks for the info.
And thanks for the champagne.

847
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,840
You too.
Okay, bye-bye.

848
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,680
Set meeting, Nike,
women's division.

849
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,010
- Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,350
Well, you've been here five minutes.
Looks like you've been here a year.

851
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,390
Oh, yeah. I'm compulsive.
It's a problem.

852
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,360
[ Thinking ] Why do I always
feel like he's checking me out ?

853
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,860
I wonder what he's got
up his sleeve.

854
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,490
- Great photographs.
- No clue they're all Margaret Bourke-White.

855
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,410
They're not all Margaret
Bourke-White, are they ?

856
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,200
Yeah, they are.

857
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,250
Wow. It's
a beautiful collection.

858
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,040
- Thanks. So how's it going ?
- Mmm.

859
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,250
You know, I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

860
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,880
It's starting slow.

861
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,710
- I'm evaluating staff, that's hard.
- Oh, yeah.

862
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,760
Yeah, right.

863
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,060
Well, you know, I don't
wanna beat around the bush.

864
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,520
- What I'd like to propose--
- He's proposing so soon ?

865
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,070
- Oh, sorry. Sorry. [ Chuckles ]
- Oh !

866
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,740
- Uh, yes--
- Excuse me.

867
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,700
- You got another one. Wow !
- [ Darcy ] Thanks.

868
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,080
[ Chuckling ]
As I was saying,

869
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,790
I know nothing whatsoever about the products
you're going for personally,

870
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,420
but I do believe
I can sell anything...

871
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,130
once I know
what the buyer's needs are.

872
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,710
And what I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence of course,

873
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,050
is to go after
that really big fish.

874
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,130
I mean, the one
you really wanna land.

875
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,140
I'll learn what I need to know,
and I'll reel them in for us.

876
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,050
No, actually, I think
I'll reel them in for us.

877
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,020
That is, unless you're going after
something in particular yourself.

878
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,020
No. It's just that there're several
big fish out there at the moment.

879
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,560
Oh, yeah ?
Well, what's your biggest fish ?

880
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,610
To your mind,
who's your whale ?

881
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,150
Um, Nike--
women's division ?

882
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,490
You heard
they were shopping ?

883
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,570
I got wind of it.

884
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,450
- Amazing. I heard no one knew.
- You knew.

885
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,500
- I heard no one else knew.
- It's okay if I know what you know.

886
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,670
- We're on the same team. Besides,
- Yeah.

887
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,790
I heard someone say once
two heads are better than one--

888
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,300
- Oh, you were listening.
- More than you know.

889
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,130
Okay,
here's what I heard.

890
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,720
Nike is shopping,
quietly.

891
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,470
But if they make a change,
it's gonna happen fast.

892
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,770
Now, you know this is
a tough one for us to get.

893
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,350
It would be a tough one for anybody
to get, but if we got it--

894
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,640
- That's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

895
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,940
So, what do they want
exactly ?

896
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,030
They wanna empower women.

897
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,530
- What ?
- I'm sorry.

898
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,200
- That won't work.
- No, okay. I'm sorry.

899
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,200
- I understand. Go on.
- Listen, they wanna get inside women's heads...

900
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,830
and reach them
on a very real level.

901
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,500
Now don't take this the wrong way, but yesterday
you got jumpy talking about lipstick.

902
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,010
- I know.
- Nike is state-of-the-art hard-core woman power.

903
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,630
You sure you wanna
go after this one ?

904
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,340
You get 'em here in two weeks,
I'll be ready.

905
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,350
[ Chuckles ]
This guy is kind of exciting.

906
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,350
Hey !
Glad I caught you both.

907
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,180
- You got a minute ?
- Sure.

908
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,310
I want you to look at these boards
for U.S. Air before they come by.

909
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,520
- Right.
- It feels like something's missing.

910
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,570
Hmm. I don't like
the graphics.

911
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,820
Feels a bit parochial.

912
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,820
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

913
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,700
- What do you think, Nick ?
- I don't know who you've had,

914
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,290
but, I don't know,
it seems kind of--

915
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,750
What's the word ?
Parochial to me.

916
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,080
Um, what do you think,
Darcy ?

917
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,880
I totally agree,
especially about the graphics.

918
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,510
They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

919
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,510
Yeah ?

920
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,800
Why don't you get them to
try it in black and white ?

921
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,850
Might punch it up
a little.

922
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,060
What ?
Did you say something ?

923
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,440
No. I just swear I was
thinking the exact same thing.

924
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,730
[ Weak Chuckle ]
Were you ?

925
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,190
Black and white could really help.
Good idea, Nick.

926
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,450
Good idea, Nick ?
Speak up. Quick.

927
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,570
- Say something before he leaves.
- Uh, Dan ?

928
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,080
Want me to take another look at the boards ? Once
they have another stab at it, give me a buzz.

929
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,250
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan ?

930
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,790
In case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might--

931
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,420
- Oh, yeah.
- they may think it's old-fashioned--

932
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,800
I'd be ready with some--
maybe a dot com kind of thing ?

933
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,970
Maybe there's something about getting
on-line and being on-line at the airport.

934
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,260
No, I think we're fine, really.
Really, we're good.

935
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,890
- I like Nick's fix on this.
- Great.

936
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,310
Hey, you wanna come by later ? I got
a box of new Cubans, just came in.

937
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,610
- Great.
- Cool.

938
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,270
You smoke cigars ?

939
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,400
No.

940
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,610
You know, your office
is looking really snazzy.

941
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,990
- I love the red.
- Thanks.

942
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,280
Mr. Marshall,
your daughter's on line one.

943
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,120
- Oh. I'm sorry. Would you mind--
- Oh. Here you go.

944
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,670
He has a daughter ?
Didn't picture that. How old ?

945
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,250
She's 15. She's staying with me
while her mom's away.

946
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,300
- He's married ?
- Away on her honeymoon.

947
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,340
- Oh.
- Alex, hi.

948
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,470
Uh-huh. Oh, sure, honey.
No, that's great.

949
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,510
"Honey" ?
Who are you trying to impress ?

950
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,010
Okay, look, I'm gonna go out
with my friends after school.

951
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,970
Then can I bring them back to your
place, or will you freak out again ?

952
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,100
No, no, no, no.
No problem. Whatever you want.

953
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,150
- What time are you gonna be home ?
- Wait for me !

954
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,020
- I don't know. I gotta go.
- 8:00's fine.

955
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,610
I love you too.
Bye, sweetie.

956
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,030
Total shocker.
He's like a nice guy.

957
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:17,620
- Sorry, duty calls.
- Oh, of course.

958
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,450
- She's 15 ?
- Yeah. Got a boyfriend that's 18.

959
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,670
- And you hate that, right ?
- [ Groans ] Hate it.

960
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,040
Yeah. But she digs him,
and he's invited her to the prom.

961
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,880
- That's a big deal, I guess.
- Going to the prom is mostly about the dress.

962
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,010
- You know that, right ? Oh, yeah.
- Is it ?

963
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,430
Once you got the dress handled,
it's all downhill from there.

964
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,140
This feels like a date. Why did I
go into all that ? He needs to go.

965
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,350
Well, I'm out of here.

966
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,730
Do some research downtown,
get inside women's heads.

967
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,520
- Well, if you need any help--
- I'll be picking your brain.

968
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,820
- You got it.
- I'll take it.

969
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,900
Oh, God.
Candy.

970
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,530
She won't last a month.

971
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,370
Oh, I like that one, but it says
you can't wear it if you have hips.

972
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,950
- That one's cute.
- It's low-cut. I can't wear low-cut.

973

But you stood up for yourself. You know
how ahead of the game you are ?

1781
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:02,090
Anyway, a guy that treats you like
that and talks to you like that,

01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:04,630
- he's not--
- Worth my time. Yes, I know.

1783
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:08,640
- It's true. He's not.
- And he's a total game player, I hate that.

1784
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:15,270
You are so much smarter
than me.

1785
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,940
And look at you.

Honey...

you look beautiful.

01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:42,250
Thanks.

1790
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,510
Take me home, Dad.

What am I doing ?
She's not in the refrigerator.

01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,920
I wonder if it's too late
to go over there.

1793
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,210
No, it's not too late. It's never
too late to do the right thing.

1794
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:13,260
That's what I'll do. I'll go over
there and I'll do the right thing.

Hello ?

Uh, hi, it's me.
Oh, I'm glad I found you.

Hey.

1803

You need to what ?
It's 1:00 in the morning.

Okay.

Thanks.

So, you sleep here now ?

1808
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,850
I thought I might as well give it a
try before I have to sell the place.

1809
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,850
Sell it? You're not
selling the place.

Can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

You know, you ought to try
returning some of your phone calls.

1812
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:14,490
- You got your job back.
- Oh, do I ?

1813
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:17,070
- You're a riot. You know that ?
- lt's true.

Why would he tell you that ? I
didn't do the job he hired me to do.

What if I told you that...

1820
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:34,090
you did everything
that you were hired to do--

1821
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:38,430
everything-- but that
someone was sabotaging you ?

1822
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:43,640
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas and--

1823
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:47,940
Well, you-- you never
even knew what hit you.

- Oh, trust me, it's possible.

Well, who would do
such an awful thing ?

1826
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,950
I would.

1827
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,250
I was a dope
with a corner office.

1828
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:08,710
And when you came with the job
I was supposed to have,

1829
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:12,500
I mean, it didn't matter
to me that...

1830
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:15,920
you were better at it than me
or you earned it more than I did.

1831
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:20,890
As far as I was concerned, it was
mine, and I was gonna get it back.

1832
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:24,890
So I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

1833
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,400
Have you ever done that ?

1834
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,030

No, of course you haven't.

You wouldn't do that.
That's just--

And, uh--

1838
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:46,580
The problem with that was that while
I was digging the hole under you...

1839

I found out
all about you.

1840
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:53,040
And the more I found out...

1841
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:56,090
the more you dazzled me.

I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, he made you feel that...

1844

the price you pay
just for being you...

1845
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:14,400
is that you don't get
to have love.

01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,730
I'm the one that needs
to be rescued here.

I sure wish
I could read your mind.

1857
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:11,290
Well, I was thinking that, um,

1858
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:15,460
if everything you're saying
is true,

1859
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,630
if I really have
my job back...

1860
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:25,510
then I think you're fired.

02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:33,440
Well, I never-- I never really
thought about it from that angle.

1862
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:40,490
Well, not that
I don't deserve it. I-do-do--

1863
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:42,490
I'm stuttering.

1864
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,170
Now I feel kind of, uh,

1865
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:01,010
embarrassed that I told you
I needed to be rescued.

1866
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:04,930
But that's-that's fine.

1867
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,530
That's it ?

1868
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,910
I don't want that to be it.

1869
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,200
I don't want that
to be it at all.

1870
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:35,540
Then don't let a little thing like
me firing you stand in your way.

1871
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,420
I didn't know
what to react to first.

in shining armor would I be...

needs rescuing...

1876
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:57,850

walk out my door ?
