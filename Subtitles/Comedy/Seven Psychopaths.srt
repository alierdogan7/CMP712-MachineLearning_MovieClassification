down in Delacroix.

Because when I went down
into his basement,

572

you know what
I found down there?

573
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,983
I found the corpses of
two negro girls down there.

574
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,774
And then I found a half-alive
'nother negro girl

the girl's name was Maggie.

She told me all about the judge

579
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,510
and she told me what
a terrible man he was,

580

Maggie right then and there.

a little with me, too.

Well, we hung him from his
neck until he was dead,

me got this idea, see?

00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,663
Stop!
So he took out a...

859
00:54:57,742 --> 00:54:59,995
...cut-throat... Stop!
Stop, stop, stop.

860
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:01,249
What?
Yeah, what?

861
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:05,800
I just... I don't think
that's a very nice story.

862
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:08,720
I wanna know what
happens at the end.

863
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:11,173
Well...

864
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:12,758
So...

865
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:16,727
The killer took out a
cut-throat razor and as he

866
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:22,351
cut his throat open, he whispered,
"Now are you happy, old man?"

867
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:24,561
And the last thing that...
The killer ever saw...

868
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:28,857
That the killer ever saw, yes, was the
old man take out a razor of his own,

869
00:55:30,149 --> 00:55:31,867
put it to his throat and...

870
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:36,789
And slice.

871
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:48,092
That's a very good story.

872
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:52,797
Did you make that
up all by yourself?

873
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:06,353
HANS: Some of the details aren't
exactly right, of course.

874
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:10,861
I wouldn't necessarily call
myself a psychopath, you know,

875
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:12,991
and I didn't go
to Hell, obviously.

876
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:16,446
<i>I don't know if he did. Yet.</i>

877
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:21,997
<i>Our beautiful
daughter was black.</i>

878
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:23,498
<i>I don't think
you mentioned that.</i>

879
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:27,795
<i>And I was not on my own the
whole time, following him.</i>

880
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:30,672
<i>You know, you can't do that
kind of work all on your own.</i>

881
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,225
But looking back on
what's been wasted...

882
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,888
At the time, I thought
it had to be done.

883
00:56:43,014 --> 00:56:44,516
I'm not so sure any more.

884
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,069
Course it had to be done.
He killed your kid.

885
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:50,654
You had to fuck him over by any
means necessary. (CHUCKLES)

886
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:52,656
Well, as Gandhi said...

887
00:56:52,732 --> 00:56:55,952
Oh, you two. If it ain't
Gandhi, it's Jesus Christ.

888
00:56:56,027 --> 00:56:58,621
"An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind."

889
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:00,243

No, it doesn't. There'll be
one guy left with one eye.

893
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:17,639
How's the last blind guy
gonna take out the eye

894
00:57:17,715 --> 00:57:21,185
of the last guy left
who's still got one eye?

895
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,811
All that guy has to do is run
away and hide behind a bush.

896
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:27,942
Gandhi was wrong.

897
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:31,776
It's just that nobody's got the
balls to come right out and say it.

898
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,581
Hans, I'm trying to
write something about

899
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:36,208
the kinds of things
you're talking about.

900
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:41,073
Yeah. Would you like
to help write it with me?

901
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,328
You said I could
help write it with you.

902
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:44,927
Yeah, we can all
help write it with me.

903
00:57:45,618 --> 00:57:49,043
He doesn't even wanna help write it with you.
His wife just died.

904
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:51,965
I don't mind helping, as long as
it isn't gonna be too violent.

905
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:54,673
Of course it's gonna be too violent.
MARTY: That's the whole point.

906
00:57:54,752 --> 00:57:57,847
I told you 20 times, Billy, I
don't want it to be violent.

907
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:00,266
I want it to be
life-affirming.

908
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:02,477
Life-affirming?
Schmife-affirming!

909
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:05,267
It's about seven fucking
psychopaths! Hey!

910
00:58:07,056 --> 00:58:09,354
No, you know what I think
the movie should be?

911
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,154
The first half should
be a perfect setup

912
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,903
for an out-and-out
revenge flick.

913
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:19,201
Yeah.
Violence. Guns.

914
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:21,655
All the usual bullshit.
And then...

915
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:25,082
I don't know, man, it's...

916
00:58:25,157 --> 00:58:28,001
The lead characters
should just walk away.

917
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:32,424
They should just drive off into the
desert and pitch a tent somewhere

918
00:58:32,998 --> 00:58:35,717
and just talk for the rest of

919
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:41,550
the frigging movie.
No shoot-outs, no payoffs.

920
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,602
Just human beings talking.

921
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:47,179
What, are we making
French movies now?

922
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:50,308
That sounds like the stupidest ending.
No shoot-outs?

923
00:58:50,766 --> 00:58:52,939
That sounds like

Your women
characters are awful.

None of them have anything
to say for themselves.

946
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:15,817
And most of them
get either shot

No. The Vietnamese guy...

01:14:12,729 --> 01:14:18,236
My wife is sitting on a chair someplace.
Some gray place.

1193
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:21,868
I thought she'd be in Heaven,
but she's sitting on a chair

1194
01:14:22,572 --> 01:14:24,415
with a bullet in her head.

1195
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,040
I thought they'd have cleaned
that kind of stuff up.

1196
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:28,833
Maybe you've just eaten

1197
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:30,960
too many hallucinogenic
cactuses tonight, Hans.

1198
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,792
Nothing to do with
the hallucinogens.

1199
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,001
But you've just seen Myra

1200
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:36,553
on a chair with a bullet
through her head.

1201
01:14:36,628 --> 01:14:38,380
In some gray place.

1202
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:40,264
England?

1203
01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:42,558
It seemed a lot
worse than that.

1204
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:45,269
Wow.

1205
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:48,523
Listen, Hans, what say we talk
about this on the drive home?

1206
01:14:48,598 --> 01:14:50,692
I mean, we may find some
perfectly reasonable...

1207
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:56,443
Jesus.

1208
01:14:56,648 --> 01:14:57,820
Billy.

1209
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:00,614
Billy?

1210
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:08,789
(PANTING)

1211
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:13,965
BILLY: In the tent, dumbo.

1212
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:15,299
What?

1213
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,093
Now don't get mad.

1214
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:22,219
MARTY:
What the hell did you do?

1215
01:15:23,174 --> 01:15:24,972
I set the car on fire.

1216
01:15:25,802 --> 01:15:28,351
How the hell are we
supposed to get home?

1217
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:30,558
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert, Billy.

1218
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,483
Yeah, that's the least
of our worries.

1219
01:15:36,938 --> 01:15:38,485
What else did you do?

1220
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:40,112
I'll give you a clue.

1221
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:45,072
Come on in.

1222
01:15:45,363 --> 01:15:47,365
So, yeah, I just called
up old Charlie Costello

1223
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:49,543
and I told him where we were and
to come down and get his dog back

1224
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:52,497
and said if he had any trouble finding
us, just look for a Buick on fire.

1225
01:15:52,537 --> 01:15:54,289
But I did tell him to
promise to come alone

1226
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:56,090
and unarmed,
and he said he would.

1227
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:58,752
And he'll be here in a couple
of hours, depending on traffic.

1228
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:01,304
Now, I've labeled
these guns for you,

1229
01:16:01,379 --> 01:16:03,347
but you totally
don't have to use them.

1230
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,764
I won't think you're pussies,
but I'm gonna hang on to mine.

1231
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:08,123
I think we've
done enough of this

1232
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:10,388
"talking about peace in
the desert" type stuff.

1233
01:16:10,472 --> 01:16:11,598
Don't you?

1234
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:13,729
I do. This movie ends my way.

1235
01:16:18,646 --> 01:16:22,947
Well, that's just fucking great!
Oh, great!

1236
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:26,871
You know what that is?
Do you know what that is?

1237
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:29,787
Great? That's just
fucking great!

1238

(SIGHS)

1239
01:16:36,414 --> 01:16:38,382
How far is the walk
to the Welcome Center?

1240
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,300
We can't leave him.

1241
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:42,211
(STAMMERS)

1242
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:43,839
You ain't gonna fight.

1243
01:16:43,922 --> 01:16:47,051
Of course I ain't gonna
fight, but I ain't gonna run.

1244
01:16:47,467 --> 01:16:49,890
What are you gonna do, then?
I guess I'm gonna die.

1245
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:52,522
Friends don't make
their friends die, Hans.

1246
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:54,190
Psychopathic friends do.

1247
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,399
You're the one who thought
psychopaths were so interesting.

1248
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:02,403
They get kind of tiresome after
a while, don't you think?

1249
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,698
(MUMBLES)

1250
01:17:18,581 --> 01:17:22,677
Is that a guinea pig? It's a gerbil, isn't it?
That's enormous.

1251
01:17:22,752 --> 01:17:25,801
Hey, Marty, we just seen
some kind of giant gerbil.

1252
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,132
(GRUNTS) Oh.

1253
01:17:27,215 --> 01:17:28,432
(GROANS)

1254
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:32,478
Marty, you alcoholic
fucking bastard.

1255
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:35,894
You might wanna
stop drinking, Martin,

1256
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:38,272
if this is the way
you're gonna behave.

1257
01:17:39,185 --> 01:17:41,438
If this is the way I'm gonna...

1258
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:44,149
This guy just telephoned
a psycho-killer

1259
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:45,529
to come down
and psycho-kill us.

1260
01:17:45,775 --> 01:17:48,278
And this guy's doubting a
lifelong belief in the afterlife

1261
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:50,784
because of a psychedelic
cactus he just ate.

1262
01:17:51,114 --> 01:17:53,958
And you motherfuckers are telling
me to behave? Whoa! Whoa!

1263
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:55,785
Time out. What's all
this about doubting

1264
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:57,371
a lifelong belief
in the afterlife

1265
01:17:57,453 --> 01:17:59,000
because of a psychedelic
cactus you just ate?

1266
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,174
Hans, what the heck?
I met Myra.

1267
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,174
On the ridge.
She had some things to say.

1268
01:18:06,504 --> 01:18:09,053
About the afterlife being
non-existent or something?

1269
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:11,266
That was the gist.

1270
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:15,813
No, no, it might
have sounded like Myra.

1271
01:18:16,848 --> 01:18:18,316
But you know why?

1272
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:22,070
Now don't get mad, but you know

1273
01:18:22,145 --> 01:18:24,318
I can do Myra's
voice pretty good.

1274
01:18:25,315 --> 01:18:29,661
Yeah, I snuck up there a little while
ago and I pretended to be her.

1275
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,789
I started saying all
kinds of crazy stuff.

1276
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,833
But what specifically
did you say?

1277
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,082
About the place

1278
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:45,718
you were in.
The place Myra was in.

1279
01:18:46,419 --> 01:18:47,420
Huh?

1280
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,302
How did you describe it,
specifically?

1281
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:52,967
(STAMMERS)

1282
01:18:53,718 --> 01:18:55,345
You mean specifically?
Yeah.

1283
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:58,853
I just kind of said
it was all kind of...

1284
01:19:03,102 --> 01:19:05,855
I just kind of said
it was all kind of

1285
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:07,316
gray and shit.

1286
01:19:11,569 --> 01:19:12,616
No.

Oh, great, now I have to kill
everybody all on my own.

1290
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:08,255
Sorry for hitting you
in the face so hard.

1291
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:13,890
That's all right. It was a pretty
good punch for a pacifist.

1292
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:19,854
I love you, man.

1293
01:20:20,763 --> 01:20:22,265
I love you, too.

1294
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,025
Listen, if you're not gonna
be really doing any shooting,

1295
01:20:28,104 --> 01:20:30,698
maybe you should just go with
Hans, see he gets back all right.

1296
01:20:32,316 --> 01:20:33,363
Huh?

1297
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:37,118
I think I'll see how this plays out.
Sure I'm drunk now anyway.

1298
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:39,991
Yeah.

1299
01:20:41,492 --> 01:20:45,122
Seriously, Marty, you gotta do
something about your drinking

1300
01:20:45,455 --> 01:20:48,174

gonna wind up killing you.

when you're waiting
in the waiting room

01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:12,069
of the VD clinic, isn't it?

1305
01:21:12,523 --> 01:21:15,026
For the door to open and the
doctor to come out and say,

1306
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:16,986
"Billy, you're good to go."

1307
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:21,116

01:22:06,202 --> 01:22:07,579

And lift up your jacket.

01:22:20,716 --> 01:22:21,808
You shot him in the back.

him in the back.

Where's your guns?

1321
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,740
You said don't bring none,

1322
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:38,489
so I didn't bring none.

01:22:39,944 --> 01:22:44,040

It's a flare gun, Billy.

I think I'm gonna die. Well,
don't keep going on about it!

let you give him

him to a hospital.

Are you out of your
alcoholic fucking mind?

1342

You don't take the chief fucking

I said no.

01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:26,346
Why not?
I don't want to.

I don't care.

Too bad.

01:24:40,356 --> 01:24:41,608
Well...

1352
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:44,573
Where are your friends?

1353
01:24:44,652 --> 01:24:45,744
I don't know.

1354
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:48,289
Yes, you do know.
No, I don't know.

01:24:48,364 --> 01:24:49,365
You do know.

1356
01:24:49,448 --> 01:24:50,449
Shoot me, then.

This is just
un-fucking-believable, man.

01:25:07,758 --> 01:25:09,226
We can't just let
him bleed to death.

1360
01:25:09,302 --> 01:25:10,474
We totally can.
