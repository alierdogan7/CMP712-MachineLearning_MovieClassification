1
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,555
Kiss my buzzer, will ya?

2
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,874
Dombrowsky,
you having trouble with your back?

3
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,434
- No, Mr Gant.
- Then take more of those crates.

4
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,596
Kovak, load him up.

5
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,678
C'mon, c'mon.
He can take more than that. More.

6
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,552
All right. Now keep moving.
We haven't got all day.

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,790
Four crates of tomatoes
out of your pocket. The company says...

8
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,357
- You made me put 'em there, sir.
- You break 'em, you pay for 'em.

9
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,436
Did you hear me?

10
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,311
- I heard you, sir.
- All right.

11
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,592
Get down there and pick 'em up, boy.
Hurry it up! We're running late.

12
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,717
- Come on, we'll get 'em up.
- Get back to work!

13
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,397
What do you guys think you're doing?
Get back to work, all of ya!

14
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,112
Samuels.

15
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,071
Didn't you hear me?!

16
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,430
Samuels! You're fired!

17
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,874
- Get your voucher.
- I didn't hear you, Mr Gant.

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,468
Get out, get out. You're fired.

19
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,196
Johnny? Johnny,
I didn't hear him. I didn't.

20
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,229
- Hadn't you better get this fish inside?
- What's it to you, Mac?

21
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,999
The name's Monahan. Mike Monahan.

22
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,315
- Mind your own business.
- It is my business.

23
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,672
- It's gonna spoil if you don't get it inside.
- What do we care?

24
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,076
- I want the wagon unloaded.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

25
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,156
- I'm the driver.
- Hey!

26
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,348
What are you trying to pull? You know
where that stuff goes. Get it inside!

27
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,109
We don't need any lazy bastards
around here. You hear me, Belkin?

28
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,997
- You, too, Kovak. You're another...
- You call me a bastard, I'll lay you out.

29
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,073
Well, I guess a job don't mean nothing
to a rich man like you.

30
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,439
That's out of your pay, Kovak!

31
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
- What are you doing?!
- I wanna see Boss Andrews!

32
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,471
I'll give you Andrews.
You're fired! Get the hell outta here!

33
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,515
I wanna see Andrews!

34
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,758
Andrews! Andrews! Andrews!

35
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,554
I'm glad you told me about this.
You've got some legitimate complaints.

36
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,674
Let's agree on this. From now on, Gant
can't fire anyone without my approval.

37
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,756
How's that?

38
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,078
How about paying for something
you drop by accident?

39
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,557
From now on, anything that's accidentally
damaged, you don't have to pay for it.

40
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,070
What about overtime?
Being paid waiting for deliveries?

41
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,320
I won't lie to you. That's out of my hands.
I'll have to talk to my superiors. All right?

42
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,275
We'll try to be fair.

43
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,709
But to be fair all around,

44
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,832
you fellers'll go back to work
and move that load inside.

45
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,396
Wait. How do we know you're gonna
talk to 'em about the extra pay?

46
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,909
You have my word.

47
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,756
By the way, Mr Kovak, I'd like to praise
you for bringing this to my attention.

48
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,314
The problems will be corrected.

49
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,635
Do we have a deal?

50
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,558
All right.

51
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,636
We got a deal.

52
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,991
- Johnny Kovak!
- Lincoln Dombrowsky.

53
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,076
Abe Lincoln!

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,275
How about another round?

55
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,995
- Here's a new face. What's your name?
- Another round?

56
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,112
- Put it around.
- Shall I put it around?

57
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,835
- You break it, you pay for it.
- You pay for it!

58
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,474
- Look at the rosy cheeks. Are you Irish?
- What of it?

59
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,913
Why don't you take your hands off of me
and be a gentleman like your friend here?

60
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,349
A gentleman? Are my hands no good?

61
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,439
Hey, Johnny, you come on now.
We wrestle. Come on, for a nickel.

62
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,157
Well, I tell you, Jugs, it's been kind
of a hard day, but Abe is feeling good.

63
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
You wanna wrestle Jugovich? Come on!

64
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,956
Come on, Abe.

65
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,435
OK, all right. Put it down here.

66
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,636
Who's on me? OK.

67
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,392
- I don't wanna hurt you, Jugs.
- I think you need a bit more arm, Abe.

68
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,637
- OK.
- Zigi, you start us.

69
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,716
- Start it, Zig.
- Go!

70
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,599
Look who is here! Vince Doyle!

71
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,280
And look at that big-shot suit he's got on.

72
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,233
- Mm, mm, mm.
- You're slumming, Vince?

73
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,874
No, I just got
a little business with Zigi.

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,797
You hear about us at the company?

75
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,152
Listen, Vince. Johnny had their backs
to the wall. We almost had a walkout.

76
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,158
- We won, Vince.
- What did you win, kid?

77
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,598
- Zigi, set these guys up.
- Yeah!

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,956
Come on!

79
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,914
They won't let us in, John.

80
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,998
Number seven.
Number eight. Number nine.

81
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,352
What's going on here? What are you
doing? Samuels, where are you going?

82
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,835
- I gotta work, Johnny.
- I wanna see Andrews.

83
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,279
Well, well, well.

84
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,233
- Mr Kovak wants to see Mr Andrews.
- That's right.

85
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,275
Well, Mr Kovak, Mr Andrews is outta
town. But he left a little message for ya.

86
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,356
You're fired! All of ya!

87
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,472
- The winner.
- Who asked you, Vince?

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,478
You gotta go out
and try to save the world, huh, kid?

89
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,876
You know, it cost me a 20 to get you out.

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,073
- He said we had a deal.
- A deal? Christ, Johnny.

91
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,159
You don't go screwing around
with those people. You got no push.

92
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,473
He shook my hand, Vince. He shook
my hand, and he said we had a deal.

93
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,034
Yeah, sure.

94
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,473
Listen, why don't you come to work for
me? We'll make an honest buck together.

95
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,990
Always looking out for me, ain't you?
You need another stooge?

96
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,554
Johnny, rest it, will ya? Relax.

97
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,394
You don't understand us, Vince.

98
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,636
Johnny, c'mon.

99
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,796
Hey, kid.

100
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,036
Johnny! C'mon!

101
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,280
Come on, you guys. Cheer up a little.

102
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,356
Thanks, Moll.

103
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,191
Hiya, Johnny. Do you remember me?
I'm Mike Monahan.

104
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
I delivered that load of fish
the other night.

105
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,551
- The fish guy. What do you want?
- I thought maybe you're looking for a job.

106
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,636
- You did, huh?
- What kinda work?

107
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,197
I'm the president of the Federation
of Interstate Truckers, Local 302.

108
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,959
- The president is here.
- Have you heard of it?

109
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,312
- He's talking about the union.
- Well, it's not much of one.

110
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,796
Do you mind if I sit down?

111
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,912
I figure we got about 100 guys right now.

112
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,795
I don't know how you feel about unions,
but you've got a way with men.

113
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,036
Yeah, I did a lot for 'em.

114
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,470
The companies we work for
are filled with creeps like Mr Andrews.

115
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,558
You know, they smile
and then they stick it to you.

116
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,235
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Work for us as an organiser.

117
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,319
You go out to the warehouses
and sign up as many guys as you can.

118
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,990
What about my lawyer here?
We work together.

119
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,509
- All right, you both got a job.
- How much?

120
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,599
I can't pay you nothing. But I give you
a commission for every guy you sign up.

121
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,029
- I don't know about trucks.
- I'll show you.

122
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,833
- I'm not interested.
- You'd get an office.

123
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,155
- Might get even.
- They ain't paying.

124
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,669
You get a car.

125
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,950
You get a car?

126
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,195
Anna! Anna.

127
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,118
Do you remember me?
From the Christmas dance last year.

128
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,869
I asked you to dance three times
and you didn't wanna. Wait a minute.

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,389
Don't you remember?

130
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,752
In case you're wondering what my name
is, it's Johnny Kovak. What's yours?

131
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,032
- You know what it is.
- No, your last name. Everybody's got one.

132
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,914
- Zerinkas.
- That's pretty. Is it Polack?

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,034
- I'm Lithuanian.
- Not many Lithuanians left.

134
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,833
I thought most of 'em were dead.
Wanna go for a beer?

135
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,715
- For breakf...? I don't drink beer.
- Then let's go someplace and talk.

136
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,552
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Baseball, books, the Bible - I'm game.

137
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,793
- What do you know about the Bible?
- What do I know about the Bible?

138
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,629
- "An eye for an eye." It's a great book.
- Do you always lie?

139
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,673
If it helps me get along
with stuck-up ladies, why not?

140
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,472
- Where you going?
- To work.

141
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,797
- I'll give you a ride to the gate. C'mon.
- I don't go for rides.

142
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,357
C'mon, it'll impress your friend.
I just washed the car. C'mon.

143
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,552
You're embarrassing me.
You're making me look bad.

144
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,955
- Can't you even say goodbye?
- Bye!

145
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,277
Anna! Do all your friends there
know how stuck-up you are?

146
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,155
- What's your business?
- We're with the union.

147
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,953
Federation of Interstate Truckers.

148
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,437
- We just wanna talk to the guys.
- Park this outside. I'll go check upstairs.

149
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,312
Thank you.

150
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,874
What are you thanking him for?

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
Couple of union boys.

152
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,955
You can go on in,
but I need names first.

153
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,277
- Abe Belkin.
- Kovak. Johnny Kovak.

154
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,475
Keep an eye on 'em.

155
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,196
How are ya? My name is Johnny Kovak.
We're from the trucking union.

156
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,153
- We just wanna talk about...
- We're not interested.

157
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,430
- Aren't you...?
- We're not interested.

158
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,235
- I know what you said, but we wanna...
- You heard what he said.

159
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,396
- Yeah. What is your name?
- Richard.

160
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,469
Richard. OK, Abe, why don't we come
back? We'll talk to these guys later.

161
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,394
Who the hell are those guys?

162
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,031
Wait. My name's Johnny Kovak.
We're from the truckers'...

163
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,358
Give me a break, will ya?
Look, I pay my dues. Just leave me alone.

164
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,312
Come on! Five minutes!

165
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,396
Ah, to hell with him.

166
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,429
Got a meeting Friday night, St Stephen's
basement. Hope some of you show up.

167
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,516
Come on.

168
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,436
Come on, Johnny.

169
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,793
- How long we been out? 14 hours?
- 13. Three sign-ups.

170
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,878
We got two sign-ups and one maybe.

171
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,798
- Any trucks been around?
- It's been slow.

172
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,275
- Where's the driver of that rig?
- I don't know.

173
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,755
- Is he inside?
- I don't know.

174
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,829
Would you put in about 60 cents' worth of
gas? And check the oil, OK? Wait up, Abe.

175
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,355
- I'm beat.
- That's some rig.

176
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,232
Yeah.

177
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,755
- It's an independent.
- Mm-hm.

178
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,158
Higgins Hauling Service.

179
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,077
Hey, anybody in there?

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,236
- Get away!
- We're from the union.

181
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,920
- Bullshit!
- We're signing up members.

182
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,838
Last time somebody knocked
on my door, they took my load.

183
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,032
- Show him the card.
- Federation of Interstate Truckers.

184
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,948
- That's right.
- OK, you're with the union. Now go.

185
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,594
Don't you wanna do something
about the companies?

186
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,075
Sign up with the union,
they can't screw you.

187
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,998
Upside down they can screw you,
and start all over again.

188
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,758
Not if everybody signs up.

189
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,792
Yeah? I'll sign up when
everybody else has signed up.

190
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,912
We can give you more clout
with the companies.

191
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,395
You two guys!

192
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,155
- No, the union.
- Sure you don't just wanna collect dues?

193
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,475
You can make them
in what the union'll get ya.

194
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,318
Bullshit.

195
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,397
If you wanna end up like Joe Harper,
that's your business.

196
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,159
- What happened?
- Pushing too hard for the company,

197
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,511
went off the road, no insurance,
nothing for his family.

198
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,029
- He had a rig just like this.
- Wait a minute.

199
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,835
We got a meeting Friday night,
eight o'clock, St Stephen's basement.

200
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,599
Hey, what's your name?

201
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,631
Kovak, Johnny Kovak.

202
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,717
- What's yours?
- Tom Higgins. Everybody knows me.

203
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,750
I'll see you Friday. Won't I, Tom?

204
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,514
But I ain't gonna sign nothing.

205
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,278
You guys know that the companies have
been putting it to us worse than ever.

206
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,794
And the only way we got
of holding 'em off is by getting together.

207
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,199
That's what a union's all about.

208
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,518
All right, Joe. How the hell are ya?

209
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,558
All right, you guys. This is Johnny Kovak.

210
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,754
Most of you guys know Joe Harper.

211
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,477
Joe Harper was
one of the first guys with this union.

212
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,319
Paying dues for more than 20 years.

213
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,716
Showing up in meetings.
Doing what he was asked.

214
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,316
Being a brother.

215
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,193
All his life he runs from one place
to another to support his family.

216
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,471
The only damn the company gave
about him was to have him run more,

217
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,034
till he run himself off the road.

218
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,349
Now the company
don't give a damn at all.

219
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,948
But I wanna tell you guys something.

220
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,120
We ain't asking the company for nothing,

221
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,038
cos we're gonna take care of Joe.

222
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,913
We're taking care of his doctor bills.

223
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,033
We're taking care of his family.
Cos Joe's a good union man.

224
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,196
And we're taking care of him
and the people he loves.

225
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,233
And I'll tell you something else.

226
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,319
You join this union,
we'll get you money for overtime

227
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,871
and doctor bills.

228
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,436
You won't have to kill yourself
making a buck, like you're doing now.

229
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,835
Like my old man did.

230
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,069
You join this union, you make it strong.
It'll make you strong.

231
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,158
And I swear, no company bastard
living up in the Heights

232
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,034
is gonna come down here
and walk all over your lives.

233
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,230
I promise you that.

234
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,235
Come on, Joe. Let's go.

235
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,072
Where do I sign?

236
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,116
Yeah. We're doing pretty good.
We're up this month.

237
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,712
Yeah. That brings it up to 300. And we'll
be up to about 400 by three or four weeks.

238
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,389
Oh, yeah. Abe is out right now.
Growing big, aren't we?

239
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,034
It's Abe's idea. We split the billboard up,

240
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,879
and explain exactly
what the "FIST" stands for.

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,309
Uh-huh. Yeah, listen, Abe is still out.

242
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,830
I'll get back to you in a minute, Mike.
Yeah, OK. Bye.

243
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,719
Mr Kovak, I'm Arthur St Clair, general
counsel for Consolidated Trucking.

244
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,149
I know who you are.

245
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,119
May I sit down?

246
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,677
It occurs to me, Mr Kovak,
that we have some concerns in common.

247
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,997
In different ways,
we're both concerned about truckers.

248
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,112
You for the union and... your commission.

249
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,872
And I'm concerned for the company
and our profits, of course.

250
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,592
Of course.

251
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,677
It's been brought to my attention,
Mr Kovak, that...

252
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,634
you have a special talent
for communicating with drivers.

253
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,118
- I'd like to put that talent to work.
- Uh-huh.

254
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,919
- How you gonna do that?
- By hiring you to work for us.

255
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,555
Think about it seriously, Mr Kovak.

256
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,515
Think of the good you can do from
inside the company, helping our drivers.

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,029
What about the men?
What about the union?

258
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,636
Your associate Mr Belkin could carry on
for you. Money, of course, is no problem.

259
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,709
We'll be happy to double whatever you're
making now in salary and commissions.

260
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,838
- It's not bad.
- Very "not bad", I'd say.

261
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,950
You know something, St Clair?

262
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,631
When I first took this job, I had
a feeling that if I did a good enough job,

263
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,150
somebody would come walking up
those stairs - somebody like you -

264
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,034
and they'd sit in that chair
and tell me what you're telling me now.

265
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,199
And I knew then what
I was gonna say, and I know now.

266
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,838
Why don't you get the hell outta my
office? You're stinking up union property.

267
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,349
As you get older, Kovak,

268
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,679
you'll find that civility can be learned...
sometimes even taught.

269
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,788
You change your mind, give me a call.

270
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,156
- Anna.
- What do you want?

271
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,068
What's the matter?
Are you crying? What's the matter?

272
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,634
- Nothing.
- Did somebody do something to you?

273
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,910
- No.
- What's the matter?

274
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
- Don't you ever cry?
- I cry when I peel onions.

275
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,554
But you look like you're more upset
than that. Wanna grab some beer?

276
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,671
I told you, I don't drink beer.

277
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,236
How about some coffee?
No, you don't want no coffee.

278
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,715
How about ice cream?
Everybody likes ice cream.

279
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,799
What do you like? You like vanilla?
Chocolate? No chocolate?

280
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,992
How about strawberry?
I know you like strawberry.

281
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,112
I can see you smiling.
I know there's a smile in there.

282
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,676
There you go. Some strawberry?
I know a great place. Cheap, too.

283
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,438
Oh, no hands.

284
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,758
You mean you don't want me to touch
you. No hands? All right, no hands.

285
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,833
It's gonna be very difficult
driving with no hands.

286
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,791
But we'll work something out.

287
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,595
- Ever try to shift with your elbows?
- I've never been in a car.

288
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,473
Maybe by the end of the summer
we'll be up around 500.

289
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,831
The union is trying to make sure
no one gets stepped on,

290
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,599
because that's what
the problem's always been.

291
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,076
I was thinking that maybe
we ought to go see a show sometime.

292
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,399
At the factory where I work, two girls tried
to start a union, and they threw 'em out.

293
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,351
That's rough.

294
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,439
I read in the papers where they have
Ginger Rogers appearing nightly.

295
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,472
Down at the Orpheum.
You ever seen her dance?

296
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,559
No. And now they can't get a job
anywhere in this entire city.

297
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,114
That's rough.
Maybe I could talk to some people.

298
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,958
- Would you?
- Yeah.

299
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,596
The way you're eating that ice-cream
cone, you remind me of Ginger Rogers.

300
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,553
You do. Saturday night I'm free.

301
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,910
- I got plans.
- You got plans? Well, so do I.

302
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,996
Sunday night?

303
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,430
- I got plans.
- Sure got a lot of plans.

304
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,711
What do you think
you'll be doing next Easter?

305
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,799
- Are you always so pushy?
- Yeah. When I really want something.

306
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,519
Maybe I'll check my schedule. See if
I got a cancellation for next Saturday,

307
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,392
nine o'clock.

308
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,717
Strawberry girl, think you'll be available?

309
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,310
- No hands?
- No hands? I'll make you a deal.

310
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,192
What?

311
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,549
No hands, if I can have
this ice-cream cone. OK?

312
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,908
OK.

313
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,669
How you doing, Bob?
How's the wife treating you?

314
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,111
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Johnny.

315
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,233
A guy in a Consolidated truck wants
to talk to you. He might wanna sign up.

316
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,433
Thanks a lot. Watch out for
Myrtle's coffee. She's on the warpath.

317
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,189
- You want to see me?
- Yeah, about signing up.

318
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,117
Good. What's your name?

319
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,037
- Jack.
- Jack? Jack what?

320
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,277
Kovak? I wanna sign up, too.

321
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,516
Argh, God!

322
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,192
Argh!

323
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,872
Argh!

324
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,273
Come on and show
your cards or your buttons.

325
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,516
Show your cards or your buttons.

326
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,157
Tom, do you wanna close the doors back
there, so we can get the meeting started?

327
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,478
We have with us here tonight,
from Indianapolis,

328
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,036
a man you all know or heard about.

329
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,799
He's gonna swear in
all you new members.

330
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,799
A man who's a real legend
in the union movement.

331
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,434
Yeah. It's Henry Ford.

332
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,318
Come on, now, Tom, now.
Let's settle down, guys. Settle down.

333
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,318
Max Graham,
the national president of this union.

334
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,957
First, I want to thank Mike Monahan
for the fancy introduction.

335
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,712
I wanna talk to you guys about
something I been seeing every place I go.

336
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,353
Skirts!

337
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,635
Any of you real smart guys
wanna crack wise,

338
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,228
get the hell outta here and do it outside!

339
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,831
I don't wanna think the companies
sent you in here to disrupt this meeting.

340
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,595
What I wanna talk to you about
is this business of Bolshevik agitating.

341
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,996
- Have you come across any Bolsheviks?
- You know what I mean.

342
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,319
I seen 'em in Pittsburgh. I seen 'em in
Detroit. You got 'em here in Cleveland.

343
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,355
I wanna talk to you about
getting your dues in on time.

344
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,798
Pay your dues.

345
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,232
Johnny, how are you?

346
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,194
- Every bohunk in here know him?
- Yeah. Everybody likes Johnny.

347
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,788
Hey, Molly. He wants to go out with you.

348
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,469
- Who?
- The gentleman you like. Abe.

349
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,114
- She wants to go out with you.
- How do you know?

350
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,198
- If you don't, I will.
- Yeah, you would, too.

351
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,919
You're not a driver, are you, Kovak?

352
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,634
- Not like you guys, no.
- Didn't think so.

353
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,116
- Stirring these men up. Grandstanding.
- What grandstanding?

354
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,118
What are you talking?
We've grown since Johnny come in.

355
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,232
You mean he's grown. You make
a commission on each one?

356
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,271
Yeah. I do my job.

357
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,790
You making a name for yourself?
Putting money in your mattress?

358
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,309
He never even drove a truck!

359
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,590
- I'll see you guys later.
- Wait.

360
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,350
Pretty soon the company'll come along
and offer you something, and you'll take.

361
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,869
You'll take.

362
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,189
Come on, Abe. Johnny, come on back.
Have another beer.

363
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,073
- Jesus! I'm sorry, Molly.
- That's OK.

364
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,634
- I'm off Friday.
- You're on.

365
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,630
Did you like the movie?

366
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,798
No.

367
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,751
You didn't?

368
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,237
Just kidding you.
You're really a sucker, you know that?

369
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,556
Night, Abe.

370
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,636
Night, Molly.

371
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,550
Good night.

372
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,233
Argh!

373
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,717
- You guys saw what they did to Abe.
- Yeah!

374
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,277
We can't just go running out on
strike just because somebody got hurt.

375
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,789
I didn't join up to lose my job, Johnny.

376
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,751
Huh? Did we?

377
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,314
I don't want a strike
no more than you do, Tom.

378
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,479
I don't want nobody to lose jobs, none
of you. What are you getting from us?

379
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,795
- Nothing.
- Are they paying you overtime?

380
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,638
- No.
- Paying your doctor bills?

381
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,749
No.

382
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,075
All we've done so far is take your dues.

383
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,239
Look. Me and Mike are gonna go in there
and we're gonna talk to 'em.

384
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,438
- Ah, so that's Kovak.
- That's him.

385
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,950
How many of our drivers
has he signed up so far?

386
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,036
About 60 per cent.

387
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,275
- Go get 'em.
- Go get 'em, Johnny.

388
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,110
I know these foreigners around here.
They're good simple people.

389
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,596
They like to have a lot of laughs,
a few beers.

390
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,358
And don't take no crap!

391
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,998
- Hello. I'm Phillip Talbot.
- I'm Mike Monahan.

392
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,236
This is our organiser, Johnny Kovak.

393
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,033
My father should be here soon.
Sorry for the delay.

394
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,118
That's all right, Mr Talbot.
We got the time.

395
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,196
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

396
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,074
- This is Mr St Clair, our attorney.
- We've met.

397
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,078
And Mr Langley, our comptroller.

398
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,995
We're gonna sit down there.

399
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,876
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen. Some of these
meetings, you know how they go on.

400
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,874
Why don't you move down here?
Perhaps we could hear each other better.

401
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,754
No, we can hear fine.
Unless you guys wanna come down here.

402
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,476
Oh, I think we can hear just fine.
Shall we begin?

403
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,639
This is Mr Monahan,
the president of the local, and Mr Novak.

404
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,751
Kovak. Chief organiser.

405
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,398
All right, Mr Kovak,
what can we do for you?

406
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,036
Mike is the president. I guess he knows
better than me, so lay it out for him, Mike.

407
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,879
Certainly. Mr Monahan?

408
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,711
The thing of it is, Mr Talbot, the men in
our local are upset about a few things,

409
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,718
and we wanted to talk 'em over with you.

410
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,039
I'm always willing to discuss our men's
problems. I want the men to be happy.

411
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,879
Well, the way the men see it,

412
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,835
the company ought to pay for
the medical bills when any guy gets hurt,

413
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,589
and set up some kind of
an insurance plan - for the family.

414
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,631
How do we stand on that?

415
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,673
Our policy's like the other companies'.
We don't have an insurance programme,

416
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,997
but, as you know, we have
on occasion lent some of the men money,

417
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,554
at standard rates,
for medical emergencies.

418
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,719
Some of the men have already expressed
their appreciation to me personally.

419
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,400
That's very nice.

420
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,674
I was thinking, Mr Talbot,
not of your lending them money,

421
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,234
but of paying the bills.

422
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,598
We're gonna cut 'em off, pal.
You know that?

423
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,198
- What did he say?
- I said, we're gonna cut 'em off.

424
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,072
Your balls.

425
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,397
And what exactly do you mean
by that crudity, Mr Kovak?

426
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,193
- I mean we're gonna shut you down.
- I see.

427
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,073
No, you don't see. You don't see nothing.

428
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,749
You guys don't hear nothing,
cos if you did we wouldn't be sitting here.

429
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,474
You're suffering from
small eyes and fat asses.

430
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,116
- Is he speaking for you, Mr Monahan?
- Johnny knows what the men want.

431
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,958
I think I've heard enough.

432
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,039
No, you haven't heard enough! If a guy
works overtime, why don't you pay him?

433
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,392
If he needs insurance, why don't you
give him it? We're not asking for charity.

434
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,398
We're not asking you to be generous,
just smart businessmen.

435
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,034
Ah, I see.

436
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,755
Well, the answer is no, Mr Kovak.

437
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,117
No insurance, no overtime, no pay raises.

438
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,356
Let's go, Mike.

439
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,112
You know how much money
you're gonna lose in a strike?

440
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,876
He's unbelievable.

441
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,794
- I wanna talk to you.
- Let go of me!

442
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,990
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you stand me up?

443
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,395
- Nobody comes for me drunk.
- I was under control.

444
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,353
- Whose control? The gentlemen...
- I ain't a gentleman.

445
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,109
The gentlemen who take me out,
they knock on my door very politely.

446
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,674
- Is that right?
- Yes. They talk to my mother.

447
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,360
- What am I gonna talk to her about?
- The weather.

448
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,436
- The weather?
- The weather!

449
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,269
They escort me to their car.
Sometimes they even bring me flowers.

450
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,834
- Flowers?
- Flowers.

451
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,232
You know, you're nuts.
You know that, Anna? You know that?

452
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,275
I look like I got any flowers?! Do you think
I'm a pansy? You think I got flowers?!

453
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,315
Are those for me?

454
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,468
My name is John Kovak. I have a date
with Anna. I'm looking for Anna's mother.

455
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,036
- I am Mrs Zerinkas. Come in, please.
- Thank you.

456
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,876
- Please.
- Thank you.

457
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,676
Sit down. Yes.

458
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,350
What beautiful roses.

459
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,508
Thank you. They were having a sale,
so I thought I'd... buy 'em.

460
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,598
Maybe we should put them in a vase?

461
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,592
If it's OK with you,
I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand.

462
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,757
Yes. Just one moment, please.

463
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,236
Anna? Your friend is here.

464
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,113
I'll be down in a minute, Mamma.

465
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,956
- Uh, please.
- Thank you.

466
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,548
This heat is really something.

467
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,274
The humidity from the lake, I think.

468
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,633
I like it when it's cold because
you can feel yourself breathe.

469
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,355
And you don't sweat
through all your shirts.

470
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,155
This is one of the hottest spells
we have had in years.

471
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,633
That's very true. Very true.
I was thinking about that.

472
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,994
- You are not Lithuanian.
- No. I'm Hungarian.

473
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,473
Hm.

474
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,438
- Catholic?
- Oh, sure. Since I was born.

475
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,437
Ah!

476
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,279
What have you two
been talking about behind my back?

477
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,392
- The weather.
- Oh, Johnny!

478
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,910
What beautiful flowers.
You shouldn't have.

479
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,555
Well, they were having a sale,
so I thought "Well, why not?"

480
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,636
Thank you.

481
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,951
I just love it when it's
so nice and warm. Don't you, Johnny?

482
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,232
Yeah. I was saying...
I like it. It opens the pores.

483
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,796
Mr Kovak was just saying
how much he likes the cold.

484
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,148
Well, what I meant is, I like it both ways.

485
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,238
I like to be hot and cold
at the same time. It...

486
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,750
Guess I better be going.

487
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,757
- Well, have fun.
- Yes, I'll try.

488
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,917
- I'll have her back in about a month or so.
- Oh, I'm sure.

489
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,315
It was nice meeting you.

490
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,719
We'll have a good time.

491
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,752
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

492
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,230
Don't breathe.

493
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,070
I do great train imitations. I've been
doing it all my life, since I was a kid.

494
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,716
- Wanna hear a train?
- Sure.

495
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,516
Let me see.

496
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,675
Hey, Johnny! How you doing?

497
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,756
Hiya, Vince.

498
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,590
I was showing Anna my train imitation.

499
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,678
Oh, yeah? You always were
a bit of an engineer.

500
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,230
I see you won yourself a doll, too.

501
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,318
Anna, this is Vince Doyle, and Jocko.
I don't know the girls.

502
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,908
- This is Bonnie and Rosie.
- Pleased to meet you.

503
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,713
- Pleased to meet you.
- You always knew how to pick 'em.

504
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,798
- Hey, Vince. How about it, all right?
- Sorry.

505
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,550
I hear you're taking your guys out.
You're a regular labour leader.

506
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,911
Regular labour leader?
Well, I'm just doing my job.

507
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,793
You're whistling past the graveyard, kid.

508
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,990
I think I'm doing the right thing.

509
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,715
Nobody's gonna break
that old man's back, not in this town.

510
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,195
We'll see.

511
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,912
- Well, we gotta go.
- OK.

512
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,031
Bye, doll.

513
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,910
Who is that man?

514
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,157
Oh, Vince? Vince works for the church.

515
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,113
- Really.
- No. He's just some guy I grew up with.

516
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,277
Vince never had
good manners like me. Hm?

517
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,109
Wanna go spend some dimes?
Wanna hear my train imitation?

518
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,232
Everybody gather round. I want bright boy
here to hear this so he knows the rules.

519
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,273
We're out on strike. That means there's
no trucks going in or coming out.

520
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,516
This is the boundary!

521
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,638
What did the police say?

522
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,955
They'll be arrested
if they destroy property.

523
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,038
I told you we'd be back, Talbot!
I told you we'd be back.

524
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,116
We're on strike! You can't win!

525
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,439
That damned Roosevelt. What this
country needs is Douglas MacArthur.

526
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,476
Hey, Jack. Rest of you guys
come on over here.

527
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,272
- Do you need a hand?
- What do you think?

528
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,313
Is that all right? Watch it, it's still wet.
Take these on over to Higgins.

529
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,519
OK, let's go. Lift it up. Watch it.
Don't tear that canvas. Thatta way. Good.

530
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,195
- Father, you know these fellers here.
- Hello, Father.

531
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:04,152
It's a three-ring circus. You said
it wouldn't even last a month, Arthur.

532
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,714
They can't hold out much longer, sir.

533
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,399
That bohunk's not gonna put
a circus tent on my doorstep.

534
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,673
Call the Law and Order League.

535
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,156
# Let's go down and join the union

536
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,475
# Let's go down and join right now

537
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,790
- How you holding up?
- Pretty good. And you?

538
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,072
I can go another eight hours.
Linda, you washed more cups.

539
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,034
I finally got you something to eat.
It's not much but go ahead.

540
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,434
- There you go.
- Thank you.

541
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,357
- Hi, Molly.
- There you go.

542
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,193
- There's a truck.
- There's a truck.

543
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,920
I want you to pull against them.

544
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,475
- Looks like they got guns.
- Hold it.

545
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,111
# So let's go down and join the union

546
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,115
Hey! Look out!
Look out! Get out the way!

547
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,593
Get back. That way. Go now!

548
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,948
What you're doing is illegal!

549
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,599
What the hell's the matter with you guys?

550
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,596
- Johnny, they're burning the tent.
- It's on fire!

551
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,834
Damn you, Talbot!
You and your lousy scabs!

552
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,474
- Johnny!
- Come on!

553
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,920
You goddamn bastards!

554
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,188
You goddamn bastards!
Get out of the way!

555
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,838
Get outta the way! You damn butchers!

556
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,757
Mike?

557
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,792
Butchers! Damn you to hell, Talbot!

558
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,989
Mike!

559
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,758
Ah, Christ!

560
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,916
Did I do this?
Is this my fault? This is my fault.

561
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,237
- I'm sure it's my fault.
- No.

562
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,269
You know, Monahan and my old man,

563
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,359
they used to tie one on
at Cassidy's... every Saturday.

564
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,396
Whistling past the graveyard,
isn't that what I said?

565
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,790
We're all in it now, Vince.

566
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,798
It's got nothing to do with me.

567
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,356
- Yeah. What's in it for you?
- That's right. What's in it for me?

568
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,235
And let me ask you something. What
the hell is in it for you? Get off it, Johnny.

569
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,678
People we buried are our people.

570
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,360
My people's anybody who pays.

571
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,391
They're our people!

572
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,638
Johnny, what you need is real push.
Real push is what I got.

573
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,516
I need it now.

574
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,434
Well, that's gonna cost you.

575
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,556
We got a fund.

576
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,993
Well... I'll see what I can do.

577
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,076
OK.

578
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,476
- Thanks.
- It's about time you wised up.

579
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,875
- I'll see you, kid.
- Goodbye.

580
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,789
Don't do it, Johnny.

581
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,434
Wanna keep burying people?

582
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,438
Bring Vince and his crowd in,
they'll screw up this union.

583
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,597
- They won't be in for life.
- Vince comes, he'll never get out.

584
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,792
- Without help we ain't got a union.
- We can do it!

585
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,117
- We need push.
- And how are we gonna know?

586
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,037
- Know what?
- The difference.

587
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,116
What difference?

588
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,275
Between them and us.

589
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,273
We got trouble here.
I'm gonna straighten things out.

590
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,913
Hi, Johnny.

591
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,678
- You know Vince.
- Long time.

592
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,633
How you doing?
Graham's talking against the strike.

593
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,036
- Let me talk to him.
- What the hell's gonna happen next?

594
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,594
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

595
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,595
What are you gonna tell these men now?

596
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,756
I'm glad you came down, Max.

597
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,348
Talbot's gonna meet with me tomorrow.

598
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,040
You took these men out,
I'm getting their jobs back.

599
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,628
Let's talk.
I need your help on something, Max.

600
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,275
Yeah, I'll bet you do.
I'll see you men in a couple of minutes.

601
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,879
We'll be back.

602
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,390
You should have asked for my help
before you started all this.

603
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,875
I can't argue about that.

604
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,796
What's on your mind?

605
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,037
- What is this?
- Get the door.

606
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,116
What is this?

607
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,155
You're going to see Talbot?

608
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,839
That's right, Kovak.

609
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,988
You're gonna sell us out, Max, aren't you?
Make us go back for nothing. Aren't you?

610
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,714
I don't have to talk to you.

611
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,389
I don't have to tell you anything.
I discussed this with the men.

612
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,718
Train leaves in an hour.
You're going back to Indianapolis.

613
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,432
Like hell I am!

614
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,552
You crazy?!
I'm the president of this union!

615
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,793
No, Max. You're a salesman.

616
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,356
- You'll sell us out.
- You son of a bitch.

617
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,235
You're gonna sell us out, make us go back
for nothing. But this is our fight, our strike.

618
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,318
This is our local. It belongs to us.

619
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,276
You're out of it.

620
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,556
All right.

621
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,989
You do it your way.

622
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,475
You wanna stand alone?

623
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,914
I'll see you at the next funeral.

624
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,356
Let's go.

625
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,599
Settle down! You guys without any seats,
stand along the sides.

626
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,835
You guys got seats, sit down,
we can get outta this sweatbox.

627
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,076
Order! Thank you.

628
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,195
I just wanna say before we get started

629
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,949
that Max Graham got called back
to Indianapolis on sudden business,

630
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,835
but he wanted me to tell you
that he's with us 200 per cent.

631
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,110
We're gonna go back out there.

632
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,471
They're not gonna beat us down no more.

633
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,558
They're not gonna burn us down no more.

634
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,079
They're not gonna
shoot us down no more.

635
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,351
Cos if they do,
we're gonna do what Mike did.

636
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,948
We're coming at 'em
with everything we got.

637
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,550
And I'm saying to Consolidated right now,

638
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,672
we gotta do any more
burying in the graveyard,

639
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,918
they better get out their shovels
cos we're through taking punches.

640
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,677
You don't win a fight taking a punch!

641
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,349
Nobody ever won a fight taking a punch!

642
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,393
You see what this says? This ain't
a bunch of letters like any other union.

643
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,990
It says FIST! And that's what we are.

644
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,079
Every guy in here, a fist. One fist!

645
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,679
One fist!

646
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,270
One fist! What are you?

647
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,469
- FIST!
- What are you?

648
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,798
FIST! FIST! FIST! FIST!

649
