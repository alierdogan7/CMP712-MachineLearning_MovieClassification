1
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:09,644
And now let's welcome
our hometown hero,

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,400
the next governor
of Washington, Al Donnelly!

3
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,363
(cheering)

4
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:22,447
Attention, Buckley residents.
Voters of all ages, vote for Al Donnelly.

5
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:26,869
He's the best man for the job.
You can count on Al, that's for sure.

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,539
Folks, if you're wondering who to vote
for, Al Donnelly's the man for the job.

7
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:39,504
I have to go home now, little doggies.
Nothing for you in this truck. No food.

8
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,424
Dogs, I want you to go home.

9
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:45,344
Get off my bumper!

10
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:49,102
Come on! Jesus!

11
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,350
Aaagh!

12
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:53,973
Oh, God!

13
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,814
Oh, my God.

14
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,162
What is with you dogs?! D'you think
this truck is in heat or something?

15
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,325
Get out of here!

16
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:17,087
If I got the same welcome everywhere
I went that I got here in my home town,

17
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,961
my candidacy would be a lock!

18
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,676
(cheering)

19
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,721
(barks)

20
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,433
With your help, we will make it
all the way to the Capitol!

21
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:44,145
(chanting) Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,360
(amplified barking and growling)

23
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,331
- Did you do this?
- No, no, no... Did you?

24
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:56,534
(growling)

25
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,094
Oh, my God.

26
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,401
Oh, my God.

27
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,567
- (woman screams)
- Mother...

28
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,338
Oh, there is a God.

29
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,381
Tell me that is not your brother.

30
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:55,139
What the hell is a marquee doin' here?
It's crazy!

31
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:03,346
Al, I'm so sorry.
Man, I don't know what happened.

32
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,226
Mike, forget it.
Did you think it was a drive-in movie?

33
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:07,348
(both laugh)

34
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:09,694
(blasts horn)

35
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:15,271
I could get time off from the rec centre.
They said I could, to help you campaign.

36
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:19,614
So I was thinking maybe I could go
on the road with you and help out, or...

37
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:24,830
Mike, I know you're behind me 100%,
but I need some different help from you.

38
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,956
Oh, man, whatever you want.
You know that.

39
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,536
- Fighting Donnellys stick together!
- Right!

40
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:34,676
Listen, I got a lot of good people
in my corner. They want what we want.

41
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,888
And we're gonna get there.
It's just gonna take some finesse.

42
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:42,093
I'll do anything.
Just name it and I'll get started.

43
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:46,181
There's a lot to be done right here,
like phone canvassing, stuff like that.

44
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,604
So stay put and I'll get you
the details. All right?

45
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,478
- We gonna do it, little brother?
- Yeah!

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,068
- Come on. Let's go.
- All the way, Governor.

47
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,120
Dock Workers' Union.

48
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,791
Let me make myself clear.
My brother is a priority.

49
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,584
Let's just find someone
in the organisation.

50
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:20,419
Just as long as he or she is reliable
and helps Mike make a contribution.

51
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,552
So just find someone and
give them the assignment... now.

52
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,677
<i>(man) Excuse me,  Mr "About to be
Governor Elect" Donnelly.</i>

53
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,356
<i>This assignment you describe,
if someone volunteered and did it well, </i>

54
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,106
would he or she earn a staff position
in your new administration?

55
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:42,691
- Steve, not now.
- Hey. Uh, yes.

56
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:45,403
He or she most certainly would.

57
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,365
Then I am your man.

58
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,206
(ringing tone)

59
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:59,042
Hi. This is Mike Donnelly. I work
over here at the recreational centre.

60
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,800
To be honest,
I pretty much run the place!

61
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,884
Is this, uh, Pat Giles?

62
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,215
Good. Good.

63
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:11,724
Hey, I hope everything's going great in
your fine town of, uh, Avery... Atwood.

64
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:17,311
The reason I'm calling is I wanted to tell
you about the candidacy of Al Donnelly.

65
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:22,356
Al Donnelly's a guy with a dream. His
dream is to be governor of Washington.

66
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:28,814
Hell, every guy's got his dream, am I
right? I had a doozie myself last night!

67
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:33,866
Get this: a cornfed harvest mouse,
a hooker, a nun, a Flemish woman,

68
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:37,906
whips, chains, whistles,
yo-yos, a circus midget,

69
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,128
my grandmother riding by on a bicycle
giving me the finger, and a duck.

70
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,712
Now, I don't know... Are you crying?

71
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,623
Oh, my Lord. I am sorry.

72
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,134
Honey, please don't. Could you
get your daddy on the phone?

73
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:55,092
- No, don't hang up, please. I...
- (hangs up)

74
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,019
Whoa.

75
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:05,898
All right, I want a 32 belly option
on two, on two. Ready? Break!

76
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,320
Hut one. Hut two.

77
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,484
Let's do it!

78
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,453
Oh, hey, little girls.

79
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,254
Yeah!

80
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,958
(cheering and whooping)

81
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,459
This sucks! These teams aren't fair.

82
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:39,931
What's wrong, Sullivan? You mad cos
you found out the new kid got an arm?

83
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,765
- Suckers, take the walk.
- Screw this. I quit.

84
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:48,306
Fine then. Here's to the winners. Yeah!

85
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,611
Kemp, fake head butt. DeSalvo, fake
head butt. New kid, fake head butt.

86
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,067
Ow! You broke my nose!

87
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,526
Oh!

88
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:01,692
- There's so much blood.
- I swear I did not mean to do it! Please!

89
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,076
- Ketchup packet.
- (laughter)

90
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,200
Come on, guys. This is weird.
Let's go play some kickball.

91
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,368
Yeah, come on.

92
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,835
Forget those guys.

93
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,497
- What's your name?
- Scott Colleary.

94
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,252
Colleary.

95
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,262
- You got a hell of an arm, Colleary.
- Thanks.

96
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,805
Yeah.

97
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,056
- Don't worry about those guys.
- They don't like me too much.

98
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:29,477
- Is your mom picking you up?
- My mom and dad got a divorce.

99
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,101
I have to live with my grandma now.

100
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:42,444
Oh, come on. Label your streets
like the rest of the country.

101
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:49,075
Oh! Oh! Buddy, are you OK?

102
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:53,537
I'm not that far from dragging you
out of the car and beating you into dust.

103
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:57,576
You should work up to that.
Kind of leaves you nowhere to go.

104
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:02,291
I can go to your mama's
and start a small fire in her panties.

105
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:04,711
Now, are you ready
to get out of the car?

106
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,008
No, sir. You know what?
That was my fault and I'm really sorry.

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,853
Here, I got something for you.
It's a souvenir.

108
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,392
Oh, here it is! Yeah!

109
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,188
Goodbye!

110
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,147
- Oh, shit.
- (honking)

111
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,114
I don't believe this.

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,488
Damn it. I gotta ditch this guy.

113
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,671
Hey!

114
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,634
- That's my grandma. Mrs Oneacre.
- Hi, ma'am.

115
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,052
Bet you made
some nice friends today, huh?

116
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,883
(Scott) See ya.

117
00:09:57,812 --> 00:10:01,560
Scott. God gave you
a hell of a throwin' arm,

118
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,891
and I'll be damned
if I'll let that go to waste.

119
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:07,650
I want you on the field every day
working on your game. How's that?

120
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,145
- Sure.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

121
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,298
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Robbie.

122
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:34,049
I spoke to Anderson at the theatre.
He wants me to lock you up.

123
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,338
I bet your brother's pissed, huh?

124
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:40,183
No, he was pretty cool, as usual.

125
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:42,142
I wanna show you something.

126
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:45,562
In fact, I'm gonna be working
with one of his top guys.

127
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,813
Whoa! Nitrous oxide boosters!

128
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:55,320
- This thing must haul major ass.
- You could say that.

129
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,621
Oh, great.

130
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,582
Damn it.

131
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,372
- Get out of my way, buddy.
- Lady, I got somethin' for ya.

132
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,706
- A souvenir for you here.
- Yes?

133
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,711
Never mind. Forget it.

134
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,587
What are you doing?
Playing pocket pool there, son?

135
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,051
- Excuse me.
- You got a little chubby goin' there.

136
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,719
Dream on, you little fart.

137
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,740
Please don't be Mike Donnelly.

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,529
Hi.

139
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:50,454
Hey. I'm Steve Dodds,
one of your brother's advisors.

140
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:54,491
- His top advisor, actually.
- Wow. It's great to meet you.

141
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,873
Nice to, um, see you.

142
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,417
Al, your brother, told me
to drop everything, come down here,

143
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,465
get you organised for the final push,
for the election.

144
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:08,505
Well, let's get to it. Team Donnelly
gonna kick a little Tracy butt.

145
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,391
Oh! Aaargh!

146
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:16,018
What I thought is, we'd start with the
supermarket, canvass that area first.

147
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,812
- I...
- No, trust me on this. It's a good idea.

148
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:22,695
- But...
- Listen, I'm running this show.

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,820
- I know what I'm doing.
- (moans)

150
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,445
- D'you have to go to the bathroom?
- Please... pop... the hood.

151
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:33,784
- Please!
- Oh, your thumbs. The hood. OK.

152
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:37,623
- What latch? Where d'you want me to...
- Just pop the hood!

153
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,870
Please!

154
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,039
Popping the hood.

155
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:47,966
(wails)

156
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,673
Good afternoon. We'd like you
to vote Al Donnelly for governor.

157
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:53,841
Yeah, thanks.

158
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,636
- Hi, ma'am.
- (gasps)

159
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,019
Vote for Donnelly.

160
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,980
Sorry.

161
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,819
I think it's better
if we bring the energy down a tad.

162
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:07,441
Are you kidding me?
These are potential voters.

163
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:10,697
It's showmanship.
You gotta go out and get 'em.

164
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,860
Watch and learn.

165
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:16,330
- Hi, folks. Vote for Donnelly!
- Good God, man.

166
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,119
- Let me get that for you.
- Look, I drove down here.

167
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:23,585
- I can put the groceries in the trunk.
- Help from the Donnelly campaign.

168
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,462
- Back off, buster.
- Oh!

169
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,497
- Come on, Mother.
- Let me help you, sir.

170
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,843
- Get in the car, dear.
- All right, Mother.

171
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,688
Folks, I'm having a little trouble here.

172
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,690
Help! Help, please!

173
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,818
He must be all hopped up
on crack cocaine.

174
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,395
Floor it, Harold!

175
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,108
I can't! I can't!

176
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,527
Argh! Help!

177
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:05,865
- Good. I think I've lost him.
- Stop! Please!

178
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,249
Aargh!

179
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,879
Aargh!

180
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,802
OK.

181
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:26,971
- Good first day.
- Yeah.

182
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:36,314
Washington State.
Isn't it a great place to raise a family?

183
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:40,272
That's because for the last eight years
I've worked hard as your governor

184
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:45,076
to make sure our state
is clean, safe and fiscally sound.

185
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,746
If re-elected to a third term,
I'll do my best as your governor

186
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,878
to make sure that all the hopes and
dreams of Washingtonians come true.

187
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,710
- (man) And cut.
- I need a break. I'll be right back.

188
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,959
Did you get the latest polls?

189
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:05,341
Donnelly's brother took a campaign van
on a rampage. He can't get a break!

190
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:09,893
- But they gained another two points.
- We're OK. A lot can be done in a week.

191
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:13,727
If we don't do something soon,
he'll be living here.

192
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,810
Who left this crap in here?

193
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,692
Promise me you'll stay in the car.

194
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,944
I promise.

195
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,784
(excited chatter)

196
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:44,876
Whoa! What have we got here?
A tall cool one!

197
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,713
Yeah!

198
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,798
Go for it.

199
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,178
- I wanna get wrecked!
- (all laugh)

200
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,971
Oh, yeah, man!

201
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:08,646
# Smokin', snortin', shootin',
suckin', tokin', poppin', droppin'

202
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,322
Let's do a little dance.

203
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,537
A party with you!

204
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,745
- The kid's a star.
- No, he's a gold mine.

205
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,750
- (Mike) Ah. Horseshit!
- (glass smashes)

206
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,169
- Front page.
- Jesus, Mike!

207
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:33,258
But it turns out he was giving these
kids a speech about saying no to drugs.

208
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:38,472
- Can the paper print a retraction?
- They'll run it on page 36 in two weeks!

209
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,564
Al, you can take this election.

210
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:48,235
But your brother is creating his own
media feeding frenzy-all negative.

211
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,024
We have got to put a lid on him.

212
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:54,150
You're right.
But he doesn't deserve to be exiled.

213
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:58,987
You just tell Steve to watch him like a
hawk and to keep the reporters at bay.

214
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,740
(cheering)

215
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,658
Welcome, Washington
Teachers' Association!

216
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,710
Welcome!

217
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:13,667
Washington has the most
beautiful forests in America.

218
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,505
And I am proud to be
an honorary Clark County lumberjack.

219
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,024
- The tree's not falling.
- Yeah, I know.

220
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:34,526
Don't let anyone ever tell you
your job is easy.

221
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,034
Oh, my God!

222
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,705
You make the call. The rest
is for damage control. You stay put.

223
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,750
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excuse us just a moment.

224
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,507
What happened? It should've
gone down on the first whack.

225
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,503
You covered really well.

226
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:03,550
You're lucky a kid didn't get
his head cracked wide open.

227
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:04,672
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:08,599
- Did you get the numbers in?
- Oh. Hot off the wire.

229
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:14,566
- Donnelly's levelled off.
- Mm-hm. We're dead even. Look at this.

230
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,610
Front page.

231
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,814
"Donnelly's brother is like
Roger Clinton, Billy Carter

232
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:24,026
and Ronald Reagan's
entire family rolled into one."

233
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,321
Let's move this out of the land of
mere embarrassment into the realm...

234
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,407
of serious effect.

235
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,584
- Ready to play the game?
- I've got some pretty nasty ideas.

236
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,421
Good. Act on them.

237
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,298
- I've been fired.
- What? Why?

238
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:46,045
He said the rec centre's state-funded.

239
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:49,258
He can't afford to be associated
with any kind of a scandal,

240
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,683
especially one
involving kids and drugs.

241
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:58,393
He said he stood up for me, but word
came from the top for me to get out.

242
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,439
It's crazy, man.
I don't know what to say.

243
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,862
I love this job. I've been here
since the place opened.

244
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,776
And then they just...

245
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:17,823
Dude, can I get a couple of minutes
just to clear some of the gear out?

246
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,327
Yeah, sure.

247
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,828
Hey, I'm sorry, man. Take your time.

248
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,560
(chatter)

249
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,194
Hey, fellas. How's it goin'?
Can I help you?

250
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:49,415
Hey, Mike. How's things? Kind of
pissed off about losing your job, huh?

251
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:55,045
- All right, pal. What's goin' on here?
- You shouldn't play with matches.

252
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:58,709
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

253
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,431
God!

254
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,182
(Mike shouts)

255
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,518
Shit!

256
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,188
Oh, my God!

257
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:25,158
- Why in the hell?! No!
- (siren)

258
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,950
Mike, how the hell did this happen?

259
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:40,915
- Robbie, you know I didn't do this.
- Jesus, Mike. Give me some credit.

260
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,927
- Did you see who did it?
- Two guys. I don't know them.

261
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:47,179
They didn't count on me getting here
first. Look, get out of here.

262
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:51,928
When the troopers arrive, I'll tell them
I didn't find anybody here. All right?

263
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,427
- Go ahead. Take off.
- Thanks, Robbie.

264
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,057
- I owe you one, man.
- Call me later.

265
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,693
(distant sirens)

266
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:04,155
Base, this is Mieghem. I'm at the rec
centre. Send fire units and a backup.

267
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,316
I'm the only one down here.

268
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,697
- Well, did he do it or not?
- Kovary, I lean toward the negative.

269
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,115
- I know what you're saying.
- Shh.

270
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,126
Give me the phone.
Steve, it's Al. What is going on?

271
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:22,588
- Hey, Al. Well, in my opinion...
- I wanna talk to my brother.

272
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,499
Al, I know how this must look,
but I had nothing to do with that fire.

273
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:30,343
I loved that place. It was my life.
You gotta believe me!

274
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,642
I believe you. You were set up. And
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

275
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:37,217
We have a game plan. Don't we, Roger?

276
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:42,098
- Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
- Roger and Steve'll work it out.

277
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:45,976
Mike, don't worry.
Everything is gonna be OK, I promise.

278
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:48,147
Thanks, Al. Thanks.

279
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,651
- Steve here.
- Meet me downstairs in the lobby.

280
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,863
Dodds, listen to me very carefully.

281
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,658
We have got to keep this... this bozo

282
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:05,457
under wraps until the election is over.

283
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,880
Now, I want you to do
exactly as I tell you.

284
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,170
- Yeah. OK. Keep talking.
- I know a place way outside town.

285
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,035
All right! Bunk beds!

286
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,335
- I got dibs on top.
- OK.

287
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,585
(Steve) First class, right?

288
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:53,377
- What's that black thing?
- What?

289
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:00,343
I don't know.

290
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,389
- Touch it.
- What? You touch it.

291
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,600
- You afraid?
- No, I'll touch it.

292
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,932
- You totally didn't touch it.
- Well, then you touch it.

293
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:13,730
- I will if you will.
- All right.

294
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:17,520
- (bat screeches)
- (both) Whoa! Man!

295
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,945
- What is that?
- It's Ozzy Osbourne. Whoa!

296
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:24,278
Oh, my God.

297
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,617
Whoa.

298
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:29,743
- I think it's gone.
- I hate those damn things.

299
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,788
- (screeching)
- Oh, man!

300
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,338
Agh! Agh!

301
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:38,122
It bit me! I'm gonna get rabies!

302
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,293
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

303
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:48,133
Come on! Oh!

304
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,055
I got an idea. OK?

305
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:57,981
I'll open the fridge, you hit the lights.
Bats are attracted to light.

306
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,485
He'll fly in the fridge,
I close the door, end of story.

307
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:05,648
- That's moths, you dumb-ass, not bats.
- Oh, yeah, moths.

308
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,325
Eegh!

309
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,822
Watch this.

310
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:25,250
That's it. Corner it.

311
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:33,218
- I think I got it.
- No way.

312
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,015
- I think it's in there.
- Well, then look.

313
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,473
You look.

314
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,899
All right. We'll both look together.

315
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:45,939
One, two...

316
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,106
- Three!
- Agh!

317
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,657
You idiot!

318
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:54,491
You can't catch a bat with a pot, moron.

319
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,497
You take a mop and a broom... Oh!

320
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:01,623
- Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
- (screeches)

321
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,507
Get this thing off me!
What the hell are you...

322
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,303
Ow! Ow!

323
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:17,338
Why are you hitting me? Ow!
It's gnawing at my skull.

324
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,012
For God's sakes!

325
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:21,427
Ow! Ow!

326
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:25,685
- Die! Die!
- Please! You're aggravating it!

327
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,987
Why are you kicking me? Ow!

328
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:33,563
- I can't see a damn thing!
- Die!

329
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,196
- Oh, Jesus!
- I think I nailed it!

330
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:39,156
- (screeching)
- I don't believe it. He's still alive.

331
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,200
Can we please try my idea?

332
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:47,332
Come on! Hold the thing tight
so it gets in there.

333
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:50,540
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder. Stay over there.

334
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:55,294
Moron! OK, it's flying in now. It's flying
in now. It's flying right in the middle.

335
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:58,756
- It touched my hand.
- If this doesn't work I'll sleep in the car.

336
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,553
Stay there. OK. OK.
It's right in the middle.

337
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:04,559
OK, we got it, we got it, we got it...

338
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,721
It's outta there.

339
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,351
Good night, Steve.

340
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,319
Good night, Mike.

341
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,107
The police officer who arrived
before our guys was a friend of Mike's.

342
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:25,444
He let him go and didn't report seeing
him, so Mike wasn't linked to the fire.

343
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:33,248
Neuschwander, you finished stirring, or
is this a fucking science experiment?!

344
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:38,416
I realise you must stick close together
cos you share a common backbone,

345
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,215
but I wanna see some movement!

346
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,181
Now!

347
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:50,093
This is great. There's 1,502
registered voters in Garfield County.

348
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:52,061
Go get 'em, Al.

349
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:55,812
Hey, pretty good day. No screwups.
Keep up the good work.

350
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,941
I'm gonna go take a squeege.

351
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,409
Oh, God!

352
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:11,743
(echoes)

353
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,874
(insufficient signal tone)

354
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,262
- (insufficient signal tone)
- (sighs)

355
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:39,731
Eegh! Oh!

356
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,157
(insufficient signal tone)

357
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,743
What is wrong?

358
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:04,913
Oh, something tells me
I want this car to just keep driving.

359
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:09,836
Hey, gang.

360
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:15,016
Is there an Opie convention in town?

361
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:20,146
- I'm kidding.
- You're not from around here, huh?

362
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:25,394
- You know what, I am. Born and raised.
- Nope. Can't be true.

363
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:34,447
Fire!

364
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:51,627
Thanks for not shoving
the nozzle up my ass first!

365
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:54,802
<i>(tyres screech,  kids yell)</i>

366
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:03,181
- Vote for Donnelly.
- (echoes)

367
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:08,057
Every vote counts.

368
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,018
Argh!

369
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,658
Oh.

370
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,254
Aaargh!

371
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:36,668
No, no, no, no!

372
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,765
Oh. Oh.

373
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,220
Oh, thank you, little roots.

374
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,597
Please stay strong.

375
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,704
What in the hell was that all about?

376
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:35,727
You freaks better be careful,
cos next time I don't go down so easy.

377
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:39,226
Next time I'll be, like, "You wanna
spray me? How about this?"

378
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,061
Arm grab! Aie!

379
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:43,479
Snap kick! Side kick!

380
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:48,272
Rabbit punch!
Rabbit punch, into pile-driver!

381
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,860
That's right, my friend. It's a pile-driver.

382
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:53,575
Oh, who else wants some? You?

383
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:56,784
Sleeper hold. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,207
Hey, that's my car.

385
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,752
It's that same asshole. Whoo!

386
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,336
- (phone rings)
- Oh.

387
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,513
(imitates a "ringing" bird call)

388
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,679
What the hell was that?

389
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:30,570
Whoa, what happened to you?
D'you fall in some mud or something?

390
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,409
Yeah, I did. And I'm gonna be rich,

391
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,028
because I'm the only person on earth
who knows where to find white mud.

392
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:42,826
I didn't say "mud". I said "crud".
D'you fall into some crud or something?

393
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,746
- Get some water to wipe off that crud.
- I'm not a kid that'd believe that.

394
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,676
- Shut up, Steve. Where'd you go?
- To make a call.

395
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,346
Remember I told you a guy stole my
car? He's a mile away. He's driving it.

396
00:32:56,432 --> 00:33:01,723
- Well, let's go get it back.
- Uh-uh. This guy is unstable, at best.

397
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:05,181
You can't keep running away
from things. You gotta be tough.

398
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,025
Argh! Argh!

399
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:11,312
Snakes! Oh, no!

400
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:13,480
One looked at me!

401
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:19,024
Check your underpants!
I hate those things!

402
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:24,621
- This gets worse every second.
- I hate snakes!

403
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:31,333
(both scream)

404
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,713
Whoa. Check it out.

405
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:40,013
- Jump in. Wash that crap off.
- There's probably piranha in there.

406
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:43,881
- This place is a nightmare.
- Get tough, nancy boy. Jump in.

407
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:48,763
I don't see you goin' in.

408
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:53,226
Ugh.

409
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:57,944
Where'd you go?

410
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,818
Hello, Washington!

411
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,316
Yeah!

412
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:06,530
Aaaargh!

413
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,774
De-de-de, do-do-do! (laughs)

414
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:44,699
This is great. I've never won
three games in a row.

415
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,859
I hardly ever play checkers.

416
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:52,741
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,
it's kinda easy to win when you, um...

417
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,908
never move your back row!

418
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,203
Ever!

419
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,750
God! Come on!

420
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,831
OK, well, where would you
want me to move this one?

421
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,260
There.

422
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,925
King me!

423
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:18,435
OK. Move this one here.
It's safe, I swear. It's safe.

424
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:19,852
(laughs)

425
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,479
That wasn't safe at all.
What an idiot.

426
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,691
- Oh, this is fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

427
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,106
(bird cries)

428
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:40,990
What's goin' on?

429
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,539
That's not normal.

430
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,423
(both scream)

431
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,607
How the hell did that happen?

432
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:19,995
Ow.

433
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,120
Oh.

434
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,283
Oh, man!

435
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:35,383
- This place is trashed.
- Check this out.

436
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,720
This whole fridge is held up here
just by this plug.

437
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,640
(Mike screams)

438
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,053
(groans)

439
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:55,192
You OK?

440
00:36:57,157 --> 00:37:02,661
I'm just dandy! I got a bowl of
chocolate pudding in my underpants!

441
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:06,455
We didn't have
any pudding in there, buddy.

442
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,875
(Mike) This sucks. I can't believe
I forgot to call Scott Colleary.

443
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,502
Good luck getting out.
It's never gonna work.

444
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,462
Yes, it will.
All you need to do is get a signal.

445
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:21,629
(insufficient signal tone)

446
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,267
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

447
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:36,066
- Hello?
- Hello?

448
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,397
- Hello?
- Hello?

449
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,190
- Mrs Oneacre? Hello? Mrs Oneacre?
- Yes.

450
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,777
Hello? Are you there?

451
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,573
Hello. This is Mrs Oneacre.
Are you there?

452
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,124
Mrs Oneacre, it's Mike Donnelly.
Is Scott there?

453
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,248
No.

454
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:57,958
Oh, jeez. I had to leave town.

455
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,380
Could you tell him I'm sorry
and I'll make it up to him?

456
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,088
- Yes.
- (moans) Don't forget to tell him that.

457
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,253
- Bye.
- Hello?

458
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,610
Good night, Steve.

459
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,905
Good night, Mike.

460
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,748
(wind howling)

461
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,752
(creaking)

462
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,834
(snores)

463
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:56,515
Ow!

464
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,889
Oh, man.

465
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,598
- Oh, God.
- I don't like this, Mike.

466
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,271
Mike?

467
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:10,936
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

468
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,816
(Steve) Whoa!

469
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,824
This sucks!

470
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,876
- Good night, Steve.
- Good night, Mike.

471
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,622
(thunder rumbling)

472
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:53,520
Hey, Mike. "I got dibs on top bunk"!

473
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,273
Shut up.

474
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:57,653
(laughs derisively)

475
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,067
- Oh, I love it.
- Why don't you shut up?

476
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,034
"Hello, Washington!"

477
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:05,413
- How's the weather up there, buddy?
- Shut up!

478
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,452
(Steve carries on laughing)

479
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:10,620
Oh, no.

480
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:12,585
Ow!

481
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,666
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

482
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:23,055
Hey, Roger? How you doin'?
It's Mike Donnelly. Is Al there?

483
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,810
Uh, gee, Mike.
Al's kind of busy right now.

484
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:32,559
Ha, I know. I just wanted to tell him
I'm working my tail off for him up here,

485
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,604
and there's no way
Al's gonna lose Gaffield County.

486
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:39,063
That's great. I'll be sure to tell him.
Thanks for ringing up.

487
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,739
Come on, let me talk to Al.
It's only gonna take a minute.

488
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,287
Al doesn't wanna speak to you.

489
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:49,621
What do you mean,
Al doesn't wanna speak to me? Why?

490
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,949
Listen very carefully to me, Mike.

491
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:55,044
You know what Al calls you
when you're not around here?

492
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:59,128
The idiot. OK? All right?
Is that blunt enough for you?

493
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:01,505
You are not going to speak to him now.

494
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:06,220
And if I had my way, you wouldn't speak
to him after he's elected governor!

495
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:08,382
(hangs up)

496
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,107
Kovary. Man, that guy's a dick.

497
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:23,645
Who is he to say
I can't talk to my own brother?

498
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:25,530
You know?

499
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,901
I ought to go down there
and straighten this thing out.

500
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,069
What do you think, Steve?

501
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:35,457
Al's speaking at that
Rock The Vote concert in Seattle.

502
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,916
Steve?

503
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,455
What do you think if I went down to...

504
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,721
Oh, that's sad.

505
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:33,628
(# rock music playing)

506
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,683
Hey, it's cool. I was in.

507
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,525
Where's the fire?

508
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:53,146
Dude, we pay these bands' salaries
by buying a ticket to this shit.

509
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,315
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

510
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,273
Okey-dokey. Come on.

511
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:02,829
Son, step away from this vector and
get into a different coordinate, pronto.

512
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,832
There's no access for you
in this quadrant.

513
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,617
Man, why don't you goose-step on
down to the women and children there

514
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,544
and give them your power trip?
They might be impressed by it, asshole!

515
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,468
- Yeah!
- Young fellow, I'll twist off your head

516
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:20,467
and spike it onto the floors
of a nightmare you can't even imagine!

517
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,890
I will dance with you
inside of the six-sided ring of fire,

518
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:28,353
unless you move from this area
far and fast! Now!

519
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,680
(music stops)

520
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,648
Wow!

521
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,479
Man, I liked that move.

522
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:41,992
Yeah, I learnt it in the '84 Bounce-Off
over at Laguna Beach.

523
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:46,204
- The one Mr T hosted.
- As a matter of fact it is. The same one.

524
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,375
(chuckles nervously)

525
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:59,505
Wow!

526
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,715
Whoopsie-daisy.

527
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:06,841
I was looking for my brother, Al
Donnelly. He's around here somewhere.

528
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,842
So you fellas are... performers or...

529
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:17,899
Oh, no, thanks. I never touch the stuff.

530
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:22,610
There's enough in the air here
to get everybody high.

531
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:27,110
Besides, it gives you the munchies.
God knows, I don't need that. Hey!

532
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:33,029
But, uh...

533
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:36,539
(emcee) Rock The Vote
presents Mudhoney.

534
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:57,808
I don't think these kids wanna hear me
talk about bond issues, man.

535
00:44:57,897 --> 00:44:59,557
Al, we are lucky to be here.

536
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:04,606
Just go out, tell the kids to vote,
do an interview with some MTV person

537
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,735
and we're outta here.

538
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:08,197
All right.

539
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,508
# Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

540
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,462
# Clutchin' anything we can

541
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:34,804
# Stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

542
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,176
# Weight of the world
crushin' our backs

543
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,724
# Tooth for a tooth

544
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,345
# Eye for an eye

545
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,517
# You know it's the truth

546
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:52,104
# And this is why

547
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,987
So he says "Rectum?
Damn near killed him!"

548
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:07,164
I love you guys.

549
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:09,329
This is fun.

550
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:14,503
So anyway, what you're saying,

551
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:18,045
I'm the Man, "Whitey",

552
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:26,308
and you guys are the victims of
a tyrannical, racist, oppressive society?

553
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,305
That's right, man.

554
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,766
Man, that sucks!

555
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,529
I'm gonna talk to some people
and straighten this out,

556
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:39,401
cos this is a bunch of bullcrap!

557
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:42,825
- All right?
- Yeah!

558
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:46,529
- I'm gonna go get 'em.
- Kick ass, Whitey!

559
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:56,413
- So when do I go on?
- Six, seven minutes. Just relax.

560
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:59,045
- All right, all right.
- Straighten your tie.

561
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:02,052
- Should I lose the tie?
- Loosen the tie.

562
00:47:02,138 --> 00:47:04,890
Just take it down. Take it down.

563
00:47:12,857 --> 00:47:15,430
Yeah!

564
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,941
All right!

565
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,607
Whoo!

566
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:24,948
Yeah, man! I love you guys!

567
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:28,201
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on. All right.
- Excellent!

568
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:31,241
- What's your name?
- Mike Donnelly.

569
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,167
Governor Donnelly? Nice threads.

570
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,537
- No, you jag, he ain't the governor.
- He's runnin'for governor.

571
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,924
- Well, get on out there!
- No! No! You got the wrong guy.

572
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,464
Just a second. Fellas, come on.

573
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,512
Uh...

574
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:03,562
Um...

575
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:06,524
I'm not supposed to be here. Uh...

576
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:14,532
God. What is this?

577
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:19,159
l, uh...

578
00:48:19,252 --> 00:48:23,000
I could sure use some cupcakes
or peanut-butter cups about now!

579
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,840
- (riotous cheering)
- Yeah!

580
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:29,838
- You know what that's about!
- (whoops of approval)

581
00:48:29,928 --> 00:48:33,760
So I guess you guys should vote,
you know, because...

582
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:36,884
voting kicks ass, right? Yeah!

583
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:43,688
And let me tell you, if you're gonna vote,
why not vote for Al Donnelly, right?

584
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,063
(cheering)

585
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,771
(synchronised drumrolls)

586
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:57,199
Cos if voting kicks ass...

587
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:59,743
What in the hell...

588
00:48:59,832 --> 00:49:01,574
Oh, please, God, I'm dreaming.

589
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:04,205
...you've got some kick-ass shit!

590
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:13,174
Oh, God. I'm a dead man. Oh!

591
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,510
I'm hyperventilating... Oh! Oh!

592
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:21,215
Cos I was born in the USA.

593
00:49:23,604 --> 00:49:25,762
(shouts of "Yeah!")

594
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:32,526
You gotta fight for your right to vote.

595
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:46,790
That's one small step for man,
one giant...

596
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,909
- I have a dream!
- (cheering)

597
00:49:57,886 --> 00:49:59,878
Power to the people!

598
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:07,056
<i>Burn,  baby,  burn!</i>

599
00:50:07,144 --> 00:50:08,852
Oh, Mike!

600
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,890
Hey, fellas. Yeah.

601
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,690
Kill Whitey!

602
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:17,651
(stunned silence)

603
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:21,735
No! No! No!

604
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:29,576
- What in the hell were you thinking?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you.

605
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:33,912
- Oh, yeah. "Sorry."
- And I don't know how it happened.

606
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:36,920
- I just got thrown on stage.
- Why couldn't you stay put?

607
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:40,041
I told you I would
take care of everything.

608
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,670
But, no, we get "Kill Whitey"?!

609
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:48,090
I can't believe I have to ask you this, but
are you trying to screw this up for me?

610
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:50,470
What is this? Do you want me to lose?

611
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:58,018
If I really thought you believed that,
I'd just... I'd wanna die.

612
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:05,436
Just stay outta the way.

613
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,571
OK?

614
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:27,176
Are you or are you not
the Black Angel of Death?

615
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,798
Without question.

616
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,723
Don't agree with me.
It just pisses me off more.

617
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:37,177
It's over. It's finished.

618
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:41,723
Talking about your brother's
election hopes or my career?

619
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,735
The person I care about
most in my life... hates me.

620
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:51,942
I'm not a brother.
I'm an embarrassment.

621
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:13,211
- So what do you wanna do today?
- I don't care. Whatever you want.

622
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:17,513
Man, I wish we could watch
your brother's debate on TV.

623
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,304
That's today? We gotta watch it.

624
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:23,311
How, by hooking a hanger up
to the metal plate in your head?

625
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:27,514
I know a place with a TV. I saw it
when we were putting up posters.

626
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:29,767
It's not far from here. Let's go.

627
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:40,911
- Here it is.
- Of course. This had to be the place.

628
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:45,657
How could you have such horrible
instincts and survive this long?

629
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,329
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Yeah, I met this guy. Nobody is home.

630
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:52,921
Ooh!

631
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,287
Agh!

632
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,001
Run!

633
00:52:57,636 --> 00:53:00,388
(Mike) Come on! Move it! Move it!

634
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,260
This guy's got
a hell of a security system.

635
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,271
Ready to start filming, Mr Stone.

636
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:13,017
Really.

637
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:18,316
My God, this guy is like Leatherface,
Chucky and Jan Brady rolled into one.

638
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,859
Eegh.

639
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,701
(Mike) "Honourable discharge.
Drake Sabitch."

640
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:28,159
This must be his dad, Norris Sabitch.

641
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:33,956
And his Grandpappy Winston.

642
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:40,049
If he'd bought a smaller TV, he could've
afforded a couch with less urine on it.

643
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,008
Yeah.

644
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,757
<i>I want to see a Washington where
children can walk down streets safely, </i>

645
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:53,643
where people can leave doors unlocked
and their minds are free from fear.

646
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,766
This is one area where I'm in
total agreement with Governor Tracy.

647
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,310
<i>In fact,  I agreed with that statement</i>

648
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,938
when she made it in her first campaign
for governor eight years ago.

649
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:07,573
Man. My bro is knockin'
the snot outta her.

650
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:12,577
- I'm gonna go take a squeege.
- Watch your step.

651
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:32,015
<i>If you really wanna understand
Mr Donnelly's view on family values, </i>

652
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,682
take a look at his brother
and ask yourself this question:

653
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:38,806
"How far does
the acorn fall from the tree?"

654
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:41,270
Or should I say "nut"?

655
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,101
(laughter)

656
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:49,816
<i>Yes,  my brother has some problems,
but who doesn't?</i>

657
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:53,692
And I just wanna say
I love my brother Mike.

658
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:57,154
And I am very proud of him.

659
00:54:57,248 --> 00:55:00,913
And I believe that Mike's problems
are rather modest

660
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:05,130
when compared to the problems
facing our great state.

661
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,586
Those are the problems
I am interested in.

662
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:10,710
- (applause)
- Get her, Al.

663
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:15,054
- (peeing)
- Ah. Ooh.

664
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:19,715
- Agh! Oh!
- You're in the wrong zone, soldier boy.

665
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:22,764
What the hell are you doin'
in my perimeter?

666
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:25,144
Um, sir, I'm not a soldier.

667
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:29,231
And I don't know if you read in USA
Today last week, but the war is over.

668
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:33,319
You can punch out now,
move on, let it go.

669

670
00:55:37,286 --> 00:55:38,779
Charlie.

671
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,120
Um, I just talked to Charlie,
and he's not mad at you any more.

672

So let's call off Operation "One of us
is Crazy" and go our separate ways.

- Don't get smart with me!
- Ow.

674
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,460
Tell me who sent you on this mission,

675

Sir, honestly, I just came back
to get my rental car and an apology.

678
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:07,599
And if I could get that, I will gladly
leave your... coordinates here.

679
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:14,230
- Oh, the car?
- Uh-huh.

680
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:18,484
- Is that all?
- (chuckles nervously) That's all.

681
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,324
Why didn't you tell me?

682
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:33,117
- God! Here's the keys.
- Oh, thank you.

683
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:36,666

Nice moves.

690

I wanna show you something.

Donnelly had a smart-ass comment
to make after everything I said.

698

699

With all deference, Governor,
if he goes down.

700
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:59,242

our people think will be very high.

701

My gut says I'm glad you're trailing.

Well, I'll have to see the pictures first.

know who to make out the cheque to.

01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:45,639
Dude, I can't even find the glove
compartment in this thing.

838
01:08:49,816 --> 01:08:51,893
Oh, my God.

839
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,525
Man, we're screwed.

840
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:01,818
Get in the back!

841
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:04,905
Get in there!

842
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:14,912
<i>(music comes on,  then goes off</i>

843
01:09:16,425 --> 01:09:18,714
How you doin', buddy?

844
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:22,634
Transportin' a prisoner.
12th Precinct up in Buckley Town.

845
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:26,056
My sarge gave me no overtime,
so I'm doing it lickety-split.

846
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:30,389
Tell me, Officer, do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

847
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:35,394
Well, I got a 426 hemi in her.

848
01:09:35,485 --> 01:09:38,022
Three-quarter cams, nitro boosters.

849
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:40,401
I can get her up to as good as 155.

850
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:44,736
Never do though, of course, unless
I'm chasing a cute chick in a Ferrari!

851
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:52,331
I guess I was going about 65, tops.

852
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:55,580
Seven. Seven miles an hour.

853
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:59,620
And normally when I stop people
they pull onto the shoulder.

854
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:04,756
I don't know how you
do things in Buckley,

855
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:08,629
but down here we are protective
of the other drivers on the roads.

856
01:10:08,723 --> 01:10:13,053
- Row-ads. Roods.
- Quiet back there!

857
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:16,229
I've taken enough guff from you
for one day. Raving psycho.

858
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:19,351
Butchered 400 chickens
and screwed a beagle.

859
01:10:19,442 --> 01:10:23,440
Takin' him back to Nevada,
where he's wanted for bangin' horses.

860
01:10:26,073 --> 01:10:27,782
Good God!

861
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:31,912
Then you get him through this state
a little faster than seven miles an hour,

862
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:33,573
Officer...

863
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,823
Uh, Meoff, Jack.

864
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:43,295
Go!

865
01:10:52,306 --> 01:10:55,177
- Oh, man!
- What a goon.

866
01:10:55,268 --> 01:10:58,138
You were great though, man.
That was genius.

867
01:10:58,229 --> 01:11:00,980
I never would've thought of that.
That was hot.

868
01:11:01,064 --> 01:11:02,725
- Whoo!
- (sirens)

869
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:04,892
Oh, shit!

870
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:11,861
Oh, man. I hope there's
enough juice left in these boosters.

871
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:16,361
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

872
01:11:16,453 --> 01:11:18,114
Whoo!

873
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,700
See ya.

874
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:25,540
Oh, man! Whoo!

875
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:54,855
We're live at the governor's mansion.

876
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:59,111
Today is a celebration of Governor
Tracy's election to a third term,

877
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:05,408
with all the campaign staff and their
families gathering for a festive affair.

878
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,075
Governor Tracy, having just pulled out
a squeaker, must be all smiles today.

879
01:12:12,214 --> 01:12:15,630
<i>We're just receiving word
that Mike Donnelly,  brother of Al, </i>

880
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:17,794
is involved in a police pursuit.

881
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:23,973
Mike Donnelly is driving down Capitol
Boulevard in a stolen police car.

882
01:12:24,058 --> 01:12:27,059
I don't believe this.
Driver, head back to the capital.

883
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:30,062
- What? You can't do this.
- Do what?

884
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:32,057
Commit career suicide.

885
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:35,933
I beg you, don't do this. Give me
some time. I can make you a senator.

886
01:12:36,028 --> 01:12:40,737
Jesus. Did it ever occur to you family
may be more important than career?

887
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:44,484
Ever occur to you that at some point
you'll have to make a choice

888
01:12:44,578 --> 01:12:46,902
between me and your loser brother?

889
01:13:12,437 --> 01:13:15,391
Go and scope it out.
Nobody's gonna recognise you.

890
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,186
OK. Promise me you'll stay right here.

891
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,064
Thank you. Thank you very much.

892
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:32,236
This election was about
the majesty of democracy,

893
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:36,448
where the gathered masses
held their vote high.

894
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:38,202
(applause)

895
01:13:42,298 --> 01:13:46,960
My re-election would not have been
possible without the people in this state

896
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:49,626
who supported me in this victory.

897
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:52,972
I must also thank
my wonderful husband Dennis

898
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:56,308
and my two beautiful,
intelligent children...

899
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:59,645
Psst! Steve. I'm in.

900
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:04,437
Where the hell's Drake?
He's supposed to be here.

901
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:08,608
I'm surprised we can't count on a guy
whose bus is surrounded by mines.

902
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:10,774
All right. Here's what we do.

903
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:15,654
We dress as caterers, right?

904
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:19,744
Nobody looks at a caterer's face.
It's always "Whaddaya got in the tray?"

905
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,083
Then we sneak around back.
When Tracy starts to...

906
01:14:24,004 --> 01:14:26,791
Something's happening here.
Steve, help.

907
01:14:26,882 --> 01:14:28,127
Steve.

908
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:30,255
Steve, get back here.

909
01:14:30,343 --> 01:14:33,546
Oh, my God.
The damn thing's caught in my belt.

910
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:36,389
God! Help, please!

911
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:40,426
- I can't...
- (gasps)

912
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,313
I can't... God!

913
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:46,138
- You in the band, help.
- Hello.

914
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:48,107
Help!

915
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,354
God!

916
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,609
- Stay.
- Steve! Help.

917
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,189
- How are you?
- Steve! Please!

918
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,822
Somebody! Somebody help me.

919
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:01,367
Somebody help me!

920
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,457
Agh! Help!

921
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:11,713
The voters have spoken, and I have
heard their message loud and clear.

922
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,468
- And that message is...
- (Mike) God! Help!

923
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,635
- Holy shit!
- (shocked gasps)

924
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,053
(laughs nervously)

925
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,015
Hi, there. Hi.

926
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:29,478
Boy, I feel like a horse's patoot.

927
01:15:31,817 --> 01:15:33,276
l, uh...

928
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,859
Oh, no! For the love of God!

929
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,818
Aaaarrggh!

930
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:52,710
(groans)

931
01:15:52,795 --> 01:15:55,795
I'm all right. I'm OK.

932
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:58,455
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute. I'll be fine.

933
01:15:59,509 --> 01:16:02,961
Nobody move, or Steve Dodds gets it!

934
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:04,679
- Who?
- Steve Dodds.

935
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:07,681
- Who's this guy?
- From the Donnelly campaign.

936
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,603
What does it matter?
He's got a gun! You're a cop.

937
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:14,471
Get over here. I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

938
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:18,977
- I want that asshole taken out.
- I'll get a sharpshooter on it right away.

939
01:16:19,069 --> 01:16:22,320
- Get your ass up there.
- Ow!

940
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:27,447
Everybody back up,
or I blow the pipsqueak's head off.

941
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:29,778
I've got somethin' to say!

942
01:16:29,872 --> 01:16:33,786
Please listen to him. Do what he says.
I have children. Tommy and Sally...

943
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,333
- Shut up!
- All right.

944
01:16:35,668 --> 01:16:38,290
You keep your mouth shut, squirt.

945
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,953
As soon as you get a clear shot, take it.

946
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:46,090
(Mike) OK, listen up.
This is serious business.

947
01:16:47,012 --> 01:16:52,053
Now, we've all been screwed
by Governor Tracy.

948
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:54,549
And now I'm gonna screw her!

949
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:55,889
(shocked gasps)

950
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:02,064
I mean, I have evidence here you need
to know about now before it's too late.

951
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:05,069
- Mike. Mike, what are you doing here?
- Oh, man.

952
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:09,191
- Isn't that Steve Dodds?
- Uh, yes, sir.

953
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:13,281
Al, man, I know what I'm doin'.
I'm gonna prove you won the election.

954
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:16,620
Mike, put the gun down.
There's other ways to handle this.

955
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:21,624
No, man! Al, there's no other way!
You gotta believe me.

956
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:24,831
I believe you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

957
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:30,506
Look, I know this looks bad.
Al, man, I'm not a screwup on this one.

958
01:17:30,594 --> 01:17:33,347
I've got proof this time. Real proof.

959
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:37,343
(Al) But the election's over. It's history.

960
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:40,008
Like you're gonna be
if you don't put that gun down.

961
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:42,594
Al, please!

962
01:17:43,482 --> 01:17:47,396
If you love me like a brother,
you gotta back me up on this.

963
01:17:47,485 --> 01:17:51,234
All right, Mike. I'll back you up.
What do you want me to do?

964
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:53,564
Just let me explain what happened.

965
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:57,067
- Oh!
- (crowd scream)

966
01:17:57,661 --> 01:18:01,789
That's it. Game over.
I'm not even getting paid for this.

967
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:05,498
- This is not worth it.
- Look out. Look out. Look out.

968
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:07,459
OK.

969
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:10,372
(crowd scream)

970
01:18:10,715 --> 01:18:15,176
Mr Thunder-maker here is gonna start
barkin' fire if you don't stop moving

971
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:17,930
and listen to what
this young man has to say.

972
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:20,591
Go ahead, Mike. Clear.

973
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:25,725
Thank you, sir. You've just met Drake
Sabitch, a great American soldier.

974
01:18:25,813 --> 01:18:29,228
I'd like to tell you about
some other great American soldiers.

975
01:18:29,316 --> 01:18:31,854
Drake Sabitch's grandfather,
Winston Sabitch,

976
01:18:31,944 --> 01:18:35,028
whose name you'll find
at the top of this list.

977
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:40,190
It says that he registered
and voted for Governor Tracy.

978
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:43,535
- We're proud to have him as a voter.
- Hold your tongue, wench.

979
01:18:43,621 --> 01:18:47,868
The fact is Winston Sabitch was killed
in the Argonne Forest in 1918.

980
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:52,288
A zeppelin landed on his head,
smashing his head clean out of his ass.

981
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:55,464
That's my granddad. Rest in pieces, sir.

982
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,465
Norris Sabitch met his maker
in Iwo Jima, 1944.

983
01:19:00,887 --> 01:19:05,596
Nelson Sabitch was killed
near the 38th Parallel in Korea.

984
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:10,678
But yesterday these men managed
to cast their vote for Evelyn Tracy.

985
01:19:10,772 --> 01:19:13,262
(disapproving murmurs)

986
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,931
You heard it here, folks. Voter fraud.

987
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:24,194
Half these people are buried in the
Garfield cemetery. That's one county.

988
01:19:24,284 --> 01:19:28,992
- It's probably the same statewide.
- Hold on just a minute, young fellow.

989
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,160
There's a perfectly good explanation
for all of this. Neuschwander.

990
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:39,962
Actually, there is a perfectly
good explanation for this.

991
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:43,467
- She put us up to it.
- Would you shut up?!

992
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:45,426
- It's all her.
- Shut up!

993
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:52,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is a fine patriot.

994
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:55,105
He deserves to be hoisted up
on our shoulders.

995
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,857
- Sergeant, please. This isn't necessary.
- Come on.

996
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,396
- Oh, you're a large American.
- Argh!

997
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,687
Get off of me.

998
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,488
My foot's caught a little bit.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.

999
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:13,788
- I'm asking you to get off me!
- Governor... I should say ex-governor!

1000
01:20:13,872 --> 01:20:16,789
I'm just trying to get
a little leverage on my foot.

1001
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,749
Agh!

1002
01:20:21,337 --> 01:20:25,086
- No, no, no! Please, somebody help me!
- Oh, man.

1003
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:27,250
(grunting)

1004
01:20:29,261 --> 01:20:33,639
- OK. Hi, how are ya?
- Somebody get him off of me!

1005
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:36,390
For God's sakes.

1006
01:20:36,476 --> 01:20:38,434
(grunting continues)

1007
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,438
Shut up! Shut up!

1008
01:20:47,069 --> 01:20:52,408
Thanks, bro. At times in the campaign
I lost sight of what really mattered.

1009
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:56,074
- I never should have doubted you.
- Oh, thanks, man. It's cool.

1010
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:58,616
Are you sure
you don't want a job on my staff?

1011
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:03,709
You know what, Al? I don't think
I'm really cut out for politics.

1012
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:06,545
Besides, I gotta rebuild that rec centre.

1013
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,631
- The kids really love the place, so...
- Yeah, I know.

1014
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:13,666
Hey, I got somebody you gotta meet.
Scott, come here a second.

1015
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:19,881
Check this kid out. He's got an arm
like you used to have. Hey, Scott.

1016
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,225
Hey. Mr Governor,
can I please have your autograph?

1017
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:26,016
Why not? Governor elect.

1018
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,188
Get it right, moron.

1019
01:21:29,777 --> 01:21:31,318
- There you go.
- Wow.

1020
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:34,486
Check this out.
Gimme a toss, Scott. Hey, buddy.

1021
01:21:34,572 --> 01:21:36,446
Ooh!

1022
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:40,233
Nice toss, Scott.
Oh, man, the kid's got a cannon.

1023
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:42,534
- Go long.
- OK.

1024
01:21:43,414 --> 01:21:45,407
- Ow!
- Oh!

1025
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,990
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- You OK?

1026
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:57,170
- So long, little brother.
- OK. See you, Al.

1027
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:04,301
- So this is it, huh, Steve?
- I guess I'm gonna miss you.

1028
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:08,140
I'm not gonna miss a 9mm to my head,
but... What were you thinking?

1029
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:10,517
I don't know.

1030
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:18,150
All right, you guys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1031
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:26,785
Oh, my God! No! No!

1032
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,994
Please don't take off (do that)!

1033
01:22:29,081 --> 01:22:30,908
Please!

1034
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,800
Al! Al! No! No!
