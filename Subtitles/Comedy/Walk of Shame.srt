01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,608
<i>Good day, Los Angeles.</i>
<i>I'm Chuck Rogers.</i>

1794
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,676
You know what happened.
I'm not crazy.

1795
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:31,712
[ Man ] Meghan.
No, what was crazy
about that?

1796
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,383
Incredible.
Yeah,
I'm really sorry.

1797
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:38,552
You should hire Chang.

1798
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:41,288
I mean, what an incredible
idea for an investigative
series.

1799
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:44,324
The girl in the yellow dress.

1800
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:47,361
Right. But you know
I didn't plan that.
It was just what happened.

1801
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:49,496
Even better. Like
<i>To Catch A Predator </i> meets...

1802
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:53,500
Tyra Banks in a fat suit
meets <i> Undercover Millionaire.</i>
It's fresh.

1803
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:57,771
Meghan, I know there's
something we can do together
at the network.

1804
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:01,541
- What are we talking about?
- It's a reality show.

1805
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:03,577
I love it.
[ Jordan ]
Love it.

1806
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:07,648
- Reality?
- [ Gordon ]
Your call.

1807
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:11,051
I need to think about it
and get back to you.

1808
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,753
Dan here can get
the ball rolling.

1809
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:14,721
I just need a pair of shoes.

1810
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:17,591
Maybe a sandwich.
Get you some shoes.
Oh, some food too.

1811
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,026
Maybe brush my teeth.
Right?

1812
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:20,727
No, no, you're fine.

1813
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:23,397
Just do some hair fixing.
I got your back,
Meghan.

1814
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:25,699
So, what do you have
in mind for us?

1815
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:28,902
- You two are a package?
- Yeah, I'm her producer.

1816
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,537
How much to go away?

1817
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:32,673
Hey, babe.
There he is.
Arrest him.

1818
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,308
Sir, we need you to stand up,
put your hands behind your back.

1819
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,976
What are you talking about?

1820
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,377
Put your cookies down.
Let's go.

1821
01:28:37,379 --> 01:28:38,378
What are you doing,
arresting me?

1822
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,314
For what?
Being too sexy? Ow!

1823
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,053
So, your place or mine?
Yeah. Um...

1824
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,823
I'd love to show you mine.

1825
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,892
It's very empty,
but it has a bed.

1826
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,727
Nice. How are we
going to get there?

1827
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:55,429
Ooh, I have not thought of that.

1828
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:57,631
Uh, maybe we should
take that cab.
No. No, no.

1829
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,066
No time for that.
No, it's not.

1830
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:00,801
I never wanna see
a cab again.
Okay.

1831
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,542
We're gonna walk.
That's fine with me.

1832
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:10,544
This will be more
of an adventure.
