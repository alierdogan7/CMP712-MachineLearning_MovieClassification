00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:48,404
Yeah. Quick. 10-54L.

178
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:51,206
[Inhales] Ambulance case.
Severed limb.

179
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,207
[Both laugh]

180
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,410
What is going on here?

181
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,178
Teddy and I met at code camp.

182
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,481
It was a voluntary refresher
course on police codes.

183
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,583
Some long nights
of intense memorizing.

184
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:03,318
It was pretty dope.

185
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,486
Sounds dope.

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,721
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
Nice to meet you.

187
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:07,689
Well, I'm gonna go sign in,
but we should catch up later.

188
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:10,024
Yeah.
Great seeing you.

189
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:11,693
You too.

190
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,495
Who's that guy?

191
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,631
Uh, that was Teddy. We went on,
like, five dates last year.

192
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,199
I liked him, but he was
stationed out in Queens,

193
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,835
so I never got to see him,
and it sort of fizzled.

194
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,937
Right, that's the guy you said
the lame stuff about.

195
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:25,278
Like "he's a good listener."

196
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,841
I'm sorry, what do you
look for in a guy?

197
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,909
I don't know, real stuff.

198
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,044
Shape of his ass.

199
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,447
All right.

200
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,416
So weird that Amy
dated that guy.

201
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,384
What do you care so much?

202
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,485
Okay, first of all,

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,521
your insinuating voice
is way too high.

204
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,756
It's creepy. And second,
I don't care.

205
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,925
I'm just curious
why she would like him.

206
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,159
Whatever you say.

207
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,627
<i>Oh, yeah, no,
I hear it now.</i>

208
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:51,062
Yeah, I sound like Meryl Streep
from <i>Mamma Mia.</i>

209
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:57,472
Oh, this is so cool.
You can shoot around corners.

210
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:00,174
I love guns. I'm gonna
make such a good dad.

211
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,375
Not even gonna touch that.

212
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,144
The Amy Santiago story.

213
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,346
<i>(Teddy) Santiago.
Got one for ya.</i>

214
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,815
10-51.

215
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:10,350
Roving gang, specify direction
of travel and number in group.

216
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,152
At least make me work for it.

217
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:15,055
Hey, I got one.
How 'bout 10-69?

218
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:16,356
That's easy.
Message received.

219
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,192
And simultaneously given.
Am I right? Up top.

220
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:20,693
69.

221
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,294
Got it.
Yeah.

222
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,649
So they got the new handguns in.
You want to check 'em out?

223
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:25,665
Totally.
Of course.

224
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, I see what happened.

225
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,669
I thought he was
talking to me.

226
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,438
And he clearly was.
Chop chop, Ted. Let's roll.

227
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:33,573
Hold down the fort.

228
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,341
Uh...

229
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,042
That's a P.U.W.

230
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,744
Or a portable
ultrasonic weapon.

231
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,514
It emits a focused beam of sound
which can disorient

232
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,483
and even
incapacitate a perp.

233
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:46,117
So it shoots sound?
Mm-hmm.

234
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,953
Is this the trigger?

235
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,154
Yes, but you want to be
careful with that.

236
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,356
Ahh... ah...

237
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,757
Thought it would be louder.

238
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:55,258
It's highly directional.

239
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,361
If it were pointed at you, you'd
be in incredible pain right now.

240
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:58,762
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

241
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,598
Oh! Oh! Oh...

242
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,332
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

243
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,435
I can taste my thoughts!

244
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,804
<i>(Terry)
Enough, Diaz.</i>

245
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,438
<i>(Charles) Oh, my God...

246
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,141
That's pretty cool.

247
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,348
Captain Holt?

248
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,115
Have you seen Captain Holt?

249
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:22,619
Tall, handsome gentleman
dressed like an airline pilot?

250
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,988
No.
Okay.

[Video game sound effects]

252
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:33,562
Your pants are up.
I'm coming in.

253
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:35,664
Captain...

254
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:38,299
Think you might have a little
bit of a problem here, boo.

255
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,535
I have this under control.

256
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,203
You should leave.
This is the men's room.

257
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:47,074
This is no longer a men's room.
It is now a liar's den.

258
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:50,745
I am Captain of this precinct,
and you are my assistant.

259
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,547
I have given you
a direct order to leave.

260
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,782
I do not have a problem!

261
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,182
If I want to play
Kwazy Cupcakes,

262
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:59,218
I will play Kwazy Cupcakes!

263
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,488
"Kwazy" is a difficult word
to say in anger,

264
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,563
I think I've made
my feelings clear.

00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:09,462
Nice.
[Chuckles]

267
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:11,297
Have you noticed
they moved the trigger?

268
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:12,698
Real exciting finger feel.

269
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,833
"Finger feel"?
Really?

Yeah, and his

I can't believe
you would kill a farmer,

of our nation's economy.

276

When it comes
to shooting patterns,

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,682
I like to go PB&J.
Penis, brain, jaw.

<i>(Teddy)
Nice shooting, man,</i>

281
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,720
but do you think the penis
is an effective target?

282
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:38,656
Interesting fact: A man can run
half a mile with no genitals.

283
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:42,517
That's a weird thing
to know a lot about.

284
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,594
Hey, hey.

285
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,096
Okay, so I know
you're pissed at Boyle.

286
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,698
I told you, shooting him

287
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,432
with that sonic cannon
was an accident.

288
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,367
It's not just that.

Look, I get it if Vivian
doesn't want me to come.

299

But Boyle should've
said something.

Nope, I'm gonna wait till
I'm on my deathbed,

Uh, no. I'm working on a thing
where when I'm out of ammo

Okay, I know you have
two bullet wounds in your butt,

but you've gotta stop
calling them your "buttholes."

00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:07,173
You know how people hold their
guns sideways to look cool?

322
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:11,243
It got me thinking. What if you
held your gun upside-down?

323
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:12,344
You can use that.

527
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:13,971
Okay, I had to tell them.
It's my nature.

528
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,407
You helped me today,
so I'll give you

529
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:17,841
a pass on
embarrassing me publicly.

530
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,777
Thank you.

531
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:21,912
I feel that the reason I was
so vulnerable to this game

532
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,147
was because technology
has evolved to the...

533
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:25,415
Yeah, I don't know.

534
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,017
I think it's just bright
and stupid and fun.

535
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,219
So fun.

536
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,854
So fun.
So fun.

537
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,191
[Sighs]

538
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,294
<i>(Charles) What's going on,
Vic Kovac?</i>

539
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,195
What do you think
Amy sees in Teddy?

540
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,530
So you do like her.
I'm just curious.

541
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,365
I mean, I guess
he's okay-looking.

542
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:44,633
And he's a good cop.

543
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:45,601
They're both kind of dorky
about police stuff.

544
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:46,968
Also, he set
the course record,

545
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,438
but that's nothing. I broke it,
like, 20 minutes later.

546
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,308
You want to know why she went
out with him and not you?

547
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:53,442
Yeah.

548
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:57,144
Because he actually
asked her out.

549
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,548
Hey, Vivian.

550
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,450
Rosa.

551
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,752
I'm here to celebrate
with the team.

552
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,222
Look, I'm not really
good at this stuff, but...

553
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,257
Thank you for inviting me
to your wedding.

554
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,592
I'm really happy I could come,

555
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,226
and I promise it won't
be weird at all.

556
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,594
Yeah, I'm really happy
you could come too.

557
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,561
'Cause I didn't think
it was gonna happen.

558
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,530
What do you mean?

559
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,564
Well, Chuck told me you were

560
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:18,898
gonna be out of town
that weekend,

561
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,067
and then, you know, he just told
me that your plans changed,

562
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,002
so, uh... so yeah,
so that's great news.

563
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,238
Why would it be weird?

564
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,806
Um, it'd be weird
'cause I'm weird.

565
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,841
Oh.

566
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:32,411
Whooo...

567
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:33,646
I'm leaving.

568
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,750
<i>(Amy)
Night, everyone.</i>

569
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:40,720
Hey, Amy.
Check it out.

570
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,121
No way, you won coolest kill?

571
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:43,388
Not even close.

572
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,756
It turns out anyone
can just buy themselves

573
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:45,995
a children's karate trophy.

574
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,705
Smart.
Yeah.

575
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,666
Hey, before you go,
I wanted to ask you something.

576
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,796
<i>(Amy)
Of course.</i>

577
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,331
I was just wondering...

578
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,366
Are you wearing lipstick?

579
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,801
Yeah, I'm going out
with Teddy again.

580
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,270
Does it look weird?

581
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,104
I called my 13-year-old niece
for makeup tips,

582
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,773
but I don't know
if I trust her.

583
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,241
She is so sexual.

584
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,842
You look great.

585
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,010
Thank you.

586
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,612
So what's up?

587
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:12,415
Oh. It's not important.

588
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,849
<i>I just had a question
about a work thing.</i>

589
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,318
But have a great date,
and we'll talk tomorrow.

590
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,019
Okay.

591
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,690
Bye.
Bye.

592
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:25,960
I'll help you with
your work stuff, Jakey.

593
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,244
Perfect.
