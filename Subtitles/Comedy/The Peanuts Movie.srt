Raise your cups

like it's Christmas

1261
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,648
I'm gonna celebrate this life I'm living

01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,940
I'm gonna tell my mother
every day I love her

1265
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,442
And tell her thanks
for being such a good mother

1266
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,100
From now on

1267
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,247

It feels good, don't it
Living your life in this quick moment?

1277
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,489
And you never ever think
it's gonna go away, but I'll say

1278
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,860
I know you'll wake up one day and say

1279
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,327
Yeah, I got things to do

1280
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,060
Yeah, I got mountains to move

1281
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,500
And it ain't about how sad it could be
It's about how good it should be

1282
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,886
Come on, sing

1283
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,180
It feels good, don't it?
It feels good, don't it?
