00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,208
I hope I get
pregnant tonight.

188
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,571
That would be nice.

I love the way you look.

Uh,

Oh.

Ah-choo!

198
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:57,173
Ha ha ha ha ha!

199
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,774
Here comes the bride!

200
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:04,940
Ha ha ha ha ha!

201
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:07,450
How do you do that?

202
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:11,818
Flap, where did you
learn how to do that?

204
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:17,260
That is the strangest music
to make love to.

205
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:18,260
I know.

207
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,973
Leave me alone.
I'm happy.

208
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,478
I don't want to talk to you.

209
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:38,481
Did you see the tablecloth
Rosie gave me?

210
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:41,484
It's got red flowers on it.

211
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:42,985
She made it.

212
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,578
No, not yet.

213
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:48,090
I made omelets.
I started them.

214
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,252
Kind of Tex-Mex.

215
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,420
No.

216
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,292
That was the worst thing...

217
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,060
you've ever done to me.

218
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,864
I think you owe
my husband an apology.

219
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,370
Until you apologize,

220
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,374
I won't listen to your gossip.

221

No, ma'am, I am not

As a matter of fact,
I don't need an apology.

All I want is
for you to understand...

Can't you stay
a little while longer?

00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:13,243
I thought we were
having a real good time.

245

Don't go yet.

246
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,347
One more minute.

Good night.

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,054
I bought you something.

252
00:15:58,122 --> 00:15:59,419
What?

253
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:04,659
A tie.

254
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,462
Emma,

255
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,726
you didn't buy this for me.

256
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,735
You were worried about
how I'd look to your mother.

257
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,738
Now, stop being a quisling
where she is concerned.

258
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:19,469
Why is it whenever I get
happy, you turn perverse?

259
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,807
Buying this made you happy?

260
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,744
Yes. Yes!

261
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:26,248
I wish you could understand this,

262
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,750
'cause you really don't.

263
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:31,254
It made me very happy,
buying this tie.

264
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:34,758
I went to two or three places
before finding it.

265
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:38,522
Then describing your jacket
to the salesman,

266
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:42,032
and knowing
how perfect it would match.

267
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,535
Which, by the way,
it certainly does.

00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,434
I mean, it was fun!

269
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,268
It was a goddamn Mardi Gras!

270
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,275
You're too dumb to understand
that kind of happiness.

271
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,277
I'm sorry.
I'm being terrible.

272
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:55,505
Going to your mother's,

273
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,774

a little irrational.

Yes.

Who's that short gentleman?

281
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,744
Not that it's any
of your business, but...

282
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:32,839
Just leave it at that.

Here she comes.

291

I met her two weeks ago
at church.

292
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:11,321
You might say she's
God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.

293
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,322
Then you like her?

294
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,326
Oh, no. Does it show?

00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,498
Good food.

I feel like
I haven't stopped talking.

300
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:39,345
I guess because I've been
thinking about you so much.

301
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,749

how to handle me?

you can give me.

to prowl after us.

to keep his jacket open...

351
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,295
because his belly's
getting too big.

00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,744
Where?

372
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:06,305
No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

373
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,757
Oh, Flap, you didn't
expect I'd be happy.

374
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:17,589
Let's be honest
with each other...

375
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,993
before we start pretending.

376
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,767
Um, look, Mom's
staring at me right now,

377
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:29,863
so can I talk about it
later to you?

378
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,872
Yeah.

379
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:32,772
All right.

380
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:33,775
Bye.

381
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,291
How long are you going
to keep this a secret?

382
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,295
The only school accepting Flap
for his associate professorship...

383
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:55,797
is in Des Moines.

384
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,300
He can't even do
the simple things,

385
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,858
like fail locally.

386
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,740
It's going to be fine, Momma.

387
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:06,241
It's Des Moines.

388
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,745
Say, "Bye-bye, house."

389
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,144
Bye-bye, house.

390
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:20,255
Be careful going down
these steps.

391
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,757
Don't break your leg.

392
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,130
Come here.
Come here.

393
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,270
Come here.
Come here.

394
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,472
[Rosie]
Stay sweet, honey.

395
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,171
Rosie...

396
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,305
Uh, that's enough, Rosie.

397
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,781
They have to get started.

398
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,286
Tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.

399
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:51,651
Have some fun, Rosie.

400
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:53,155
Don't act so brave.

401
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:56,283
I know you'll go crazy
without me to nag.

402
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,227
You be good to her
or else we'll get you.

403
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:03,190
I mean it.

404
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:08,867
Bye, Flap.

405
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:11,066
Have a good drive.

406
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:17,246
Okay, fingers and toes in.

407
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,747
Take Momma's purse.

408
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:32,755
Momma, that's the first time...

409
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,592
I stopped hugging first.

410
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:36,689
I like that.

411
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,893
Get yourself
a decent maternity dress.

412
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:43,804
Had to get one in, didn't you?

413
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,076
Did you tell her, Patsy?

414
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,476
She keeps thinking it's me.

415
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:52,780
Tom,

416
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,784
will you be good
to your mother...

417
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:58,082
and take care of her?

418
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,622
Bye, Mrs. Greenway.

419
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:01,213
Good-bye.

420
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,894
Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.

421
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,020
Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.

422
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,392
You shape up, Patsy.

423
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,189
Oops!

424
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,699
Dropped my gum.

425
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,201
We'll get you another piece.

426
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:22,000
The phone bill will be
enormous, you know that?

427
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:26,715
I'll miss you, Momma.

428
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,722
Can we go now?

429
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,724
Yeah. Pull away slow.

430
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,195
[Flap]
It will be good for us...

431
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:15,697
to be away from your...

432
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,357
From our families.

433
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,867
I miss Houston.

434
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:22,371
You don't know
how lucky you are.

435
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,237
Everybody wants to go
to Des Moines.

436
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:28,744
People come to get
one look at Des Moines...

437
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,245
before they die.

438
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:34,750
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.

439
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:36,752
I know you're teasing me.

440
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,754
Texas is the best!

441
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,720
I think you should stop worrying.

442
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,226
You'll see some
terrific new things.

443
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:46,262
We are.

444
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,835
[Garrett]
Oohhh!

445
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,342
Ahhooo!

446
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:05,676
Whoo!

447
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,216
Whoo!

448
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:09,717
Would you please, if you will,

449
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:12,721
hold it down over there?

450
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,519
Sorry, I can't hear you.

451
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,025
Hold it down!

452
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:20,529
Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

453
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:23,031
Come over a little closer.

454
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,536
Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you.

455
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:44,720
I took a sauna.

456
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:47,382
It's hard not to yell...

457
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,891
when you hit cold water.

458
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,723
You're ignoring me
when I speak?

459
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,731
What am I supposed to say?

460
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,233
It's hard not to yell...

461
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,565
when you hit cold water.

462
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,832
Hey, uh, come here.

463
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,509
Come here?

464
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,910
What is your name?

465
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,912
Aurora?

466
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:12,913
Yes.

467
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,775
You-You want a shock?

468
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,014
No, not especially.

469
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,078
What?

470
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:27,696
Well, we're going to have this...

471
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,197
dinner at, uh...

472
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:32,200
NASA dinner at the White House.

473
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:36,705
You know, some cosmonauts,
and all of us...

474
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,241
I didn't know
who I could take.

475
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,244
All the people I flew with,

476
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:46,248
their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back...

477
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:49,251
if I show up
with one of my regular girls.

478
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,310
I didn't know
anybody old enough,

479
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:56,518
so I thought, "Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbor."

480
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:02,230
Well, anyway, they
canceled the dinner,

481
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:06,667
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

482
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:07,828
Seriously.

483
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,566
Ain't that a shocker?

484
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,073
Yes.

485
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:15,578
Imagine you having a date
with someone...

486
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,512
where it wasn't necessarily
a felony.

487
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:26,789
What would you have said
if I asked you?

488
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,790
Seriously.

489
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:35,453
I would've said I'd like
to see the White House.

490
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:38,000
So you would've come.

491
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,268
What the hell.

492
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:44,306
You want to have dinner
out sometime?

493
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:45,807
No, thank you.

494
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,536
What about lunch?

495
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,273
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot.

496
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:54,316
There's something
about your manner.

497
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,912
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

498
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:04,255
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

499
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,760
This is the element.

500
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:08,262
Do you want to play, Aurora?

501
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,629
Want to have lunch?

502
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,066
We'll have lunch.

503
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,272
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant...

504
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,275
to improve the atmosphere
in this neighborhood,

505
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:22,072
I wouldn't exactly say no.

506
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,272
Come here.

507
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:28,283
We're too far apart to talk.

508
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:41,124
Now,

509
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:42,289
Aurora,

510
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:47,298
since you've agreed,

511
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,306
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

512
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:54,810
I mean, I know how you feel.

513
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:58,813
There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.

514
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,746
I said to myself,

515
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:03,251
"You agreed to do it.

516
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,911
"You're strapped in,

517
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:07,422
"and you're in the hands...

518
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:12,052
"of something bigger and
more powerful than yourself.

519
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:16,064
"So, uh, why don't you just...

520
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:20,091
lay back and enjoy the ride?"

521
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,602
I'm not going.

522
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:23,605
There's something
wrong with you.

523
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,279
Oh, God.
I'm such a shit.

524
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,287
[Flap]
Wait! That must be it.

525
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,289
[Emma]
Right there? Oh, God!

526
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:44,793
Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

527
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,294
Oh, it's great.

528
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:47,693
Isn't that sweet?

529
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, that was a bump.

530
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,301
Oh, yeah.

531
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,803
What is that?

532
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,306
Shall we go see the house?

533
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,739
You stay there.

534
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,279
Come on.
Let's get this off.

535
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:05,246
Come on.

536
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,250
Whoa! Come on.

537
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,755
Oh, sweetheart,
did you hurt yourself?

538
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:14,755
Nope, not yet.

539
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,758
Do you like it?

540
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:19,260
Do you like it?

541
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:21,263
Oh, it's great.

542
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:23,265
Flap, it's great.

543
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,766
Oh, my God.

544
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,769
Oh.

545
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:28,769
Oh!

546
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:43,517
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

547
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,290
I'm really tired.

548
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,402
Ow! Ow!

549
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:11,406
You ever made love in Iowa?

550
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,256
Tommy's room is on
the other side of the hall,

551
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:22,257
so we can get noisy.

552
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:26,261
Good. You get to make

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,384
That'll do till you're ten.

737
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,443
You're driving Daddy away.

738
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:22,251
Tommy, stand up and follow me.

739
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:24,349
Don't make me hit you.

740
00:44:24,426 --> 00:44:25,358
Hurry up.

741
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,264
I said hurry. Come on!

742
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:35,996
$44.

743
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,440
20, 30...

744
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:56,984
Let's see.
That's 38, 40...

745
00:44:57,058 --> 00:44:59,822
You don't have enough money?

746
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:06,232
I don't have any checks,

747
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,769
so I'll put some things back.

748
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:11,772
Can I have the register key?

749
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,274
She doesn't have enough money!

750
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:17,444
It's no big thing.

751
00:45:17,512 --> 00:45:19,946
I brought the wrong purse.

752
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:21,448
Here, take this.

753
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:26,119
$43.75.

754
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:32,292
$41.35.

755
00:45:33,428 --> 00:45:35,760
Mom, you promised
I could have something.

756
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,764
I won't give her real food.

757
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:38,764
Give her this.

758
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,130
No way!

759
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,133
$40.35.

760
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,635
Mom!

761
00:45:42,704 --> 00:45:44,137
All right.

762
00:45:44,205 --> 00:45:45,604
Here.

763
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:47,300
$40.55.

764
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:56,180
$40.75. We're going
in the wrong direction.

765
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:58,617
Why must you be so nasty?

766
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:02,588
I mean, it's not going
to help anything.

767
00:46:02,657 --> 00:46:05,285
We're both people, you know?

768
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:08,288
$40.75.

769
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:10,627
I don't need it.

770
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,237
Mrs. Horton,
I'm Sam Burns from the bank.

771
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:21,241
I turned down
the second on your house.

772
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:24,801
Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.

773
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:27,473
Can I help you
make up the difference?

774
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,414
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

775
00:46:29,484 --> 00:46:31,679
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

776
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:36,022
You're a very rude young woman.

777
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:37,752
I know Douglas from the Rotary.

778
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:41,421
I can't believe he'd want you
treating customers so badly.

779
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:44,363
I don't think I was
treating her badly.

780
00:46:44,432 --> 00:46:47,265
Then you must be from New York.

781
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:55,442
Be careful, Teddy!

782
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,442
What?

783
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,944
Be careful!

784
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:02,211
Where's your car?

785
00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:03,215
Right here.

786
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:05,718
That was worst time I've ever had.

787
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:08,722
I didn't know I could get
cheered up so fast.

788
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,722
No problem.

789
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,224
Come on, Mom.

790
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:12,725
Wait by the car.

791
00:47:12,794 --> 00:47:13,726
Come on.

792
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:14,727
Wait.

793
00:47:14,796 --> 00:47:15,728
No.

794
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:17,628
Wait by the car, honey.

795
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:18,631
But...

796
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,632
Wait, honey!

797
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:21,726
Over by the car!

798
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:22,735
Now!

799
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:23,736
Now!

800
00:47:23,805 --> 00:47:25,466
Now!

801
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:31,737
Nice boys.

802
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:34,247
You're great with them, too.

803
00:47:34,315 --> 00:47:36,249
Really.

804
00:47:36,317 --> 00:47:40,413
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

805
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:41,921
Hey, thanks again.

806
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,753
Oh, no thanks required.

807
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:45,793
I've had a lovely time.

808
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,990
Me, too.
I'll get the money back to you.

809
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:53,125
You can drop it
in the mail, if you like.

810
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:55,465
To the bank?

811
00:47:55,537 --> 00:48:00,497
Sure. You could even use
a check-by-mail envelope.

812
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:04,102
Or, uh, you could come in.
Whichever.

813
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,807
Maybe I'll come in sometime.

814
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,711
Well, that'd be fine.

815
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,224
Can I help you with that?

816
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:23,890
No, thanks.
I'm used to this.

817
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,729
And so another birthday...

818
00:48:27,802 --> 00:48:30,794
for a gal named Aurora Greenway.

819
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:32,305
Even though 50,

820
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:35,365
she still takes my breath away.

821
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:39,209
Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky.

822
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,875
A heavenly object, a siren's cry.

823
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:45,552
You're the best.

824
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,053
Happy birthday.

825
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:50,390
Thank you, Edward.

826
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,655
Thank you.

827
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:56,219
Do you want one, Vernon?

828
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:58,731
Would you like a kiss?

829
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:04,838
You're not lying
about your age, are you?

830
00:49:04,906 --> 00:49:06,339
Of course not.

831
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,841
I thought you were 52.

832
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,313
How do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

833
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,349
She said her age.

834
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,350
The number doesn't matter,

835
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:19,352
but its concealment does.

836
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,354
Why does he keep talking?

837
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:22,354
Dr. Ratcher...

838
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:25,859
The way to adjust to old age...

839
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:29,363
Doctor, I think
you're a mite confused...

840
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,866
because of being
recently widowed and all.

841

[Tapping On Window]

842
00:49:54,956 --> 00:49:56,389
You okay?

843
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:00,226
Hmm?

844
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,266
[Vernon]
Aurora?

845
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:07,767
Aurora?

846
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:09,770
Let's give her some privacy.

847
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:28,982
[Buzz]

848
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:30,922
Yeah?

849
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:32,425
The door's open.

850
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:35,428
Just a minute.

851
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:45,938
Well, hello.

852
00:50:47,508 --> 00:50:48,440
Hi.

853
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:57,079
I was curious if you still
wanted to take me to lunch.

854
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:00,953
I wasn't aware that we...

855
00:51:01,022 --> 00:51:03,456
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.

856
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:05,389
A few years back?

857
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,894
Does the invitation still exist?

858
00:51:07,962 --> 00:51:10,396
Would you like to?

859
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,898
To lunch.

860
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:14,867
Not dinner, remember.
It was lunch.

861
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:16,426
Why not? No.

862
00:51:16,504 --> 00:51:17,436
Good.

863
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,630
When?

864
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,743
Uh...

865
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:24,800
Tomorrow?

866
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:25,903
Tomorrow?

867
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:30,507
All right.
All right.

868
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:32,918
Good.

869
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:38,424
12:30?

870
00:51:38,493 --> 00:51:40,757
12:00.

871
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:41,920
Good.

872
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,784
If you mind the open air,

873
00:52:37,852 --> 00:52:39,786
I could get the top.

874
00:52:39,854 --> 00:52:40,912
No. Don't worry.

875
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:42,923
Grown women are prepared...

876
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:44,925
for life's little emergencies.

877
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:04,377
Us going out together...

878
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:06,379
Not bad, huh?

879
00:53:06,447 --> 00:53:07,880
Do you think,

880
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:11,385
could you possibly put the top up?

881
00:53:11,452 --> 00:53:14,250
The top's at home in the garage.

882
00:53:27,468 --> 00:53:29,402
Hello. How are you?

883
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:33,907
How are you, Ali?

884
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:36,409
It's nice to see you.

[Woman]
That guy, Fred, at that bar?

886
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:53,426
He asked me out.

[Woman #2]
Oh, God.

888
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:58,432
He took me to the Cadillac Bar.

889
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:00,364
It's a fun place...

890
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:05,240
if you're with the right people,
but I wasn't.

891
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:31,397
Well,

892
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,366
I'm starving.

893
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:36,562
No hidden meaning
in that remark.

894
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:37,764
Well, uh...

895
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,773
Would you like an oyster?

896
00:54:46,347 --> 00:54:47,279
No.

897
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:50,550
Thank you.

898
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:52,051
It's good.

899
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:59,690
I think that is extremely rude,

900
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,720
noticing other women
when you're with me.

901
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:05,231
I, um...

902
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,031
think we're going
to have to get drunk.

903
00:55:09,103 --> 00:55:11,003
I don't get drunk,

904
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:15,338
and I don't care
for escorts who do.

905
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,844
You got me into this.

906
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:20,847
Trust me about this one thing.

907
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:23,748
You need a lot of drinks.

908
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:26,343
To break the ice?

909
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:31,383
To kill the bug
that you have up your ass.

910
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:37,530
May I get you something?

911
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:40,032
I will have some bourbon,

912
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:41,534
preferably Wild Turkey.

914
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:58,150
You're not fun,
by any chance?

915
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:02,417
We shouldn't think
about that right now.

916
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:08,153

sometimes miss dessert.

at the same time.

Hi, Sam.
It's nice to see you.

00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:35,287
I can hardly believe it.

922
00:56:35,355 --> 00:56:36,788
You, too.

923
00:56:38,158 --> 00:56:40,991
What I didn't expect was
that there'd be moments...

924
00:56:41,061 --> 00:56:43,052
where I'd forget to be scared...

925
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,030
that someone
would see us together.

926
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:47,658
You don't have to be scared.

927
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:50,669
Contemplating sin
is all we've done.

928
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:54,104
I'm glad you've been
contemplating it, too.

929
00:56:54,174 --> 00:56:56,108
I didn't know that.

930
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:58,542
Well, all these lunches,

931
00:56:58,612 --> 00:57:00,546
all this hand-holding.

932
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:05,074
I'm not going
back to the bank this afternoon.

933
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:10,089
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.

934
00:57:10,157 --> 00:57:12,921
It's pretty far out, and...

935
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:15,928
Well, it's empty.

936
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:22,801
I've got to pick up
my kids at 5:00.

937
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,336
Okay. I understand.

938
00:57:24,404 --> 00:57:26,804
Don't give it a thought.

939
00:57:29,443 --> 00:57:30,967
Emma,

940
00:57:31,044 --> 00:57:34,480
I haven't made love
to a woman...

941
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,384
in almost three years.

942
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:39,817
How come?

943
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:44,113
My wife has a disc problem,

944
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,716
and she can't take having...

945
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:49,828
any weight on her.

946
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:54,026
I hope you don't
mind me asking this,

947
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:59,539
but have you ever thought of
your wife getting on top?

948
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:02,268
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

949
00:58:02,342 --> 00:58:04,708
She may surprise you.

950
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:06,712
No. I don't think so.

951
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,340
It would be so unlike her.

952
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,713
Did you ask?

953
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:13,446
About 600 times.

954
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:27,199
[Emma]

955
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:30,202
[Sam]
Do you prefer Texas to Iowa?

956
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,704
What were you really thinking?

957
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:37,073
That's what I was thinking
when you just asked me that.

958
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:41,080
There seems to be
an absence of wildness,

959
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:43,207
even in the people.

960
00:58:43,283 --> 00:58:47,219
Well, we're farmers,
and we talk poor...

961
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:50,723
because the farmer
aspect of things is,

962
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:54,227
"Don't let anybody know
you have anything,

963
00:58:54,294 --> 00:58:57,229
and don't call attention
to yourself."

964
00:58:57,297 --> 00:58:59,492
My wife says...

965
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:02,967
I guess we shouldn't
talk about Dotty.

966
00:59:03,103 --> 00:59:05,003
Wind in the hair!

967
00:59:05,072 --> 00:59:09,406
Lead in the pencil!

968

970

971
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:25,023
Keep giving it that gas!

972
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:29,592
I see the Gulf of Mexico!

973
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,291
I'm not enjoying this!

974
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:34,993
Give it a chance.

975
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:37,298

It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.

979
01:00:01,561 --> 01:00:04,587
If you wanted to
get me on my back,

980
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:07,098
you just had to ask me.

981
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,683
Aah!

982
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,184
Oww! My hand!

983
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:28,016
Get it out!

984
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:30,522
I can't! I swear!

985
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,524
I swear to God!

986
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:34,457
We were having a good time,

987
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:37,520
then you had to go do this!

988
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:39,030
Please, anything!

989
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:41,033
Bend down!
Bend down!

990
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:47,039
Why did you have to get drunk?

991
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:49,041
I am not drunk...

992
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:50,542
Anymore!

993
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,044
The pain sobered me up.

994

No!

995
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:16,002
Emma, this might be
a terrible thing to ask,

996
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,435
but are you thinking
about your husband?

997
01:01:18,505 --> 01:01:19,437
A little.

998
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:20,939
We can go back.

999
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:22,440
No, Sam. Stop it.

1000
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,943
Look, I want to do this.

1001
01:01:25,011 --> 01:01:28,947
I'm glad I don't know whether
Flap's been with someone else.

1002
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:33,452
I'd hate to think I was
doing this just to get even.

shocking and insulting me?

01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:48,730
I'm inviting you to come over...

1102
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:50,827
and look at my Renoir.

1103
01:06:50,904 --> 01:06:52,565
You're inviting me to bed.

1104
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,767
Yes, it happens to be
in my bedroom.

1105
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:58,777
Is the Renoir under the covers?

1106
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,113
Don't cackle, Garrett.

1107
01:07:03,183 --> 01:07:06,118
Do you want to see it?

1108
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:10,646
Do I want to
come to your bedroom?

1109
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:12,213
Let me think.

1110
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:13,725
Do you?

1111
01:07:13,793 --> 01:07:15,226
Just... Just...

1112
01:07:15,295 --> 01:07:17,661
Just give me a minute.

1113
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,790
It's...
It's a tough one.

1114
01:07:22,402 --> 01:07:23,835
Um...

1115
01:07:25,238 --> 01:07:27,832
I guess... I don't know.

1116
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:31,138
Yeah, okay.

1117
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:32,610
I guess so.

1118
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,169
Sure. Why not?

1119
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:38,116
I'll see you in a bit.

1120
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:40,482
If I don't answer the bell,

1121
01:07:40,553 --> 01:07:41,884
the back door's open.

1122
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:43,980
The back door's open.

1123
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:22,827
[Doorbell Rings]

1124
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:24,830
My God. He ran it.

1125
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,473
[Door Opens]

1126
01:08:38,044 --> 01:08:38,976
[Door Closes]

1127
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:46,985
[Breathing Heavily]

1128
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:58,095
Hi.

1129
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,036
I was doing laps when you called.

1130
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,330
Lucky for us,

1131
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,341
I only did eight.

1132
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:13,878
This is it.

1133
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:17,215
This is the Renoir.

1134
01:09:27,226 --> 01:09:28,659
I like it.
