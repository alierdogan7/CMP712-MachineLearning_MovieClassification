Aah!

Aah!

00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:58,196
- Oh.
- What the fuck, Hank?

00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,330
Ugh.
I'm sorry, Marce.

00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,065
I just... I couldn't sleep
last night.

8
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,567
My mind was racing,

9
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,936
and that couch of yours
is no fucking help whatsoever.

10
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,938
It's, like, a medieval
fucking torture device.

11
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:09,474
I was touching your penis,
Hank.

12
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:11,142
I know, Marce.
Felt good too.

13
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,410
You give a nice tug job.

14
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:14,445
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,616
When she's motivated.
It's a lost art, really.

16
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,084
Oh, shit.
I think I'm gonna puke.

17
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:21,419
Did you guys fuck?

18
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,254
Both:
Gross.

19
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,456
Hey!
What do you mean, gross?

20
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,925
Fuck you,
you fucking pedophile.

21

What's so gross
about fucking me?

22
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:30,028
Nothing, Marce.

23
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,362
You know I'd throw
a shot into you.

24
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:32,997
Any time.

25
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,399
Oh, Christ.
Make it stop.

26
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,334
That's it. All you do
is mope around the house

27
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,335
all day in your underwear.

28
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,436
You're on notice.

29
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,204
Consider your ass
kicked to the curb.

30
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,673
Marce, I got no place to go.

31
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:43,675

Becca won't have me.

I'm this degenerate scumbag.

40
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,579
And would it kill you
to put some goddamn clothes on?

41
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,548

No way, Charlie.

47
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,757
No, you look good.

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,758
Hmm.

more sorry about it,

is a great case for me.

Maybe no one was hurt
in your case.

I was hurt.
She punched me.

00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,109
Maybe it was all just good,
dirty fun.

the preliminary hearing,

there's not enough of a case
to take to trial.

00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,370
And if you can't?

156

Don't tell anyone
I told you, but, um...

161
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:23,147
Sometimes it's even better
than sex.

162

- Wow.
- Safer too.

163
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:27,118

like sex very much.

- I'm not.

532
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:09,459
It's just that I just had
one or more fingers inside you,

533
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,228
and I... I don't know
where you come from,

534
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:14,931
but the way I was raised,
that's pretty intimate.

535
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:19,769
[Exclaims]

536
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,324
[Soft moaning]

537
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,767
"To my dear beautiful daughter,

538
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,302
"I'm writing you a letter.

539
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:01,604
"That's right,
a good old-fashioned letter.

540
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,573
"It's a lost art, really.

541
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,275
Like handjobs."

542
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,911
Shit.

543
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,612
"I have a confession to make.

544
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:12,048
"I didn't like you
very much at first.

545
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,651
"You were just this annoying,
little blob.

546
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:17,854
"You smelled nice.
Most of the time.

547
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:20,623
"But you didn't seem
to have much interest in me.

548
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:24,027
"Which I, of course,
found vaguely insulting.

549
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:26,996
"It was you and your mom
against the world.

550
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:29,733
"Funny how some things
never change.

551
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,235
"So I cruised along,
doing my thing,

552
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,038
"acting the fool,
not really understanding

553
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,574
"how being a parent
changes you.

554
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:41,444
"And I don't remember the exact
moment everything changed.

555
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,646
"I just know that it did.

556
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:45,949
"One minute I was impenetrable.

557
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:47,584
"Nothing could touch me.

558
00:25:47,618 --> 00:25:51,788
"The next, my heart was somehow
beating outside my chest,

559
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:54,257
"exposed to the elements.

560
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,060
"Loving you has been
the most profound,

561
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:00,263
"intense, painful experience
of my life.

562
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,466
"In fact, it's been almost
too much to bear.

563
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:04,801
"As your father,

564
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:07,871
"I made a silent vow
to protect you from the world,

565
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:09,606
"never realizing I was the one

566
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,808
"who would end up
hurting you the most.

567
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:15,078
"When I flash forward,
my heart breaks.

568
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,013
"Mostly because
I can't imagine you

569
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,749
"speaking of me
with any sort of pride.

570
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:24,320
"How could you? Your father
is a child in a man's body.

571
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:27,524
"He cares for nothing and
everything at the same time.

572
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,727
"Noble in thought,
weak in action.

573
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:36,466
"Something has to change.
Something has to give.

574
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,168
"It's getting dark.

575
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,303
Too dark to see."
