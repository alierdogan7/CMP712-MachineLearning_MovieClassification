then it's just a growth, like a cyst.

Yes.

701
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,321
I owned a Schwinn bike as a kid.

702

- Yeah.

703
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,082
I lived in New Jersey
for about five years.

704
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,721
And then later in business school,
Schwinn was one of our case studies.

710

sensibilities, techniques.

713
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,805

- What happened, in your view?

714
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,963
- I thought you studied our case.
- I did.

715
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,044
- Schwinn went to China.
- We did.

716
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,925
They could build our bikes
a lot cheaper and a lot faster

717
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,045
- and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- But it wasn't?

718
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,605
Well, obviously not.

719
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,485
We taught them how to build
a good, solid bicycle.

720
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,564
They took that wisdom and started
making all the bikes themselves.

721
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,525
- Now they own the market.
- Because they can sell them for nothing.

722
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,284
But it's just a matter
of taking different stickers

723
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,885
and putting them on the very same bikes.

724
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,361

1185
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,730
Yeah, this one time,
he brought me up to New Hampshire.

1186
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,485
It was cold,

1187
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,965
'cause it had snowed a week before.

1188
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,281
And we drove into this national park.

1189
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,160
And we parked and we walked
deep into the woods

1190
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,720
for four hours, at least.

1191
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:41,445
And the sun was already falling,
so we stopped.

1192
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,605
No sign of any civilization
in any direction.

1193
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,325
I thought he had a plan, you know,

1194
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,041
but he acted like he had just
figured out the math of it all...

1195
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,085
that we weren't gonna get back before dark

1196
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,205
and the night would freeze us solid.

1197
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,965
Not to mention the prospect
of wolves, bears.

1198
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,565
- Wolves and bears?
- Yeah.

1199
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,281
So he asked me, "What should we do, son?"

1200
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,643
And I realized
this was some kind of a test,

1201
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,765
so I thought of all
the Boy Scout stuff I knew

1202
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,287
and I said, "Build a shelter?"

1203
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,927
So we got started and we took
turns chopping and tying.

1204
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,362
We set it up there,
a perfectly respectable A-frame.

1205
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,081
We collected fronds from the pine trees
and lined the bottom with them.

1206
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,005
And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"

1207
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,765
And I knew. We needed a needle and thread.

1208
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,805
Or... duct tape.

1209
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,005
For what?

1210
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,323
To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.

1211
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,885
We cut up our jackets and we taped them
together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.

1212
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,282
And we slept there in our long underwear.

1213
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,002
- And you shared the sleeping bag?
- We did.

1214
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,160
And I must say,
when we were all settled in there,

1215
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,365
it was really warm.

1216
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,091
And you didn't have a fire?

1217
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,521
No fire. Just each other.

1218
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,370
And in the morning?

1219
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,404
We taped our jackets back
together and went home.

1220
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,206
[LAUGHS]

1221
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,048
Good.

1222
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,884
ALAN: Hey, Kit.

1223
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,884
I'm writing to tell you
that I'm postponing

1224
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,885
my return to the United States
and I don't know for how long.

1225
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,802
The deal I was working on
here in Jeddah didn't happen.

1226
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,924
A competitor from China offered
the same technology a lot faster

1227
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,605
and at half the price.

1228
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:08,286
I shouldn't have been surprised,
but there I was, surprised.

1229
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,765
So, Kit, the money part
of our lives is not solved just yet,

1230
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,285
but I'm working on it.

1231
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,162
I've taken a new job here
which pays pretty well.

1232
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,564
It should be enough even to get you
back into school next semester.

1233
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,925
Keep believing, Kit,
'cause I believe in you.

1234
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,845
You're strong and young and you have time.

1235
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,045
I'm not so young, but I have to tell you,

1236
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,085
there's a force in my life now

1237
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,403
that makes me feel strong again.

1238
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,450
And I feel that there's time.

1239
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,047
There must be time.

1240
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,764
