00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,267
AM I?

179
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,800
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,533
WHO IS IT, JOE?

181
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,600
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW.

182
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
WE'RE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE DRINK.

183
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,067
YES, SO I SEE.

184
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,533
WELL...

185
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,533
SEE YOU LATER, JOE.

186
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,867
SORRY.

187
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,067
DIDN'T KNOW I WAS
TALKING TO THE BOYFRIEND.

188
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,067
[JOE]
SO LONG.

189
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,567
SO LONG, JOE.

190
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,067
WHO'S THAT MAN?

191
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,200
HE ISN'T ANYBODY,

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,067
JUST A FELLOW
I USED TO KNOW.

193
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,067
I THOUGHT YOU'D GIVEN UP
THAT SORT OF FRIEND.

194
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,067
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HIM IN YEARS.

195
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,067
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO THINK

196
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,100
I WAS HIGH-HATTING HIM.

197
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,600
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING.

198
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,100
DON'T WORRY.
YOU WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN.

199
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,567
TELL ME, DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT GOING?

200
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,433
NO. I JUST CAME BACK
FOR A SECOND.

201
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,467
I WANT TO GET THOSE...
BONDS.

202
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,100
BONDS?

203
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,933
WHAT BONDS?

204
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,600
THE GOVERNMENT BONDS,

205
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
THE ONES YOU TOOK
FROM THE OFFICE SAFE.

206
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
OH, YES.
YOU TOLD ME

207
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,900
TO SELL THOSE
A LONG TIME AGO.

208
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,100
I'D NEVER TELL YOU
TO SELL THOSE.

209
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
I BOUGHT THOSE
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

210
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,600
BUT DON'T YOU
REMEMBER--

211
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,100
NOW, SEE HERE, JULIA,

212
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,600
YOU'RE COUNTING TOO MUCH
ON MY ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.

213
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LITTLE
HERE AND THERE FOR SOME TIME

214
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,933
WITHOUT MY SAYING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

215
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,433
BUT THIS IS $50,000.

216
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,600
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
ACCUSING ME OF--

217
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,100
NO ONE ELSE HAD THE
COMBINATION TO THAT SAFE.

218
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,600
YOU TOOK THEM.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM?

219
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
WHAT IF I DID TAKE THEM?

220
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF SEEING YOU HAND OUT

221
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO YOUR FAMILY,

222
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
SUPPORTING
A GANG OF LOAFERS

223
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
THAT DON'T CARE
A DARN ABOUT YOU,

224
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,167
A WIFE THAT KICKED YOU OUT

225
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,167
THE FIRST TIME
YOUR FOOT SLIPPED.

226
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,167
NOT ONE WOULD RAISE
A HAND TO HELP YOU,

227
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,167
AND I'VE GIVEN
MY WHOLE LIFE TO YOU.

228
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,167
IF YOU KICKED OFF TOMORROW,
WHERE WOULD I BE?

229
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,667
OUT IN THE GUTTER.

230
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,667
I TOOK THOSE BONDS.
WHO HAS A BETTER RIGHT?

231
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,067
I WANT THAT MONEY,

232
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,667
OR I'LL HAND YOU OVER
TO THE POLICE.

233
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,067
GO AHEAD.

234
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,167
THEY'LL BE PRETTY ROUGH
WITH YOU...WITH YOUR RECORD.

235
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,667
THAT'S A FINE THING
TO SAY

236
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,233
AFTER WHAT
I'VE BEEN TO YOU.

237
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,833
HELLO. GIVE ME--

238
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,667
WELL?

239
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,167
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

240
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,167
25,000--
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

241
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,667
YOU'RE GOING TO RETURN
EVERY CENT OF IT.

242
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,667
I CAN'T.
I HAVEN'T GOT IT.

243
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,667
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE REST?

244
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,167
I NEVER HAD IT.

245
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,167
THEN THERE WAS SOMEONE
IN WITH YOU. WHO WAS IT?

246
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,667
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

247
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,167
I'LL ANSWER THAT.

248
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,333
HELLO.

249
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,333
HELLO.

250
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,333
HELLO!

251
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,333
HELLO!

252
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,667
YOU DON'T NEED
TO TELL ME.

253
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

254
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:15,133
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

255
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,167
STOP WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

256
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,667
HE'LL TURN UP
ALL RIGHT.

257
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,733
YES, BUT, TOMMY,
TODAY'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

258
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,900
HE'S JUST FORGOTTEN.

259
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,233
YOU KNOW HOW HE
FORGETS EVERYTHING.

260
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,733
NO. HE NEVER FORGETS
A PROMISE TO ME.

261
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,900
I'M WORRIED, TOMMY.

262
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,233
I KNOW SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HIM.

263
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,233
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
TO HIM, DARLING?

264
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,233
NOW, WILL YOU
STOP WORRYING?

265
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:23,233
YOU SEE, THE IMPORTANT
THING IS THE RHYTHM.

266
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,233
YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE
RHYTHM IN YOUR SHAKING.

267
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,233
NOW, A MANHATTAN YOU
SHAKE TO FOX-TROT TIME,

268
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,733
A BRONX TO TWO-STEP
TIME.

269
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,200
THE DRY MARTINI

270
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,733
YOU ALWAYS SHAKE
TO WALTZ TIME.

271
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,067
OH!

272
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,867
MMM!

273
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,567
WHAT IS IT?
JUST A MINUTE.

274
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,700
NOW, MIND YOU,

275
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,700
THERE'S A STILL MORE
MODERN TREND IN--

276
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,067
HERE. LET ME HAVE--
THANK YOU.

277
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,267
CERTAIN PEOPLE--

278
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,600
HELLO THERE.

279
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,767
HELLO.

280
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,267
ANOTHER GLASS.

281
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,767
HOW ARE YOU?

282
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,267
YOU KNOW,
WE DO KNOW EACH OTHER.

283
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,767
WELL, OF COURSE WE DO.

284
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,767
WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR YEARS.

285
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,233
AREN'T YOU
NICK CHARLES?

286
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,267
YES.

287
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,267
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.
I'M DOROTHY WYNANT.

288
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,267
NOT THAT SCRAWNY
LITTLE BIT OF--

289
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,267
YES.

290
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,267
HOW DID YOU EVER
REMEMBER ME?

291
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,767
YOU USED TO FASCINATE ME--
A REAL, LIVE DETECTIVE.

292
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,267
YOU USED TO TELL ME
THE MOST WONDERFUL STORIES.

293
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,767
WERE THEY TRUE?

294
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,567
PROBABLY NOT.

295
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,467
TOMMY, THIS IS
NICK CHARLES.

296
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,467
HI, TOMMY.
HAVE ANOTHER GLASS.

297
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,967
HE WORKED ONCE
ON A CASE FOR MY FATHER.

298
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,467
YEAH. SOME NUT
WANTED TO KILL HIM.

299
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,967
HOW IS YOUR FATHER?

300
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,467
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME TO ASK YOU.

301
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,467
HE'S DISAPPEARED.

302
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:42,967
DON'T SAY THAT,
DARLING.

303
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,467
HE'S JUST AWAY
SOMEWHERE WORKING.

304
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,467
I CAN'T FIND HIM.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

305
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,967
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT KNOW.

306
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,467
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

307
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,467
I'VE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

308
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,967
WHAT ABOUT
HIS LAWYER?

309
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,467
USED TO BE SOME BIRD BY
THE NAME OF MAC, UH...

310
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,467
OH, MacCAULAY?

311
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,467
HERBERT MacCAULAY.

312
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,800
I TRIED HIM ONCE.

313
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,200
TRY HIM AGAIN.

314
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,700
HERE'S A NICKEL.

315
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,200
THANK YOU.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

316
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,067
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT
ME WORRYING, TOO.

317
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,067
OH, YOU MUSTN'T
WORRY ABOUT HIM.

318
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,933
MIND YOU, HE'S
A GREAT GUY BUT SCREWY.

319
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,533
[MAN] MADAM,
I'M VERY SORRY,

320
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,367
BUT NO DOG...

321
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,533
ASTA!

322
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,700
I'M SORRY, MADAM.
NO DOGS ALLOWED.

323
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,533
YOU CANNOT TAKE
THE DOG IN THERE.

324
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,533
I'M NOT TAKING HIM.
HE'S TAKING ME.

325
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,567
OH!

326
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,067
ARE YOU HURT, MADAM?

327
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,233
NO. WOMEN AND CHILDREN
FIRST, BOYS.

328
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,200
WHAT IS THE SCORE
ANYWAY?

329
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,967
OH, SO IT'S YOU
HE WAS AFTER.

330
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,200
HELLO, SUGAR.

331
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,533
HE'S DRAGGED ME INTO
EVERY GIN MILL ON THE BLOCK.

332
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,533
I HAD HIM OUT
THIS MORNING.

333
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,067
I THOUGHT SO.

334
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,067
THIS IS TOMMY.
MY WIFE.

335
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,533
HOW ARE YOU,
TOMMY?

336
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,533
TOMMY, I DON'T USUALLY
LOOK LIKE THIS.

337
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,067
I'VE BEEN
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

338
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,867
MADAM, I'M AFRAID
WE SHALL TAKE THE DOG OUT.

339
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:50,867
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

340
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,067
IT'S MY DOG...
AND MY WIFE.

341
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,067
YOU MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
ME FIRST ON THE BILLING.

342
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,533
THE DOG'S
WELL-TRAINED.

343
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,067
HE'LL BEHAVE
HIMSELF.

344
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,533
HE MIGHT
BITE SOMEBODY.

345
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,733
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
LOOK. LIE DOWN.

346
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,600
LIE DOWN.

347
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,400
STAND UP.

348
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,100
SEE?

349
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100
ANY LUCK?

350
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,067
YES. HE'S JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.

351
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,267
YOUR FATHER?

352
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,300
NO. MacCAULAY.

353

I WISH THEY'D
STOP THAT.

1576
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,900
I WONDER IF
THEY'LL FIND HIM.

1577
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,467
HE MUST BE
IN NEW YORK.

I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
WHY WYNANT'S SHOP IS CLOSED.

1588
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:23,467
HE WENT AWAY,
DIDN'T HE?

1589
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:25,467
HE WENT AWAY A LOT
WHEN I KNEW HIM,

1590
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:27,467
BUT HE NEVER
CLOSED THE SHOP.

1591

01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,300
HA HA! I'LL GET HIM,
ALL RIGHT!

1733
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,133
BRING THAT STUFF
OUT TO THE CAR.

1734
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:17,133
YOU GOING TO RUN HIM

1735
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:18,267
THROUGH THE
POLARISCOPE?

1736
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:19,467
YES.

1737
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:21,300
YOU MIND IF
I COME SEE IT?

1738
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,933
I'M VERY INTERESTED
IN THAT BODY.

1739
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:27,300
STEP RIGHT OVER HERE,
MR. CHARLES.

1740

HE WAS KILLED WITH. SEE?

1741
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,900
HMM.

1742
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,800
OOH...

1743
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,533
WHAT'S THAT?

1744
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:47,300
OH, JUST AN OLD
PIECE OF SHRAPNEL.

1745
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,633
SHRAPNEL, HUH?

1746
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:51,133
MMM. WELL, MAYBE
HE WAS IN THE WAR.

1747
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:54,133
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR
HIS CANE AND HIS LIMP.

1748
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:55,933
YES. YES.

1749

01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:36,067
HEY, DOGGY.
COME ON.

1757
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:38,200
LOOK DOWN AT THE
FLOOR, AT THE BODY.

1758
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,533
MR. CHARLES,
THIS WAY.

1759
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:41,067
GET THAT
OUT OF HERE!

1760
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,067
JUST A MOMENT. MRS. CHARLES,
ONE FAMILY GROUP.

1761
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,367
FOR THE WOMAN'S PAGE.

1762
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:46,367
DO THE POLICE KNOW
WHERE WYNANT IS?

1763
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:47,367
NO.

1764
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:48,967
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL FIND HIM?

1765
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,200
I KNOW THEY WILL.

1766
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
GOT ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY?

1767
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,200
NO.

1768
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,700
WHAT ABOUT
THIS ROSEBREEN?

1769
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,700
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

1770
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,700
CAN'T YOU TELL US
ANYTHING ABOUT THE CASE?

1771
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,767
YES. IT'S PUTTING ME
BEHIND IN MY DRINKING.

01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,267
LET'S GET THIS IN.

NEXT STEP, NICK?

01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,267
GOOD-BYE, BOYS.

1777
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:11,767
GOOD-BYE.

1778
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:19,767
BACK TO CALIFORNIA,
HUH?

1779
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:21,267

AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT SATISFIED.

01:13:27,267 --> 01:13:28,767
OH!

1783
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:30,267
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

1784
01:13:30,267 --> 01:13:31,767
WELL, I DON'T INSIST.

1785
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:33,267
NO, I WANTED YOU

1786
01:13:33,267 --> 01:13:35,267
TO STAY HERE
AND FIND WYNANT.

1787
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:36,767
I DID FIND HIM.

1788
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,767
HE WAS DOWN
IN HIS SHOP.

1789
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,267
NICK!

1790
01:13:40,267 --> 01:13:42,267
THAT WAS HIS BODY
THAT WAS DOWN THERE.

1791
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,267
DARLING, YOU'D BETTER
LAY OFF THAT LIQUOR.

1792
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:45,700
WELL, THAT'S A FACT.

1793
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,333
WYNANT'S BODY?

1794
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,933
YEP.

1795
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:51,333
SAY, DON'T YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

1796
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,333
EVERYBODY THOUGHT
IT WAS ROSEBREEN.

1797
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,667
THAT'S WHAT
THEY THINK--

1798
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,667
GUILD AND THE REST
OF THEM.

1799
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:58,333
THEY TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED

1800
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,400
IT WAS ANOTHER ONE
OF WYNANT'S VICTIMS.

1801
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,900
GUILD'S OUT
LOOKING FOR WYNANT.

1802
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,400
THAT'S ALL
THAT TROUBLES HIM.

1803
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,900
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT WAS WYNANT'S BODY?

1804
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,900
WELL...
SEVERAL THINGS.

1805
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,900
OH, HELLO. FRED?
WE'RE HUNGRY AGAIN.

1806
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,400
HA HA!

1807
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,400
AND LOTS OF ONIONS.
OH, AND, UH, COFFEE.

1808
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,900
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.
WHAT THINGS?

1809
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,400
HMM?

1810
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
WHAT THINGS
MAKE YOU SO SURE?

1811
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,900
OH! WELL, TAKE THE
CLOTHES, FOR INSTANCE.

1812
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,900
THEY WERE VERY
CAREFULLY PRESERVED,

1813
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,400
AND THE BODY WAS

1814
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
JUST AS CAREFULLY
DESTROYED.

1815
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,900
WHOEVER KILLED HIM WAS
COUNTING ON ONE THING--

1816
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,567
THAT SKELETONS
ALL LOOK ALIKE.

1817
01:14:33,567 --> 01:14:35,233
WELL, THEY DO,
DON'T THEY?

1818
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:36,500
SURE.

1819
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,900
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANOTHER
SWALLOW UNTIL YOU OPEN UP.

1820
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,900
I REMEMBER THAT WYNANT
HAD SHRAPNEL IN HIS SHIN.

1821
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,400
IT USED TO BOTHER HIM.

1822
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,900
I LOOKED FOR IT
AND FOUND IT.

1823
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,300
HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN DEAD?

1824
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,467
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1825
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,400
OH, THEN HE COULDN'T HAVE
COMMITTED THOSE MURDERS.

1826
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,900
SMART GAL.

1827
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,567
WYNANT DEAD.
DOES DOROTHY KNOW?

1828
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:53,900
NO. NOBODY KNOWS
BUT YOU.

1829
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,467
I'M GOING TO
TELL HER.

1830
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:56,900
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

1831
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,400
SHE'S GOING CRAZY.

1832
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,467
SHE'D RATHER KNOW
HE WAS DEAD THAN--

1833
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:02,467
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.
I HAVEN'T TOLD GUILD.

1834
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:03,633
WHY?

1835
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,633
I'M LYING LOW
UNTIL I GET THE DOPE.

1836
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,433
I WON'T GO OFF
HALF-COCKED.

1837
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:08,933
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1838
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,967
I'M GOING TO GET
THE MURDERER,

1839
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:12,467
AND I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

1840
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,467
YOU WANT TO SEE ME
TAKE HIM?

1841
01:15:14,467 --> 01:15:15,800
YES.

1842
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
HAVE YOU GOT
A NICE EVENING GOWN?

1843
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

1844
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,700
HAVE YOU GOT
A NICE EVENING GOWN?

1845
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,900
YES, I'VE GOT
A LULU. WHY?

1846
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,900
I'M GOING TO GIVE A PARTY
AND INVITE ALL THE SUSPECTS.

1847
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,367
SUSPECTS?
THEY WON'T COME.

1848
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:29,900
OH, YES, THEY WILL.

1849
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,900
I'LL GET GUILD TO ISSUE
THE INVITATIONS.

1850
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,400
WHO DO YOU THINK
DID IT?

1851
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,567
MIMI.

1852
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:37,900
MIMI?

1853
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,333
MIMI, JORGENSON,

1854
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,900
MORELLI, TANNER.

1855
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,400
WHAT WERE YOU DOING

1856
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,400
ON THE NIGHT
OF OCTOBER 5, 1902?

1857
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,867
I WAS JUST A GLEAM
IN MY FATHER'S EYE.

1858
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,967
LET'S SEE.
YOU AT THE HEAD.

1859
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:03,967
AND YOU ON MY RIGHT.

1860
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,067
THANK YOU.

1861
01:16:05,067 --> 01:16:06,967
I'LL PUT MacCAULAY HERE.
HE CAN HELP ME.

1862
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:08,967
OUGHT TO BE A LADY
NEXT TO HIM.

1863
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:10,133
I'VE GOT MIMI.

1864
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:12,300
I DON'T THINK
MIMI LIKES HIM.

1865
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,467
THEN IT'S MIMI.

1866
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,967
WHO GOES NEXT TO ME?

1867
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:16,967
LEAVE THAT OPEN.
SEE WHAT YOU DRAW.

1868
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:18,467
PUT DOROTHY THERE.

1869
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:19,967
AND THEN TOMMY?

1870
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:21,967
I'LL KEEP TOMMY ON THIS
SIDE. PUT GILBERT NEXT.

1871
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:23,967
NICE BOY.
WHO'S NEXT TO GILBERT?

1872
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:25,467
THAT BIRD
THAT SHOT ME.

1873
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:27,467
MORELLI? THIS IS
GOING TO BE GOOD.

1874
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:29,467
I'LL PUT MIMI'S
GIGOLO HUSBAND HERE.

1875
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,967
HAVE THEY FOUND HIM?

1876
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:32,467
THEY'VE FOUND HIM.

1877
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:33,967
WHO GOES NEXT TO HIM?

1878
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,467
I'M LEAVING
THAT OPEN.

1879
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,467
I HAVE A FEELING
HE WON'T COME ALONE.

1880
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,467
WHERE WILL YOU
PUT GUILD?

1881
01:16:39,467 --> 01:16:40,833
DOWN AT THE END,

1882
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,467

AN EYE ON THINGS

1883
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:43,967
WHEN THE TROUBLE
STARTS.

1884
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,967

JUGGLER, THERE.

01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:51,133
ARE YOU SURE ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE IS THE KILLER?

1887
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,467
POSITIVE.

1888
01:16:52,467 --> 01:16:53,967
I CAN'T STAND
THE SUSPENSE.

1889
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:55,467
WHICH ONE DID IT?

1890
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,967
I WISH YOU'D TELL ME.

YOU'D TELL ME.

1892

WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL DINNER.

1894
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,433
HOW'S IT GOING, BOYS?

1895
01:17:05,433 --> 01:17:08,433
OH, SWELL.
NOW, HOW'S THIS?

1896
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:09,933
YES, "MISSEUR."

1897
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:11,933
MMM.
TERRIBLE.

1898
01:17:11,933 --> 01:17:13,433
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1899
01:17:13,433 --> 01:17:15,433
YOUR MEN WILL SERVE
THE DINNER.

01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:17,600
THESE BOYS ARE
JUST HERE IN CASE.

1901
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,933
I THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

1902
01:17:19,933 --> 01:17:21,433
[GUILD]
HELLO, MRS. CHARLES.

1903
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:22,133
OH, HELLO, MR. GUILD.

1904
01:17:22,133 --> 01:17:23,233
I SEE
YOU'RE ALL SET.

1905
01:17:23,233 --> 01:17:24,733
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL COME?

1906
01:17:24,733 --> 01:17:26,233
MOST OF THEM
ARE HERE ALREADY.

1907
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:28,233
MY MEN ARE
PICKING UP THE REST.

1908
01:17:28,233 --> 01:17:29,733
BRING THEM IN, BOYS.

1909
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:31,733
YOU'RE A GREAT HELP
TO A HOSTESS.

1910
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:34,333
I WISH I HAD YOU
AT ALL MY DINNER PARTIES.

1911
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,733
LET GO OF MY ARM,
YOU BIG LUG!

1912
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:38,233
I AIN'T
DONE NOTHIN'.

1913
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,733
OH, IT'S YOU, HUH?

1914
01:17:39,733 --> 01:17:42,233
WE ONLY WANTED YOU
TO DINE WITH US.

1915
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:44,733
IF YOU THINK I'LL TALK,
YOU'RE CRAZY.

1916
01:17:44,733 --> 01:17:47,233
JUST 'CAUSE I WAS MIXED
UP WITH A STOOL PIGEON

1917
01:17:47,233 --> 01:17:48,733
DON'T MEAN I'M ONE, TOO.

1918
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,233
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
SHOW THE LADY A CHAIR.

1919
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:52,733
ON YOUR WAY, SISTER.

1920
01:17:52,733 --> 01:17:54,233
DID YOU FIND
DOROTHY?

1921
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:55,733
NO, BUT
SHE'LL BE HERE.

1922
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:57,233
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A DRINK.

1923
01:17:57,233 --> 01:18:00,300
I SHOULD THINK YOU GUYS
ARE TIRED OF PICKING ME UP.

1924
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,800
STEP THIS WAY, KID.

1925
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,133
WHAT'S UP?

1926
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:04,300
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!

1927
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. JORGENSON?

1928
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,800
HOW DARE YOU SEND
A DETECTIVE AFTER US?!

1929
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,800
WE WANTED TO BE SURE
YOU'D GET HERE.

1930
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,300
I TOLD HIM
WE COULDN'T COME.

1931
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,800
WE'RE GOING
TO THE THEATER.

1932
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,800
NICKY'S PUTTING ON
A LITTLE SHOW OF HIS OWN.

1933
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,800
YOU MUST STAY.
PLEASE COME HAVE A COCKTAIL.

1934
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:22,500
WHAT'S THE GAG?

1935
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,300
YOU KNOW
AS MUCH AS I DO.

1936
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,800
HAVE A COCKTAIL.

1937
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,300
NO, THANKS.

1938
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,800
I SAID
HAVE A COCKTAIL!

1939
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
HE WANTS US
TO HAVE A COCKTAIL.

1940
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,800
HI, MacCAULAY.

1941
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,800
TAKE OFF
YOUR HAT AND COAT

1942
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,300
AND JOIN
OUR FESTIVITIES.

1943
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,800
OH, TANNER.
WHAT'S THIS?

1944
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,133
THEY HAD ME IN JAIL
LAST NIGHT.

1945
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,800
DON'T THINK
A THING OF IT.

1946
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
TANNER,
TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS.

1947
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,300
WHAT IS IT,
MR. CHARLES?

1948
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,300
[WHISPERING] I've got
something, I think.

1949
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,533
COME IN, TANNER.

1950
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:50,967
WHERE'S DOROTHY?

1951
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:52,467
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS WITH YOU.

1952
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:54,300
SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
THIS AFTERNOON.

1953
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,767
HERE SHE IS NOW.

1954
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:58,300
WE PICKED THEM UP AT
THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION.

1955
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,800
COME ON IN.

1956
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,367
HELLO, NICK.

1957
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:02,867
A PARTY, HUH?

1958
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:03,867
YES.

1959
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:05,367
CELEBRATING FATHER'S
THIRD MURDER?

1960
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,367
THEY WERE TRYING TO
MAKE A GETAWAY.

1961
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,367
WE WERE DOING
NOTHING OF THE SORT.

1962
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:11,367
YOU CAN'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

1963
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:12,867
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

1964
01:19:12,867 --> 01:19:15,467
TAKE THIS...GENTLEMAN'S
HAT AND COAT.

1965
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:17,067
MUSIC. MUCH MUSIC.

1966
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:18,367
NICK INTERRUPTED ME

1967
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:20,367
AT A VERY IMPORTANT
TIME OF MY LIFE.

1968
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:23,133
I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
MY FIRST FALSE STEP.

1969
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,133
I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

1970
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:26,633
NO. YOU STAY HERE.

1971
01:19:26,633 --> 01:19:29,867
IF I STAY, I KNOW I'M GOING
TO TAKE A POKE AT HIM.

1972
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:31,467
THEN I INSIST
THAT YOU STAY.

1973
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,400
HERE'S JORGENSON.

1974
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,200
WHY, CHRIS!

1975
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,367
HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M NICK CHARLES.

1976
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:39,867
CHRIS, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

1977
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:41,267
NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

1978
01:19:41,267 --> 01:19:43,367
I SWEAR
IT ISN'T MY FAULT.

1979
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,867
I TRIED TO KEEP YOU
OUT OF THIS.

1980
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:47,867
TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF HIM.

1981
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,367
DO YOU HEAR ME?

1982
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,433
CHRIS, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN?

1983
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:52,433
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

1984
01:19:52,433 --> 01:19:54,933
WE HAD TO BREAK DOWN
THE DOOR.

1985
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:57,600
CHRIS,
HOW COULD YOU? OH!

1986
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,033
DO COME IN AND MAKE
YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

1987
01:20:00,033 --> 01:20:02,100
TAKE THE GENTLEMAN'S
HAT AND COAT.

1988
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,533
COME, FRIENDS,
AND GET IT.

1989
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:06,367
TOMMY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE END MAN?

1990
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,867
MR. JORGENSON,
NEXT TO TOMMY.

1991
01:20:07,867 --> 01:20:10,367
[NORA] DOROTHY, YOU
AND MR. QUINN ARE HERE.

1992
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:12,367
MacCAULAY,
HERE, IF YOU WILL.

1993
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:14,367
TANNER, DOWN THERE.

1994
01:20:14,367 --> 01:20:18,367
OH, MRS. JORGENSON,
NEXT TO MR. JORGENSON.

1995
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:19,867
I'M MRS. JORGENSON!

1996
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:21,867
PUT IT OVER THERE,
SISTER.

1997
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:24,500
I WAS MRS. JORGENSON
BEFORE YOU WERE.

1998
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,367
OH, MIMI,
UH...YOU'RE HERE.

1999
01:20:27,367 --> 01:20:28,867
OH, WAITER,

2000
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:31,867
WILL YOU REMOVE
THE ILLUMINATION, PLEASE?

2001
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:33,733
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BE SEATED.

2002
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:39,100
NOW, MY FRIENDS, IF I MAY
PROPOSE A LITTLE TOAST.

2003
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,200
LET US EAT, DRINK,
AND BE MERRY,

2004
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,367
FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.

2005
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:48,200
YOU GIVE SUCH CHARMING PARTIES,
MR. CHARLES.

2006
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,767
THANK YOU,
MRS. CHARLES.

2007
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:51,467
PERHAPS YOU'LL
TELL US NOW

2008
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:52,767
WHY WE'RE HERE.

2009
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:55,867
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME VERY IMPORTANT NEWS.

2010
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:57,100
WHAT IS IT?

2011
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,333
JUST THIS.

2012
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,600
CLYDE WYNANT DID NOT KILL
JULIA, NUNHEIM, OR ANYONE.

2013
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,100
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S IN THE PAPERS.

2014
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,600
HE DIDN'T
KILL THEM?

2015
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,100
WHAT DID I
TELL YOU?

2016
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,600
I'D LIKE TO
BELIEVE THAT.

2017
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,100
I KNEW THEY'D
PULL SOMETHING.

2018
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,433
IF YOU GOT MONEY,

2019
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,600
YOU CAN GET BY
WITH ANYTHING.

2020
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,167
QUIET!
LET HIM HAVE HIS SAY.

2021
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,100
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT, NICK?

2022
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,600
[NICK]
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT.

2023
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,900
WHERE?

2024
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,900
THAT'S NOTHING.
I SAW HIM MYSELF.

2025
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,400
I TOLD YOU.

2026
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,900
IT'S A FRAME-UP.

2027
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,400
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM?

2028
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,533
LAST NIGHT,
IN MY APARTMENT.

2029
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:31,167
IS THAT SO?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

2030
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,667
HE WANTED TO KNOW
HOW I WAS

2031
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:35,833
AND HOW
THE CHILDREN WERE.

2032
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,267
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?

2033
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,600
UH, BROWN SUIT,
BROWN SHOES,

2034
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,067
A WHITE SHIRT,

2035
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:44,100
A GRAYISH TIE
WITH REDDISH-BROWN

2036
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,133
OR BROWNISH-RED DOTS
IN IT.

2037
01:21:46,133 --> 01:21:47,633
TELL THE MEN.

2038
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:49,900
I SAW HIM, TOO,
WEARING A GREEN SUIT.

2039
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,600
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

2040
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,100
I KNOW, BUT I SAW HIM.

2041
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,100
[GUILD]
WHERE?

2042
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,800
I WAS GAZING
IN MY CRYSTAL.

2043
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,100
OHH!

2044
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:03,333
WAITER, WILL YOU
SERVE THE NUTS?

2045
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:06,500
I MEAN, WILL YOU SERVE
THE GUESTS THE NUTS?

2046
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,267
MIMI, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE LYING.

2047
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:11,600
I REALLY DID SEE
WYNANT LAST NIGHT.

2048
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,100
ARE YOU KIDDING?

2049
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,600
WHAT'S THE IDEA
OF HOLDING OUT ON ME?

2050
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,067
YOU SAW HIM
YOURSELF.

2051
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:18,500
THAT WAS
HIS BODY

2052
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,967
BURIED
IN THE SHOP.

2053
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:21,333
NICK!

2054
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,333
DOROTHY, IT'S TERRIBLE
TO TELL YOU THIS WAY,

2055
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:26,167
BUT YOUR FATHER
IS DEAD.

2056
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:27,900
HE'S BEEN DEAD
THREE MONTHS.

2057
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,167
I'M TERRIBLY--

2058
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:31,667
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ON YOUR COAT.

2059
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,667
OH, DARLING,
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

2060
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,167
IT'S TERRIBLE,
I KNOW,

2061
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,333
BUT ISN'T IT
BETTER THAT WAY?

2062
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,167
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF HER.

2063
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:42,667
UH, TOMMY...

2064
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,633
TOMMY,
YOU SIT HERE.

2065
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:46,667
WAITER, WILL YOU
KINDLY REMOVE THAT?

2066
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,167
WHAT? NO ONE EATING?

2067
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,167
AH! MIMI, I SEE IT HASN'T
AFFECTED YOUR APPETITE.

2068
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:53,167
BECAUSE I DON'T
BELIEVE A WORD OF IT.

2069
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:54,667
WHAT'S YOUR PROOF?

2070
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:57,167
A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL
IN HIS SHIN.

2071
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:59,667
IF HE DIDN'T DO IT,
WHO DID?

2072
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:02,233
THE MURDERER IS
RIGHT IN THIS ROOM,

2073
01:23:02,233 --> 01:23:03,733
SITTING AT THIS TABLE.

2074
01:23:03,733 --> 01:23:05,167
YOU MAY SERVE THE FISH.

2075
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,967
EAT SOMETHING,
YOU FOOL.

2076
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:08,767
WON'T YOU TELL US WHO?

2077
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,233
I DON'T KNOW.

2078
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:12,967
I THOUGHT IF WE HAD
A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER,

2079
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:14,533
WE MIGHT FIND OUT.

2080
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:16,233
NICE FOOD, ISN'T IT?

2081
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:20,133
YES. IT'S THE BEST DINNER
I EVER LISTENED TO.

2082
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,433
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?

2083
01:23:26,733 --> 01:23:28,067
MORELLI.

2084
01:23:28,067 --> 01:23:29,900
YOU CAN'T
PIN THIS ON ME!

2085
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,900
WHAT AM I,
THE FALL GUY?

2086
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,233
SIT DOWN!

2087
01:23:33,233 --> 01:23:35,067
[NICK] I ONLY WANT
TO ASK A QUESTION.

2088
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:37,067
MORELLI,
YOU KNEW JULIA.

2089
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:38,233
YEAH.

2090
01:23:38,233 --> 01:23:39,867
WAS SHE GYPPING WYNANT?

2091
01:23:39,867 --> 01:23:42,233
SHE DON'T SAY.
I FIGURE SHE IS.

2092
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:43,733
[NICK]
WHY'S THAT?

2093
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:45,733
I WANTED 5 GRAND.
SHE GAVE ME CASH.

2094
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:47,733
THANKS.
THREE MONTHS AGO--

2095
01:23:47,733 --> 01:23:50,233
THE NIGHT THAT
WYNANT CAUGHT YOU

2096
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,500
IN JULIA'S APARTMENT,
MORELLI--

2097
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,633
HE DISCOVERED JULIA
WAS CHEATING ON HIM

2098
01:23:54,633 --> 01:23:56,733
AND SPLITTING IT
WITH SOME MAN.

2099
01:23:56,733 --> 01:23:58,533
THAT MAN WAS...TANNER.

2100
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,267
[DROPS UTENSIL]

2101
01:24:00,267 --> 01:24:02,300
OH, I'M SO SORRY,
TANNER.

2102
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,800
DON'T YOU WANT
SOME WINE?

2103
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,367
NO. REALLY,
MR. CHARLES,

2104
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:08,133
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

2105
01:24:08,133 --> 01:24:09,467
[MAN]
TANNER, SIT DOWN.

2106
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:11,067
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
TANNER.

2107
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:13,800
YOU'RE DRIVING
ME CRAZY.

2108
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,867
OH, NOW, LET ME SEE.
WHERE WAS I?

2109
01:24:16,867 --> 01:24:18,133
OH, YES.

2110
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:20,133
WYNANT WENT
TO FIND THE MAN

2111
01:24:20,133 --> 01:24:22,133
HE ACCUSED
OF HAVING CHEATED HIM.

2112
01:24:22,133 --> 01:24:25,133
THAT MAN, KNOWING HE WAS
CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS

2113
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:28,133
AND WITH PRISON
STARING HIM IN THE FACE,

2114
01:24:28,133 --> 01:24:29,633
TOOK THE ONLY WAY OUT.

2115
01:24:29,633 --> 01:24:31,133
HE KILLED WYNANT.

2116
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,733
NOW, MR. JORGENSON--

2117
01:24:32,733 --> 01:24:34,133
YES?

2118
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:36,700
YOU'RE NOT EATING.
DON'T YOU CARE FOR OYSTERS?

2119
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,800
I WAS LISTENING

2120
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,267
TO WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING.

2121
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:40,633
GOOD.

2122
01:24:42,133 --> 01:24:44,633
THIS MURDERER
IS VERY CLEVER.

2123
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:47,633
HE STUDIED THIS WHOLE THING OUT
VERY CAREFULLY.

2124
01:24:47,633 --> 01:24:50,733
YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU, GILBERT?

2125
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:51,933
YES.

2126
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:53,200
NO!

2127
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,300
HE PLANNED THE WHOLE THING
BEAUTIFULLY.

2128
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,633
AFTER HE KILLED WYNANT,

2129
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,700
HE WIRED MacCAULAY
USING WYNANT'S NAME

2130
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,200
AND TOLD HIM
TO CLOSE THE SHOP.

2131
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,567
WHICH I DID.

2132
01:25:02,567 --> 01:25:04,200
NATURALLY.

2133
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,867
THEN HE DESTROYED
ALL OF WYNANT'S CLOTHES

2134
01:25:06,867 --> 01:25:09,067
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF HIS WATCH CHAIN.

2135
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:11,433
HE FIGURED THAT SOMEDAY
THAT MIGHT COME IN HANDY.

2136
01:25:11,433 --> 01:25:13,200
THEN HE TOOK WYNANT'S BODY

2137
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,200
AND BURIED IT
WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CLOTHES--

2138
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,900
A FAT MAN'S CLOTHES
TO THROW US OFF THE TRACK.

2139
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,933
HE PUT IN A BELT BUCKLE
WITH AN "R" ON IT,

2140
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:23,933
HOPING WE WOULD THINK
IT WAS ROSEBREEN--

2141
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:26,700
AN OLD ENEMY OF WYNANT'S
WHO DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO.

2142
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,200
OH, MORELLI,

2143
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,200
WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING
YOUR KNIFE SOME OTHER WAY?

2144
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,700
YOU'RE WORRYING GILBERT.

2145
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,467
IF THAT KNIFE'S MISSING,

2146
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,700
I'LL LOOK FOR IT
IN YOUR BACK.

2147
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,700
AFTER OUR HERO
HAD KILLED WYNANT,

2148
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,167
HE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.

2149
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:46,700
HE REALIZED HE AND JULIA
COULD STILL COLLECT MONEY.

2150
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,200
WYNANT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT OF TOWN.

2151
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,700
NO ONE KNEW WHERE.

2152
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,700
OUR HERO WROTE LETTERS
TO MacCAULAY,

2153
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,200
SIGNING WYNANT'S NAME,

2154
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,600
SO MacCAULAY WOULD CONTINUE
TO SEND MONEY TO JULIA.

2155
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,100
HE EVEN TELEPHONED
MacCAULAY.

2156
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,767
THAT FIRST DAY
YOU CAME TO SEE ME,

2157
01:26:00,767 --> 01:26:02,767
HE TELEPHONED
HE WAS IN TOWN.

2158
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:04,767
HE CALLED
WHILE I WAS OUT.

2159
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:06,267
WASN'T HE SLICK ABOUT THAT?

2160
01:26:06,267 --> 01:26:08,767
THAT SAME AFTERNOON,
JULIA TELEPHONED HIM.

2161
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:10,800
SHE SAID THAT
YOU WERE COMING, MIMI.

2162
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,067
I WANTED TO ASK
ABOUT MR. WYNANT.

2163
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,767
EXACTLY. WELL, OUR HERO
GOT TERRIFIED.

2164
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:19,267
HE WAS AFRAID THAT JULIA
WOULD BREAK DOWN AND TELL YOU

2165
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:20,767
HE HAD MURDERED WYNANT.

2166
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:23,767
SO HE WENT TO JULIA,
AND HE KILLED HER.

2167
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:26,700
HE LEFT WYNANT'S WATCH CHAIN
IN HER HAND.

2168
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,267
[NORA]
Is this true?

2169
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:29,600
I don't know.

2170
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,933
Why are you
saying it?

2171
01:26:30,933 --> 01:26:32,933
It's the only way
it makes sense.

2172
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:34,433
I hope
you're well.

2173
01:26:34,433 --> 01:26:36,433
HIS PLAN WAS WORKING
BEAUTIFULLY.

2174
01:26:36,433 --> 01:26:39,433
EVERYBODY BELIEVED
THAT WYNANT WAS IN TOWN

2175
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:41,933
AND THAT HE HAD DONE IT.

2176
01:26:41,933 --> 01:26:43,933
THERE WAS JUST ONE HITCH--

2177
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:46,833
A BIRD NAMED NUNHEIM...
YOUR FRIEND.

2178
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:49,700
NUNHEIM HAD GONE
TO CALL ON HER.

2179
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,200
HE HEARD THE SHOTS.

2180
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,767
HE SAW
THE MURDERER LEAVE.

2181
01:26:52,767 --> 01:26:54,233
HE KNEW WHO DID IT.

2182
01:26:54,233 --> 01:26:56,767
IF HE KNEW,
HE DIDN'T TELL ME!

2183
01:26:56,767 --> 01:26:59,133
YOU CAN'T DRAG ME
INTO THIS!

2184
01:26:59,133 --> 01:27:02,333
OUR HERO HAD PAID NUNHEIM ONCE
TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

2185
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,833
WHEN NUNHEIM
THREATENED HIM AGAIN,

2186
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:05,333
HE BUMPED HIM OFF.

2187
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,833
OH, HE WAS VERY CLEVER.

2188
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,967
EVERYBODY, EVEN
OUR ASTUTE FRIEND GUILD,

2189
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:10,833
THOUGHT WYNANT WAS ALIVE
AND WAS THE MURDERER.

2190
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,333
YOU CAN SKIP THAT.

2191
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:16,167
BUT OUR HERO HAD JUST ONE
WEAK LINK IN HIS CHAIN.

2192
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:19,333
THE TELEGRAMS AND PHONE CALLS
WERE ALL VERY WELL,

2193
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:21,667
BUT NO ONE HAD ACTUALLY
SEEN WYNANT,

2194
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:25,167
SO OUR HERO PICKED ON POOR MIMI
TO STRENGTHEN HIS CASE.

2195
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:27,833
MIMI IS THE ONLY ONE
AT THIS TABLE

2196
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:31,167
WHO CAN TELL US WHO
THE REAL MURDERER IS.

2197
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,333
MIMI, WHO TOLD YOU TO SAY
YOU SAW WYNANT?

2198
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,333
NOBODY TOLD ME.
I DID SEE HIM.

2199
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,567
[GILBERT]
LET MY MOTHER ALONE!

2200
01:27:37,567 --> 01:27:39,100
WHAT WERE YOU PAID?

2201
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,167
IT'S TRUE.

2202
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:42,400
I DID SEE HIM.
HE ISN'T DEAD!

2203
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,567
YOU'RE LYING.
YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY.

2204
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:47,567
YOU WERE GETTING A GOOD PRICE
FOR SAYING YOU SAW WYNANT.

2205
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:50,067
YOU FIGURED YOU WON'T
GET ANYTHING IF HE'S DEAD.

2206
01:27:50,067 --> 01:27:52,067
I'M NOT STAYING HERE
TO BE INSULTED!

2207
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,067
MacCAULAY, YOU DREW UP
WYNANT'S WILL.

2208
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:56,067
WASN'T MIMI CUT OFF
IF SHE REMARRIED?

2209
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:58,100
I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ANSWER THAT.

2210
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,733
TANNER, ISN'T THAT TRUE?

2211
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,300
[TANNER]
YES.

2212
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,467
THAT SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM
TELLING THE TRUTH, MIMI.

2213
01:28:03,467 --> 01:28:05,967
MRS. JORGENSON, WERE YOU
EVER DIVORCED FROM CHRIS?

2214
01:28:05,967 --> 01:28:07,200
NO.

2215
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,233
YOU SEE, MIMI,

2216
01:28:08,233 --> 01:28:10,733
UNDER THE LAW,
YOU'VE NEVER REMARRIED.

2217
01:28:10,733 --> 01:28:12,633
YOU'RE STILL
ONE OF THE HEIRS.

2218
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:15,133
ARE YOU HOLDING OUT
FOR A FEW DOLLARS

2219
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:17,633
WHEN YOU CAN GET
THE WHOLE ESTATE?

2220
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:21,167
REMEMBER THE OTHER TWO MIXED IN
WITH HIM--JULIA AND NUNHEIM.

2221
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:24,067
WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT TALK,
HE BUMPED THEM OFF.

2222
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:26,700
HE WON'T TAKE
ANY CHANCES ON YOU.

2223
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,300
DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT?

2224
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,500
YOU DIRTY
LITTLE--

2225
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
[GUNSHOT]

2226
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,633
WELL, THERE'S YOUR MURDERER--
MacCAULAY.

2227
01:28:32,633 --> 01:28:34,133
[GUILD]
MacCAULAY?

2228
01:28:34,133 --> 01:28:37,133
SURE. WANT ME TO WRAP HIM
IN CELLOPHANE?

2229
01:28:37,133 --> 01:28:38,567
COME ON.
GET IN THERE!

2230
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:40,867
MacCAULAY!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

2231
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:42,900
WELL, I'LL BE
A MONKEY'S UNCLE!

2232
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,967
NICKY, HE MIGHT HAVE
KILLED YOU!

2233
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:46,300
YOU SORRY HE DIDN'T?

2234
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,300
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
NOT A DETECTIVE.

2235
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:54,800
NOT A HIP
IN A CARLOAD.

2236
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,800
WELL,
HERE'S TO YOU TWO!

2237
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
AND TO YOU TWO,
TOO!

2238
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,700
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

2239
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,200
WHY, THE RAT!
HE CAN'T TOP US.

2240
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,200
