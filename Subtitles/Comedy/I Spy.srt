00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,049
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

173
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:11,799
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

174
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,880
Is this my stuff?
Oh, easy.

175
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,485
This is Carlos' stuff. This is yours.

176
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,119
Where's my monofilament
phone descender?

177
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,359
I didn't get one of these exploding
pagers. I don't see one of those.

178
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,317
You got the micro GPS.

179
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,922
Micro?

180
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,644
This is your spy-cam.

181
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,522
This is Carlos' spy-cam,
and this is my spy-cam?

182
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,327
Look at the size of this thing!

183
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,923
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it's reversed.

184
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,764
You want people to say, " Look how
small and sexy and sleek this is."

185
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,683
Not, " How huge this is! Look what he
pulled out of his pants. It's huge!"

186
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:58,922
People will laugh at me if I pull this
out. Is that his escape module?

187
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,286
Yes, it is. I know, everybody wants
to be like Carlos.

188
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,838
I don't want to be like Carlos,
but I can't help noticing

189
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,763
that my stuff looks like you can get it
from RadioShack in 1972.

190
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,562
Uh-huh.

191
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:12,918
Yes, it is.

192
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,646
Right away.

193
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,926
All right, we'll finish this later.
It's a good start, though.

194
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,008
ANNOUNCER: Kelly Robinson, seen here
making his typical flamboyant entrance...

195
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,763
Shouldn't this be on the
Weather Channel or something?

196
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,807
- with a first-round knock out
of Blak e "The Blade" Lirette.

197
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:38,838
ROBINSON: Yeah! 57 and 0, baby!
Kelly Robinson, baby!

198
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,045
That guy is so annoying.

199
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,006
Everybody "Hungary"
for his showdown

200
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,729
with the European
heavyweight king, Cedric Mills.

201
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,039
I don't think you understand
how important it is to Kelly Robinson

202
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,928
that he be 58 and 0.
I'm 57 and 0 right now.

203
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,238
This man gonna be 58!

204
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,639
That guy is a born jerk.
Cheese. Cheese.

205
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,084
That's right, tak e my picture.
Cheese. Cheese.

206
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,444
Get my right side. Cheese.

207
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,360
Alex!

208
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,838
Gen. Tucker, this is
Special Agent Alex Scott.

209
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,601
General.
Special agent.

210
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,841
I still love hearing that. I was just
a regular agent till a couple weeks ago,

211
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,206
and then around Christmas,
I got promoted to special.

212
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:14,888
Special.

213
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,922
We were going over the op.

214
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,762
We call it the "Switchblade."

215
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,808
They designed the thing as the first
electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft.

216
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,766
But in the hands of the evildoers,

217
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,399
it's an untraceable delivery system
for weapons of mass destruction.

218
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,048
New owner: Arnold Gundars.

219
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,565
The boys over at CIA have access
to his overseas accounts.

220
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:36,607
The past five days, there's been
a significant depletion of funds

221
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,043
without any reimbursements.

222
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,280
In other words, the bastard's bought
the damn plane.

223
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,723
He just hasn't sold it yet.

224
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,398
I'll get it back, general.

225
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,006
Give me a minute.

226
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:50,838
Hot.

227
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,441
GENERAL:
Are you sure we can't use Carlos?

228
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,803
No, they all know him.

229
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,564
Without plastic surgery, he wouldn't
last five minutes on this case.

230
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,208
That's a shame.

231
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,961
That Carlos is amazing.

232
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,760
This guy...

233
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,720
You sure about this, Mac?

234
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,119
He'll get the job done.

235
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,437
Shouldn't Rachel be here?

236
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,361
She's already in Budapest,
setting up the op site.

237
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,599
You've worked with her
before, right?

238
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,680
I have, but not
in a stakeout situation.

239
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,085
This mission doesn't call
for a stakeout.

240
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,365
It wouldn't kill us to keep
our options open, I guess.

241
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,845
The European middleweight
championship

242
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,000
is being held in Budapest
in two days.

243
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,605
Gundars is a boxing fanatic. He's
throwing a party the night before.

244
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,237
Okay. Classic stakeout
scenario, right?

245
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,765
No, Alex. No stakeout. This is
more about hacking and tracking.

246
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:45,001
Now, take a look at this guest list.

247
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:50,323
You got to be kidding. This is like a
who's who of international bad guys.

248
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,799
Obviously, Gundars is using this
party as cover to auction the plane.

249
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,925
Your mission is to get
into Gundars' palace,

250
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,081
find out where the plane is
and stop him from selling it.

251
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,480
You put all these heavy hitters in one
place and security's gonna be insane.

252
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,847
Exactly. The way we see it, there's only
one shot we've got of getting you in there.

253
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:09,922
Stakeout?

254
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,523
No.

255
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,645
We've arranged cover.

256
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,083
You'll be working with a civilian
to secure entry.

257
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,238
A civilian?

258
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,640
57 and 0. Getting ready to be 58 and 0.
You know how Kelly Robinson do.

259
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,482
Listen to me now. I don't
care what Gen. Patton says.

260
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,879
We don't need to do it this way.
I think if...

261
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,687
I kick ed ass all around the world,
you know me.

262
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,000
For crying out loud. Can we turn this off
or change the channel or something?

263
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,488
This guy gives me a headache...

264
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,209
You better watch what come out your
mouth next, little blond-haired surfer boy.

265
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,883
He never shuts up. Now he's
lighting into some poor reporter.

266
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,847
No, I'm talking to you. Better watch
what's coming out your mouth.

267
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,524
You digging your grave with your
tongue. You gonna get your ass whipped.

269
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,120
Alex Scott, meet Kelly Robinson.

270
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,557
Hoo, boy!

272
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,688
That's gotta be him.

273
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:21,079
Yeah, girl, you crazy. Come on out
here and give me some sugar, girl.

274
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,922
I had too much fun last night.
And you too.

275
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,325
Let's bounce. I got y'all's numbers.
I'll call y'all soon.

276
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,480
I'll talk to you all soon.
Bye-bye.

277
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,640
No Kelly, no stretchie.
Back of the bus.

278
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,926
Move everything to the back. Move the
camouflage booty to the back of the bus.

279
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,888
Hey, I'm Alex Scott.
We met yesterday, sort of.

280
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,688
Yeah, I remember.
The pleasure's all mine.

281
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,528
Yeah...

282
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:49,917
Is that your plane?

283
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,442
Hey, step away from the man.
No autographs!

284
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,606
It's all right, Jerry.
This guy's my new assistant.

285
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,725
Whoa, Kelly, I thought
I was your assistant.

286
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,847
Hey, T.J., what'd I tell you? The secret
mission, right? Secret mission.

287
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,000
Secret mission.

288
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,400
Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
Right. Right.

289
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,645
It's not a good idea to tell them who I am.
I think we should try to keep that down.

290
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,039
Hey, man, relax, I ain't no fool.
I ain't tell them who you was.

291
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,882
I told them the mission was, I had to take
care of the president's retarded nephew.

292
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,847
Wait a second, what?
Yeah, they think you're a retard, man.

293
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,044
Wha...?

294
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,121
All you gotta do is get you some drool, a
plastic helmet and zip your jacket up tight.

295
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,280
You get that mentally challenged look.
You'll pull it off.

296
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,917
Hold on just a second. That's good.

297
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,958
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

298
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,599
Excuse us. Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.

299
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,566
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

300
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,799
You're thinking you're going to be
the Harlem Globetrotters

301
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,039
and I'm gonna be the team
that stands there and looks like an idiot.

302
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,848
Yeah, that's it.
But that's not how it's gonna work.

303
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,284
We're going to be on the same team.
In fact, I'm Meadowlark Lemon.

304
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,521
You're Curly Neal. You feed
me the ball. Remember Curly, he...

305
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,327
Yeah, he did all the dribbling.
And you Meadowlark?

306
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:59,481
Exactly. I'm pulling down the ref's shorts,
throwing pie in the face.

307
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,719
You got the bucket of confetti.
They think it's water.

308
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,642
And the rubber band on the ball.
Right, doing the...

309
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,403
I like all that. Tell you what, Meadowlark,
you get me some of this chicken,

310
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,959
some of these sodas and get these bags
and get your ass on the plane.

311
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,245
Meadowlark. You heard
what he just said to me?

312
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,404
He told me that in this situation, he
would be Meadowlark and I'm Curly.

313
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,721
What kind of bullshit is that?
Curly, my ass. I'm Meadowlark...

314
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,799
I'm not Kelly Robinson.
No, you ain't no Kelly Robinson.

315
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,448
Kelly Robinson don't make
his own phone calls.

316
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,002

don't even call his mama!

to confirm the man's reservation.

That's all.

319
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,167

Yeah, yeah. Hustle. Hustle on.

334
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:19,362
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.

335
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,606
[###]

336
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,285
Kelly just took the stick.

337
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:27,888
I thought he was doing a phone interview.

338
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,607
What interview? The man was napping.

339
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:32,920
What? Now he's flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!

340
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,884
Excuse me, sir, but there's a lot of stuff
for us to go over...

341
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,279
Didn't you see me turn on
the "fasten seat belt" light?

342
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,360
No, I didn't see that.

343
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,160
Sit your ass down!
When you get up, sit down.

344
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,962
Funny.

345
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,608
He's a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.

346
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,444
When you did the stick up, I went
flying there! That's a good little trick.

347
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,839
I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

348
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,125
So back to business.
I'm gonna need you at the party at 8.

349
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,883
You know something, spy guy? We got to
change the schedule around a little bit.

350
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,325
Kelly Robinson don't be going to
no parties at 8:00. I ain't about to start.

351
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,957
Are you gonna be referring to yourself
in the third person the whole time?

352
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,642
'Cause that can get a little irritating.

353
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,800
Well, it's not gonna get
irritating until 11:00,

354
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,405
'cause that's when I'm
showing up for your little party.

355
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,323
Okay. Excuse me, gents.

356
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,802
I can't risk that. The party could
be clearing out by 11.

357
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,961
Look, ain't no party that Kelly Robinson
gonna be at gonna end at 11:00.

358
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,643
You know, that's the type of attitude
that can destroy a mission.

359
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,083
You know what can destroy a mission?

360
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:42,764
A lame-ass party that end at 11:00.
Let the shit go, man. I ain't going till 11.

361
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay, drop the shit.
Okay.

362
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,882
I'll get T.J. or Jerry to get me in.
Yeah, go get T.J. He'll help you.

363
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,280
I just hope that the optical
diaphanous polyalloy transducers

364
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,440
can fit on one of their retinas.

365
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,600
What you say?
What you got over there?

366
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,806
This right here. It's one of the little things
we got for the mission. It's pretty cool.

367
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,529
It opens up here. I put this in my eye,
this little camera,

368
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,726
and then I give this to T.J.
Then he's able to see everything I see.

369
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,322
Wait a second here.

370
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:11,004
I don't know if I want T.J.'s eye juices
all over something that goes in my eye.

371
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,080
Maybe I should try that.
What you call it, poly what?

372
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:16,480
Polyalloy transducers.
The polyalloy should be for me.

373
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,480
Let me put it in my eye, then.

374
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,084
I put this in my eye?
Put it in your eye.

375
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,648
This is some spy shit?
Yeah.

376
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,925
Okay, I'll put this in.

377
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,647
And I got
the camera in my eye.

378
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,488
What's gonna happen now?

379
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,321
Can you see anything?
No.

380
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,079
What about now?

381
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,480
Hey, I see me!
Look, watch this.

382
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,721
That's bad. Shit, now I see the TV.
I'm seeing what you seeing.

383
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,722
Exactly.
I see me looking at you looking at me!

384
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey, Kelly Robinson.

385
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,803
Look at this. Put this behind
your ear. It's a listening device.

386
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,199
Just stick it back here?
Can you hear me?

387
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,441
Yeah, it sound like you
in my head. Shit, I like this!

388
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,201
That's the type of thing
we're gonna be doing on the mission.

389
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,280
At 11:00, though.
No, not 11:00.

390
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,759
11:00. I already spoke. Kelly Robinson
has spoke. I said 11, it's 11.

391
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,840
It's a dead issue. Let it go.

392
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,284
Look at me. I said 11, goddamn it!
Get out my face!

393
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,644
That shit is bad.
Then give them back.

394
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,561
I ain't giving back shit. Take them.

395
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,448
That look funny, look like
I'm yelling at me. Take them back, punk!

396
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,158
I'm Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I'll kick your ass, baby!

397
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,685
That's what it look like when I'm whupping
somebody's ass? That's scary as hell.

398
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,409
That's scary. Kelly.
Oh, yeah, that's scary.

399
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,402
Look at that move.
Kelly Robinson.

400
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,404
Why you staring at me?
Do something with your time.

401
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,129
Okay, Kelly.
I heard that in my head.

402
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,645
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That's a trip.

403
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,279
What's our altitude?
About 37,000 feet.

404
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:42,168
What's that? Is that a little Cessna
out there on the horizon?

405
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,608
Where?

406
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,402
Hey! Surfer boy!

407
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,526
You seeing this, Kelly?
What are you doing?

408
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,283
Come fly the plane.
Wake him back up!

409
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:57,282
He fell asleep.
You put that dart in his back!

410
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:58,888
ALEX:
I thought you knew how to fly it.

411
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,562
Wake him up.
You better fly it.

412
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:04,768
I don't know how to fly no plane!
He put it on automatic, I hold the stick.

413
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,444
The deal is, we go at 8,
and I wake the pilot up.

414
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,203
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.

415
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,361
You know that ride I just took?
Get ready for a great ride.

416
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,089
I'm ready to die, baby.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

417
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:20,480
Death? Ha, ha! That's how I feel
about death. Go on. Crash it.

418
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,960
This is getting crazy.
Wake the man up.

419
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,166
Do we have a deal?
Yes. Just wake the man up!

420
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,724
Hey, Ken. He ain't woke.
He'll wake up. He'll be fine.

421
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,120
So you a pilot this whole time?
I can fly a little.

422
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,041
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.

423
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:45,838
I ain't coming to no party at 8:00.
I told you 11:00. Here's your eye shit.

424
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,045
Hey, be careful with that.
Hey, my ass.

425
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:52,885
If you broke something in my plane,
if something in my plane is broke...

426
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:00,321
[###]

427
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,639
You in trouble, T.J.

428
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,482
Oh, God.

429
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,843
It wasn't my fault, man.
It was Mission Man.

430
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:22,240
I'm going downstairs! No, we in
the basement. I'm going upstairs.

431
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,368
Y'all got five minutes to get my ass into
the most expensive suite in this hotel,

432
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,407
or else, T.J.! Or else!
Or else what?

433
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,357
I... I... I don't know what else, because
I don't think good underground.

434
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,999
But whatever it is, it's gonna be bad!
Let me tell you something. You falling off.

435
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:40,605
Your ass is gonna be back in St. Louis,
frying fish in your father's fish store.

436
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,602
Now, you mess up one
more time again. I'm waiting.

437
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,761
Please do it one more. Just please.
One more time.

438
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,046
One more time. Please let him do it
one more time.

439
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:51,962
Oh, my God.

440
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,929
Hey! How's the room?

441
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,402
My room is fine. Oh, did I say
11? I meant to say 12. Maybe.

442
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,719
What's with the attitude?
Excuse me!

443
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,845
Kelly Robinson? The famous boxer?

444
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,277
Yeah, one and the same, baby.

445
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:11,806
I can't believe it!
It's a big thrill for you, huh?

446
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:16,360
You don't know. I know you from
your advertisement for your perfume.

447
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,168
Kelly Robinson. TKO.
TKO. That's right.

448
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,240
It's not perfume. It's cologne.

449
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,400
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I put out cologne.

450
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:25,724
I so stupid.

451
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,245
So, Kelly, tell me...

452
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,687
Do you really wear it?

453
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,684
Well, you tell me.

454
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,163
I'd love to go to your room
and get your autograph.

455
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:48,244
Is that right? I'd really love to, but
unfortunately, my room ain't ready.

456
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,839
Let's go to mine. Is very,

457
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,765
very close.
Hey, hey.

458
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,363
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
Excuse me.

459
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,282
ALEX: No. Come here for a second.
Excuse me.

460
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,599
Don't you move. What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

461
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,885
Nothing. But if you let go
of my arm, in about five minutes

462
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,767
I'm gonna go across the street
and wax that ass.

463
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,762
Listen to me. For all intents and
purposes, you are a spy right now.

464
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,568
I can't have you running off
with some strange Hungarian woman.

465
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0. Going off
with a strange woman is what I do.

466
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,887
Mind your own business. Let me go do
this. Have a good evening, all right?

467
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,927
I guess I'm just jealous.
I can understand, but she chose Kelly.

468
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,364
Look, I'll hit it once for you, all right?
Good night.

469
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,757
See if she's got a sister.

470
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,966
If she got a sister, I ain't gonna call your
ass. It's gonna be the three of us.

471
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:31,087
Why don't you go see the city?
What you say your name was?

472
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,800
Are you going to scream it?
Yes, I will scream your name if I know it.

473
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,120
I had a couple of interesting
situations where...

474
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,520
What happened?
The girl tried to press charges... Hey, hey!

475
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,849
Hey, slow it down!
I got a lady over here.

476
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,601
Hey, that's some serious road rage.

477
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,445
What's up, man?
What's all this?

478
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,207
MAN: How long have you been working
for the U.S. government?

479
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,121
I work for the United States
of Kelly Robinson.

480
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,728
There was BNS agent on your jet.

481
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,288
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who was he?

482
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,485
Hey, man, y'all been reading
too many spy novels.

483
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,480
Maybe we should cut off his penis.

484
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:14,163
Cut off my penis? Why would you go
straight to "cut off his penis"?

485
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,643
What happened to "rough the man up"?

486
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,606
Cut it off!
Wait a second, now calm down!

487
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,728
You ain't cutting off nobody's penis!
I'll answer all your questions, but...

488
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,608
Who's the agent?
I'm not sure if he's an agent.

489

Who's the agent?
I don't know if he's an agent or not!

Okay, he's 5 foot 9, he's got blond hair...
His name?

491
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:36,077
I'm not sure, but he's very annoying.
He's definitely a BNS agent.

pointing at me, so I'm blocking!

I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

Nice to officially meet you.
You're a spy!

509
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,485
Don't tell anyone.

You're all BNS?
It's all BNS.

Crazy way of showing it.

God, Alex, you been working out?
Yeah, a little. Why?

513

You just got buff.
Just doing curls.

I hope you didn't mind. Alex wanted
to test you before we put you in the game.

516
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,599
So this whole thing was a big test?
RACHEL: Yep.

517
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,885
Unbelievable. That was great.

You know what you are, my friend?

531
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,647
You're a "why not" guy,
as opposed to a "why" guy.

532
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,800
What's the difference?
A "why" guy's like:

533
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:39,558
"Why are we gonna do this?"
"Why are we gonna do that?"

534
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:41,242
They're scared. They're afraid
to make a decision.

535
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,481
Afraid they might get in trouble.
As opposed to a "why not" guy.

536
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:46,446
He's like, "Roll the dice."
Man of action.

00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,287
That's me.
Kelly Robinson's a "why not" guy.

538
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,009
The "why not" guys are
like eagles. They don't flock.

me if I wasn't a "why not" guy.

is a national secret.

See this man? This is Arnold
Gundars, premier arms dealer.

546
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,402
We believe he has this plane,
the Switchblade.

547
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:13,686
It's a sophisticated prototype
stolen from the U.S. government.

548
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,488
The Switchblade is the next generation
of stealth technology.

549
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,686
Undetectable to radar, infrared,
even the human eye.

Our mission is to get it back.

551
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,083
To make a long story short,

552
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:26,559
we can't find it,
because we can't see it.

553
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,441
Here it is with the electrochromatic
cloaking device engaged.

That's like one of those bugs
that look like a leaf.

One of the who?
On the Nature Channel

556
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,841
sometimes they have a bug that stays
safe because it looks like a leaf.

557
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,126
But it don't really look like a leaf.
It can make itself look like a leaf.

558
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,044
A leafy bug. It's a good name for it.
You should call that the "Leafy Bug."

That's a good idea.
I'll pass that on.

late for the mission. It's almost 8:00.

01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:17,007
It's time to go down.

1303
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,960
ANNOUNCER:
And Mills is down!

1304
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:25,087
Now we're talking!
REFEREE: Five.

1305
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,807
Come on, come on!
REFEREE: Six.

1306
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,563
Seven. Eight. Nine.

1307
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:32,118
ANNOUNCER: He's not gonna make it.
Ten! You're out!

1308
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:34,883
ANNOUNCER: It's over!
Kelly Robinson is still

1309
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:37,244
the super middleweight
champion of the world!

1310
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:44,045
Robinson foregoing his usual
flamboyant victory lap.

1311
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:46,086
He bolts the ring.

1312
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:48,968
I'm impressed, Alex.
You're tougher than I thought.

1313
01:13:49,129 --> 01:13:51,962
There's one thing that
will always make a man talk.

1314
01:13:57,649 --> 01:13:59,048
Cutting my belt?

1315
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:11,641
Take off his pants.
Take off my pants?

1316
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,879
Hold it.
Wait a second.

1317
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:27,640
ALEX: Easy. Easy.
Come on, take it easy.

1318
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:44,162
What are you doing here?
You turned on the eye thing,

1319
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,843
so I had to come save your ass!
I did?

1320
01:14:48,769 --> 01:14:52,159
That's a huge gesture!
That must mean you really love me.

1321
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:54,206
Don't get this twisted.
I did this to secure my parade.

1322
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:57,042
No getting around it. You love me.
This is for the parade!

1323
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:58,198
It's love!
Parade!

1324
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,643
It's love!
Parade!

1325
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:02,044
Kelly Robinson Day parade!
Move!

1326
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:08,081
I'm starting to regret this shit!

1327
01:15:08,929 --> 01:15:10,362
Move! Move!

1328
01:15:14,249 --> 01:15:15,602
Cover me!
Go!

1329
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:26,562
[CLICK]

1330
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:40,279
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1331
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,403
Who the hell is this guy?

1332
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:47,162
It's Carlos. I guess Mac
sent him in as backup for us.

1333
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:48,523
He's like a superspy.

1334
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:50,884
He's a spy, the same as me.
Not a superspy.

1335
01:15:51,049 --> 01:15:53,438
He got a fly-ass
ninja outfit and parachute.

1336
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:54,883
We hanging from balloons
and shit.

1337
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:58,162
Gundars! Tell your men
to put down their weapons.

1338
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,399
It seems to be quite
a trend tonight. Down!

1339
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,208
CARLOS: Alex, the code,
before we all blow up.

1340
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:06,042
That's what I'm doing.
I was on my way to do it.

1341
01:16:06,209 --> 01:16:09,519
Doing fine before you got here.
CARLOS: Mr. Zhu Tam, I believe.

1342
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,645
Carlos, careful.
Rachel's a double agent!

1343
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:14,243
Yes, I know, Alex.

1344
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,285
Yours too, Rachel.

1345
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,599
Apparently, you've been a bad girl.

1346
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:30,844
Now hold up.
Wait a second. Hey, Alex,

1347
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:33,398
this James Bond dude is with Rachel.
Not now.

1348
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:36,322
I got a hunch. This guy is bad.
I can feel it right now.

1349
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:38,525
I said, not now.
Let me figure this out!

1350
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:40,441
How did big shot know
she was bad?

1351
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,601
I got 45 seconds to figure out
this logarithmic code,

1352
01:16:43,769 --> 01:16:46,044
or we'll all die
because we'll blow up.

1353
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,679
Why don't you stick to your perfume
ads and leave the espionage to me?

1354
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:51,123
No, don't say that to him.

1355
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:53,883
Hey, Zorro, it's not perfume.
It's cologne.

1356
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,047
No, Kelly! No!

1357
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,600
Come on, come on.
Here we go.

1358
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:11,646
Code invalid.
Come on.

1359
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:13,242
Eighteen, seventeen,

1360
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:14,958
sixteen...

1361
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:19,682
Thirteen,

1362
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:21,043
twelve,

1363
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,198
eleven...

1364
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:30,006
Nine, eight, seven.
Sequence aborted.

1365
01:17:30,169 --> 01:17:31,284
I got it. I got it.

1366
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,565
No, I don't. No, I don't.
No, I don't.

1367
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,847
Don't do it! Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.

1368
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,837
I'm putting it down. Okay?

1369
01:17:45,889 --> 01:17:47,959
But I'm on your side.
I'm with BNS.

1370
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:50,689
What do BNS stand for with you?
Bitch that Need some Slapping?

1371
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:53,761
I was just trying to make sure Carlos
doesn't get to this computer.

1372
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,124
Think I believe that shit?
What's wrong with you?

1373
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:59,759
Hear her trying to flip the script?
Now she's saying she's good?

1374
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:02,363
I gotta hear this.
This should be rich.

1375
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:05,089
RACHEL: We've suspected Carlos
was dirty for months.

1376
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:07,809
Mac and me teamed up with him
so we could nail him.

1377
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,529
Why didn't they tell me?
You know how this stuff works.

1378
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:13,403
It's all on a need-to-know basis.
You know that.

1379
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,367
Mac didn't want you protecting me
at the wrong time.

1380
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,327
That's all Carlos would have needed.
He's so insanely jealous of us.

1381
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,286
He is?
If he knew how we felt...

1382
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:23,679
KELLY: Go easy now.
Don't be creeping up and shit.

1383
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:26,409
She got long legs.
Bitch is sneaky. She'll kick you.

1384
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,560
He's always known
I wanted to work with you.

1385
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,720
You wanted to work with me?
Yeah.

1386
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:32,561
What, like on a stakeout?

1387
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,318
Don't you know
how I feel about you?

1388
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:39,686
That's bullshit.
My head's spinning. I don't know...

1389
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:43,205
I can't deny it. I feel the same...
You dizzy from massive blood loss

1390
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:46,008
because the bitch stabbed you
15 minutes ago!

1391
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:49,047
I could have crippled him
for life if I wanted to.

1392
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:52,963
You've got full mobility in your leg, right?
It doesn't feel that bad.

1393
01:18:53,129 --> 01:18:54,357
Son of a gun.

1394
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:59,523
I had no idea.
Carlos was jealous of us?

1395
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:01,566
That's enough.
I can't listen to this shit.

1396
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:04,482
What's wrong with you?
You booty-blinded right now.

1397
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:07,959
It's like being snow-blinded, only it ain't
no snow, just a cute piece of ass.

1398
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:10,518
No. She's telling the truth.

1399
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:13,249
You don't understand the spy world.
There are agents.

1400
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:16,367
There are double agents, and
there are pseudo-double agents.

1401
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:18,326
It's actually pretty standard stuff.

1402
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:20,286
Y'all stabbing each other is standard?

1403
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:23,601
Yeah. It's pretty standard.

1404
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:24,958
Look out!

1405
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:37,558
I'm watching your ass.

1406
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:41,365
Alex, you idiot!
I'm on your side!

1407
01:19:41,529 --> 01:19:42,848
I've had enough of this!

1408
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:54,844
There's Vitalis and shit all over...

1409
01:19:55,009 --> 01:19:59,321
He was coming like a buzz saw. If you
didn't grab him, he was gonna kill me.

1410
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:02,128
It was like looking
in the eyes of the devil.

1411
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,162
Where's Rachel?

1412
01:20:05,249 --> 01:20:07,638
Yeah, where is Rachel, huh?
She gone.

1413
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:09,959
Didn't I tell you
that bitch was bad?

1414
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:11,801
Why didn't you keep
an eye on her?

1415
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:14,847
You said she was good!
You can't listen to what I say.

1416
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:17,648
I'm bleeding from a knife wound.
I'm delusional!

1417
01:20:17,809 --> 01:20:20,562
You said yourself I'm booty-blind.
I'm blinded by ass.

1418
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,367
You blinded now, but a minute ago...

1419
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:25,999
You two fools just let Rachel
escape with Gundars' computer?

1420
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:29,206
That has all the passwords
to his numbered accounts.

1421
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:32,805
It's worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.

1422
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:34,322
That's why he sent me...

1423
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:38,842
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?

1424
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:41,484
He's still a bad guy, right?

1425
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:44,364
Yeah, he...
Well, I don't know.

1426
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:47,566
Everybody keeps flip-flopping
around. I can't keep it straight.

1427
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:49,082
It's murky.

1428
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:51,809
You said it was standard...
I know what I said!

1429
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:54,324
It's murky when there ain't
no girl involved, huh?

1430
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:55,808
I see how it go.

1431
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:58,688
I'll tell you one thing. Good
or bad, I'm tying this guy up.

1432
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,564
We tie everybody up.
That's the new rule.

1433
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:04,961
Why don't you stop stressing?
There's the Leafy Bug, baby.

1434
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:07,285
That's what we set out to do,
and we got it.

1435
01:21:07,449 --> 01:21:09,087
We got the plane.
We heroes.

1436
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:11,399
You're right. Let's go home.
Look at that.

1437
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:14,447
You wanna see something cool?
What?

1438
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:21,958
Man, that is some superfly,
superspy shit!

1439
01:21:22,129 --> 01:21:23,528
Let me see.
What you pressing?

1440
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:25,759
Just press that button.
Okay.

1441
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,483
Invisible.
Invisible.

1442
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,641
Gotta get that on my cars. You know
how clean my garage is gonna look?

1443
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:33,369
Visible. Invisible.
Visible...

1444
01:21:33,529 --> 01:21:35,997
ALEX: Careful, don't wear out the battery.
Let me have some fun.

1445
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:38,558
It loses its specialness after a while.
Give it back.

1446
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:39,963
Come on, why you acting...?

1447
01:21:40,769 --> 01:21:43,647
Why you gotta be tripping?
Why can't I play with it?

1448
01:21:43,809 --> 01:21:46,369
You broke it.
I broke the shit? How I break it?

1449
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:49,202
Like a child, you knock it
out of my hand. I broke it?

1450
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:51,087
Are you happy now?
How will I explain this?

1451
01:21:51,249 --> 01:21:54,047
I show up with the plane
and a broken remote.

1452
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,801
You think they're worried
about the remote?

1453
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:58,847
There's dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they'll care about that?

1454
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:00,920
Come on, man!
You're right. Let's go.

1455
01:22:01,089 --> 01:22:03,319
We're heroes.
I'm gonna get my parade, huh?

1456
01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:06,481
Maybe so.
I'll definitely get a parade behind this.

1457
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:11,725
All right. Settle back,
and I'm gonna fire this baby up.

1458
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:15,528
And that is why they call it
the Switchblade.

1459
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,924
All right. Ready
for the ride of your life?

1460
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:26,522
Yeah, let's do this.

1461
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:30,684
ALEX:
Watch this.

Punch it!

ALEX: Got a little wrinkle.
Not to worry.

[YELLING]

1466
01:22:47,969 --> 01:22:50,483
KELLY: Kelly Robinson ain't
supposed to go out like this!

1467
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:53,117
I'm supposed to die in the ring!

1468
01:22:57,529 --> 01:23:00,282
Kelly, you okay?
Come here. You okay?

1469
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,360
Hell, no! I ain't okay.

1470
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:04,918
You just crashed my parade
down into the river.

1471
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:08,445
We had nozzle failure. Then the
thrust manifold went all haywire.

1472
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:11,442
You didn't check it, did you?
Huh? This is perfect!

1473
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:14,646
My first mission, I do everything right.
Now thanks to you, I ain't a hero!

1474
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:17,764
- What is that?
- This is my flotation device.

1475
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:19,123
That's a bomb!
What?

1476
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:20,768
That's a thermonuclear bomb.

1477
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:23,159
Why you gotta throw them
around here, then?

1478
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:27,038
No, it's okay. It's not armed.
Can you imagine if this had gone off?

1479
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:29,165
This would have killed millions!

1480
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:32,446
And they didn't arm it?
They didn't get a chance to.

1481
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:34,804
You know why
they didn't get a chance to?

1482
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,288
Because we stopped them!

1483
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:38,246
We stopped them.
Know what that means?

1484
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:40,718
I think so.
We heroes again!

1485
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,278
Damn, you're right.
You bet your pink ass I'm right!

1486
01:23:43,449 --> 01:23:45,724
We're heroes again!
Even without the plane.

1487
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:48,119
We're heroes!
This is the proof right here!

1488
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,757
This bomb.
I can't wait to call the president.

1489
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:53,921
We gonna get the Congressional
Medal of Honour and a parade!

1490
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:55,886
This is gonna be fantastic.

1491

Has my bank transfer come through?

01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:08,960
Not yet, Ms. Tessio.

You forgot your drink.

Alex, how are you?

1495
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:41,525
God!
Came prepared this time.

1496
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:42,678
Smart.

Where you going?
Back up.

you was gonna get away?

Thought you was gonna
make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?

1500
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:51,560
When I have my parade, I'll tie
your ass to the front of a float.

1502
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,799
How about a stakeout
in Greece for two weeks?

1503
01:24:57,969 --> 01:24:59,527
Stakeout?
Yeah.

1504
01:25:00,289 --> 01:25:01,688
Two weeks?

1505
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:05,561
Hey! The answer is still no.

1506
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,926
I know. I was just imagining
for a second. There's no harm in...

1507
01:25:09,089 --> 01:25:12,320
You taking a long time. Tell her no.
You getting lost in this. No!

1508
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:13,888
No.
In fact, say, "Hell, no!"

1509
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:16,768
Hell, no.
Hell, no, bitch!

1510
01:25:17,089 --> 01:25:19,557
Sorry.
The spell wore off.

1511
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:24,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, boys, I'm glad
you guys got all the news coverage.

1512
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:27,363
What's that mean?
She's always got to have the last word.

1513
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,565
She always gotta say some shit, huh?

1514
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:33,000
What she talking about, news
coverage? Ain't been no news...

1515
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,363
Is that Carlos?

1516
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,239
"Superspy hero thwarts..."
So Carlos was good.

1517
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:41,082
We the ones that saved the day!
Is this a parade?

1518
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,763
Yes! Look at the spectacle
and the glitter and shit!

1519
01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:45,567
That's my parade!
He stole my parade!

I don't know what to say.
I know what to say. Bullshit!

01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,367
Bullshit!

1522
01:25:51,769 --> 01:25:52,918
Bullshit!

01:25:53,089 --> 01:25:55,239
We gotta go to Washington
and get debriefed.

1524
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:57,240
I ain't going!
I don't blame you.

1525
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:01,084
It's just, I was looking forward
to testing out the hover gel with you.

1526
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:05,087
The whatsit gel?
Hover.

1527
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,763
It's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.

1528
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,841
It's 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body,

1529
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:12,761
and as long as you're in an
oxygen-rich environment,

1530
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:15,602
it allows you to float
down to earth like a bird.

1531
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:19,407
Like a jelly bird?

1532
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:23,278
Yeah. That's the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.

1533
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:25,565
They have a couple for us
on the transport plane.

1534
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:29,358
Plan was, they drop us off over D.C.,
and we float down like birds.

1535
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:33,283
There's press and photographers.
It's gonna be a whole spectacle, but...

1536
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,167
What we waiting on?
Let's do this.

1537
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,240
You'll do it?
Hell, yeah, I'll do it!

1538
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:39,718
Float like a jelly bird?
Let's go right now.

1539
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:42,039
I used to always dream
I'd be able to fly.

1540
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:44,279
Are you serious?
My grandma said I was a damn fool.

1541
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,007
That's what made her
punch me the first time!

1542
01:26:46,169 --> 01:26:48,080
See, I told her and...
Hold on.

1543
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,843
Get a couple jars of jelly on the plane
and two parachutes.
