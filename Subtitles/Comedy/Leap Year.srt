Well, hundreds
of years ago,

721
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:36,929
there was this beautiful
girl called Grainne.

722
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,466
Now, she was promised in marriage
to this fella called Fionn,

723
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:45,406
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord,

724
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,901
old enough to be her father,
old enough to be her grandfather,

725
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:49,967
and therefore

727
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,012
she wasn't
in love with him.

728
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:55,107
Anyway, on the night
of their betrothal,

729
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:59,622
whom did she meet but a
handsome young warrior, Diarmuid.

730
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,024
They fell madly in love at first
sight, but what could she do?

731
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,857
Well, she slips a sleeping
potion in everyone's drinks,

732
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:11,492
and the pair of them run off
together across the Shannon.

733
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:16,996
Fionn wakes and there's Grainne
gone. Well, he goes mental.

heads off in hot pursuit.

But it was the people, you know, the
people in the villages of Ireland,

736
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,110
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

737
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:32,052
They hid them in forests and
in their barns and castles,

738
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:35,655
where they'd sleep one night
and then they'd move on.

Of course.

Sleep was all they did, 'cause
Diarmuid, good man that he was,

743
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:50,502
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

744
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:54,873
and out of respect for him, didn't,
you know, take it any further.

Sorry.

1225
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:43,955
We were all running the Caragh
together, me, Kaleigh, Ryan.

1226
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:49,460
So we bought the pub and
built it up from nothing.

1227
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:54,332
We really got it going.
I mean, we were flying.

1228
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:58,571
And I thought that me and
Kaleigh were mad for each other.

1229
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:02,806
Apparently not.

1230
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,618
So that thing I'd grab
if I had 60 seconds,

1231
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,692
it's my mother's
Claddagh ring.

1232
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:19,124
You know, the ones with the two
hands holding the crowned heart.

1233
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,462
Mmm-hmm.

1234
01:17:20,968 --> 01:17:22,435
Well, she's got it.

1235
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:27,566
Well, you're here now. You
should find her and get it back.

1236
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:29,542
I don't know.

1237
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,079
It's your mother's ring.

1238
01:17:32,613 --> 01:17:33,602
Anyway, I thought
it was your ring

you're finally on board.

me that one bob and we'll call it a day?

Sorry.

1396
01:28:39,146 --> 01:28:40,306
Well,

1397
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:44,611
when my 60 seconds
came around, I realized

1398
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:48,244
I had everything
I ever wanted

1399
01:28:48,355 --> 01:28:50,653
but nothing
I really needed.

1400
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:54,783
And I think that
what I need is here.

1401
01:28:56,663 --> 01:29:00,224
And I came all this way to see
if maybe you might think so, too.

1402
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,528
And if you do...

1403
01:29:05,405 --> 01:29:09,535
Well, I don't really have any plans
past that, which is new for me.

1404
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:13,137
So,

1405
01:29:14,648 --> 01:29:16,582
Declan O'Callaghan,

1406
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,818
and I should probably
learn your middle name,

1407
01:29:21,288 --> 01:29:23,188
here is my proposal.

1408
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:28,220
I propose
we not make plans.

1409
01:29:29,563 --> 01:29:31,622
I propose we give
this thing a chance

1410
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:34,132
and let it work out
how it works out.

1411
01:29:35,035 --> 01:29:36,627
So what do you say?

1412
01:29:38,739 --> 01:29:41,367
Do you want to
not make plans with me?

Mrs. O'Bradycallaghan.

Where the hell
are you going?

1417
01:31:39,459 --> 01:31:40,858
You said no.

1418
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:43,087
I didn't say no.

1419
01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:46,262
I didn't say anything.

1420
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:48,959
You walked away.

1421
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:52,003
I was getting something.

1422
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:54,870
Really? That was a good
time to go get something?

1423
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:56,841
Well, yeah,
it was, actually.

1424
01:31:58,845 --> 01:32:00,574
I was getting this.

1425
01:32:04,117 --> 01:32:05,607
You big idiot.

1426
01:32:07,387 --> 01:32:10,481
I wouldn't be holding this
ring if it weren't for you.

1427
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:13,158
I reject your proposal.

1428
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:18,595
I don't want to
not make plans with you.

1429
01:32:21,034 --> 01:32:23,264
I want to make
plans with you.

1430
01:32:25,071 --> 01:32:26,265
You do?

1431
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:29,107
Yeah. I do.

1432
01:32:37,884 --> 01:32:39,545
Will you marry me?

1433
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:46,390
In all my life, I never thought
I'd see you down on one knee.

1434
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,156
Yeah, it's getting
a bit damp down here, so...

1435
01:32:51,898 --> 01:32:55,129
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

1436
01:32:57,504 --> 01:32:58,562
Yes.

1437
01:32:59,606 --> 01:33:01,005
Yes, I will.

1438
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:34,271
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

1439
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:37,071
I thought I wasn't gonna
have a place to stay tonight.

1440

What?

1441
01:33:39,145 --> 01:33:41,545
You think you're staying with me?

1442
01:33:42,082 --> 01:33:43,845
This might cost you.

Would you
look at that!

1445

On a Sunday, no less. It's good
luck to get engaged on a Sunday.

1446
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,962
And end a journey.

1447
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,133
Aye, and dig a well.

they're digging a well?

push her off the road!
