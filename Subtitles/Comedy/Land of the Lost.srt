ASTRONAUT: Mission Control, come
in. Mission Control, do you read?

2
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,530
Mayday. Mayday.

3
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,575
On reentry into Earth's orbit,
I seem to have fallen into,

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,246
I don't know, some kind
of tear in time and space.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,125
My coordinates are unknown.
Is this even Earth?

6
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:47,505
Ship's instruments indicate
should be White Sands, New Mexico.

7
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,300
Obvious error. Is anyone
receiving this? Come back.

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,639
Oh, God. Oh, God.

10

team, fix coordinates now!

11
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,773

Somebody respond!

12
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,567

Oh, God. Oh, God!

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,240
Does anyone read...

17
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,748
No!

00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,340
MALE ANNOUNCER: This is
Today, with Matt Lauer.

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,801
We're back now with
Dr. Rick Marshall,

20
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,387
whose new book arrives
in stores tomorrow.

21
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:42,268
It was back in Oslo, Doctor, last month,
that you just startled your colleagues

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,897
with this theory of yours that takes
science in a completely new direction.

23
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,023
- Quantum...
- Quantum Paleontology.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,274
Quantum Paleontology,
that's correct.

25
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,942
What exactly is that?

26
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,280
Well, it's... Not to say modestly,
it's our very future, Matt.

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
It's the only
real solution

28
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,951
to solving this fossil fuel
crisis we're experiencing.

29
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,579
And it boils down
to two simple words.

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,080
Renewable biofuels.

31
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,208
Close. Time warps.

32
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,627
- Time warps?
- Time warps.

33
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,669
You're serious about this.

34
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,630
I'm deadly serious.

35
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,091
Five years, over $50
million on my research.

36
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,637
You've spent $50 million of your
own money studying time warps?

37
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,307
No, that's adorable. No, taxpayers'
money. I don't have $50 million.

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,725
And now you're
asking for more.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,268
It's all explained
in my book.

40
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,478
I know. We've plugged the book.

41
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,854
(READING)

42
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:27,939
Yeah.

43
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,106
Bantam Books. Amazon.

44
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,819
We are living in a time
right now with huge cuts in...

45
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,945
I saw.

46
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,404
- Huge cuts in spending.
- Right.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,989
We're in dire economic straits,

48
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,952
and you're spending $50
million on studying time warps.

49
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,995
How do you not think
that's irresponsible?

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,163
- Well, I...
- Are you smoking?

51
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,998
No, I'm making a balloon
animal here, earthling.

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,291
But you can't smoke in the studio.

53
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,543
Okay, no one told me that.

54
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,169
Just, you can't.

55
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,587
Look, look... Fine.

56
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:56,342
There are huge, huge amounts of
trans-dimensional energy out there

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,177
just waiting for us to throw the switch.

58
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,512
Energy crisis averted.

59
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,141
You are asking people to stake the entire
future of industrialized civilization

60
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,853
on what you call
"parallel dimensions. "

61
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,856
What about the critics who
have a fair question, Doctor?

62
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,235
They say this theory of yours is
not science. It is non-science.

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,904
And some are even more blunt,
and they say it's nonsense.

65
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,114
How do you
respond to that?

66
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,407
- My critics?
- Your critics.

67
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,200
- And there are a lot of them.
- Can you be more specific?

68
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,785
Stephen Hawking.

69
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,831
Stephen Hawking says this
is nonsense. That's his word.

70
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,416
Okay, you know what?
This interview's over.

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
Why?

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,295
Because, like, your producers said
you wouldn't bring that up, all right?

73
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,379
It's a fair question.

74
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,131
No, it's not! It's a hatchet job!

75
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,383
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall,

76
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,426
whose book arrives in stores tomorrow.

77
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,677
RICK: Goddamn right it was!

78
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,761
You might want to look for it

79
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,265
in the "I'm out of my
freaking mind" department.

80
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,142
When we come back, trampolines.

81
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,435

making a run for the stage!

83
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,229

84
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,231
MAN: - Hey, he's so strong!
- What are you, crazy?

00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,984
(RICK SCREAMING)

86
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,159
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed
colleagues, I'll conclude with this.

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,621
Our very future depends on one thing.

88
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,039
(RICK READING)

89
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,083
Subatomic particles that
move so incredibly fast,

90
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,419
they actually travel backwards in time.

91
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:18,299
Ask yourself, what if there was a
device that could harness these tachyons?

92
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,678
We could open and travel
through warps in time and space.

93
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,932
What's that?
Not in our lifetime?

94
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,977
My friends, I've designed such a device.

95
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,688
I give to you
the tachyon amplifier.

96
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,483
Genius in a box.

97
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,570
Only with this device, you don't
travel forwards or backwards.

98
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,822
You travel sideways in time

99
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,452
to another dimension where past,
present and future all meet.

100
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,871
And lights!

101
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,541
All right, any questions?

102
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,795
Oh! Great. Yes.
You, right there, young man.

103
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,798
Yeah. If you shot a
ton of pot at the sun,

104
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,967
would it burn up
and get everybody high?

105
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,593
No. No, no.

106
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,513
Are there any real questions
that pertain to science?

107
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,973
Do you take Cialis?

bathroom before this presentation?

109

you're about to cry now?

Did you ever try to make
the tachyon amplifier?

Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm Holly Cantrell.

I studied all your
work at Cambridge.

120
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,082
I think you're brilliant.

121
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,211
Well, Holly from Cambridge
who thinks I'm brilliant,

122
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,380
I started, but I didn't finish. So, no.

123
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,924
No, but you have to build it. I
mean, it's the most incredible...

124
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,301
What are you eating?

125
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,971
It's a donut
stuffed with M&M's.

126
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,599
That way when you finish the donut,
you don't have to eat any M&M's.

127
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,436
But don't you see?
You were absolutely right.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,562
- Everything...
- Stop!

129
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,817
Chasing that theory got me laughed out
of mainstream science and landed me here.

130
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,319
And you know what? I don't
have anyone to blame but myself.

131
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:08,492
'Cause, as they say, if you don't
make it, it's your own damn "vault. "

132
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,828
That's a bitch-slap
of truth right there.

133
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:15,082
If your theories are such
rubbish, then explain this.

of a $10 lighter.

Go on, explain that.

137
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,221
I found it out in the desert
along with crystals like this

138
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,766
that radiate pure
tachyon energy.

139
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,935
Go on.

140
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,730

00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,968

past, and I don't know, you know,

155
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,225
just with the stress of
everything, I just overdid it.

156
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,980
But I'm in control, and I don't
have to go back to Phoenix.

00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,484

and apologize for yesterday.

building it, yes,

but I didn't have the
nerve to test it out.

165

give me some courage, but no dice.

strength to turn that thing on.

00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,652
They're just like zombies. That's
how zombies get you. Volume!

695
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,445
We're all gonna die.

696
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,697
HOLLY: Like hell.

697
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,867
I'm gonna take at least one
of these bastards with me,

698
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,952
even if he has to choke
to death on my skull!

699
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,245
Oh!

700
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,581
What, do you want some, too, do you?

701
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,875
WILL: What are you guys doing?

702
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,251
One second.

703
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,471
What in the hell?

704
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,767
Get in!

705
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,896
Oh, God.

706
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,480
Wait, stand down, Holly.

707
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,232
All right.

708
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,859
- Hang on.
- Yeah.

709
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,235
Hang on,
I think we're safe!

710
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,487

make it through the entrance.

keeps peering into my soul.

712
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,075
Well, this is
just fantastic.

713
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,827

in here and suffocate

00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,543

an efficient use of space.

716
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,670

Thank Vindok you've come
to my aid, Rick Marshall.

722
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,480
- You know me?
- Of course.

723
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,774
Even in the farthest
reaches of the universe,

724
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,068
we have seen your Matt Lauer video.

725
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,696
I am a prisoner
in this land of the lost.

726
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,324
Only you can help me escape.

727
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,702
The fate of the universe depends on you.

728
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,831
Well. That's very flattering, Enik,

729
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,793
but I think you've
found the wrong guy. I...

730
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,961
No, Rick Marshall.

731
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,923
I have summoned you here specifically
to help me stop an evil madman

732
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:26,220
who has already conquered my world
and now plans to conquer yours.

733
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,265
His name is the Zarn.

734
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,228
I am the Zarn! Heed my
warning or be destroyed!

735
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,773
The Zarn became obsessed with
using the power of these crystals

736
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,733
to conquer the universe.

737
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,029
If he is not stopped, he will
open a doorway to your world

738
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:49,159
and lead his army of Sleestak on
a rampage across time and space.

739
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,912
He must be stopped.

740
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,498
Enik, buddy.

741
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,002
I'm a scientist.
You're a scientist.

742
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,171
I think together you and I
can figure this out. Now...

743
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,090
You mustn't touch the crystals!

744
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,174
Okay!

745
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,968
The wrong manipulation of the crystals

746
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,179
could turn time and space inside out.

747
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,015
What do you need from us?

748
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,102
The Zarn lacks only one thing
to enact his evil plan.

749
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,107
A device to amplify tachyons and
unleash the full power of the crystals.

750
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,569
Well, Marshall's created a device
that isolates tachyon interference.

751
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,903
Yeah, I did that.

752
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,238
Of course.

753
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,826
With tachyon particles focused
along the proper temporal vector

754
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,661

instantly you could help me.

760
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,048
Thank you.

761
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,884
You are a truly
advanced intellect.

762
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,720
I don't know how you
manage amongst these others.

763
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,139
I don't know how I do,
either. I really don't!

764
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,348
Excuse me!

765
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,642
You have this tachyon amplifier?

766
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,687
I lost it on the way,
and I don't know where.

767
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,064
It could be lost in time.
On the contrary.

768
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,399
I detect it nearby. It...

769
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:06,236
Strange. I cannot precisely
pinpoint its location.

770
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,405
It moves.

771
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,365
Leave it to us.

772
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,076
If it's out there, we'll find it.

Not so fast, amigo.

trust a dude in a tunic. "

775

776
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,293
Yes. It's never led me astray.

00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,796
All right, come on. Enik,
are you well enough to travel?

778
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,592
No. My place is here in the
pylon. I must protect the crystals.

779
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,762
If you wish to return home,
these crystals are the doorway.

780
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:36,183
Your device is the key.
Find it before the Zarn does.

781

Bring it to me and rescue
us all. Rescue the universe!

Hustle up.

785
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,324

786
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,078
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a bit
of a miniatures enthusiast.

787
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,080
It's very impressive.

788
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,164
Thank you.

789
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,042
Yeah, well, I see some
obvious scaling issues, but...

790
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,710
I think
it's pretty damn good.

791
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,047

It's the cave.

That's the cave.
That's where we're living.

797
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,145
Now, I will tether Will to
this hot air balloon right here.

798
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,565
Okay? And it will be fitted with
a crude tachyon reflector-array

799
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,942

blanket and a cell phone charger.

volunteering for that.

I've taken care of that.

807
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,960
During the course
of my professional career,

808
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,589
I've done extensive research with
reptiles and various birds of prey,

809
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,756
of which dinosaurs are.

810
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,008
Well, that's disputable.

811
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,634
Please be quiet.

They have a very
acute sense of smell.

813
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,471
And now while I've gathered this

814
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,391
strictly for genetic research
to be used upon our return,

815
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,104
I think it would prove wise to
use this now. Hadrosaur urine.

to cover our...

How'd you get that?

00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,905
Well, while you were sleeping,

821
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,240
I'm out gathering research. Okay?

822
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,868
This was to be used
for genetic engineering,

823
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,038
and I was going to write a
report on kidney function,

824
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,708
but now it'll just be camouflage.
We'll all blend in. Okay?

825
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,043
So we will cover ourselves...

(SIGHING) Oh, my God!

829
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,008
So you've been gathering urine.

830
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,886
Yes. What's the problem?

831
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,681
That means that you stood
under a dino dong with a bucket.

832
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,731
If you want to be technical and reduce
it to its basest element, yes, I was.

833
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,318
How'd that work out for you?

834
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,736
Are you honestly asking me?

835
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,071
Yeah.

00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,576

little bit like fly fishing.

And then, zing!
You get a big catch.

839
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,295
Okay. So we'll cover
our bodies in urine,

Listen. I gotta just level
with you, bro. I misjudged you.

I thought you were just a dumbass

I'm gonna have to say no.

As one scientist to another,
I beg you for mercy.

Where's Will?

01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:39,081
He went to a better place.

1576
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:42,668
You killed him?

1577
01:29:42,753 --> 01:29:43,753
No.

1578
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:48,466
No, he went to a strange world,

1579
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:54,597
a world of dinosaurs,
monkey people, lizard people,

1580

a hole in space and time,
a virtual land of the lost.

believe, Will chose to stay.

That's great news.

You've had quite a year.

1619
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,360
Actually, a stellar year, Matt.

1620
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,529

you back a dinosaur egg,

gracious enough to transport.

Is this gonna be okay?"
