blasted off from our planet,

14

that launched a probe

15

way out into the blackness of space.

16

The probe would use
the energy from the sun

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,180
and the gravitational pull
of our neighbouring planets

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,770
to cross our solar system.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,220

a man and a woman,

25

FENELLA: Hello and welcome to Book News,

394
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,924
the show where you get to know
what books are coming to you

395
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,849
and authors get what's coming to them.

396
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,820
What's the truth
under publishers' blurbs?

397
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,820
Why do writers' photographs always
show them looking ten years younger?

398
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,500
You've come to the right place
to find out.

399
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,420
Our first guest tonight
is Mortimer Stanley,

400
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,889
whose latest novel is entitled
What You See With Your Eyes Open.

401
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,140
Mortimer, your last novel
was published nearly ten years ago.

402
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,564
It got what they call "mixed reviews"
and sold fewer than 3,000 copies.

403
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,660
What possessed you to write another one?

404
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,728
Well, my wife was dying.

405
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,620
You were estranged, weren't you?

406
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,770
Well, yes, but on her deathbed,
she urged me to write another book.

407
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,340
Knowing that she would never
have to read it?

408
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,487
- (CHUCKLES)
- Well...

409
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,380
Fenella's complaining that you didn't
tell her about his shoplifting conviction.

410
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,860
Well, he was 14, James.
It's got nothing to do with his book.

411
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,724
Well, neither has the show, Cath.

412
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,083
Listen, what upsets Fenella about you
is your integrity.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,968
But me, I quite like it.

414
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,540
Play your cards right,
you could get your own office

415
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,060

418
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,603
Sorry. Excuse me one second.

419
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,524
Mind you, you've gotta play
your cards right.

- What the hell are you doing here?
- (CHUCKLES)

421
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,601
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Please go away.

422
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,331
That wouldn't be fair to you, Cath.

423
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,161
This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to get to know the real me.

424
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,850
Well... I'm calling security.

425
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,420
No, not just the charming,
high-flying military strategist.

426
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,420
Hello, security?

427
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,329
Not the inventor of extreme
rendition, either.

428
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,488
Yes, I've got an intruder in room 405.

429
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,491
Or the mastermind behind
warrantless domestic surveillance.

430
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,443
Just a humble officer who adores you.

431
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,644
Okay, Grant, I appreciate
that you like me...

432
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,885
Like? Like? What do you think,
I'm one of these cardboard cut-outs?

433
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,205
Like? No. No, no, no. Adulate. Worship.

434
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,841
Okay, well, I don't adulate
or worship you.

435
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,731
I don't even really like you.

436
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,725
So that's why I'm asking you
to just go away and leave me alone.

437
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,369
- So there's some hope?
- No, no, no. There's no hope.

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,651
Cath, I came all the way to England
to see you.

439
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,524
Doesn't that show you
how much I care about you?

440
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,140
No, it shows me that you're obsessed.
Obsession's not a quality that I admire.

441
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
Really?

442
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,322
I think the lady wants you
to go, Colonel.

443
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,209

444
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,206

the British Broadcasting Corporation?

down the hall from me

at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

448
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,048
And he did it in his spare time.

- It's from the Latin.

Could you just stop that, please?

691
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,282
You, stop tapping.
Let's just have a break, shall we? Just...

692
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,368
Right, what's next? (CLEARS THROAT)

693
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,380
- (SNIFFING)
- Ooh.

694
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,051
This one's in German. Wow.

695
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,489
Let me be able to understand German.

696
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,642
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

697
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,180
- (BARKING)
- What are you talking about, Dennis?

698
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,124
- (BARKING)
- Look, just shut up, okay? I can handle this.

699
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,220
- (BARKING)
- She's not going to ask me to marry her.

700
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,700
- (BARKING)
- Or have my children, okay?

701
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,849
- (BARKING)
- Dennis, what are you talking about?

702
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,166
(BARKING)

703
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,163
That's a good idea, actually.
What are you talking about?

704
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,540
Dennis, be able to talk.

705
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,926
Biscuits.

706
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,900
- What?
- Biscuits.

707
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,526
Maybe if I make her fall in love with me
like a little bit, you know,

708
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,051
so she doesn't want to marry me

709
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,400
- but she would have sex on a regular...
- Biscuits.

710
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,491
- For crying out loud, they're in the cupboard.
- What are?

711
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,660
Biscuits. Red biscuits, black biscuits.

712
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,740
- Nothing else matters.
- Is that all you think about?

713
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,580
Yes, yes! Biscuits.

714
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,091
(WHIMPERING)

715
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,287
All right, Dennis,
become a rational, thinking creature.

716
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,844
Look, I just can't concentrate on anything
until I've had one of those biscuits.

717
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,900
I know it's crazy but that's how it is.
I guess I'm kind of hooked on them.

718
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,780
So please give me just one biscuit,

719
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,531
then I'll be able to think
about something else.

720
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,340
That makes sense.

721
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,820
Oh, oh, oh! He's getting the biscuits!
He's getting them! This is it!

722
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,967
Yeah!

723
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,180
He's got them. (BARKING)

724
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,568
He's got them. He's going to throw one.
Get ready, get ready. Here it comes.

725
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,768
Ah! Mmm. Mmm.

726
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,083
God, it must be terrible being a dog.
I never realised you had so many cravings.

727
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,660
- It's no worse than you and that bitch.
- What bitch?

728
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,922
The bitch you were shagging last night.

729
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,300
Oh, my God. She's not a bitch, okay?
She's a lovely human female.

730
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,540
And we weren't just shagging.

731
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,180
Right. Come to think of it, I wouldn't
mind shagging your leg right now.

732
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,442
A little leg dance, huh?
Just above the sock. (LAUGHING)

733
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,289
- Ah...
- How about it? Come on, Daddy. (LAUGHING)

734
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,244
I thought I turned you into
a rational, thinking creature.

735
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,807
Rational, thinking creatures
still have desires.

736
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,900
(CHUCKLES) Oh, well,
we can soon deal with that.

737
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,240
(BARKING) No!

738
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,620
- No, no, don't take my desires away from me.
- Why not?

739
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,167
They're what makes my life worth living.
Biscuits, shagging.

740
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,567
I don't think I like your conversation.

741
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,490
But I worship you, master.
I love you so much.

742
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,140
- I can't bear displeasing you.
- I... I know.

743
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,810
- My whole world collapses...
- I know. Yes. I love you.

744
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,860
...when you're cross with me.

745
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,166
Look, maybe it was better
when you didn't talk.

746
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,483
Oh, no, don't take away my power of speech
now that I can think rationally.

747
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,965
That would be so cruel.

748
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,340
(DOORBELL RINGING)

749
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,805
- I heard the bell. Somebody at the door.
- Okay, no...

750
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,740
- The bell! Hey! The bell!
- No, no. Dennis. Dennis, good dog.

751
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,860
- Hello, the bell!
- Dennis... Dennis.

752
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,086
- Hey, hey, somebody.
- Just... Just quiet.

753
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,340
There it goes again.
Hey, hey, somebody at the door.

754
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,169
Oh, no, have I done
something wrong again?

755
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,248
No, just... Just be quiet.
Do you understand me?

756
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,140
Yes. Yes, anything to stop you
being angry with me.

757
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,810
- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- The bell! There it goes again!

758
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

759
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,180
Dennis, listen.
Just listen, listen, listen, listen.

760
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,169
Be quiet. That is an order.

761
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,380
Right. Quiet.

762
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,290
I like obeying orders,
especially your orders.

763
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,165
Good. Well, then, shut the fuck up.

764
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,700
Right, right.
Shut the fuck up. Yeah, right.

765
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,165
(DOORBELL RINGING)

766
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,281
Good boy.

767
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,808
Oh, God, I made her do it. I made her
do it... I... okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

768
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,060
- Hi.
- Hey. (LAUGHING)

769
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,004
- Can I come in?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

770
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,100
- So, look, um, about last night...
- Yes.

771
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,380
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. No, no.

772
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,380
Okay. Um, I just...
I don't want you to think

773
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,740
that I, um, do that sort
of thing all the time

774
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,380
because... Because I don't.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

775
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,300
- Um... I was slightly drunk.
- Yeah, well, I mean, naturally.

776
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,260
Otherwise we probably wouldn't have
done the thing with the...

777
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,940
- No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
- ...beard trimmer.

778
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,045
I mean, I like you. I, um, I've always
really enjoyed talking to you.

779
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,562
I just... I probably wouldn't have jumped
on you like that if I hadn't...

780
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,041
- Been pissed as a newt?
- Well, sort of.

781
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,900
Yeah, okay. Well, then, let's just forget it.
It never... It never happened.

782
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,809
No, no, no, that's not
what I'm saying, Neil.

783
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,522
Oh, well, um, what did you want, then?

784
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,690
DENNIS: Shag her, Neil!

785
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,644
That's Dennis.

786
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,140
- Dennis?
- Yeah. He is a plumber.

787
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,050
Um, I'm having a few problems
with my waterworks. My water pipes.

788
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,366
DENNIS: Shag her, Neil!

789
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,491
I'd better get him the shagger.
It's a special wrench that plumbers use.

790
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,340
(WHISPERING)
I thought I told you to shut up.

791
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, sorry.

792
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,340
You're supposed to be
a rational, thinking creature.

793
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,284
Sorry, sorry. Can't help myself. Sorry.
Oh, dear. I wanna shag your leg.

794
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,448
NEIL: Shh. It's not a great time,
to be honest.

795
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,980
Maybe later, if you behave.

796
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,140
DENNIS: Oh...

797
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,620
Oh... Couldn't... Couldn't find the shagger,
so he just went with the old decoupler.

798
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,300
DENNIS: I love you, Neil!

799
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,528
Shut up, Dennis!

800
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,980
It's odd, isn't it,
shouting at the plumber like that?

801
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,460
But, uh, the fact is he's my brother.
The plumber is my brother.

802
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,961
DENNIS: Say you love me, Neil.

803
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,180
And we're very close.

804
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,408
- God, Rosie was right.
- Rosie?

805
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,966
DENNIS: Please can I shag your leg?

806
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,205
Jesus, Neil, how could you?
The next morning!

807
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,726
What? I...

808
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,380
- Why do I always end up with creeps?
- I'm not a creep!

809
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,484
DENNIS: There was a cat, Neil!
Neil! Hey, you, cat!

810
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,380
Stay out of my garden, go on!
Neil, it's a ginger tom!

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,970
(BARKING)

812
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,220
Dennis, be a dumb animal again
for five minutes.

813
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,731
(BARKING)

814
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,340
So she thinks I'm gay.

815
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,820
(LAUGHING) I mean, so what, you know?

816
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,129
I mean, it means that she won't want to
marry me or have my kids.

817
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,282
Bingo. Problem solved.

818
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,645
Thank you, Dennis.

819
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,126
Catherine!

820
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,604
Catherine!

821
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,167
Um, me be on the bus.

822
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,924
Ah! I don't mean on the bus.
I mean in the bus.

823
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,260
(SCREAMING)

824
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,648
Not in the engine.
In the passenger accommodation!

825
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,330
Ow!

00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,330
Catherine!

830
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,780
Whoa.

831
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,900
- Ray.
- You've gotta stop Miss Pringle.

832
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,731
She's... She's set up shrines
all over the school.

833
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,171
There's even a website.

834
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,740
Look, you wanted her
to worship you, okay?

835
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,842
- Not like this.
- Ray, I don't have time for this.

836
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,849
Wait, wait, wait.
You haven't lost the powers, have you?

837
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,201
- No, I haven't lost the powers. Ray.
- You have. You've lost the...

838
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,300
- I haven't lost the powers.
- Do the thing.

839
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,890
Ray, become a duck.

Ray, stop it. Ray, become a sausage.

842
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,200
- I haven't lost the powers, Ray, okay? This is...
- Where is he, Neil?

843
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,047
Oh. That's his car.

844
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,780
(GASPS) Oh. Behold the car of Ray!

00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,100
- Catherine, can we talk?
- No.

847
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,611
But I love you.

848
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,460
You also love Dennis, apparently.

849
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,927
- Did you take that off there?
- Uh, no, this is mine.

850
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,405
- Yours?
- Yeah.

851
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,140
Look, you've got it all wrong
about Dennis.

I've nothing whatsoever against Dennis.
You love him, he loves you.

853
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,042
I'm happy for both of you.
Just don't bring me into it.

854
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,340
Yeah, no, but there's something I need
to tell you about Dennis.

855
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,460
You are going to have to pay for that
now that you've touched it.

856
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,140
- It's mine!
- No, it isn't.

857
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,620
Look, I heard what you
said to each other, Neil.

858
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,980
Yeah, look. There's something crucial
about Dennis you don't know.

859
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,081
- SHOPKEEPER: Hey!
- He's not a man.

860
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,361
I don't want to hear this, Neil.

861
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,820
I know, but I'm just saying,
he's not a man.

862
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,763
Ow! Ah! Hell's tits!

863
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,220
- You pervert!
- Ow!

864
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,740
You come in here and steal our stuff?

865
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,820
I told you, that's not your sausage.

866
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,140
- It is my sausage. Give it back.
- Get off. Be careful, be careful.

867
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,740
- Just let go!
- Oh, God!

868
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,411
- Give me 80p.
- Fine.

869
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,980
- I'll just get your change.
- No, it's... Never mind. It's...

870
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,340
Well, no, cos it's £4.20.

871
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,442
- Keep it.
- It's too much for a tip.

872
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,450
- Have it your way.
- I should think so, too. Jesus.

873
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,285
Feck. Sausage, become Ray.

874
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,403
Jesus, Neil. Have you any idea
how vulnerable a sausage feels?

875
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,886
There he is!

876
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,930
RAY: I'm off!

877
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,761
- Leave me alone, you nutters!
- (MISS PRINGLE) Ray! Ray!

878
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,400
Here you go. You must have been hungry.

879
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,808
It's clear he has no idea of doing
any good whatsoever.

880
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,940
Why can't we just get on
with the destruction?

881
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,100
(KINDLY ALIEN)
Because there are rules, Maureen.

882
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,020
We must follow galactic procedure.

883
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,808
Rules didn't stop you from eating
the inhabitants of G4378, Janet!

884
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,082
(KINDLY ALIEN) They were delicious.
Very crunchy, as I recall...

885
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,649
- Surprise, surprise!
- Oh, my God!

886
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,808
- No!
- Wait. Wait, wait. Catherine!

887
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,401
You're crazy, do you know that?

888
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,080
(GRANT GRUNTING) Crazy in love, darlin'.

889
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,060
Get out of my flat, Grant.

890
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,650
Well, I can't because
you've locked the door now, babe.

891
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,540
Well, then, get out the way you got in.

892
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,849
Oh, honey, come on, now.
That ain't nice! (POUNDING ON DOOR)

893
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,169
Just get out, Grant.
I never want to see you again!

894
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,900
Get out of my life!

895
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,650
Get out!

896
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,220
Come on, now, open the door.

897
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,800
- Sorry. Sorry about the noise.
- (GRANT GRUNTING AND POUNDING DOOR)

898
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,340
At least it wasn't barking.

899
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,260
Feck off. Not you.

900
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,860
- Walk out the front door, okay?
- GRANT: Honey!

901
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,860
Then sneak in the back.
Make your way up to my place. No moves.

902
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,420
- No, no, no funny business.
- GRANT: Come on. Let the love shine through.

903
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,820
You can just stay out of his way

904
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,843
- and I will make you dinner.
- GRANT: Love me!

905
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,209
- I hate doors!
- All right.

906
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,740
But invite Dennis.
We'll behave like grown-ups.

907
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,524
- GRANT: Catherine?
- Okay.

908
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,369
- GRANT: Catherine, come back.
- I'm leaving!

909
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,644
(GRANT POUNDING) Okay. I'm coming!
Hold on. Wait for me, now.

910
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,723
(GRANT GRUNTING)

911
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,780
(SING-SONG VOICE)
She's coming to dinner!

912
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,260
(PRESENTER ON TV)
This episode looks at doggy fantasies.

913
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,700
Whoa. Hey! It was just about to start.

914
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,860
She's coming to dinner.

915
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,260
- Who?
- Catherine.

916
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,044
Oh, the bitch.

917
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,881
Don't call her that, all right?
I don't want you chipping in, either, okay?

918
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,843
Just pretend to be a dumb animal again.

919
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,571
Me? A dumb animal?

920
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,643
NEIL: Yeah, well, you know
how to pretend, don't you?

921
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,140
It's just... It's called acting.

922
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,083
Oh, you mean like when I'm having
my tummy tickled?

923
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,723
- You love having your tummy tickled.
- No, I don't.

924
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,091
- What?
- It's a sham, Neil. All dogs do it.

925
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,042
- Why?
- Why do humans like tickling dogs' tummies?

926
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,980
Because they love
having their tummies tickled.

927
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,369
Uh-uh. Dogs pretend to like it because
they know human beings like doing it.

928
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,087
(GASPS) Well, just pretend to be
a perfectly ordinary dog, okay?

929
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,500
Can't I join in the conversation
just a little bit?

930
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,922
- No.
- That is so cruel.

931
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,366
(DOORBELL RINGING)

932
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,260
Somebody at the door! Hey! Hey! It's the bell!
It's the bell! It's the bell! It's the bell!

933
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,761
- I know it's the bell, Dennis.
- Right. No, no, sorry.

934
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,407
Just one more peep out of you, okay,
and the flea collar is going back on again.

935
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,020
Right, right, right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

936
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,360
Bark.

937
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,606
Woof.

938
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,451
Do it properly.

939
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,969
- (BARKING)
- Yeah, good. Okay, thank you.

940
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,525
Got it.

941
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,100
- Hi.
- Has he gone?

942
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,565
No, I don't think so.

943
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,883
- Ooh!
- Dennis, down.

944
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,260
You named him after the plumber,
then, did you?

945
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,771
Uh...

946
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,244
Ah. Do you want your tummy tickled?

947
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,246
Why do dogs like that so much?

948
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't know.

949
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,884
(CATHERINE LAUGHING)

950
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,620
So the producer promises to take me
out of the general office

951
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,166
and give me a big desk with a view,
but he won't.

952
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,643
He's just trying to get me into bed.

953
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,844
What did you want to tell me?

954
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,324
Uh, just try this first.

955
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,601
Mmm.

956
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,525
Oh, that's incredible.

957
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,282
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

958
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,100
Mmm. I had no idea you were
such a fantastic cook.

959
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,841
I've... I've... It's unlike anything
I've ever tasted. What is it?

960
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,360
I just said, "Let the soup be the most
amazing thing Catherine has ever tasted,

961
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,300
"unlike anything she's tasted before."

962
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,780
- And it is. (LAUGHING)
- Really?

963
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,843
Really. I can make things happen.
Anything.

964
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,940
That's what I was trying to tell you
this morning, you know?

965
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,300
I wasn't talking to a live-in
homosexual plumber.

966
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,050
I was talking to Dennis.

967
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,848
- The dog?
- Dennis the dog.

968
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,408
- Who answered you back?
- Yeah, because I made him talk.

969
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,567
- Oh.
- With my powers.

970
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,605
Special powers?

971
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,340
I mean, what, you...
You want a bigger desk? You got it.

972
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,249
You want a great view? You got it.

973
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,928
Um... Neil, how long have you had
these special powers?

974
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,340
Well, they came upon me very suddenly.

975
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,762
- Very suddenly?
- Yeah, I was knocked off my bike.

976
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,700
Just ask me to do something, anything.

977
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,088
- Just, you know...
- Listen, Neil, it's... It's okay.

978
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,180
You can get help with this.

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,811
Shit, Grant!

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,081
DENNIS: I'm out of here!

983
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,540
- There's nobody else, huh?
- Who is this guy?

984
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,860
She didn't tell you? I'm her fiancé.

985
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,644
- You're not my fiancé, Grant.
- Oh, yeah?

986
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,020
And you weren't just making out
with this apology of a man?

987
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,406
Stop this.

988
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,340
You know how long you'd last
on a battlefield, soldier?

989
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,540
I'm sorry, Neil.

990
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,722
- (SNAPS FINGERS) That long.
- I'm warning you.

- You're warning me?
- Yeah, I'm warning you.

- Why don't you suck on this, asshole?
- Grant!

994
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,380
All I have to do is go like this and...
And say what?

995
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,802
- Where did you find this fruitcake?
- Put that away, Grant.

996
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,060
Uh, what can I say?
Grant, become a fairy?

997
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,640
It's Grant, not...
(BRITISH ACCENT) ...Grant.

998
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,728
- Stop it.
- And you're the goddamn fairy.

999
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,700
How about Grant go back
to where you came from?

1000
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,201
- It's Grant.
- How about kiss my arse, Grant?

1001
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,940
Neil, don't. He's crazy.

1002
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,620
How about you say, "Please, Grant,
don't put a bullet through my brain?"

1003
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,611
- Grant, stop it!
- I prefer, "Let all bullets bounce off me."

1004
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,380
- Go on, shoot me.
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.

1005
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,540
- He doesn't dare.
- Neil, please, please.

1006
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,220
Go on, pull the trigger.
What's the matter, "Grant"?

1007
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,651
- Shut up.
- Go on, shoot me.

1008

- Neil, he will.
- No, he won't.

1009
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,220
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't. Grant, drop the gun.

1010

- You little shit!
- (SHRIEKS)

1011

You're idiots, both of you.

1012

throw yourself at Grant?

No. Look, you did what you had to do.
It worked. Forgotten.

1182

Well, what is it, then?

1183
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,761
Do you know what it feels like
to be in someone else's power?

1184
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,370
To have no will of your own?

1185
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,526

1191

he is unavailable for comment

A short time ago, scientists were afraid
of constantly rising global temperatures.
