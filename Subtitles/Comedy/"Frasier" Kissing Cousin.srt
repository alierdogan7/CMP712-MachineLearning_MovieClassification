1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,100
Frasier:  Well, it's official.  Once again,
there is no room for me at the

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,100
Yo-Yo Ma Orchestral Fantasy Camp.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,300
Hello.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,200
Roz:  Frasier, this is my cousin Jen.
She's visiting this week remember?

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Frasier:  Oh, yes, of course.
So how are you enjoying Seattle?

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,300
Jen:  Well, I've been living in London,
so Seattle seems a little lame.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
No offense.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,800
Frasier:
Oh, none taken.  So you like London?

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Jen:  Not really.
It's like a parody of itself.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Frasier:  
How so?

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Jen:  Oh, you know, double decker buses, bobbies,
little pubs.  It's like EPCOT but even fakier.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,300
So I bailed.
Went and spent some time in Florence.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
Frasier:  Ah, Firenze.  How is she?

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,600
Jen:  I gotta say, Florence is over.
It was probably cool,

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,300
before all the Americans found
out about it.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Frasier:  You mean three hundred years ago?

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Jen:  Exactly.That's why I'm going to Vietnam.
Americans have never even heard of it.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,000
Frasier:  Ah.  Well, you know, I'm afraid I have
to bail on this conversation,

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,800
I have a show to prepare for. Roz,
when are we doing those promos?  This evening?

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
Roz:  Oh, I had to reschedule those 'cause
Jen and I are goin' out tonight!

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,100
Jen:  A guy I met on the internet is in a band.
We're going to go check

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
them out, have a few drinks, watch all the losers.
Wanna come?

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,300
Frasier:  While no stranger to the discothèque,
I'm afraid it will have to

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Be you and Roz this evening.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,500
Jen:  This is our first time going out since
I was a kid.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,400
When she used To baby-sit me, she was always
dragging me on some wild adventure.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Like that time we changed
the sign from "SCHOOL ASSEMBLY" to "COOL ASS"?

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
Roz:  Oh, my God.
Frasier:  Charming.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,800
Jen:  No, you don't understand.
The town we grew up in, was totally boring.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,600
It was like Kill Yourself, USA, right?
Roz was the only person who did anything fun.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Frasier:  Is that so?

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Jen:  Yeah.  My mom calls me "Roz Junior,"
which is what passes for wit where we come from.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,400
Roz:  And, our town has the world's...

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,300
Together:  FOURTH LARGEST THERMOMETER!

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,700
Frasier:  Yes, well,
I can see why London really let you down.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Kenny:  Hey, Doc.
Frasier:  Hi, Kenny.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,400
Kenny:  Remember last month when you spent your
whole show talking to that pregnant teenager?

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,100
Frasier:  Yes.

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Kenny:  Well, it wasn't a total waste.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,500
We just got nominated for an Excellence
in Broadcasting Decency Award.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,800
Frasier:  Really?  Well, that is quite an honor.
I don't think we've ever won one of those.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,600
It's a very prestigious award.That's what makes
it so special when they call your name.

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,800
You know,
it's heavier than it looks.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
You don't want to drop one of those on your foot,
let me tell you.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,100
Frasier:  So you won one.

46
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,000
Kenny:  Yeah, it's in a box in my office.
You can come by sometime and I'll show you.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,900
Frasier:  Honestly, Kenny,
when are you going to unpack those boxes?

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,800
Isn't Four years enough time to make that
office your own?

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,700
Kenny:  Negatory, Doc.
Every time I unpack in a new job, I get fired.

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,500
Tacoma, Moline, Moline again...
I learned my lesson;

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
those boxes stay packed.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Frasier:  So that's why you haven't unpacked.
You know, all this time,

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,100
I've been using you on my radio show as
an example of procrastination.

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,300
I had no idea you were just living in fear.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Kenny:  I prefer to see it as a
healthy superstition.

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,300
Frasier:  Kenny, there's no such
thing as a healthy superstition.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,400
Kenny:  Oh yeah?  What do you call washing
your hands after you go to the bathroom?

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
Frasier:  Look at this place.  Dad,

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't believe you've thrown out a single
paper since Daphne moved in with Niles.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,900
Martin:  Hey, it was your idea to split up
the chores.  Recycling is your deal.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Recycling and floors, remember?
I'm in charge of regular garbage and tabletops,

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,700
both of which are nicely
under control, I might add.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Frasier:  Really?  I count three snack plates
around your chair, all of them on tabletops.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,600
Martin:  Not anymore.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,100
Frasier:  All right, what's it gonna take for
you to start doing your share

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
of the work around here?

67
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,900
Martin:
Trade me floors for garbage.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,900
Frasier:  You'll really take care of all
the floors if I handle the garbage?

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,000
Martin:  That's right.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Frasier:  Okay.  Okay, you got a deal, Mister.

71
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Frasier:  Hi, Daph.

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,500
Daphne:  Hello.  Why's all your garbage
stacked up in the hallway?

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Martin:  That's right, why is that, Frasier?

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
Frasier:  Your game is deep.

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,100
Daphne:  My, things are a bit untidy around here,
aren't they?

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Maybe I'll Just clean up these dishes
before we get started.

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,900
Frasier:  Daphne, you don't have to do that.
Martin:  That's true.  You're not our slave anymore.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Daphne:  I'm not gonna do all of it,
just the tabletops.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Martin:  Aw, that's sweet of you.

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,100
Martin:  Burn.

81
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Frasier:  No, no.

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,600
Niles:  Well, there's room at Roz's table.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Frasier:  No!  I find her cousin Jen just a bit
judgmental for my taste.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,700
Yesterday she told me my show was bourgeois.

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,000
I pointed out that anything that had mass
appeal could be said to be bourgeois.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,900
She then said that my argument was bourgeois.
Which I found to be on tabletops.

87
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,700
Niles:  People in their twenties are always like that.
The world is so daunting at that age.

88
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,300
They comfort themselves with the
idea that everything's just trash.

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,400
We were like that in medical school.

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,700
Acting as if we were above it all,
smarter than everybody.It passes.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,900
Niles:  Hello, Roz.

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,000
Roz:  Niles, Frasier!

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,300
Frasier:  Hi, Roz.

94
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Roz:  Come join us.  Jen, this is Niles.

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Niles:  Pleased to meet you.

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
Jen:  "Niles", whoa.  Thanks Mom and Dad, right?

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,100
Frasier:  Well, Jen, good to see you again.
So, how was our night out,girls?

98
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,600
Roz:  Well, it's still goin' on!
We went to this really great club called Zoo.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Frasier:  Excuse me, The Zoo?

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Roz:  No, it was just called Zoo.

101
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
[Jen lets out a snort.]

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,000
Jen:  Huh, "The".

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
[She and Roz laugh.]

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
Frasier:  Roz, is that glitter in your hair?

105
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,600
Roz:  Oh, is it?
I thought it all came out in the car wash.

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,300
Jen:  Oh, that's mine.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,300
Hello? ... Oh, Anka.You won't believe
what huge Seattle cliche I'm in right now. ...

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,300
only cool person in this whole city.
The rest are just drones.

109
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,200
Apparently they don't believe in raw sugar.

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,200
Excuse me.

111
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,700
Frasier:  You see what I mean about her.

112
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,000
Niles:  She's struggling through a typical
phase of development.  Stop being so sensitive.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Jen:  Sorry about that.

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,400
Niles:  Not at all.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,700
Jen:  So, tell me about you guys.
Roz says you're super competitive with each other.

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,800
Did your parents
withhold affection or is just the penis thing?

117
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Niles:   Uh,
I'll take mine to go.

118
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Coming up next, This Day in Psychological History.
After the news.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,700
Roz:  It was a good show, Frasier.

120
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,900
Frasier:  It's not over Roz, this is just a break.

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,200
Roz:  I'm sorry, I'm so exhausted.
I haven't slept since Jen got here.

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,500
Jen:  Hey, Roz, wanna go watch some
backyard wrestling tonight?

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,800
Roz:  I don't know.
Maybe we should stay in tonight...rent a video?

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,500
Jen:  Rent a video?  You're turning into
Aunt Mirabelle.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,100
All you need is a beanbag ashtray
and a tracheotomy.

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Roz:  Well, I'm not there yet. I just thought that
maybe you could use a night off.

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,000
Frasier:  Say there, Jen, did you have a chance
to explore that art gallery I suggested?

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Jen:  Yeah.  I know you're into that stuff so
I don't want to put it down.

129
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,100
But it was like everything in therewas trying to
make us feel better about our corrupt,

130
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
Frasier:  They're landscapes.

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Jen:  But I picked up something
for you on the way over here.

132
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,600
Frasier:    Really?

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,100
Jen:  Mm-hm.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,300
Frasier:  Well... a bust of Freud.
Well, that's really quite thoughtful of you.

135
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Jen:  I figured you'd appreciate the irony.

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,200
Since he's been proven wrong about
practically everything.

137
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,000
Frasier:  I like to think that Freud's theories
will withstand the test of time.

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,300
Jen:  Really?  Have you read either of his books?

139
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
Frasier:  Excuse me, young lady...

140
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Jen:  Uh-oh, here comes the lecture.

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Frasier:  Yes, for once you are right,
for a disquisition is indeed at hand.

142
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,600
And may I suggest you roll your eyes
back into the forward position,

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
as I may actually employ some visual aids.
Now,

144
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,200
ourstory begins with a young Greek woman of
the name Clytemnestra...

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Roz:  Look, everybody, Kenny's here!

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,500
Kenny:  Wow, I've never heard that before.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
Roz:
Jen, maybe Kenny can show you around the station.

148
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
Jen: You already showed me
around the station yesterday.

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Roz:  Yeah, but you know what?  I totally
forgot to show you our ratings binders.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Kenny:  You did?
Roz:  Yeah.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,900
Kenny:  Well, then you're in for a treat.

152
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,300
Jen:  What's that trophy for?

153
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,200
Kenny:  Oh, a little series I produced
called "Life Is My Favorite Drug of All".

154
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Jen:  Sounds pretty lame.

155
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Kenny:   Yeah, it was.

156
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Frasier:  All right, that girl is really
getting under my skin.  When is she leaving?

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
Roz:  She's not that bad.

158
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
Frasier:
Oh, come on, Roz, she's running you ragged.

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,400
Roz:  Oh, please, this is nothing.
I used to party every night.

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,900
Frasier:
Well, sure, at twenty you can do anything.

161
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,600
Roz:  Hey,
there's still a lot of candy left in this pinata.

162
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,500
Frasier:  That's attractive.

163
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,300
Roz:  Thank you.

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,300
Kenny:  And this is my office.

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,900
The nerve center.
Where it all gdoes down.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
Jen:  Did you just move in here or something?

167
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Kenny:  Oh, no.  No,but in AM radio
you've got to be ready to go in a moment's notice.

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,800
One day you're operating a fifty thousand watt powerhouse in Cleveland,

169
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,100
the next your spinning platters
out of a barn in Tulsa Town.

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,600
You've gotta keep movin',
it's all about the music.

171
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,700
When it isn't about news and talk.

172
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Jen:  I heard AM radio is dead.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Kenny:  Yeah, it is.  So,
you're going to Vietnam?

174
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,100
Jen:  I'm thinking about it.

175
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Kenny:  That's such an original choice.
You're so cool.

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,900
Jen:  You're the first person that hasn't
thought I was totally crazy for wanting to go there.

177
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,700
Kenny:  Oh, what do they know?
I've always loved the idea of just taking off.

178
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
You know, seeing someplace exotic.

179
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,800
Jen:  Why haven't you?

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
Kenny:  My wife.  She didn't like to travel.

181
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,700
Jen:  But you just said you were separated.
So do it.  Blow all of it off,

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,700
go to Vietnam.  Break out of this prison cell.

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Kenny:  I could, couldn't I?  You know,
I could just be free.   Just get a motorcycle,

184
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,700
drive around the countryside,
really start to live.

185
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,300
Jen:  I never even thought of the motorcycle.
Now you have to do it.

186
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,600
Kenny:  People would think I was nuts.

187
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,000
Jen:  I wouldn't.

188
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,700
Frasier:  When Freud's genius has OBVIOUSLY
influenced every psychiatrist on

189
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
the planet...

190
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Frasier:  I haven't forgotten about you, callers.
Stay tuned, won't you?

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Roz:  I'm starting to feel guilty
about pawning Jen off on Kenny like that.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,100
He's been a little down lately,
and Jen can be a little, well, negative sometimes.

193
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Frasier:  I hadn't noticed.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,100
Roz:  I just hope she doesn't send him
spiraling down into some  kind of depression.

195
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,700
Jen:  So, Seattle still loves the Walkman, huh?
He's probably listening to "Thriller".

196
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
So, do you still want to go to
that warehouse party tonight?

197
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,600
Doors open at eleven, so we should
probably be there at one.

198
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,700
Roz:  Look, I wish I could Jen,
but I really have to sleep.

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,600
Jen:  Don't worry, we'll have a few cocktails
and you'll feel a lot better.

200
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
Roz:  Forget it, I am not drinking again tonight.

201
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,300
Jen:  So just drink beer.  I mean,
Alice is still at her grandparent's,right?

202
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Roz:  Listen sweety,
why don't you go out by yourself tonight.

203
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Jen:  Oh, come on, Mirabelle, have some fun.

204
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Roz:  Don't do that.

205
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Jen:  Do what, Mirabelle?

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,100
Roz:  Knock it off, I'm serious.

207
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,200
Jen:  You used to be so fun,
but ever since you've got the condo and the SUV,

208
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,200
you're all 401(k) or whatever.

209
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,100
Roz:  I'm exactly the same person I've always been.

210
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,900
Jen:  Oh, yeah?  I checked your car radio.
It's not stuck on that classic rock station.

211
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,200
Roz:  For your information,
classic rock is both classic and it rocks.

212
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
Jen:  What happened to you?
Roz:  I'm old!

213
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,600
Frasier:  Daphne, would you get that?

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Niles:  Sorry I'm late, I...

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Niles:  What's going on?

216
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,100
Frasier:  Uh-oh.

217
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,600
Martin:  Steady...

218
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,600
Daphne:  Your father and brother
needed a little help.The oven's all clean,

219
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,600
I just have a bit of ironing left,
I won't be a minute.

220
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,700
And don't forget:
I've drawn baths for both of you.

221
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Niles:  Are you proud of yourselves?

222
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
Frasier:  We didn't ask her to do anything.
Martin:  She offered.

223
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,600
Niles:
Then why is no one looking me in the eye?

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,000
Frasier:  I'm sorry, Niles, you're right.
Maybe we took advantage.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Martin:  Absolutely.  We're way out of line,
it won't happen again.

226
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,900
-Niles:  What are you doing?
-Martin:  What?

227
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,800
-Niles:  Are you going to leave that there?
-Martin:  I'll clean it later.

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Niles:  Well, that's the whole problem.If you
would just clean as you go,things wouldn't pile up,

229
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,700
you wouldn't need Daphne's help.
-Martin:  I guess.

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Niles:
No, it's true, look at this.  Look how easy.

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,600
See?  Small, consistent efforts, that's what
it takes. just like managing one's cuticles.

232
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,100
[calling]  You know, there's a bowl of
potato salad laying out,completely uncovered.

233
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,500
Martin:  It's getting tangy.

234
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Niles:  The plastic wrap is right here.

235
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,300
Frasier:  We really should help him.

236
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,900
Martin:  Are you nuts?
He's about to make us dinner.

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,500
Frasier:  He is not.

238
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,200
Martin:  Twenty bucks says he is.

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
Frasier:  Forget money.
Let's wager something real.

240
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,200
Martin:  All right, if I get him to make dinner,
you do all the chores.  If I don't, I'll do 'em.

241
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Daphne:  I'm ready, Niles.

242
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Niles:    Excellent,

243
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,400
because tonight I am taking you to the finest bistroin
the Pacific Northwest.

244
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Frasier:  You're on!

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,200
Martin:  Take your sweet time, why don't you?!
[calling out]  Hey, guys,

246
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Are you sure you don't want to stick around?
I was just going to open a can of spaghetti.

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,400
Niles:   But, you have sea bass in the fridge.

248
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
Martin:  Oh, it'll probably last another day.

249
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,200
Niles:  Oh, I think you should cook it tonight.

250
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,600
Martin:  Fine.  I'll nuke it with some ketchup.

251
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Niles:  That's ridiculous.
You can't use your turkey recipe on fish.

252
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Martin:  Well, what am I supposed to do?

253
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,100
Niles:  Well, just take one clove of garlic,
two tablespoons of finely

254
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
minced fresh ginger... Oh, for

255
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
heaven's sake, I'll do it myself.

256
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,600
Daphne:  I suppose I'll lay the table.

257
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
Martin:No, no Daphne.You've done enough for today.
That's Frasier's job.

258
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,100
Frasier:  [v.o.] And so for our final hour today,
I'd like to focus on First-time callers only.

259
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,900
We've heard a lot of familiar voices this
week and I'd like to shake it up...

260
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,100
-Jen:  Hey.
-Kenny:  Hey.

261
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,800
Kenny:  I looked for you at that
warehouse party last night, but I didn't see you.

262
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
Jen:  Oh, I was in the old meat locker.

263
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
Kenny:  Oh, I didn't look in there.

264
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,700
Jen:  Sorry we didn't hook up.
Did I leave my sunglasses in here?

265
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
Kenny:  Oh, yes, you did.

266
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,800
So, I'm taking off.I had a really cool time with you.
I hope you make your break from here soon.

267
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,200
Kenny:  Good news.  I just got off the phone with
my travel agent.  She got me this great fare to

268
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,100
Ho Chi Minh City and she said it'd be no
problem to get you on the same flight.

269
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
This is gonna be awesome!

270
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,700
I've never seen Asia before.
I've seen the band, of course, but not,you know...

271
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,900
Jen:  Oh, well, about that, Kenny, um,
I already booked a flight.

272
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,300
Kenny:  Oh, well maybe I can get on your flight.

273
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,600
Jen:  Well, see, the thing is, I travel solo.

274
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,200
Kenny:  Oh.

275
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,600
Jen:  It's kind of a rule I have.
I had this bad experience once...

276
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,300
Kenny:  Oh, no, please.  I totally get
where you're coming from.  Solo's the

277
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
way to go.  My high school French club went
to Montreal once,nightmare!

278
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Jen:  You should still go.
You deserve to have some fun.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Kenny:  Okay.  Yeah.

280
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,500
Well, maybe I'll run into you over there.

281
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700
Jen:  I'd like that.

282
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,900
Frasier:  [v.o.]  Our next caller is Stu,
from Madrona. Go ahead, Stu, I'm listening.

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Stu:  [v.o.]  All right, it's like this:
I've been dating my girlfriend for six years and

284
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,800
she keeps bugging me about movin' in..
But I know as soon as she does,

285
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,000
my freedom is gone.  Everything's gotta
be in the hamper,

286
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,600
I can't eat over the sink, can't just go out
whenever my buddies call, it's a lot to give up.

287
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,500
Frasier:  Okay, Stu, how old are you?

288
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,900
Stu:  The calendar says forty-seven,
but I feel eighteen, right?

289
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Roz:  Forty-seven?!

290
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Frasier:  Now, Roz...

291
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,800
Roz:  I have a suggestion for you, Stu:
Grow the hell up!

292
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,500
Stu:  What?  I'm sorry?

293
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,300
Roz:  I'm thirty-eight.
And I FEEL thirty-eight.

294
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Now, I know we're all supposed to act like
perpetual teenagers these days, but you know

295
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
what?  I like acting my age.

296
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,300
I like being a mom.  I like having a career.

297
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,500
And I like balancing my checkbook! When did it
become such a bad thing to be an adult?!

298
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,100
Stu:  Dr. Crane?  Hello?

299
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,900
Roz:  Now, don't get me wrong,
I had a great time when I was younger, I

300
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,500
I did!  But after a while,
that way of life just seems...empty.

301
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,900
You have to go deeper,and commit to
things that really matter to you.

302
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,700
Believe me, when you do that,

303
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
you'll find out how amazing
and rich life can be.

304
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,600
Stu:  Hey, I know that voice.
You were at Zoo the other night.

305
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
You told me you were twenty-nine.

306
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,600
Frasier:  Thanks for your call, Stu,
let's go to traffic.

307
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Roz:  I'm sorry, Frasier.I guess
