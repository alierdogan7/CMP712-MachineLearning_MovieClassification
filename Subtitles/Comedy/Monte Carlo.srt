was that all...

368
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,719
No ticket? No itinerary?

I am sorry,

Yeah, yeah, Grace, you just
got to pull it together.

you in college?

you a ball in your honor

I couldn't possibly!"

You go.

we are way
out of our league.

help you out with that.

You know what the problem
is with you two?

586
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,353
It's that you are
exactly alike.

what the hell to be

1621
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:47,073
Are you wishing
you were ugly like me?

1622
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,205
Blame it on the girls
who know what to do

1623
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:53,504
Blame it on the boys
who keep hitting on you

1624
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:56,879
Blame it on your mother
for the things she said

1625
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:00,131
Blame it on your father
but you know he's dead

1626
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:03,465
Blame it on the girls

1627
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:06,721
Blame it on the boys

1628
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:10,146
Blame it on the girls

1629
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,475
Blame it on the boys

1630
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:16,731
Blame it on the girls

1631
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:20,031
Blame it on the boys

1632
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,359
Blame it on the girls

1633
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:26,787
Blame it on the boys

1634
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:29,991
Blame it on the girls

1635
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,704
Blame it on the boys

1636
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:36,922
(WHO SAYS PLAYING)

1637
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:42,425
Wouldn't wanna be
anybody else, hey

1638
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:46,765
You made me insecure

1639
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,552
Told me I wasn't good enough

1640
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,512
But who are you to judge

1641
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:54,348
When you're a diamond
in the rough

1642
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,479
I'm sure
you got somethings

1643
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:59,187
You'd like to
change about yourself

1644
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,193
But when it
comes to me

1645
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,445
I wouldn't wanna be
anybody else

1646
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:08,200
(VOCALIZING)

1647
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,623
I'm no beauty queen

1648
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,076
I'm just beautiful me

1649
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:17,664
(VOCALIZING)

1650
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:20,545
You've got every right

1651
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,592
To a beautiful life
Come on!

1652
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:26,013
Who says
Who says you're not perfect

1653
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,216
Who says
you're not worth it

1654
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:32,020
Who says you're the
only one that's hurting

1655
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:35,598
Trust me
That's the price of beauty

1656
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,979
Who says
you're not pretty

1657
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,732
Who says
you're not beautiful

1658
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,438
Who says?

1659
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,786
It's such a funny thing

1660
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:51,364
How nothings funny
when it's you

1661
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:53,745
You tell them
what you mean

1662
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,122
But they keep
whiting out the truth

1663
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,670
It's like a work of art

1664
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:00,919
That never gets
to see the light.

1665
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,342
Keep you
beneath the stars

1666
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,715
Won't let you
touch the sky

1667
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:09,970
(VOCALIZING)

1668
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,434
I'm no beauty queen

1669
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,728
I'm just beautiful me

1670
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:19,309
(VOCALIZING)

1671
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:22,065

To a beautiful life
Come on!

01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,543
Who says you're
not star potential

1681
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,049
Who says you're
not presidential

1682
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,301
Who says you
can't be in movies

1683
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,930
Listen to me
Listen to me

1684
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:55,136
Who says you
don't pass the test

1685
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,472
Who says you
can't be the best

1686
01:47:57,554 --> 01:47:59,682
Who said
