1
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:55,664
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

2
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,362
# Or you'll be alone in a quick #

3
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:02,504
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

4
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,033
# Or you'll never get another fix #

5
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:09,479
# I'm telling you it's not a trick,
pay attention, don't be thick #

6
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:11,175
# Or you're liable to get licked #

7
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,712
# You're gonna see the reason why #

8
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:18,154
# When they're spitting in your eye
they'll be spitting in your eye #

9
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:22,960
# Hang up the chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

10
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:26,953
# Your girl's not a tonic or a pill #

11
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:30,331
# Hang up your chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

12
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,132
# You're just jonesin' for a spill #

13
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:37,239
# Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
when you meet another nurse #

14
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,970
# She'll be drivin' in a hearse #

15
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:44,180
# You're gonna need a heap of glue
when they all catch up with you #

16
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:45,877
# And they cut you up in two. #

17
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:49,318
Freemont power, Freemont pride.
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

18
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,686
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

19
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,691
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

20
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,989
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

21
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,325
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

22
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:01,355
Go Freemont!
(cheering)

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,198
Okay, everybody,
tomorrow after classes

24
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:06,864
make sure that you have your uniforms
picked up from the dry cleaners,

25
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,102
because the bus for the playoffs
is gonna leave at 7:30 a.m.,

26
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,370
The next morning, all right?

27
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,707
- (sighing)
- Oh my God.

28
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:15,838
But the Doughnut Hole has agreed
to donate four dozen doughnuts.

29
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,678
All: Yeah!

30
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,616
Okay, we're gonna kill
the Rangers this year, right?

31
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,744
All: Yeah!

32
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,948
I can't believe you're leaving.

33
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,685
It's just a couple of hours
before you go.

34
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,161
Yeah. Right.
Right.

35
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,789
Aren't you excited?
It's playoffs!

36
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,822
Yeah. Whatever.

37
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:03,927
Come on.

38
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:06,089
I have to get home for dinner.

39
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,463
Please.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,764
Oh, all right.

41
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,014
Father:
That's some beef.

42
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,351
- Mother: And carrots.
- Yummy.

43
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,217
Thank you, Mother.

44
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:32,883
Thanks.

45
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,484
- Thank you, poodle.
- Sure.

46
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,095
Grace.

47
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,621
Father:
Dear Lord,

48
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,157
please bless this food
that we are about to eat.

49
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:48,832
We thank you for the abundance
that You have provided.

50
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:52,275
Please help us to follow Your path,

51
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,144
the one you intended us all to follow.

52
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,513
And Lord...

53
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,785
please help us to obey
the roles in life You set for us.

54
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:08,554
For all that is natural and...

55
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:12,051
healthy...

56
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,088
and sacred,

57
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,362
in Your name we pray.

58
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:19,461
Amen.

59
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:21,631
- Amen.
- Let's eat.

60
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:56,468
(car horn honking)
Bye, dear.

61
00:04:56,508 --> 00:05:00,467
See ya later, swee... I mean tonight.
See you tonight.

62
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,503
Don't forget your
library books by the door.

63
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,538
Got them. Bye.

64
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,978
So... are we ready?

65
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,181
They'll all be here at 3:00.

66
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:13,520
Jesus, I hope we're
doing the right thing.

67
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:15,788
(bell rings)

68
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:18,762
Shaker Hills, here we come.

69
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:21,391
Remember, 7:30 doughnuts.

70
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,394
Boy: Did you talk
to both her parents?

71
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,408
- Girl: She's coming.
- Kill the Rangers.

72
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,838
I'll meet you outside.

73
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,750
Don't you hate it when they do that?

74
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,785
I think it's fun.

75
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:54,822
Maybe he just doesn't do it right.

76
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,731
- See ya.
- Bye.

77
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:19,046
(horn honks)
Speed up, jerk!

78
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,759
Jared?

79
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,922
Why are we going so slow?

80
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:29,297
Sorry.
Zoning, I guess.

81
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:41,840
Mike, thanks so much for coming
all the way back out here again.

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,405
- That's what we're here for.
- Thank you, Mike.

83
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,111
- Now you've watched the video?
- Over and over.

84
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,086
Come in.

85
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,813
(horn honks)

86
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:57,452
Mike:
The important thing is to be clear.

87
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:59,019
And direct.

88
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,294
But to do it lovingly.

89
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:03,095
We're not accusing,

90
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,396
we're supporting.

91
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,404
I think I hear the car.

92
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,398
Uh-oh. Here they come.

93
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,986
Surprise.

94
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,252
What happened?
Is somebody dead?

95
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,193
They're your favorite.

96
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:33,925
Now, why don't you just
come on in and sit down, honey?

97
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,796
What's going on?

98
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,199
Hi, Megan.

99
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,362
My name is Mike.

100
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:43,431
Your parents and your friends
want to have a conversation with you,

101
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:46,774
and I'm here to help
facilitate that dialogue.

102
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,109
So why don't we start
by sitting down,

103
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:51,615
and making ourselves
comfortable?

104
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,640
How would that be?

105
00:07:58,156 --> 00:07:59,453
Now, Peter,

106
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,892
would you like to start
the conversation?

107
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,725
Megan, we love you.

108
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,221
We all love you.

109
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,929
And lately we've become
concerned about

110
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,201
certain behaviors.

111
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,539
We're afraid you're being
influenced by...

112
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:21,136
a way of thinking.

113
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,079
Unnatural...

114
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:25,048
Do you remember the woman on TV?

115
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,482
Honey, we think you're a...

116
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,917
(whispers)
Lesbian.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,651
Huh?

118
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:35,756
I myself was once a gay.

119
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:39,286
Now I'm an ex-gay, Megan.

120
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,788
I work for a place
called True Directions

121
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,769
who help people, like yourself,

122
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,534
to learn to understand
the reasons behind

123
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,973
homosexual tendencies,

124
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,136
and how to heal them.

125
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:58,115
What tendencies?
Why would you think I'm a...

126
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,585
You've been trying
to make us eat this tofu.

127
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,644
In diet, watch for a switch to

128
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,349
vegetarianism.

129
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,120
You don't have any pictures
of guys in your locker,

130
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,524
just these.

131
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,358
Mm-hmm.

132
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:12,693
And these.

133
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,958
Sexual,

134
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:17,957
even vaginal motifs
in artwork and decorating.

135
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,970
Gay iconography.

136
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:25,603
You don't even like to kiss me.

137
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:26,632
It's true.

138
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,144
I can't believe this.

139
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,241
Denial is a normal part
of the healing process

140
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,445
that we'll explore

141
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:37,852
at True Directions.

142
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:40,881
- Healing?
- Like rehab, honey.

143
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:43,018
Homosexuals Anonymous.

144
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,723
Poodle, it's only for a few months.

145
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:49,665
There is no way I'm going.

146
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,350
Mother: Let's go.

147
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,157
Now.

148
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,338
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

149
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:10,973
I'm Mary,
I'm the founder of True Directions.

150
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,449
- And you must be Megan?
- Yes.

151
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:15,816
- This is my son, Rock.
- Mother: Hi.

152
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,821
Pleasure to meet you, Megan.

153
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:21,052
Looks like we got you just in time.

154
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,650
What are you, about 17?

155
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:25,219
- Yes.
- Almost lost her to college.

156
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,288
It's so much harder
once they've been through

157
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,664
all that liberal arts brainwashing.

158
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,896
But we've saved a few.

159
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,494
I'll take her from here.

160
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,667
Well. Come along.

161
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,206
Mother:
They seem like nice people.

162
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,238
(car starts)

163
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:50,444
(honks)

164
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,557
The others arrived yesterday,
so why don't I catch you up?

165
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:05,626
It's a two-month program
based on five simple steps.

166
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,003
Why don't we concentrate
on the first step:

167
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,838
You admitting your problem.

168
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,400
When you see a woman,

169
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:15,344
in a tight skirt,

170
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,245
and long,

171
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:18,805
beautiful legs,

172
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,216
or perhaps
she's in the bathroom,

173
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,278
putting lipstick
over her full lips...

174
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:26,187
or maybe in the locker room,

175
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,953
soaping her body...

176
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:30,324
rubbing her breasts...

177
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,295
you don't have any
unnatural thoughts?

178
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,195
I don't think it's unnatural.

179
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,757
Ah-ha! You see?

180
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,065
You don't even think it's wrong.

181
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,936
Until you admit your sickness,
you will wear these.

182
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:43,964
You will earn the right
to wear civvies

183
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:45,475
once you have admitted

184
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,307
the first step.

185
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:50,906
It's a long path
to righteousness, Megan.

186
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:53,041
And it's a battlefield
of temptation out there,

187
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,052
and you're going
to have to fight.

188
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,383
Until then,

189
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,879
I'd like you to meet
one of our other soldiers.

190
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,221
Hilary.

191
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,687
Megan, this is Hilary.

192
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,560
She will show you around.

193
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:10,055
And, well, you'll get acquainted.

194
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:14,304
Okay.
Rise and shine at 7:00.

195
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:16,135
Breakfast at 8:00,

196
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:19,109
Group therapy until lunch.

197
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:22,840
Now in the afternoon
we have free time to do,

198
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,372
you know, whatever,
and then we move inside

199
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,352
for reorientating exercises.

200
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:32,185
Family therapy on the weekends.

201
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,687
You didn't miss much, really.

202
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,124
Oh.

203
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,931
This is where we sleep.

204
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,770
But there's no inappropriate
behavior allowed.

205
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:52,207
Inappropriate?

206
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,471
Like swearing?

207
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,775
No. Inappropriate like fucking.

208
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:56,871
Oh.

209
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,142
You get caught
in the throes of sodomy,

210
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,412
and au revoir.

211
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:13,389
Never mind Graham,
she's a spoiled brat.

212
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:15,331
I read her chart.

213
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,667
Step one was easy,

214
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:22,070
admitting you're a homosexual.

215
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:25,303
See, we all passed yesterday.

216
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:34,284
I'm a homosexual.

217
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,309
See how easy it is?

218
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:48,364
Megan, meet the rest of our group.

219
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,699
Hi, Megan.

220
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:54,193
I'm Jan,
and I'm a softball player,

221
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:55,967
and I'm a homosexual.

222
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:01,177
I'm Sinead.
I like pain.

223
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:02,702
I'm a homosexual.

224
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,944
I'm Joel.
I'm a Jew.

225
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:08,717
And a...

226
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:10,277
ho...

227
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,347
homosexual.

228
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:17,620
- We met.
- Graham.

229
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:19,653
I'm Graham, and I like girls,

230
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,722
a lot.

231
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,199
I'm a homosexual.

232
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,236
Andre.
Actor. Dancer.

233
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,206
Homosexual.

234
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:32,903
Dolph. Homosexual.
Varsity wrestler.

235
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:35,003
How you doin'?

236
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:38,709
Hi. I'm Clayton Dunn.
I work in retail,

237
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,717
and I'm a homosexual.

238
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,514
It's time for your first disclosure.

239
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,887
Now don't be intimidated.

240
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:49,392
Why don't you start by telling us

241
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:53,056
about the first time that you realized
that you might be a lesbian?

242
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,587
I'm not.

243
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,829
Everyone just thinks I am.

244
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,731
I shouldn't even be here.

245
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,409
That's a perfectly
normal place to start.

246
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,210
Why don't we discuss
the issues in your intervention?

247
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:16,581
I'm a vegetarian.

248
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:17,986
All: Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:20,823
I have pictures of women around.

250
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,759
- You think that's normal?
- Sure.

251
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,493
I never really thought about it.

252
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,158
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

253
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,864
Yes. For two years
we've been going steady.

254
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:37,362
I really love him.
He's smart and popular.

255
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:40,434
He's got the biggest dick
I've never seen.

256
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,207
Well, um...

257
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,409
have you ever had sex with him?

258
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,882
I'm a Christian.

259
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,284
It's really easy to be a prude
when you're not attracted to him, isn't it?

260
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,016
He's very handsome.

261
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,752
But does he make you hot?

262
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,590
Do you think of him
at night when you...

263
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,823
I'm not perverted.

264
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,799
I get good grades.
I go to church.

265
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,596
I'm a cheerleader.

266
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,766
I'm not like all of you.

267
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:11,400
Everyone reads "Cosmo."
Everyone looks at other girls.

268
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,069
All the time.

269
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,102
You only assume that they're thinking
what you're thinking when they look.

270
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,978
But they're not.

271
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,011
Freemont power. Freemont pride.

272
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,079
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

273
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,454
Go Freemont!

274
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,926
I thought everybody
had those thoughts.

275
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:35,926
I just want to be normal.

276
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,264
Then you admit
you're not normal.

277
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,167
So why don't you admit

278
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,695
you are a homosexual?

279
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,802
(voices echoing)

280
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,538
Both:
You hug us way too much.

281
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,482
Hilary:
Step one was easy.

282
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,314
You don't even like to kiss me.

283
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,382
You put your hand up my skirt.

284
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:01,050
- Homosexual
- I think it's foul.

285
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,661
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

286
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:07,528
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

287
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,897
I'm a homosexual.

288
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:16,362
I'm a homosexual.
I'm a homosexual.

289
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,534
Congratulations, Megan.

290
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,840
You have just taken your first step

291
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,176
in your true direction!

292
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,876
(clapping)

293
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:31,421
I'm a homosexual.

294
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,254
Okay.

295
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,851
Go on now.

296
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,660
Don't worry, Megan.
It's gonna be okay.

297
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:47,934
No.

298
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,872
Here. Put these on.

299
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,312
Oh my God.

300
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:03,777
They were right.

301
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm a homo.

302
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,890
Oh my God.

303
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:24,738
Congratulations on
your first step, pom-pom.

304
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,141
Don't listen to her.

305
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,743
She's just upset
'cause the fish on her plate

306
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:36,980
is the only kind she can eat.

307
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:40,616
I can't wait to be straight.
I've always wanted to be.

308
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,387
It's cool to finally talk about it.

309
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:44,587
I can't tell any of my
friends on the team.

310
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:45,925
Maybe you have
the wrong friends.

311
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:48,591
I think we should all be
supporting each other.

312
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,100
Really, princess. Do you
want to start the kumbayas?

313
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:01,873
Hi Mom.

314
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,174
The flowers are pretty.

315
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,205
I know.

316
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:10,113
I noticed that we sprung
another leak in the ceiling.

317
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:12,213
I'd like for you
to get to it tonight.

318
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:13,985
I'll get to it, Mom.
Jesus.

319
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,226
Ow! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

320
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,785
Look.
Not in my presence.

321
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,297
I have told you
over and over again.

322
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:25,098
No more sipping.
Chug it, like a man.

323
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,126
Go on. Chug.

324
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,232
There.

325
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,970
Try and get to that tonight.

326
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:46,685
(sighs)

327
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,819
(electronic buzzing,
soft moaning)

328
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:06,732
Yeah.

329
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,712
Sorry, it's just me.
What are you doing?

330
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:15,810
AV, what's it to ya?

331
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,684
AV? What's that?

332
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:20,315
Aversion therapy, stupid.

333
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,222
So what does that mean?

334
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,717
When you have inappropriate
fantasies about girls,

335
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:28,630
you shock yourself with this shocker.
(buzzes)

336
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,999
So every time you think of them,
you feel that pain.

337
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:33,435
That's sick.

338
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,098
No pain, no gain, baby.
You want to like dick?

339
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,335
You better start training yourself.

340
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,536
Hey, isn't that Graham's sock?

341
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:43,342
None of your damn business.

342
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:52,080
(buzzing continues)

343
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:58,552
Megan.

344
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,587
You have a phone call.

345
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,155
Hello?

346
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,030
Mother:
Megan, it's Mom and Dad.

347
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:07,196
We know it's after lights out,
but we miss you so much.

348
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:10,536
Father: We just wanted to know
how our little poodle is doing.

349
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,371
I'm doing okay.

350
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:13,876
You were right,

351
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,845
I am a homosexual.

352
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,938
But I'll be regular soon.

353
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:20,507
Father: Oh, that Mary
is pretty good then, huh?

354
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:22,143
Mm-hmm, and Mike
and all others.

355
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,813
I'm already starting step two.

356
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:26,584
Father: We're so glad,
and after all that money.

357
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,888
Mother: We can't wait
to see you up there at graduation,

358
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:31,656
to have you home,
so we can all be together again.

359
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:32,719
Father:
Just remember we love you.

360
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:35,197
We would do anything for our Megan
to have a normal life,

361
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:37,291
- and if you need anything...
- Mother: We'd better go.

362
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:38,460
Now you hang in there.

363
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:40,436
- Stay strong!
- Sweet dreams.

364
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,905
You too, Daddy.
See you at family therapy.

365
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,407
I love you.

366
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:48,868
And forward.

367
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:52,040
Backwards and forwards,

368
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:55,745
and backwards.
In a very clean line...

369
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:57,913
- you go in, and you go out,

370
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:00,048
And you go up
and you go down.

371
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,490
Girls, is everybody
paying attention here?

372
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:07,020
And you go in and out,
and in and out,

373
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,691
and in and out...

374
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:11,530
Get into every little crevice.

375
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:14,128
And in and out.

376
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,002
And you slip in...

377
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,099
and out...

378
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:21,111
add a little more oil,
and shove it in,

379
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,578
and take it out.

380
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:24,342
Put some muscle into it.

381
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:27,578
Shove it in and out.

382
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:31,110
And shove it in,
and take it out.

383
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,884
Okay, who wants
to go down with me?

384
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:39,293
# Climb before you hide #

385
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,661
# Then fool your pride #

386
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,862
# 'Cause we'll be waiting for ya #

387
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:49,100
# I go back to zero Henry #

388
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:53,007
# I see what you think you saw #

389
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:58,037
# When you passed me in the hall #

390
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:02,644
# I was... #

391
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:06,952
# There you go you're getting over #

392
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,427
# Tap an old friend on the shoulder #

393
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:15,899
# Penny fines for leaving empties #

394
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:20,734
# Lose your mind,
you're just like Henry #

395
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,975
# Let's go back to zero... #

396
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,040
You're turning into a pretty young lady.

397
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:36,075
Now hold still.

398
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:39,545
(whistle blows)
Come on!

399
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:43,888
All:
Die! Die! Die!

400
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:47,762
Okay then,

401
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,767
who's left to report out their root?

402
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:52,359
Andre?

403
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:55,701
Shit, Miss Mary, I ain't
the only one who don't got no root.

404
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:58,207
Andre, we don't use profanity,

405
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:00,733
or double negatives
here at True Directions.

406
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,379
Okay, who's next?

407
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:07,383
- Megan.
- Well, I've really been thinking,

408
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:10,477
but, I just can't think of anything.

409
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:13,490
I think our little prom queen
is too afraid to disclose.

410
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:16,118
Oh really?
What's your root, Graham?

411
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,219
We're working on your issue,
not mine.

412
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:19,456
You're deflecting.

413
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:20,793
Actually,

414
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:23,322
I think it might be
a great idea for Megan

415
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,562
to be reminded
of your root, Graham.

416
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,803
My mother got married in pants.

417
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:37,273
All right, let's see, Dolph?

418
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:41,182
Too many locker room showers
with the varsity team.

419
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:42,242
Hilary?

420
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:45,585
All girl boarding school.

421
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:46,850
Sinead?

422
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,518
I was born in France.

423
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,788
Clayton?

424
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:53,160
My mom let me play
in her pumps.

425
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,131
I like balls.

426
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:57,156
Why thank you for that, Jan.

427
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,494
Joel?

428
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:02,664
Traumatic breasts.

429
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:05,698
So, yeah.

430
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,266
Now, Megan.

431
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:09,541
Do you see how easy
it could be?

432
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,980
You just have to
dig down into those

433
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:15,246
painful memories,
and you'll find it.

434
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,346
Now, Hilary.
Will you please come up here?

435
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,286
Today we are going to learn

436
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:27,388
one of the most wonderful things
about being a heterosexual...

437
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,523
friendship.

438
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,123
So what I'd like you all to do,

439
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,067
is to start partnering off.

440
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:36,630
Find yourself a friend for
the remainder of the program.

441
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,144
All right, everybody settle.

442
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:44,904
Now that we have all
found someone,

443
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,540
what I'd like you to do

444
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,574
is practice sometime tonight

445
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:50,814
with these.

446
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:57,690
- It's a woman.
- And what else?

447
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:58,888
I don't know.

448
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,260
A mother.

449
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:02,128
Women have roles.
After you learn that,

450
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:04,156
you'll stop objectifying them.

451
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,863
Haven't you been listening
to anything Mary said?

452
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,633
Well have you?

453
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,334
- Have I what?
- Stopped objectifying them.

454
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:14,139
I'm still looking for my root.

455
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:16,236
Must be tough
when you're such a priss.

456
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,913
Your turn.

457
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,415
- (buzzing)
- Ow!

458
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:28,219
You really have to be more prepared
for temptation, Megan.

459
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:29,850
(sighs)

460
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,824
Give it to me.

461
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:40,268
I'm open.

462
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:59,454
Mike: Boys!

463
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:03,357
Don't you see how sad
and pathetic you all are,

464
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:07,887
always wanting something
you can't have?

465
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:12,197
If I catch you looking
at another man like that

466
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,260
ever again,

467
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:17,933
you'll be watching sports
the whole weekend.

468
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:23,169
Mary: First thing we do,
is we pull these tabs out.

469
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:26,046
Then you fold it over.

470
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,278
Right now I've used
food coloring.

471
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,252
This way you could
see it better.

472
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,221
And if it's a boy, well it

473
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:35,122
- tinkles out.
- That's the wrong tab, okay?

474
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:37,126
Will you please hold it still
while I'm doing this?

475
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,559
You're doing it all wrong.

476
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,722
No, I'm not. If you would just
give it to me to do,

477
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:43,130
it would be fine.

478
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,098
Mary: Girls...

479
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,965
intervene.

480
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:53,268
Let's try that one more time.

481
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,840
...and I realized

482
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:03,114
that when we finished
swimming lessons

483
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:07,055
we would change
in front of each other.

484
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,081
And that's it...

485
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:11,026
why I'm a homo.

486
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:14,622
Andre, that's what kids do
after swimming lessons.

487
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:16,632
Change,
everybody does that.

488
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,725
But I took one look
at those boys,

489
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:21,237
and I got a...
you know what.

490
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,068
(coughs)

491
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:27,475
I can relate to that.

492
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,503
When I used to study with Jacob,

493
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:33,209
we used to touch each others legs,

494
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,877
and rub up against each other.

495
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,250
Blowing each other after
your fuckin' bar mitzvah's

496
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,619
a little bit different
than learning to dog paddle.

497
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:41,647
That is totally uncalled for.

498
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:44,421
Well excuse me, but we're paying
a lot of money here

499
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:45,928
to get these kids fixed,

500
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:49,056
not sit around,
and listen to stories all day.

501
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,068
Graham, I hope you're getting
a little more out of this program

502
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:54,434
than that faggot over there.

503
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:57,099
Mr. Eaton,
I don't find that appropriate.

504
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,507
No, he's right,

505
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:04,810
it was a stupid ass root.

506
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:09,114
I'm never gonna know why
I'm a faggot.

507
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,052
I've heard enough
of this crap.

508
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,385
And when you get back
from Switzerland,

509
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,289
you'd better have this gay thing
out of your system. Got it?

510
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:16,815
I got it.

511
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,886
You fuck up, no college,

512
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,125
no car, no trust fund.

513
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:38,547
I'm not sitting
in any room with faggots.

514
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,154
Mary: Megan...

515
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:48,783
it's your turn to report
out your root.

516
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,760
I think it might be
my parents.

517
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:54,559
Okay, go with that.

518
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:58,466
You know we've kinda been
like this greeting card family.

519
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:01,665
And then there was
that one year where...

520
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:04,265
well Dad was unemployed
and Mom had to support us.

521
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,799
Wait a minute,
that was only for nine months.

522
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:11,177
And then I was offered
a much better job at the plant.

523
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:15,683
Maybe seeing Mom
kind of being the Dad, maybe l...

524
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:20,846
maybe I got the wrong idea
about the roles of men and women.

525
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:22,415
Absolutely.

526
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:25,189
I can't believe that you didn't
mention this earlier.

527
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:28,755
Your father was emasculated,
your mother was domineering.

528
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:29,787
Well not exactly.

529
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,802
You wanted to emulate your mother.

530
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:36,431
You have no respect for men,
because you don't respect your father.

531
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,907
- It's really not like that.
- Megan,

532
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:41,706
you have found your root.

533
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:47,612
In order to start healing
this festering wound,

534
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,119
I want you to write a song.

535
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,882
It's very therapeutic,

536
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:54,049
and it's good to put
your feelings down.

537
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,888
(blows whistle)

538
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:04,662
Free time is up in 20.

539
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,999
That means inside.

540
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,522
What is it?

541
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:41,861
Nothing. Trash.

542
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:51,342
What am I, contagious?

543
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:07,158
What is that?

544
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:09,495
I'm stuck on
five, six, seven, eight.

545
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:11,830
- God is good.
- God is straight.

546
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:14,860
Hey that's good.

547
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:22,771
It's not supposed
to be intellectual.

548
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:27,010
Cheers are supposed to be simple,
make people feel good.

549
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,950
Cheers make girls
do stupid cartwheels,

550
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:31,453
orgasms make people feel good.

551
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:40,519
Your parents didn't
stay very long.

552
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:44,432
I imagine it gets uncomfortable

553
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:47,630
sitting that long
with a stick up your ass.

554
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:51,767
I'm sure they're just trying
to do what's best for you.

555
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:53,605
I thought it was just an act,
but you really are

556
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:55,907
as sweet as fucking pie,
aren't you?

557
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:58,505
This is bullshit, Megan.
It doesn't work.

558
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:01,711
You are who you are.
The only trick is not getting caught.

559
00:34:04,054 --> 00:34:06,955
How'd you end up here?

560
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,050
I got caught.

561
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:12,152
Doing what?

562
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:21,095
I had this friend,

563
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:25,005
and we just spent
a little too much time together.

564
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,533
What were you doing?

565
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,739
What do you think?

566
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:41,823
My step-mom caught us in my room
one day and sent me here.

567
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,420
Were you in love with her?

568
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:52,328
Does it matter?

569
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:59,399
Careful.
I could report you for that.

570
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,356
# Open the door #

571
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,527
# Walk in behind her #

572
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,559
# Draw back your bow #

573
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:30,004
# Let it remind her #

574
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,064
# No one's around #

575
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,133
# No need to fake it #

576
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,407
# She's not in love #

577
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,607
# How can she take it? #

578
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,020
# Give her the time #

579
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,117
# She'll know you mean it #

580
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:53,186
# Make up her mind #

581
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:55,356
# Throw in her feelings #

582
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,423
# Open the door #

583
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,697
# Have her jump through it #

584
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,727
# She fell in love #

585
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:04,205
# How could she do it? #

586
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,038
# Do you know? Do you... #
(buzzing)

587
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,067
(moaning)

588
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,726
(whispering)
Resist temptations...

589
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:37,329
(heavy breathing)

590
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,083
(gasps)

591
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:55,454
Oh my God.
Please don't tell.

592
00:36:55,492 --> 00:36:57,357
Oh my God, help.

593
00:36:57,393 --> 00:37:00,419
Shut the fuck up!
You stupid little bitch.

594
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:01,896
- (electric buzz)
- Ahhh!

595
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,296
Hey!

596
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,960
What's going on in here?

597
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,198
- A little premature simulation?
- They were kissing.

598
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,435
- She's full of shit.
- Mike, we were just uh...

599
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,669
- Mike...
- Don't call my mom.

600
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,941
Dolph, I am really
disappointed in you.

601
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,211
I thought you had what it took
to get out of here clean.

602
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,309
It's time to wake Mary.

603
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:24,786
Come on!
Come on!

604
00:37:24,821 --> 00:37:26,789
Come on!

605
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:38,458
Mary: Whoever started this
is out of this house,

606
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:40,264
and the other is really
in the dog house.

607
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,294
- Clayton: Not me.
- Dolph: I can't go home.

608
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:46,775
Mary: I am not interested
in anybody's sob stories.

609
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,711
I can only help those
who are willing to help themselves.

610
00:37:50,747 --> 00:37:54,513
Now... who started this?

611
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:57,486
Someone has got to start talking!

612
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,593
All right, Clayton, you little pervert...

613
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,686
- What?
...you've got one week of solitary,

614
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:09,596
and if I catch you again you're out.

615
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,028
(sighs)

616
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:20,699
Come on, Mary.

617
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:40,292
I wish I could've seen
those two boys in action,

618
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,561
before Miss Thing over there,
went Nancy Drew on us.

619
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,467
If that little twink
woulda narked on me,

620
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:48,732
heads would have rolled.

621
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:52,670
Would you tie her to your bed
and zap her to death?

622
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,700
Or are you running low
on batteries?

623
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,961
Mary:
And here are our love-birds,

624
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,833
taking a relaxing
evening stroll together.

625
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:23,032
Notice how affectionate they are.

626
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:25,438
This could be you.

627
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:29,969
And here is our
happy couple at home.

628
00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:34,005
Now it's important to make
your man feel at ease

629
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,542
when he comes home
from a long day at work.

630
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:46,293
Now, when it's time
for lovemaking,

631
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,493
Dan kisses Sue
and touches her breasts.

632
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:54,401
Women often find
this sensation pleasurable.

633
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,409
# There's a dream
in the back of my mind #

634
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,887
# Across the tracks is where
I'll find my dream... #

635
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:15,448
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

636
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:19,825
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

637
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:23,889
# Talk penny, sing a dime #

638
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:27,994
# My Coleman stove
is broke down all of the time #

639
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:32,098
# Neighbor, neighbor,
call the neighbor #

640
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:36,271
# We'll have dinner
in the trailer... #

641
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:45,486
So do you miss
your friends from home?

642
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:49,455
I just can't decide
who I miss more,

643
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:53,690
the grunting apes in the letterman jackets
or the bulimic cheerl...

644
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,665
Go ahead, say it.

645
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:58,690
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

646
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,630
I don't have any friends.

647
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,535
What about you?

648
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:13,472
Well, I thought I did.

649
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:18,644
- Do they know you're here?
- Oh yeah.

650
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:20,679
It's rough.

651
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,540
What's going on?
It's almost lights out.

652
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,410
We're sneaking out.
Get dressed.

653
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:46,779
But Mary...

654
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:48,750
Fuck Mary.

655
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:51,583
No way.
There's only four weeks left.

656
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:53,987
There's no way
I'm getting thrown out now.

657
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:57,322
Megan, they're never gonna
find about this.

658
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,055
We haven't had fun in forever.

659
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:05,332
Come on.
We could use a little fun.

660
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,728
- What if we get caught?
- Were not gonna get caught.

661
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:18,774
If you're not coming with us,
at least don't rat on us.

662
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:20,578
Let's go.

663
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:54,448
Come on. Hurry up.

664
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:55,472
Go, go, go.

665
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:58,078
Oh we have a nice big group tonight.

666
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,280
Get in.

667
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:07,085
- Okay, fasten your seatbelts.
- Wait.

668
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,357
Oh. We have one more.

669
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:13,061
- Well it's about fucking time.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

670
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:15,730
Hi. I'm Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

671
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:18,296
This is Larry Morgan-Gordon.
Glad to have you with us.

672
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:20,866
You'll need one of these.

673
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,006
It may not be an exact match, but...

674
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,514
First time you've all been AWOL?

675
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,983
Larry and Lloyd are ex, ex-gays.

676
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:31,009
From True Directions?

677
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:32,918
We were among Mary's ranks
before we defected.

678
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:36,652
We're just trying to provide you all
with a balanced perspective,

679
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:38,250
to see that there are options.

680
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:41,695
In the end it's up to you
whether choose to live a...

681
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:42,698
lie.

682
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:43,994
Whether you want
to be who you are

683
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:46,934
or keep it hidden,
is really more what we're about.

684
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:50,097
So you run like,
the underground homo railroad?

685
00:43:52,408 --> 00:43:54,399
(dance music playing)

686
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,374
Come on, girls.

687
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:11,988
You didn't tell me you were
taking me to a gay bar.

688
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:14,019
Where else would we go?

689
00:44:15,898 --> 00:44:18,765
- I'm gonna get you a drink.
- I don't drink.

690
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:42,814
I refuse to accept a false
solution to my problem.

691
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:45,292
I resist temptation
and seek to solve my problem.

692
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:48,729
- I refuse to accept a false...
- What are you doing?

693
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:52,495
- My interventions.
- You know you don't have to do that.

694
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:54,400
Just be yourself.

695
00:45:07,216 --> 00:45:10,185
# Baby #

696
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:14,315
# You're making me want you... #

697
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:16,791
Hi. Would you like to dance?

698
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:21,126
- Sure she does.
- No, sorry. I can't.

699
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:23,324
That's okay.
Just thought I'd ask.

700
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:25,334
No problem.

701
00:45:25,368 --> 00:45:26,665
Too good for one dance?

702
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,830
You can't dance with a girl
for a second? Go ahead.

703
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:32,864
- Hi.
- Hi.

704
00:45:32,908 --> 00:45:36,036
Sorry.
I don't dance much.

705
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,136
That's okay.

706
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:41,673
# Making me care,
do doo doo #

707
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:44,914
# Do doo, doo, doo... #

708
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:11,172
# Baby... #

709
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:14,808
# You're making me want you #

710
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,249
# Want you #

711
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,652
# And baby... #

712
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:22,122
# You're making me love you #

713
00:46:22,158 --> 00:46:26,891
- # Love you #
- # We're in the city, city #

714
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:30,888
# You're making me love you #

715
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:34,733
# We're in the city, city #

716
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,761
# Makin' me love you... #

717
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:42,706
Megan, it's not what you think.

718
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:46,613
That's why we came here, right?
So you could be yourself.

719
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:50,277
- I don't like Sinead that way.
- Which way is that, clothed?

720
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,287
We weren't doing anything.

721
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:54,983
When you were going like this,
you weren't doing anything?

722
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:57,185
No I wasn't...
I wasn't doing that.

723
00:46:58,427 --> 00:47:00,258
It doesn't matter.

724
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,758
- Why are you freaking out?
- It's none of my business.

725
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:07,063
Do what you want.

726
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:09,435
You want me to do what I want?

727
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:13,670
- I could care less.
- What I really want?

728
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,609
Screw you.

729
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,790
I'm not supposed to like you.

730
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:42,163
But?

731
00:47:45,774 --> 00:47:47,469
I wanna do that again.

732
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:12,023
(cheering, music plays)

733
00:48:41,697 --> 00:48:43,722
What are you looking at?

734
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:56,167
Ah! Mary's coming!

735
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:36,808
- Good night.
- Good night.

736
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:59,038
# Here I go falling down
down, down #

737
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:00,837
# My mind is a blank #

738
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:04,175
# My head is spinning
around and around #

739
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:07,774
# As I go deep into
the funnel of love #

740
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:13,083
# It's such a crazy,
crazy feeling #

741
00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:14,919
# I get weak in the knees... #

742
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:16,822
Come on,

743
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,089
throw out the first thing
that comes to your head.

744
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:20,993
Okay, just think.

745
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,021
I already did.

746
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:26,091
Mine is just as good
as anybody else's.

747
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:28,103
I'm a heterosexual.

748
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:31,106
Not yet, honey.
You're almost there.

749
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,165
And don't speak out of turn.

750
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:35,438
No, I know, I've never been gay.

751
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:39,742
Jan remember,
you were molested.

752
00:50:39,782 --> 00:50:43,013
Just take a look at yourself.

753
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:45,043
Everybody thinks I'm this big dyke

754
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:48,113
because I wear baggy pants,
and play softball,

755
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:52,491
and I'm not as pretty as other girls,
but that doesn't make me gay.

756
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,158
I like guys.

757
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,760
I can't help it.

758
00:51:00,803 --> 00:51:02,930
I want a big fat wiener up my...

759
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:04,700
Amen, sister.

760
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,435
(sniffs)

761
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:08,443
I quit.

762
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:11,446
Who in the hell
is she trying to fool?

763
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:14,110
Hey, Jan.

764
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:15,810
Jan.

765
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,703
Group.

766
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:44,406
I have found something
very disturbing this morning.

767
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,812
I would like to know

768
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,375
who has been sneaking out,

769
00:51:50,419 --> 00:51:54,617
with those smut peddling
recruiters?

770
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:56,722
I want names.

771
00:51:58,193 --> 00:52:02,596
I want to know who is involved.

772
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:06,432
Fine then. Graham?

773
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:08,265
What do you have to say
for yourself?

774
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:09,895
Why are you looking at me?

775
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:12,406
Because I found these
under your bed.

776
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:16,945
Do you have anything
you'd like to confess?

777
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:21,276
I didn't sneak out.

778
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:23,113
But you know who did.

779
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:26,450
No, I don't, but um...

780
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:32,589
I did realize something
about myself last night,

781
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:36,724
that I was too scared
to admit until now.

782
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:38,255
Out with it.

783
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,063
Come on, out with it.

784
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:45,699
I have a crush.

785
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:47,072
On Joel.

786
00:52:50,946 --> 00:52:53,972
It was the first time I really
felt something for a guy.

787
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:58,316
And it just... it really proved
to me the treatment's working.

788
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:00,719
Oh, Graham.

789
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:07,286
Now, let this show you

790
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:10,423
what determination has yielded.

791
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:12,434
Fruit.

792
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:15,164
Now I want you all
to look at Graham's strength,

793
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:18,503
and how she worked her way
through this five-step program.

794
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,600
And by the way, I am very
disappointed in the rest of you.

795
00:53:21,643 --> 00:53:25,340
And I have scheduled a meeting
with each of your parents.

796
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,181
If you can't listen to me,
then perhaps you'll listen to them.

797
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:32,312
Joel: No, I didn't go
to the Cocksucker.

798
00:53:32,354 --> 00:53:34,515
I've never been to the Cocksucker.
I won't.

799
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,547
My cocksucking days are over.

800
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,184
I am normal.

801
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:42,687
Mom, Dad, you have to believe me,
I swear I didn't go anywhere.

802
00:53:42,731 --> 00:53:45,256
You're not gonna tell
your parents are you?

803
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,498
(chimes)

804
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,030
Now, honey,

805
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:55,805
your mom and I both know

806
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:59,041
that you didn't have
anything to do with that...

807
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,242
- that...
- Field trip to the Cocksucker.

808
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,275
- Field trip to the Co...

809
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,982
but... if you had gone...

810
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:12,153
You have to know
that you would be on your own.

811
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:14,389
What's that supposed to mean?

812
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:17,125
Well you can't come home.

813
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:21,659
We can't allow you to live
an unhealthy lifestyle under our roof.

814
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,634
So, Megan, if that
is what you choose,

815
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:30,702
you're choosing to cut us
out of your life.

816
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:35,611
Well, great. Great.

817
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:39,178
Now, what did you
want to tell us?

818
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:42,883
Just that you don't have
anything worry about.

819
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:48,195
I've been missing Jared a lot,

820
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,698
and can't wait to see him again.

821
00:54:50,732 --> 00:54:54,395
Oh, Megan. That's wonderful.

822
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:56,631
You just keep up
the good work,

823
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:59,197
and we'll be back
to see you graduate.

824
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:01,072
Dad: You'll be home
before you know it.

825
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:03,600
Bye-bye, sweetie.

826
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,180
- You be a good girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

827
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:14,519
Hmph!

828
00:55:17,426 --> 00:55:19,417
(answering machine)
This is Larry and Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

829
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:21,452
Leave us a message.
(beep)

830
00:55:21,496 --> 00:55:24,829
I know you're there.
Now pick it up.

831
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:27,198
Listen to me,
you little inverts.

832
00:55:27,235 --> 00:55:29,965
Okay, you want to play
rough with my kids,

833
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:32,701
then I can play rough with you.

834
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:35,175
- Time's up.
- Yes, thank you.

835
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,341
We've got a little situation
to deal with.

836
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,407
(Chanting)
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

837
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,385
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

838
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:46,478
Mary:
You have other options.

839
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:49,615
Don't you want to be normal?

840
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:54,152
Hey, I know you.
I saw you last night.

841
00:55:54,196 --> 00:55:57,757
Hey!
Your daddy know you're a faggot?

842
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:00,029
Good shot, Graham.

843
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,195
What are you doing?

844
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:04,432
What if he saw us kissing?
What do you want me to do?

845
00:56:04,473 --> 00:56:06,737
We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

846
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:10,370
We are here! We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

847
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:14,576
That's it. If you don't retreat,
we're coming out.

848
00:56:14,616 --> 00:56:16,607
(screaming)

849
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,220
Is this what you teach now, Mary?
Throw stones from glass houses?

850
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:24,748
You're gonna have a lot
of broken glass around you.

851
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:27,591
It's part of the process, Lloyd.

852
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:30,257
It's not easy for them.

853
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:49,682
- Excuse me
- Oh, thanks.

854
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:52,551
You are so good
at being straight.

855
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:56,387
Wow. You have really
big muscles.

856
00:56:56,425 --> 00:57:00,259
I keep forgetting about
all these little things.

857
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,753
Get her cake.
Get her the cake.

858
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,926
Can I rub them?

859
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:08,094
Got a little cake right there.

860
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:21,448
That's good.

861
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,283
Oh. Yeah.

862
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,256
Mm-mm.

863
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:33,884
You're really manly.

864
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:35,920
- Thanks.
- I like that.

865
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:38,194
- Manly is good.
- I feel like the aggressor.

866
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:41,327
That's nice.

867
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:43,963
Yeah.

868
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,376
You will all

869
00:57:51,413 --> 00:57:53,938
be graded in each category,

870
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:57,975
and those of you who pass,
will move on to step five,

871
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:02,149
simulated sexual lifestyle.

872
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,956
And those of you who fail,
will be sent home.

873
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:09,828
Boys with Mike.
Girls with me.

874
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:14,230
# Her melody #

875
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:16,567
# Wants her desperately #

876
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:19,438
# Cry lonely tears #

877
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:22,102
# 'Cause she's so far from here #

878
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:27,446
# She's a ray of sunshine #

879
00:58:27,482 --> 00:58:31,748
# My only ray of sunshine #

880
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:33,846
# Her yellow hair #

881
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,414
# Her fiery stare #

882
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,585
# But nothing's right #

883
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:42,188
# 'Cause she's not here tonight #

884
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:46,758
# She's a ray of sunshine #

885
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:52,263
# My only ray of sunshine #

886
00:58:52,307 --> 00:58:54,434
# I know that I'm going nowhere #

887
00:58:54,476 --> 00:58:57,502
# I wish that she'd
come back to me #

888
00:58:57,546 --> 00:58:59,878
# She's all I need #

889
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,577
# She's all I need #

890
00:59:02,617 --> 00:59:07,077
# All I need to end my misery... #

891
00:59:07,122 --> 00:59:09,613
Mike:
Essay topic: My root,

892
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:13,389
and how it prevented me
from heterosexual loving.

893
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:22,269
# She's a ray of sunshine #

894
00:59:22,304 --> 00:59:28,174
# My only ray of sunshine. #

895
00:59:29,644 --> 00:59:32,442
Now, in order
to successfully navigate

896
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,846
the treacherous sea
of temptation,

897
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:39,445
one must first enter a life
out of homosexuality.

898
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:42,888
I've never seen
such a determined group.

899
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:46,519
And I am passing all...

900
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:49,827
but one of you.

901
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:52,823
- Andre.
- Hmm?

902
00:59:52,868 --> 00:59:55,735
You may pack your bags.

903
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,761
Now there's cake in the kitchen.

904
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,831
You'll wanna rest up
for the simulation.

905
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,400
Michael, congratulations.

906
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:07,779
I just wasn't meant
to be butch.

907
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:09,807
I'm a sissy.

908
01:00:11,386 --> 01:00:13,718
No.

909
01:00:13,755 --> 01:00:16,246
You should be proud
of who you are.

910
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:19,887
Hello.

911
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:23,557
I mean you're more
than just a sissy.

912
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:26,692
You're nice and clean,

913
01:00:26,735 --> 01:00:29,568
and smart and sexy,

914
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:31,799
and firm and luscious, and...

915
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,569
Excuse me.

916
01:00:33,608 --> 01:00:35,599
The last thing
I need right now

917
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:37,635
is some fruit
who just proved he's straight

918
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,705
telling my ass how sexy I am.

919
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,942
Congratulations, liars!

920
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:47,318
You know who you are,
and you know who you want.

921
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:49,516
Ain't nobody gonna change that.

922
01:00:49,557 --> 01:00:51,457
Shit!

923
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:18,605
# Breathe into my hands #

924
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:23,106
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

925
01:02:39,434 --> 01:02:43,427
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

926
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:47,498
# Are you still breathing? #

927
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:51,444
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

928
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:55,438
# Are you still breathing #

929
01:02:56,518 --> 01:02:58,679
# Breathe into my hands #

930
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,056
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from... #

931
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:23,508
Graham?

932
01:03:27,615 --> 01:03:30,948
I've never felt that way before.

933
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:32,976
Except...

934
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:37,287
Except for what?

935
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:40,158
- Don't laugh, okay?
- I won't.

936
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,123
Except for when
I was cheerleading.

937
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:50,129
- Really?
- I'm serious.

938
01:03:52,173 --> 01:03:54,937
It sounds stupid to you,
but I really love it.

939
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:01,145
Cheerleading's the one thing
that's kept me happy.

940
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:08,789
It's exhilarating.

941
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,985
I would love to see you cheer.

942
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:18,430
- Don't make fun of me.
- No, I'm not.

943
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:22,435
Did you ever think
maybe I'm just jealous

944
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:23,869
that you love something?

945
01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:28,203
# Breathe into my hands #

946
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:31,701
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

947
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:40,978
Get out of bed!

948
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,417
You hormonal hussy.

949
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:46,427
I can't believe you did this.

950
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:47,894
You were suppose to be
the role model.

951
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:50,363
Now get up right now!

952
01:04:50,398 --> 01:04:52,525
What did I do?

953
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:55,127
Hilary:
A little sleep-over with Graham.

954
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,660
(scoffs)

955
01:04:56,704 --> 01:04:59,104
Get dressed right now!

956
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:02,771
Mary:
You of course understand

957
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,438
what your little adventure
has cost you.

958
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,314
You will be removed from the program,
and the premises at once.

959
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:11,682
I understand.

960
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:14,517
And of course your parents
have made it very clear

961
01:05:14,556 --> 01:05:16,490
that you are just not
welcome home any more.

962
01:05:16,524 --> 01:05:19,584
So you will be left
to your own devices.

963
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:24,556
I mean there may be one thing
that you can do,

964
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:26,863
where we can workout
some kind of a deal.

965
01:05:26,901 --> 01:05:28,698
I'll let you stay,

966
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:30,704
and graduate with the rest
your class,

967
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:33,673
but you must do me
one favor in return.

968
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,232
Partner in simulation
with Rock.

969
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:36,265
Rock?

970
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,770
I don't think that'll work.

971
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:42,715
(dance music playing)

972
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:48,855
Oh, for Pete's sake!

973
01:05:51,893 --> 01:05:54,191
(singing)
# Wham bam, thank you, ma'am. #

974
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:58,165
Rock, turn it off.

975
01:06:02,904 --> 01:06:04,394
We've lost Megan.

976
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:06,703
She just wasn't
strong enough.

977
01:06:06,741 --> 01:06:09,733
But you still have a chance
to save yourself.

978
01:06:09,777 --> 01:06:11,039
It's your choice.

979
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:14,571
You can run off with Megan
and turn into a raging bull-dyke

980
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:17,414
or you can do the simulation
and graduate,

981
01:06:17,452 --> 01:06:19,420
and lead a normal life.

982
01:06:19,454 --> 01:06:21,081
There is no choice.

983
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:22,919
You came here to graduate,

984
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:25,585
and that is exactly
what you are going to do.

985
01:06:25,627 --> 01:06:27,117
You understand me,
young lady?

986
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:30,460
This is exactly
why your mother left.

987
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:32,762
Are you ready to lose
your father?

988
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,383
Then it's settled.

989
01:06:58,426 --> 01:07:01,259
Graham will partner with Rock
in simulation.

990
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:04,129
Megan, you're out.

991
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:06,099
Skedaddle.

992
01:07:08,536 --> 01:07:10,663
(softly)
I'm sorry.

993
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:52,876
Man:
What do you want?

994
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:54,779
I need to talk
to Lloyd and Larry.

995
01:07:54,816 --> 01:07:56,613
But you're from True Directions.

996
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,141
- Yeah.
- (window shuts)

997
01:07:58,186 --> 01:07:59,881
Hey, not anymore.

998
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,457
All right, kid,
get in here.

999
01:08:05,493 --> 01:08:07,324
Come on, move your tush.

1000
01:08:09,564 --> 01:08:10,963
I can't go back.

1001
01:08:10,998 --> 01:08:13,865
I thought you could teach me
how to be a lesbian,

1002
01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:16,836
what they wear,
where they live.

1003
01:08:16,871 --> 01:08:18,065
You know.

1004
01:08:19,374 --> 01:08:21,433
Megan, we can't
help you with that.

1005
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:24,707
There's not just one way
to be a lesbian.

1006
01:08:24,746 --> 01:08:28,341
You just have to continue
to be who you are.

1007
01:08:30,318 --> 01:08:32,149
- Dolph?
- Megan.

1008
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:37,184
Thank you so much for saving me
from that place.

1009
01:08:37,225 --> 01:08:38,715
What are you doing here?

1010
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,886
I live here.

1011
01:08:39,927 --> 01:08:43,260
Or at least until I find a way
to make it on my own.

1012
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:46,857
It's way better than TD.

1013
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:50,302
We all get our own rooms
and curfew is midnight.

1014
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:52,101
But we have to share bathrooms.

1015
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,698
Not at the same time,
of course.

1016
01:08:53,741 --> 01:08:55,265
Of course.

1017
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,743
Come on,
it's going to be okay.

1018
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,440
No it won't.

1019
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:05,077
She was supposed to leave with me
and she didn't.

1020
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:08,078
Whoa, slow down, who?

1021
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:09,146
Graham.

1022
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,680
I knew it.

1023
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:13,057
She was into you
from the start.

1024
01:09:13,094 --> 01:09:14,755
Then why didn't she
come with me?

1025
01:09:14,796 --> 01:09:16,491
Maybe she was scared.

1026
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,192
Like I'm not?

1027
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:21,258
Believe me,
you're better off here.

1028
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:29,369
Mary:
Graham?

1029
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,378
Pay attention.

1030
01:09:31,412 --> 01:09:32,777
Action, Rock.

1031
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,687
Now lean in and kiss her.

1032
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:49,590
Nice, Rock.

1033
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:53,259
Now, feel how soft
and vulnerable she is.

1034
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:54,928
Isn't it wonderful?

1035
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:56,368
Now, Graham,

1036
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,702
let him take the lead.

1037
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:02,268
A little tongue...

1038
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:05,245
He loves you.
He wants to be with you.

1039
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:07,611
The way God intended.

1040
01:10:07,648 --> 01:10:10,310
To be inside you.

1041
01:10:10,351 --> 01:10:12,649
His love muscle thrusting.

1042
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:14,086
(both scoff)

1043
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:16,278
Cut.

1044
01:10:16,324 --> 01:10:19,054
Megan, we thought that Dolph
should take you out this week,

1045
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:20,788
to celebrate your
new freedom.

1046
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:23,058
- How would that be?
- Sure.

1047
01:10:23,097 --> 01:10:24,496
So, Megan...

1048
01:10:24,532 --> 01:10:26,659
what do you want
to do now?

1049
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:30,296
Larry, Megan just made
a very traumatic decision

1050
01:10:30,338 --> 01:10:33,239
- and she's moving through that process.
- I thought that...

1051
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:35,504
we could check out
some schools in the city,

1052
01:10:35,543 --> 01:10:38,444
- and I could...
- She's not ready...

1053
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:39,605
Sweetie.

1054
01:10:39,647 --> 01:10:42,309
I'm just asking
a simple question.

1055
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:44,375
- I'm not interrogating her.
- You are moving into that

1056
01:10:44,418 --> 01:10:46,909
- aggressive space again.
- Can't I even ask a question around here?

1057
01:10:46,954 --> 01:10:48,945
Now I feel you moving
into your victim stance.

1058
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,518
I was not attacking,
I was verbalizing.

1059
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:57,825
I just feel like you don't
value my opinion anymore.

1060
01:10:57,865 --> 01:11:00,197
Seems like nothing I do
pleases you.

1061
01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:03,634
I feel inadequate.

1062
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:07,831
I love my Larry bear.

1063
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:12,037
- Lloyd's sorry.
- Larry bear's sorry, too.

1064
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:19,883
Okay then.
Dinner's ready.

1065
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:23,550
Very good.
Okay, who's next?

1066
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:37,866
Okay, now remember
that sex is fun.

1067
01:11:37,905 --> 01:11:39,634
We're making love.

1068
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:41,733
There's nothing dirty
about it.

1069
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:45,109
Sex is beautiful when it's
between a man and a woman.

1070
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:46,477
Mom?

1071
01:11:46,514 --> 01:11:48,778
Okay,
now from this position,

1072
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:50,408
the woman will
spread her legs,

1073
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:52,510
opening like a flower.

1074
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:54,043
That's wonderful Graham.

1075
01:11:54,088 --> 01:11:57,489
Now at this point,
the man will insert himself

1076
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:58,856
into the woman.

1077
01:12:04,932 --> 01:12:06,297
Yes, that's...

1078
01:12:06,334 --> 01:12:08,234
Yes. Rock that's it.

1079
01:12:08,269 --> 01:12:10,328
Mrs. Brown?

1080
01:12:10,371 --> 01:12:11,736
What is it, Joel?

1081
01:12:11,772 --> 01:12:15,037
- What about foreplay?
- Foreplay is for sissies.

1082
01:12:15,076 --> 01:12:18,239
Real men go in,
unload and pull out.

1083
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,576
Mom!

1084
01:12:32,259 --> 01:12:33,817
We could dance
if you want to.

1085
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:37,662
You go ahead.

1086
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,926
I think I need to go get some air.

1087
01:12:56,183 --> 01:12:57,650
I miss her.

1088
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:02,850
She's scared that maybe
she's making the wrong choice.

1089
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,084
But it's her wrong
choice to make.

1090
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,457
You have to be willing
to walk away.

1091
01:13:08,262 --> 01:13:11,026
What about you and Clayton?

1092
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:14,091
If he can't make a stand,
he just can't make a stand.

1093
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,867
Well, what about you?

1094
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:24,102
What are you willing to do?

1095
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:33,683
I'm so proud of you.

1096
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:36,019
Doesn't it feel great
to be straight?

1097
01:13:36,057 --> 01:13:39,652
To be out of homosexuality?

1098
01:13:39,694 --> 01:13:42,390
It's not always
gonna be easy,

1099
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,898
but at least we know
what to do now.

1100
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,891
Okay, girls,
ready to go?

1101
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:52,364
Give me the keys.

1102
01:13:52,406 --> 01:13:54,772
- I hope she's worth it.
- Is Clayton?

1103
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:56,674
I'm doing this for you,
not for Clayton.

1104
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:57,973
Yeah, right.

1105
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:07,449
There he is.

1106
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,277
Let's go.

1107
01:14:56,604 --> 01:15:01,337
Mary: Welcome to the graduating class
of True Directions.

1108
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:06,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present

1109
01:15:06,747 --> 01:15:10,046
our happy heterosexuals.

1110
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:11,676
(applause)

1111
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:40,074
- Jesus.
- Miss me?

1112
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:41,638
Why are you here?

1113
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:43,149
I came to get you.

1114
01:15:45,486 --> 01:15:48,216
I can't go anywhere, Megan.

1115
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:15,843
That was fast.

1116
01:16:15,883 --> 01:16:17,077
Where's Graham?

1117
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,250
I've got to try again.

1118
01:16:31,532 --> 01:16:33,796
We have all gathered
on this special day,

1119
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:37,895
to celebrate the wonderful
true directions.

1120
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,867
And praise be
to our Higher Power.

1121
01:16:47,181 --> 01:16:50,116
Will our graduates
please stand again?

1122
01:16:51,452 --> 01:16:52,942
Sinead Lauren.

1123
01:17:00,294 --> 01:17:01,693
Joel Goldberg.

1124
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:12,532
Hilary Vandermueller.

1125
01:17:19,513 --> 01:17:21,242
Graham Eaton.

1126
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:48,205
And now,
I think that in closing...

1127
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:49,834
we should...

1128
01:18:00,054 --> 01:18:01,112
Graham.

1129
01:18:07,695 --> 01:18:09,890
One, two, three, four,

1130
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,296
I won't take "no" anymore.

1131
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,426
Five, six, seven, eight,

1132
01:18:14,468 --> 01:18:16,766
I want you to be my mate.

1133
01:18:16,804 --> 01:18:19,295
One, two, three, four,

1134
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,604
You're the one that I adore.

1135
01:18:21,642 --> 01:18:24,076
Five, six, seven, eight,

1136
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:27,137
Don't run from me
'cause this is fate.

1137
01:18:27,181 --> 01:18:30,150
# Breathe into my hands #

1138
01:18:30,184 --> 01:18:34,211
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1139
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:41,889
I love you.

1140
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:45,095
Megan...

1141
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:47,896
you stop it, this instant.

1142
01:18:47,935 --> 01:18:50,961
'Cause you will wallow in the smut

1143
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:52,734
of your homosexual depravity

1144
01:18:52,773 --> 01:18:54,365
for the rest of your life.

1145
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:03,276
Go, come on, let's go.

1146
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:05,808
- (engine starts)
- Megan!

1147
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:09,450
Wait!

1148
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:18,389
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1149
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:26,299
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1150
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,208
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1151
01:19:31,145 --> 01:19:33,773
# Breathe into my hands #

1152
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:39,184
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

1153
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,653
# Breathe into my hands #

1154
01:19:41,688 --> 01:19:46,284
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1155
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:47,657
(applause)

1156
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:53,065
My name is Peter,

1157
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,226
and...

1158
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:57,635
my daughter is a homosexual.

1159
01:19:58,672 --> 01:20:00,970
All:
Hello, Peter.

1160
01:20:15,556 --> 01:20:19,686
# What do they know
when they say I'm too young? #

1161
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:24,425
# As I get older
and until my life is done #

1162
01:20:24,465 --> 01:20:29,266
# I'll be the one
who had love that was true #

1163
01:20:29,303 --> 01:20:33,399
# They all had nothing
and I had you #

1164
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,465
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1165
01:20:35,509 --> 01:20:37,568
# Together forever in love #

1166
01:20:37,611 --> 01:20:40,512
# Together forever in love #

1167
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:56,425
# I'll be your reason
for starting your day #

1168
01:20:56,463 --> 01:21:01,196
# You'll be my true love
in every way #

1169
01:21:01,235 --> 01:21:05,365
# I'll always need you
I promise that now #

1170
01:21:05,405 --> 01:21:10,138
# Through good and bad
as long as this life will allow #

1171
01:21:10,177 --> 01:21:12,645
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1172
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:14,840
# Together forever in love #

1173
01:21:14,882 --> 01:21:18,841
# Together forever in love #

1174
01:21:18,886 --> 01:21:21,252
# My life is for living #

1175
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:25,486
# I'll spend mine giving you
all that I can #

1176
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:28,290
# My heart and my hand #

1177
01:21:37,504 --> 01:21:42,771
# My life with you will
shine brighter than gold #

1178
01:21:42,809 --> 01:21:47,712
# Memories of heaven
for when I get old #

1179
01:21:47,748 --> 01:21:52,082
# Never again
will I wanna run away #

1180
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:56,715
# I didn't think that I could
ever feel this way #

1181
01:21:56,757 --> 01:21:59,351
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1182
01:21:59,393 --> 01:22:01,691
# Together forever in love #

1183
01:22:01,728 --> 01:22:06,995
# Together forever in love #

1184
01:22:08,735 --> 01:22:11,329
# Together forever in love. #

1185
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:37,890
# Open the door #

1186
01:22:37,931 --> 01:22:40,092
# Walk in behind her #

1187
01:22:40,133 --> 01:22:42,397
# Draw back your bow #

1188
01:22:42,436 --> 01:22:44,427
# Let it remind her #

1189
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:46,530
# No one's around #

1190
01:22:46,573 --> 01:22:48,632
# No need to fake it #

1191
01:22:48,675 --> 01:22:50,609
# She's not in love #

1192
01:22:50,644 --> 01:22:53,511
# How can she take it? #

1193
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:03,623
# Give her the time #

1194
01:23:03,657 --> 01:23:05,818
# She'll know you mean it #

1195
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:07,850
# Make up her mind #

1196
01:23:07,894 --> 01:23:10,192
# Throw in her feelings #

1197
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:12,255
# Open the door #

1198
01:23:12,299 --> 01:23:14,460
# Have her jump through it #

1199
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:16,526
# She fell in love #

1200
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,629
# How could she do it? #

1201
01:23:18,672 --> 01:23:21,766
# Do you know,
do you know #

1202
01:23:21,808 --> 01:23:24,208
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1203
01:23:24,244 --> 01:23:27,907
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1204
01:23:27,948 --> 01:23:30,746
# Do you know,
do you know #

1205
01:23:30,784 --> 01:23:33,378
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1206
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,186
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1207
01:23:37,224 --> 01:23:39,454
# You should try to kiss her #

1208
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:52,334
# Crazy galore #

1209
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:54,738
# You wouldn't do it #

1210
01:23:54,775 --> 01:23:56,709
# Seen it before #

1211
01:23:56,743 --> 01:23:59,234
# Looks like you blew it #

1212
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,214
# Do you know,
do you know #

1213
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:04,843
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1214
01:24:04,885 --> 01:24:08,286
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1215
01:24:08,322 --> 01:24:11,382
# Do you know,
do you know #

1216
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:13,916
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1217
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,760
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1218
01:24:17,798 --> 01:24:20,096
# You should try to kiss her #

1219
01:24:20,133 --> 01:24:23,159
# Do you know,
do you know #

1220
01:24:23,203 --> 01:24:25,694
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1221
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:29,573
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1222
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:32,510
# Do you know,
do you know #

1223
01:24:32,546 --> 01:24:35,106
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1224
01:24:35,148 --> 01:24:38,914
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1225
01:24:38,952 --> 01:24:41,250
# You should try to kiss her #

1226
01:24:41,288 --> 01:24:43,722
# Just put up your fist #

1227
01:24:43,757 --> 01:24:49,753
# You should try
to kiss her goodbye. #

1228
01:24:59,072 --> 01:25:01,506
# Swish with me #

1229
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,873
# And I'll swish with you #

1230
01:25:05,946 --> 01:25:08,813
# That's right, get down #

1231
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,407
# Everybody swish to the left #

1232
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,611
# That's right, get down... #
