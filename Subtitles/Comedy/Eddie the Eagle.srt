you're going, young man?

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,516
Then the Olympic Squad
under Warren Sharp.

356
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,713
EDDIE: The Warren Sharp?

357
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,870
PETRA: Yeah.
The great American coach.

358
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,155
Peary was his star jumper.
He broke records.

359
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,118
He was really
a gifted flyer

360
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,232
with a very
special style. But...

361
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,190
...he was too crazy,
you know?

362
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,515
And now he's just crazy,
but in a different way.

363
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,631
Bronson Peary. How come
I've never heard of him?

364
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,398
They kicked him out.

"being a total loser."

369
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,076
Petra, do you mind
if I borrow this?

370
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,709
Yeah, take it.
Okay, thanks.

371
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,593

have a little chat about

372
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,955
me being an
Olympic ski-jumper.

373
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,160
You've more chance of being
a ballerina than a jumper.

374

a few tips, really.

you used to jump for America.

Yeah, Petra has
a lot of stories, man.

380

387
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,909
Britain doesn't have a ski-jumping
team so I was thinking...

388
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,912
Okay. Now I know
you're crazy.

off to the best of starts...

390

fixing rust-buckets.

is simultaneously
stretching up...

into your descent.

take-off downwards. Okay?

for the 70 meters.

sitting there?

539

I landed the 40 meters.

And I've decided...

542
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,151
I'm going to the
Olympics in Calgary.

543
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,037

watch it on TV?

544

a golden opportunity.

The only thing I need to do
to qualify is compete.

548
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,197

minimum requirement.

555
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,675
Eddie, okay.

556
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,513
Eddie, the smallest Olympic
jump is 70 meters. Okay?

557
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,477
You'll die if you try it.

558
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,272

takes four years

559
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,793
to build up to it.

560
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,399
Well, I'm not
the average jumper.

561
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,550
Correct. You're well
below average.

562
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,511
I just did
the 40 meters in a day.

563
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,716
I'm ready for the 70 meters.
I'll do it now if you want.

Don't.

566

if I'm gonna jump.

I get your permission.

00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,072
Bo Derek! Yeah, baby!

709
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,151
I think a little bit
of wee came out.

710
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,554
So, all you have to do is make
this landing and you qualify.

711
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,153
One jump away
from the Olympics, man.

712
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,037
Get your skis.

713
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,199
Okay. Stay focused.

714
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,392
Do everything I told
you to do only better.

715
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,831
A lot better. Go.

treat every jump

as if it is your last.

719
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,678
We are saying for us,
that is easy.

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,279

00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,715

Well, technically,
you haven't.

Because you just
changed the rules.

769
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,879
It costs £4.5 million

to send a National Squad
to the Olympics.

771
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,714
The Government gives us
a mere fraction of that.

we make up the difference?

776
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,676
to be associated
with certain qualities.

777
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,470
Excellence. Achievements.
Victory.

778
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,512
Strangely, they have no
desire to be associated

779
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,790
with ludicrous
antics and defeat.

780
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,070
So, why do I stop
being ludicrous

781
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,151
if I jump 61 meters?

782
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,429
That is the distance

783
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,353
ratified by our
Safety Committee.

784
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,593
Personally,
I'd prefer it to be higher.

785
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,759
Or is it longer?
I never can tell.

Either way,

787
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,197
we will not have
amateurs in the Olympics.

was for amateurs.

The only way to qualify

800

is to make 61 meters
in competition.

801
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,958
So I'm gonna go
on the European circuit.

802

are they asking you to jump?

If I'm gonna go
on the European circuit

813
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,991
I'm gonna need to raise
some serious cash.

814
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
Yeah, well, don't ask us,
we ain't got any.

815
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120

for the van?

817
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,591

I sorted out the transport.

This window is a bugger.
(SQUEAKING)

855
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,711
I think it's a good thing they
turned you down, man. It is.

856
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,389
I mean, 61 meters
is a genuine distance.

857
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,755
Means you gotta
do this for real.

858
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,354
Well, it's easy for you to say,
you were a champion.

859
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,550
You were always
really good.

860
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,351
I was kicked off
every team I was ever on

861
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,120
before I even got
a chance to prove myself.

862
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,998
Believe it or not, I do know what
it's like to be written off, Eddie.

863
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,914
Of course,
my solution was

864
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,639
just to crawl inside
the bottle here, but...

865
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,953
I was in hospital for a
year when I was a kid.

866
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,632
Dodgy knees.

867
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,473
All the doctors said
I should give up sport.

868
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,112
Take up reading.

869
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,594
First book I got:

870
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,188
<i>The Official Olympic
Photo Album 1972,</i>

871
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,395
BOTH: <i>Moments of Glory.</i>

872
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,072
Yeah, I know it.

873
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,589
Well, anyway,
that is the book

874
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,558
that made me realize
I needed my own moment.

875
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,556
That one thing I could do
to prove them all wrong.

876
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,831
Do you think I'm mad?

877
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,149
Yeah.

878
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,675
(CHUCKLES)

879
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,797
You're completely
mad, man. But, hey...

880
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,354
...you kinda gotta be mad
to do this sport, right?

881
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
Yep.

882
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320

Eddie Edwards,

884
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,317
I can get you your moment.

885
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,959
But it's gonna
hurt like hell.

886
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,758

some proper equipment.

889
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,754

890
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,512
Perfect.
Size 11, right?

891
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,715
Mm-hmm.

892
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,432
Oh, wow.

893
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,078
Peary, is this not theft?

894
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,878
It's the Lost and Found, man.

895
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,757
Come on. Some guy dropped
10 bucks on the street

896
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,353
and you were to pick it up,
would that be theft?

897
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,515
EDDIE: Yes.

898
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,039
What if he didn't know
it was missing?

899
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,190
Then I'd give it
to charity or something.

900
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,915
Eddie, you are a charity.
Your needs are much greater.

901
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,678
What about you?

902
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,549
Me? I'm just
stealing these.

903
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,870
Any better?
It's not better. It's crap.

904
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,589
It's more difficult
than I expected.

on my knees

to let me jump again.

jumping seriously

take yourself seriously."

01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,438
I wasn't expecting
that at all.

1565
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,876
Yeah. Well,
I think I can match that.

1566
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,792
"Now the real work begins.
WS." Warren Sharp.

1567
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,074
Yeah. Yeah.

1568
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,395
So how about it?
Here's to the next four years.

1569
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,879
Ah.
Ugh.

1570
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,632
God, that's good.

1571
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,429
(CROWD CHEERING)

1572
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,189
Hello, Mum.

1573
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,839
Hello.

1574
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:34,560
Where do you think
you've been, young man?

1575
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,030
Competing
in the Olympics, Mum.

1576
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,473
I'm so proud of you, son.

1577
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,437
I mean that.
I'm so proud of you, mate.

1578
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,392
Thanks, Dad.

1579
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,232
So proud of you, man.

1580
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,231
(ALL CHANTING)

1581
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,475
<i>I'm shouting</i>

1582
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,996
<i>Don't care who is listening</i>

1583
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,516
<i>Don't live here,
I'm visiting</i>

1584
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,673
<i>To go where I've never been</i>

1585
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,399
<i>I'm reaching</i>

1586
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,155
<i>'Cause this isn't far enough</i>

1587
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,676
<i>There's more
in this heart than love</i>

1588
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,271
<i>Won 't stop
till I'm high above</i>

1589
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,750
<i>I'm cursed with anticipation</i>

1590
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,389
<i>I have no time
for conversation</i>

1591
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,036
<i>Look at me,
I'm free to do what I want</i>

1592
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,429
<i>What I want</i>

1593
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,956
<i>Come on, thrill me
Come on, kill me</i>

1594
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,350
<i>Feel the blood rush
Round the body</i>

1595
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,830
<i>Can 't hold it in
and I can't fight it</i>

1596
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,549
<i>Can 't turn away
and I can't hide it</i>

1597
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:56,076
<i>Come on, find me
Come on, blind me</i>

1598
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,630
<i>Look, the fear
is far behind me</i>

1599
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,076
<i>What was just a dream
now will be</i>

1600
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,709
<i>I'm calling to the world,
Come on, come on, thrill me</i>

1601
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,715
<i>Come on, thrill me</i>

1602
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,634
<i>I feel alive
when you're with me</i>

1603
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,429
<i>I feel the endless
possibilities</i>

1604
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,717
<i>You give me something
You give me something</i>

1605
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,634
<i>You give me everything</i>

1606
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:40,110
<i>And I will make it
all worth it</i>

1607
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,988
<i>Yeah, I will reach
the summit white as snow</i>

1608
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,152
<i>You make me wanna
You make me wanna</i>

1609
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,198
<i>You make me wanna be yours</i>

1610
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:53,909
<i>'Cause we were honestly</i>

1611
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,515
<i>We were nothing
more than each other</i>

1612
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,036
<i>But I needed you
Yeah, I needed you</i>

1613
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:05,511
<i>Like you needed me</i>

1614
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:09,716
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1615
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,634
<i>Traveling high
Learning to fly</i>

1616
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:16,951
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1617
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,874
<i>Out of the sky
For you</i>

1618
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,316
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1619
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,234
<i>Out of the sky
I'm on a ride</i>

1620
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:31,790
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1621
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:35,668
<i>Learning to fly
For you</i>

1622
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,038
<i>I can see the eagle landing</i>

1623
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,950
<i>It's all I wanna do now</i>

1624
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,870
<i>Didn 't think
I'd ever get so high</i>

1625
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,872
<i>Take me to that
hallowed ground</i>

1626
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,996
<i>High above
So safe and sound</i>

1627
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:22,077
<i>Do your best
to clip my wings</i>

1628
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:28,599
<i>You see, my skin
is thicker than you think</i>

1629
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,195
<i>So I lock away that madness</i>

1630
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,670
<i>Keep emotion in a tight fist</i>

1631
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:42,598
<i>Gonna hold my head up high
until I reach the summit</i>

1632
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,671
<i>Ascension</i>

1633
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,675
<i>Just sky holding me</i>

1634
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:02,550
<i>Oh to rise like an angel</i>

1635
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:06,235
<i>Just to kiss every star</i>

1636
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,432
<i>See the cloud's
silver lining</i>

1637
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,956
<i>Flying high and far</i>

1638
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,910
<i>Oh, ascension</i>

1639
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:25,559
<i>Ascension</i>
