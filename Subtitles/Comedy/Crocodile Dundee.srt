Uh, see, crocs don't
like fresh meat.

242
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,749
He wasn't trying to
eat me on the spot.

243
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,935
He just wanted grab hold of me and
take me down for a death roll.

245
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,128
A death roll?

246
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,215
Yeah. See, a croc will grab you,

247
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,668
take you down to the
bottom of the water,

248
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,714
and roll you over and over and
over till you stop kicking.

249
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,683
Then he'll take you away to
his meat safe somewhere.

Anyway, he wasn't happy
with the grip he had on me,

256
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,362
so he let go to get a better
one, and I talked him out of it.

- Yes, sir.

Tucano's would be nice.

01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,677
What's the matter, Aussie boy?

1086
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,849
You going to make like a
kangaroo and hop away?

You okay, Mick?

Oh, yeah, Gus. No worries.

1095
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,581
I was just getting on top of them.

1096
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,194
You sure you're not
Pintinjarra tribe?

1097

No, man. Harlem Warlords.

1099
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,968
I knew you were tribal.

1100
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,945

He's still not answering.</i>

1105
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,962
Uh, he called down this morning
to say he was checking out today.

1106
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,344
<i>We're going to miss
him around here.</i>

1107
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,719
Thanks.

Thank you, sir.

1109
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,216
G'day, Irving. How are you, mate?

01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:27,991
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't
be dead for dollars.

01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:29,470
Close.

1112
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,790
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

1113
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,997
Ah, no. I thought I'd go Walkabout.

1114
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:36,544
Huh?

1115
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,168
Wander around,
take a look at America.

1116

For how long?

1117
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,502
Long as it takes.

1118
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,421
What's the quickest
way out of town?

1119
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:47,738
Well, if you're looking
for adventure,

1120
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,573
there's a subway two
blocks that way.

- Morning, Miss.
- Morning.

1127
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,842
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1128
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,452
No, but it will come to me.

1129

Incidentally, Miss, if you're
looking for Crocodile Mick,

1130

Yeah. He's headed for the
subway two blocks down.

1133
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,364
You'd better hurry.

1134
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,195
Mind this for me.

Hey, lady, where you going?

1137
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,894

don't you play with me?

The lady down the end
wants to see you!

1149
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:07,671
What does she want?

1150
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:10,963
What does she want?

1151
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,131
What do you want?

1152
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:17,261
Tell him not to leave.

1153
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:20,052
I'm not going to marry Richard.

1154
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:27,018
Tell him don't leave. She's
not going to marry Richard.

Don't leave. I'm not
going to marry Richard.

Why not?

1157

I don't know.

1158
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:39,570
Why not?

1159
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:41,906
Why not?

1160
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:46,286
Tell him I love him.

1161
