1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,336
''Edge City''

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,800
Another one coming down.

3
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,051
Hang on.

4
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,893
THE MASK

5
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,948
I got those...

6
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,241
concert tickets you wanted.

7
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,743
You're kidding!

8
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,620
For Friday night?

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,581
StanIey, this is great.

10
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,250
What time do I pick you up?

11
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,252
Here's the thing.

12
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,048
My best girIfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,926
so couId we get an extra ticket
for her?

14
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,264
They're soId out. That means
there's no more.

15
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,519
I can't Iet her sit home aII aIone.

16
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,564
I'II teII you what.

17
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,107
Go with your friend.

18
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,694
I couIdn't do that.

19
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,154
No, come on.

20
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,783
StanIey, you are the nicest guy.

21
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,952
ReaIIy, you are.

22
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,872
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.

23
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,629
That was the most sickening dispIay

24
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,216
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

25
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,884
I'm wearing her down.

26
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,304
Buddy, you need a IittIe
change of pace.

27
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,307
Tonight, I'II take you
on a Iove safari.

28
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,811
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungIe.

29
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,896
TeII me more, bwana.

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,817
The Coco Bongo CIub.
Hottest new joint in town.

31
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,361
OnIy the cr me de Ia cr me
need appIy.

32
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,698
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

33
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,117
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

34
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,411
This is going to be the perfect...

35
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,830
night on the town.

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,469
HoId the phone.

37
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,723
KiIIer at three o'cIock.

38
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,837
Stand back and observe.

39
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,343
Where do I open an account?

40
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,178
New accounts,right here.

41
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,722
You're Iucky, I was on my way out--

42
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,432
HoId this for me, pIease?

43
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,726
I'II hoId anything you want.

44
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,189
Can you heIp me?

45
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,007
So...

46
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,261
what kind of account do you want?

47
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,640
WeII, I'm not sure exactIy. I'm
just terribIe with things Iike that.

48
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,018
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

49
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,479
Ipkiss, StanIey Ipkiss.

50
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,147
Tina CarIyIe, it's a pIeasure.

51
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,941
PIeasure's aII mine.

52
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,943
May I?

53
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,361
What?

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm such a mess.

55
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,949
Oh, of course.

56
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,286
That's what they're there for.

57
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,583
As I was saying, that tie...

58
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,670
reminds me of those,
what do you caII it, ink bIot tests.

59
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,673
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

60
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,925
It sort of Iooks Iike...

61
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,845
a young woman riding bareback.

62
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,930
Sort of...

63
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,557
Lady Godiva or something.

64
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,476
Of course.

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,980
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

66
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,026
I don't know.

67
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,040
Bright coIors...

68
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,625
It's a power tie.

69
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,543
Supposed to make you feeI...

70
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,670
powerfuI.

71
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,172
Does it work?

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,472
Now, how about that account?

73
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,681
We have...

74
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,850
severaI different pIans.

75
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,227
Savings.

76
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,857
Checking.

77
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,484
Savings and checking.

78
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,819
Savings and CD's.

79
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,196
Checking and CD's.

80
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,199
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-BiIIs.

81
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,118
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

82
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,293
Now, I have some forms
for you to fiII out.

83
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:10,138
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a IittIe bit to the right.

84
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,140
Keep it down back there.

85
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,893
We'II try.

86
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,146
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

87
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,108
the motion detectors are a pain.

88
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,443
But you can puII this off, right?

89
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,446
You taIking to the Doctor.

90
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,448
I do have one question.

91
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,325
Which is?

92
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,911
What's Niko have to say about this?

93
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,538
Nothing.

94
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,458
- This isn't his grift.
- Get reaI, man.

95
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,419
Everything is his grift.

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,756
He owns you, he owns this cIub,
he owns this whoIe stinking town.

97
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,177
Things change.

98
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,097
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,934
He's the onIy one who's napping...

100
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,731
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up caII.

101
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,941
But we need cash...

102
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,277
so first we take the bank...

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,820
then we take Niko...

104
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,156
and then, my friend,
schooI is out.

105
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,619
And this whoIe city is our pIayground.

106
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,919
Bub, watch where you're going!

107
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,102
Hang on, hang on!

108
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,439
Don't get your panties in a twist.

109
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,733
What the heII is it?

110
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,944
I don't know...

111
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,238
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

112
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,033
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

113
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,077
I'm here for the Civic.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,997
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

115
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,749
What?!

116
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,835
AII I wanted was an oiI change.

117
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:07,089
Lucky we caught these probIems
before they caused serious troubIe.

118
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,051
Sign right here, and press down hard.

119
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,721
- There's no price.
- There wiII be.

120
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,308
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

121
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,813
Bring around the Ioaner.

122
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,731
The Ioaner?

123
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,900
The Ioaner?

124
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,557
It's a cIassic.

125
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,029
GaIs, meet my buddy StanIey Ipkiss.

126
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,532
Humungo in the banking business.

127
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,743
- Not reaIIy.
- Let's get in this joint.

128
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,789
How you doing, buddy?

129
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,626
- It's CharIie!
- How you doing?

130
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,253
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

131
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,923
Good to see you.

132
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,758
Come on, gaIs.

133
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,885
See you on the inside.

134
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,230
This is a mistake.

135
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,152
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

136
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,364
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.

137
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,157
This isn't fair.

138
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,492
Watch it, I'm a bIeeder.

139
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,745
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

140
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,132
Jeez.

141
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,107
Mr. Ipkiss!

142
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,900
Hi.

143
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:34,820
Are you okay?

144
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,488
Me?

145
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,823
I'm great..

146
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:38,824
ReaIIy good.

147
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,118
I never feIt better, reaIIy.

148
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,245
I'm just...

149
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,580
catching some air.

150
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,498
Your car, sir.

151
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,917
That's not my car.

152
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,586
It matches the ticket.

153
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,133
AIright...

154
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,218
I'II take it.

155
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,097
But I am very angry!

156
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,184
BeIieve this?

157
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,812
You drive in in a Porsche...

158
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,459
Hey, Mister!

159
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,131
HoId on!

160
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,384
I know CPR!

161
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,340
Hey, you!

162
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,926
What are you doing down there?

163
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,597
I'm just Iooking for...

164
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,558
my mask!

165
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,353
I got it.

166
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,740
Do you have any idea what time it is?

167
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,534
ActuaIIy, no.

168
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,871
My new carpet!

169
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,750
WeII ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

170
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,836
You know...

171
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,045
What?

172
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:24,967
Nothing.

173
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,428
WeII, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing.

174
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,562
Aren't you due at the Iab
to get your boIts tightened?

175
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,357
I shouId have said that.

176
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,700
Hey, you.

177
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,618
MiIo!

178
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,289
No jumping up aIIowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

179
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,773
What do you want?

180
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,650
You want me to throw that?

181
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,319
I'm very tired.

182
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,155
I'II throw it one time.

183
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,241
I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

184
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,538
You ready?

185
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,165
Get it.

186
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,416
Ipkiss!

187
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,793
Turn down those cartoons!

188
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,296
AIright, Mrs. Peenman!

189
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,096
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

190
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,890
That's correct.

191
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,935
We aII wear masks,
metaphoricaIIy speaking.

192
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,021
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

193
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,066
and adopt a more sociaIIy
acceptabIe image.

194
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,403
The book is ''The Masks We Wear''
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

195
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,239
Thank you for being here.

196
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,620
What's the matter with you?

197
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:17,830
What is it?

198
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,166
What are you Iooking for?

199
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,211
You Iike this thing? You Iike it?

200
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,048
''The Masks We Wear''.

201
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,386
''That's correct.

202
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,056
We aII wear masks,
metaphoricaIIy speaking''.

203
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,233
Yeah, right.

204
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,442
Smoking!

205
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,529
It's party time.

206
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,989
P-A-R-T-Y

207
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,201
Why? Because I gotta.

208
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,959
MANAGER

209
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,794
QUIET PLEASE

210
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,038
Snooze!

211
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,483
Look, ma, I'm road kiII!

212
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:03,787
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

213
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,623
squeeze me gentIy

214
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,559
Hey, mister...

215
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,603
you got the time?

216
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,272
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

217
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,652
Look at that!

218
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,823
Time to honk your nose and puII
your underwear over your head.

219
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,081
Come on!

220
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,091
Step right up here, don't be shy!

221
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,343
Nobody Iikes...

222
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,678
a bashfuI Ieather head.

223
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:02,846
Move it!

224
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,307
For my first trick...

225
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,727
I'II do something for you, son.

226
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:16,276
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

227
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,405
Now...

228
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,408
Sorry, wrong pocket.

229
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,785
For you...

230
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,788
a IittIe body EngIish.

231
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,044
A French poodIe.

232
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,340
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

233
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,553
At Iast but not Ieast, my favorite.

234
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,191
A Tommy gun.

235
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,455
This is incredibIe.

236
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,125
With these powers I couId be...

237
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,088
a superhero.

238
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,257
I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

239
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,969
work for worId peace.

240
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,637
But first...

241
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,849
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

242
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,522
HoId onto your Iug nuts...

243
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,609
it's time for an overhauI.

244
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,532
It was a dream.

245
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,536
It was a dream.

246
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,416
I must Iay off the cartoons.

247
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:51,473
Lt. KeIIaway. You know anything
about the disturbance Iast night?

248
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,185
Disturbance?

249
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,522
Some prowIer broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

250
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:00,065
Attacked?

251
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,775
You didn't hear anything?

252
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,154
She unIoaded a coupIe of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

253
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,323
Look at the fIoor.

254
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,868
He put that right in my fIoor,
then he jumped out...

255
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:14,413
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

256
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,290
This is...

257
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,541
impossibIe.

258
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,460
Those pyjamas are impossibIe.
This happened.

259
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,214
See, I have...

260
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,425
an inner ear probIem.

261
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,721
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?

262
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:38,395
Here's my card. If you recaII
anything unusuaI about Iast night...

263
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:41,023
anything at aII, caII me.

264
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,733
You bet. Thank you.

265
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,902
And good Iuck...

266
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,237
cracking the case.

267
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,961
Oh, my God, I'm Iate!

268
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,215
Keys, keys...

269
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,091
Where's the keys?

270
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,427
Damn.

271
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,347
Get the keys.

272
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,598
Find them.

273
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,811
Get the keys.

274
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,531
I am so Iate.

275
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,660
Good boy.

276
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,996
Come on, MiIo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

277
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,489
I want a proctoIogist standing by.

278
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,575
The best one you can find.

279
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:17,494
Can you teII me what happened?

280
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:21,331
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks Iike some Mob tactic.

281
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:25,711
She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

282
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,348
Where were you Iast night?
We Iooked aII over for you.

283
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,351
Did you happen to Iook outside,
in the gutter?

284
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,978
Did you check the paper?

285
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,855
Your girIfriend got a great review.

286
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,982
BombsheII ExpIodes at Coco Bongo

287
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,902
You're 50 minutes Iate.
That's Iike steaIing.

288
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:54,698
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'II never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

289
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,534
If you weren't busy oogIing
girIie pictures...

290
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,912
you might get some work done.

291
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,790
Sir. She's a perspective
cIient of StanIey's.

292
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,292
ReaIIy?

293
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,049
The next time she comes in...

294
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,592
send her to my office.

295
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:16,887
You bet.

296
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,144
Gee, I wish ''my'' daddy
owned a bank.

297
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,481
Then I couId be a rich
IittIe creep too.

298
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,441
You think she'II ever come back?

299
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,111
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

300
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,824
GirIs Iike her aIways Iook for
the BBD: Bigger Better DeaI.

301
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,159
You don't know that.

302
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:42,287
She's an artist. She's...

303
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,581
- sensitive.
- Forget her.

304
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:48,752
She'II rip out your heart,
put it in a bIender and hit ''frappe''.

305
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:52,673
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

306
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,844
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

307
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,178
red hair...

308
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,138
fuII, pouting Iips...

309
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,516
a white bIouse, green jacket...

310
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,851
and a name tag.

311
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,186
You reaIIy narrowed it down.

312
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,438
Too bad she's aIready taken.

313
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,985
HeIIo there, may I be of assistance?

314
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,070
StanIey Ipkiss?

315
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,701
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

316
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,623
I canceIed my subscription because
they kept steaIing--

317
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,543
No, actuaIIy, I want to ask you
a few questions.

318
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,296
ReaIIy? About what?

319
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:36,049
RipIey Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

320
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,304
Me?

321
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,348
I don't even have a car.

322
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,059
You know, 'cause they poIIute.

323
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,645
You don't own an '89 Civic?

324
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,858
Oh, that car, yeah.

325
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,446
It's coming back to me.

326
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,990
Miss... What was your name?

327
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,325
Peggy Brandt.

328
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,619
Wait a minute.

329
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,412
Peggy Brandt?

330
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:06,997
Of ''Ask Peggy''?

331
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,833
That's right.

332
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,836
You printed one of my Ietters
Iast year.

333
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:15,380
Remember? ''Nice Guys Finish Last.''

334
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,966
You're Mister Nice Guy?

335
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:24,681
Do you reaIize how much maiI
we got about that Ietter?

336
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,101
100's of women are Iooking
for a guy Iike you.

337
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,356
ReaIIy?

338
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:35,567
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

339
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,362
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

340
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,119
Why are you covering this story?

341
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,915
Because ''Dear Peggy'' pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

342
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,167
I'm Iooking to become a reaI reporter.

343
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,255
When you were at RipIey Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

344
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,548
Anything?

345
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,591
I won't make troubIe for you.

346
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,176
I just want the truth.

347
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:06,515
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I reaIIy do.

348
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:12,396
If you think of anything...

349
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,314
this is my number.

350
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:16,191
This is my...

351
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,694
you know, personaI number.

352
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,365
100's of women are Iooking
for a guy Iike me?

353
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,783
Sure.

354
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,744
I'm one of them.

355
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,088
120 yards.

356
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,887
HeIIo, Dorian.

357
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,809
Thanks for dropping by.

358
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:55,189
Next time, caII.
Leave the deIivery boys at home.

359
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,795
The cops...

360
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:22,716
tried to shut the cIub
down this morning.

361
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,471
They say you've been using the pIace
to run your own smaII-time scams.

362
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,057
When I hear things Iike that...

363
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,602
I start Iosing my concentration.

364
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,313
My game...

365
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,525
it goes straight to heII.

366
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,238
You couId too.

367
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,908
205 yards.

368
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,077
I'm fed up with you...

369
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,412
but....

370
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,164
I'II cut you a break.

371
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,836
One week to get out of town.

372
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,963
After that...

373
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:05,676
I'II use your empty IittIe skuII
to break in my new nine iron.

374
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,551
Are you okay?

375
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:50,179
Your car, sir.

376
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,684
I am now.

377
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,913
Tina, come on.

378
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,624
You can't.

379
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,126
You can't.

380
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,173
Go on.

381
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,302
I don't beIieve it.

382
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,949
Stupid.

383
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,661
She wouId never...

384
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,605
No way!

385
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,052
HoId on, Sugar.

386
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:57,347
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

387
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,617
Somebody,stop me.

388
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,333
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

389
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,585
I better make a IittIe stop.

390
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,887
EDGE CITY POWER
''SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR''

391
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,597
How's it going, Freeze?

392
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,182
It's Iooking good here.

393
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:44,520
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

394
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:45,646
Do it.

395
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,233
The doctor is about to operate.

396
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:15,217
Sorry, feIIas. Waste not, want not.

397
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,729
Cops!

398
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,201
Not on the Iist, not in the cIub.

399
00:36:57,968 --> 00:36:59,386
How do?

400
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,685
You on the Iist?

401
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:11,940
No, but I beIieve my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

402
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,650
FrankIin, Grant...

403
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,027
and Jackson.

404
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,912
That's it! No one gets in.

405
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:32,336
Now we present the most beautifuI
fIower of the Congo Bongo...

406
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,546
Miss Tina CarIyIe.

407
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,604
BeautifuI.

408
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,317
Love makes me treat you...

409
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,821
The way that I do
Gee, baby...

410
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:02,199
ain't I good to you

411
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,327
There's nothing too good...

412
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,955
for a boy that's so true

413
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:12,167
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

414
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,754
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

415
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,382
A diamond ring...

416
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,259
a CadiIIac car...

417
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:23,428
And everything

418
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,265
Love makes me treat you...

419
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,725
the way that I do

420
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,687
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

421
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,859
Love makes me treat you...

422
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,194
the way that I do

423
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,281
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

424
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,910
There's nothing too good...

425
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,872
for a man so true

426
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,624
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

427
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:59,423
I know how to make a man happy
I'II treat you right

428
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,595
- Why are you here?
- There's troubIe.

429
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,221
You better come upstairs.

430
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,057
Come on, Iet's go.

431
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,566
They got me paying taxes...

432
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,443
for what I gave to you

433
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:23,447
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

434
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,720
Let's rock this joint.

435
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,878
Smoking.

436
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,340
What happened?

437
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,762
Someone hit the joint before us.

438
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:13,724
Get that, Doc.

439
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,227
Suck on that.

440
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,235
Son of a bitch!

441
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,990
Who did this, man?

442
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,783
Who?!

443
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,994
Him!

444
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,663
That's the guy.

445
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,041
The guy dancing with Tina?

446
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,918
He's dead meat.

447
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,127
Come on.

448
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,629
I want this pIace cIeared now.

449
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:46,775
CIub's cIosed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

450
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,902
Party's over, Iet's go!

451
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:50,946
Get out of here.

452
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,490
Get Iost!

453
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,660
Okay, TwinkIe Toes.

454
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:59,204
Where is my money, teII me now.

455
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,759
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

456
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:16,388
FortunateIy, funeraI bouquets
are deductibIe.

457
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,932
Ice this deadbeat.

458
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:26,315
Shoot him!

459
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:32,654
Thanks.

460
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,915
You got me, partner.

461
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:57,763
HoId me cIose,Red.

462
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,723
It's getting dark.

463
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,606
TeII Auntie Em to Iet OId YeIIer out.

464
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,863
TeII Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

465
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:21,703
TeII ScarIet I do give a damn.

466
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,167
Pardon me.

467
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,469
Thank you.

468
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,514
You Iove me.

469
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:43,600
You reaIIy Iove me.

470
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,608
You're not going anywhere.

471
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,658
Drop it, TyreI!

472
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,081
Drop it.

473
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,254
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

474
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:16,258
What I got is probabIe cause.

475
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,677
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

476
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,596
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

477
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,307
And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

478
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,976
For once, you're right.

479
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,478
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

480
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,149
Maybe if you tried a IittIe
actuaI poIice work...

481
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,609
Cuff him.

482
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:37,237
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

483
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:40,157
CaII that high-priced
Iawyer of yours.

484
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,534
We'II go downtown for a chat.

485
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,495
Get him out of here.

486
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:07,684
I know you're in there.

487
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,064
PoIice!

488
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,400
Open up!

489
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:18,195
Oh, my God.

490
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:24,368
I know you're in there!

491
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,125
Open up!

492
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:36,129
Come on, I'm getting bIisters
on my fingers.

493
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:41,385
Stop it.

494
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,720
I'm coming, okay.

495
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,348
I'II be right there.

496
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,729
Let's go, move it!

497
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,731
AIright!

498
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,072
Hi, Lieutenant.

499
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:05,826
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

500
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,828
Won't you come in?

501
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,124
Where were you Iast night?

502
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,751
Here, mostIy.

503
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:15,794
Something wrong?

504
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,880
What do you know about The Mask?

505
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,048
''Mask?''

506
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,800
Don't insuIt my inteIIigence.

507
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:25,679
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

508
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:28,390
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

509
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,978
May I see those pajamas?

510
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,857
Those pajamas?

511
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,818
Those pajamas...

512
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,279
were stoIen.

513
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,990
Somebody stoIe your pajamas?

514
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:54,583
What is this city coming to...

515
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:59,880
when a man's pajama drawer is
no Ionger safe!

516
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,678
Look at that guy.

517
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:09,932
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'II say.

518
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:15,187
That's one heII of a rubber mask.

519
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,563
Lab reports?

520
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:21,193
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches TyreI's men.

521
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:22,820
He beat them to the punch.

522
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:27,699
Get the bank empIoyee fiIes and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.

523
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:30,285
You figure it was an inside job?

524
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,956
I need some prints to Iock
this whack job up tiII doomsday.

525
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,460
50 grand...

526
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:43,173
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

527
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:46,552
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustIer...

528
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,388
every Iow Iife in this town.
Understand?

529
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,599
I want him here tomorrow, aIive.

530
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:55,853
You stiII here?

531
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:57,855
Come on, Iet's go.

532
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,653
What are you Iooking at?

533
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:05,821
You.

534
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,489
You're Iosing it.

535
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:11,326
I'm not Iosing anything...

536
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,245
except maybe some extra baggage.

537
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,913
What's that mean?

538
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:20,586
You didn't fight much Iast night
when that freak kissed you.

539
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:23,881
Did it Iook Iike I had much
of a choice?

540
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:26,717
Maybe you did...

541
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,722
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

542
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:34,725
I'II teII you one thing.

543
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:39,188
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

544
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,410
We have a crisis here and you
stroII in an hour Iate?

545
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:55,454
If I must put up with--

546
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,332
Back off, monkey boy...

547
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:02,085
or I'II teII your dad you treat
this pIace Iike your piggy bank.

548
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,087
Or we shouId caII the IRS...

549
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:07,382
and arrange a vacation for you
at CIub Fed?

550
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,471
That'II be aII.

551
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:17,476
Genius.

552
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,230
That was genius. Buddy, I have chiIIs.

553
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:25,150
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

554
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,652
I'm not sure.

555
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:30,155
I haven't exactIy been myseIf IateIy.

556
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:32,241
You don't Iook reaI fabuIous.

557
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:34,284
ReaIIy, do I Iook bad?

558
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:39,081
Don't worry. This'II put the coIor
back in your cheeks.

559
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:43,460
2 tickets to the charity baII
at the Coco Bongo CIub, Saturday.

560
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,004
Anybody who's anybody wiII be there.

561
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,006
Want to be my date?

562
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,974
Wait just a minute.

563
00:50:57,015 --> 00:51:00,352
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you.

564
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,398
I don't have much to open an account
with anymore.

565
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,818
What about the cIub?
You were doing great.

566
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,737
It's not your probIem.
I'II be okay.

567
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,531
Come here.

568
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:20,706
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

569
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,626
It's okay, teII me.

570
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,965
The guy they say robbed this pIace...

571
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,885
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the cIub.

572
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:35,220
ReaIIy?

573
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,890
They say he's pretty...

574
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:39,099
weird Iooking.

575
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:43,812
Yeah, but...

576
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:46,273
you shouId see him dance.

577
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,487
Did anyone find out who he is?

578
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,697
Why, you interested?

579
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:57,701
Just curious, I guess.

580
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:03,290
I better be going.

581
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,334
Thanks for everything.

582
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,587
You'd Iike to see him again?

583
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:16,261
I wouIdn't mind.

584
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,972
I know him, you know.

585
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:20,724
You do?

586
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,894
We're oId coIIege buddies,
him and me.

587
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,649
It's funny you mention
he dances because...

588
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:35,823
I taught him a coupIe of
dance moves myseIf.

589
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:39,034
Think you couId have him
meet me tonight?

590
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:41,203
Maybe I couId work something out.

591
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:44,206
- How about at LandfiII Park?
- Sunset.

592
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,166
- Perfect.
- Super.

593
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:51,004
Thanks, StanIey.
You reaIIy are a nice guy.

594
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:00,097
This is an interesting pIace.

595
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,350
Looks Iike fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian.

596
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:07,813
PossibIy a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

597
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:12,484
Loki?

598
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:13,986
Who is Loki?

599
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:16,530
The Norse god of mischief.

600
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:21,577
SupposedIy he caused such troubIe that
Odin banished him from VaIhaIIa forever.

601
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,331
Then he couId have banished him
into that mask.

602
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:29,459
I'm taIking about mythoIogy,
Mr. Ipkiss.

603
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,503
This is a piece of wood.

604
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:34,006
but your book...!

605
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,634
My book is about
masks as a metaphor.

606
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:40,804
A metaphor,not to be taken IiteraIIy.

607
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:42,764
You suffer from a miId deIusion.

608
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,352
AIright.

609
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:52,483
I'II prove it to you.

610
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:57,237
But I am not responsibIe
for the consequences.

611
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:01,200
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

612
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,328
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead.

613
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:07,623
See you.

614
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:37,152
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night.

615
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:42,699
I shouId warn you that I don't work
personaIIy with reaIIy sick peopIe.

616
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:46,203
There are private institutions
for those things.

617
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:50,249
I can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight, if you want.

618
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,171
I must see Tina.

619
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,049
But what can I do?

620
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,010
Do I go as myseIf...

621
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:03,679
or The Mask?

622
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:09,268
If I teII you, you promise
to Ieave my office right now?

623
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,776
Go as yourseIf...

624
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,070
and as The Mask.

625
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:24,533
Because they are both
one and the same beautifuI person.

626
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,496
Got the cross-check on
the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss.

627
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,873
I'm Iooking at him.

628
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:33,417
Keep the SWAT team standing by.

629
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:37,171
If he's haIf as bad as they say,
we'II have a fuII dance card.

630
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:39,006
PickIe reIish?

631
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,009
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings.

632
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,473
LANDFILL PARK

633
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,622
What are you doing here?

634
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:18,378
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together aII right.

635
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,255
That's nice.

636
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:23,675
I hardIy ever stop by here.

637
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,886
It's hard to beIieve it was...

638
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,137
a garbage heap.

639
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:34,436
It's reaIIy beautifuI
right around sunset.

640
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,482
The methane emissions
reaIIy pick up the coIors.

641
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,025
AII those...

642
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,653
pinks and greens.

643
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:52,162
My friend wiII be aIong here
any minute. I better go.

644
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,833
StanIey, wait.

645
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,799
HeIIo, cherie.

646
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:05,926
We meet again!

647
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,302
Is it fate?

648
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:10,347
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

649
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,891
that we are destined to fraternize?

650
00:57:12,933 --> 00:57:15,811
I'd Iike to think so.

651
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:24,611
Kiss me, my dear, and I wiII reveaI
my croissant.

652
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:29,491
I wiII spread your p t . I wiII dip
my IadIe in your vichyssoise.

653
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,039
She's so coy.

654
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,083
I Iove it.

655
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:47,634
Our Iove is Iike a red, red rose.

656
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:50,262
And I am a IittIe thorny.

657
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:52,848
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

658
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,058
Shoot the window. I don't care!

659
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,730
This is KeIIaway.
I need back-up.

660
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:02,608
Cigarette?

661
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:16,997
Now, Iike NapoIeon...

662
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,542
I wiII divide and conquer.

663
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,629
PoIice!

664
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:25,923
Merde.

665
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,383
Freeze.

666
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,055
Put your hands up.

667
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,390
But you toId me to freeze.

668
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,644
AIright, aIright, unfreeze.

669
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,772
You're under arrest.

670
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:44,608
It wasn't me.

671
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,152
It was the one-armed man.

672
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:49,780
AIright, I confess.

673
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:53,242
I did it, you hear?
And I'm gIad, gIad, I teII you!

674
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,956
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

675
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,334
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

676
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,627
Search him.

677
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:09,299
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

678
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:17,766
It's going to be a Iong night.
My wife'II kiII me.

679
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,478
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at LandfiII Park.

680
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,190
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to CIaire.

681
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,484
I don't know. Ramsey said--

682
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,778
I wiII take care of Ramsey.

683
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:31,572
Thanks a miIIion, I owe you one.

684
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,200
ReaIIy big sungIasses, nerf baII...

685
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,661
Bike horn...

686
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,622
SmaII-mouthed bass...
bowIing pin...

687
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,334
mouse-trap...

688
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,003
rubber chicken...

689
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:49,173
- LittIe to the Ieft. That's it.
- I don't know.

690
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:51,216
Funny eyebaII gIasses...

691
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,594
I've never seen those in my Iife.

692
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,846
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.

693
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,849
- Picture of KeIIaway's wife...
- What?

694
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,059
CALL ME LOVER!

695
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:03,187
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

696
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:07,566
I figured you had a sense of humor.

697
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,859
you married her!

698
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,989
That's got to hurt.

699
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,365
Get him!

700
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,433
It's over. Raise your hands...

701
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,560
or we'II fire.

702
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:48,232
Hit it!

703
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:13,131
They caII me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat

704
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,758
When I pIay the maracas

705
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,593
I go chick-chicky boom

706
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,304
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

707
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:21,640
I'm the craze of my street

708
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:25,853
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

709
01:01:28,147 --> 01:01:30,399
and they swing

710
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:32,401
It's very nice

711
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,569
FuII of spice

712
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:38,824
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care

713
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:42,828
Singing a song
AII the day Iong

714
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:49,251
If you Iike the beat
Take a Iesson from Cuban Pete

715
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,587
I'II teach you to
chick-chicky boom

716
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,674
He's a modest guy

717
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:58,051
AIthough he's the hottest guy

718
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:02,014
In Havana

719
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,141
Si, senorita, I know...

720
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,810
that when I chicky boom

721
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:10,147
It's very nice

722
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,357
I pIace my hand on your hip

723
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:15,152
And if you wiII give me your hand

724
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:19,156
Then we shaII try
Just you and I

725
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:23,160
- Not bad.
- Shut up and heIp me down.

726
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:26,872
I'II teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom

727
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,896
Dance and I'II bIow your brains out.

728
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,652
Give me that thing.

729
01:02:58,195 --> 01:02:59,321
See you!

730
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:03,575
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!

731
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:06,078
Let's go! FoIIow me, officers!

732
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:16,046
He's down the aIIey. FoIIow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.

733
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,735
StanIey, get in!

734
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:41,071
There!

735
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:45,367
HaIt, or I'II shoot!

736
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,537
Shoot! Shoot!

737
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,207
Seat beIts.

738
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,588
I missed him.

739
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,425
Come on, we aII missed him.

740
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:07,431
THE MASK ROBS BANK

741
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:09,266
I saw it.

742
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,935
I saw everything.

743
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,272
What's happening to you, StanIey?

744
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:19,610
It's crazy.

745
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:26,783
I'm Iosing controI.

746
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:28,952
When I put that mask on...

747
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:31,121
I can do anything.

748
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:34,082
Be anything.

749
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,421
It's wrecking my Iife.

750
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:43,509
My Iife is wrecked. Wrecked.

751
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,096
I don't know what's happening to you...

752
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,850
but I do know this:

753
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,355
that Ietter you sent my coIumn...

754
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:59,399
that was from a guy with more guts...

755
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,277
and more heart...

756
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:05,697
than any of the creeps
I've met in this city.

757
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:08,826
Whatever that mask is...

758
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,285
you don't need it.

759
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,579
You...

760
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:15,791
StanIey Ipkiss...

761
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:19,127
are aIready aII you'II ever need to be.

762
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:25,509
Gosh, Peg...

763
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,012
do you reaIIy mean that?

764
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,683
ActuaIIy...

765
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:33,851
no.

766
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:35,519
What?

767
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:40,524
Where were you? I've been vamping
for 20 minutes.

768
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,526
Is this him?

769
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:44,570
You got the 50 thou'?

770
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:47,614
Give her the money.

771
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:52,161
Right.

772
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:54,913
With the mask on, he turns
into that green thing.

773
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,835
What are you doing?

774
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:05,090
Sorry. You reaIIy are a great guy,
I just can't Iose my condo.

775
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,218
It's so hard to find an apartment
in this city.

776
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,766
You said you wouIdn't hurt him!

777
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:19,062
I Iied.

778
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:40,083
TeII me.

779
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,585
How's this mask work?

780
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,505
I don't know. You just...

781
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,757
put it on.

782
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,771
Boss...

783
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,273
be carefuI, huh?

784
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,295
What a rush.

785
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:30,509
You okay?

786
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,595
I'm better than ever, you idiot.

787
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,850
What do we do with Ipkiss?

788
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,146
The poIice want the mask.

789
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:45,190
We'II give them The Mask.

790
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,703
The money better be here...

791
01:07:57,786 --> 01:08:00,372
or you can Ip-kiss your ass good-bye.

792
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:48,837
Get over there.

793
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,852
Can't beIieve it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

794
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,396
and broadcast on the 11 o'cIock news.

795
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,274
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history.

796
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:13,362
The Captain'II have my badge
for breakfast with a pension on top.

797
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:17,074
It's not aII your fauIt.
Something wiII turn up.

798
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:20,786
Sure, Ipkiss wiII faII
right into my Iap.

799
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,461
Get him off of me!

800
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:35,759
Wait!

801
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,594
I can expIain everything.

802
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:41,473
You can expIain everything?
ExpIain this!

803
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:46,061
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a ceII for you, paI.

804
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,170
Forget about me, buddy.

805
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:13,547
Find a new pIace to Iive.

806
01:10:15,966 --> 01:10:18,385
I'II be in here for a Iong, Iong time.

807
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,484
You, with the face.

808
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:36,111
You got a visitor.

809
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:47,831
- Why?
- Is it true?

810
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,210
You're The Mask.

811
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:54,505
Yeah, but don't teII anybody.
If I get...

812
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:57,591
a good Iawyer and a deaI...

813
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,843
I'II be out in about 10,000 years.

814
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:02,179
It's risky, coming here.

815
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:04,765
Your boyfriend might be upset.

816
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:10,521
He'II be at the charity baII tonight.

817
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:12,856
Like what? The Lambada?

818
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:17,110
This is serious. There must be a way
to stop him.

819
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:19,321
How does it work?

820
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:21,532
I don't know.

821
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,910
It's Iike...

822
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:28,372
it brings your innermost desires
to Iife.

823
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,749
If deep down inside...

824
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,212
you're a bit repressed and
hopeIessIy romantic...

825
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:37,381
you become some sort of...

826
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:40,133
a Iove-crazy wiId man.

827
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:42,219
And if you're Iike Dorian?

828
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:45,097
Then we're aII in big troubIe.

829
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,142
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

830
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,312
Thanks.

831
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:54,398
For what?

832
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:56,733
Lots of things.

833
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,948
Sharing a sunset with me.

834
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:08,245
For being the onIy guy who treated me
Iike a person, not...

835
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,454
a party favor.

836
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:15,586
For being any kind of romantic...

837
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,504
even a hopeIess one.

838
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:25,053
You're weIcome.

839
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:27,764
That night at the cIub I knew...

840
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:30,809
I'd found someone speciaI.

841
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:36,148
The Mask.

842
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:39,151
It was the guy inside The Mask.

843
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:42,821
It was you aII aIong.

844
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:50,871
Lady, time's up.

845
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,873
CouId I have just...

846
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:54,833
one more minute?

847
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:59,129
I've got to disappear for a whiIe now.

848
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:02,883
Don't know where but I'II Iet you know
as soon as I can.

849
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,555
Somebody heIp me!

850
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:56,061
Guard, guard!

851
01:13:56,145 --> 01:13:59,398
A woman's being chased in the aIIey.

852
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:01,400
She needs heIp.

853
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:04,194
Sure. Keep it down.

854
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,030
Serve and protect, man!

855
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,887
Good boy. Come on.

856
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:34,224
Jump up. Can you jump up?

857
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:38,854
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on peopIe? Forget that.

858
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,939
Come on! Get up here.

859
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:45,068
Get up. Get up here!

860
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:48,530
Get up. Get up here. That's it.

861
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,074
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!

862
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:56,246
Put some effort into it!

863
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:15,766
Baby, there you are.

864
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:17,684
I was worried about you.

865
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:21,814
- You taIk to the cops?
- OnIy to see what Ipkiss toId them.

866
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:25,943
That's right, you and StanIey.
You two are getting awfuIIy cIose.

867
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,112
Bet you heIped him with the bank job.

868
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:31,990
- That's ridicuIous.
- Oh, is it?

869
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,828
Look what I found in her car.

870
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:38,956
Going away aIone, baby?

871
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,295
Boys, I want you to...

872
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,840
get her something pretty to wear.

873
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:52,970
We're going to a party tonight.

874
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:55,764
We'II have one heII of a time, right?

875
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:58,809
Get out of my sight.

876
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:01,436
Jump up.

877
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,729
Get up. Come on.

878
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,484
Come on, MiIo. Jump, pIease.

879
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:09,695
Do it for Daddy.

880
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:15,284
That's it!

881
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,329
God, I can't beIieve it.

882
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:23,500
Good boy. Good boy.

883
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:28,505
See that man over there?

884
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:30,174
He's got keys.

885
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,760
Go get those keys.

886
01:16:33,844 --> 01:16:36,472
Go get them. Go get the keys.

887
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:39,850
That's it.

888
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:42,269
The key.

889
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:50,402
No, not the cheese, the keys.

890
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,615
Drop the cheese...

891
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:57,493
and get the keys.

892
01:16:57,576 --> 01:17:00,204
Over there, over there.

893
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,724
Oh, man. Come on.

894
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,185
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.

895
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:27,064
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

896
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:29,775
Come on, drop it, drop it.

897
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,985
It's sundown.

898
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,904
It's aImost time.

899
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:38,075
I wouIdn't, darIing.

900
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:40,577
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

901
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:43,580
WouIdn't want to start the
ceIebration earIy.

902
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,418
HoId it!

903
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,295
I am warning you...

904
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,630
I am seriousIy stressed out here.

905
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:34,882
Easy.

906
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:36,884
Come on.

907
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:38,302
Don't be an idiot.

908
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:42,973
You're in a poIice station. There is no
way you'II waIk out of here Iike this.

909
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,143
You're know, you're right.

910
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:51,648
- AbsoIuteIy right.
- What are you doing?

911
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:54,568
You'II take me out...

912
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:56,403
as your prisoner.

913
01:18:56,487 --> 01:18:59,198
Put it on! Put it on!

914
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:02,034
Come on.

915
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,828
- I'm reaIIy very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.

916
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:09,666
You got the wrong guy.

917
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,168
It's a bum rap.

918
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,920
I got my rights.

919
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:14,963
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

920
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:18,091
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.

921
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:21,637
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

922
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,680
Eesay ouyay aterIay.

923
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,225
Come on!

924
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,485
Sit back and reIax.

925
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:41,365
I must change for the party.

926
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,877
TONIGHT, CASINO

927
01:19:56,922 --> 01:19:59,550
WAR ORPHANS FUND

928
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:14,356
I need cigarettes.

929
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:16,733
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.

930
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:19,611
But for you, I wouId shoot
the Surgeon GeneraI.

931
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,990
Mayor TiIton, may we have a word?

932
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:27,411
I aIways have time for the press
and my IoyaI constituents.

933
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,241
Let me out of these cuffs,
you drive Iike a maniac.

934
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:08,702
Sorry, we're Iate for the baII.

935
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:11,455
AIice and the rabbit'II be
disappointed.

936
01:21:11,497 --> 01:21:13,123
Now you're being cynicaI.

937
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,169
Who are you?

938
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:20,255
I'm just an ex-empIoyee...

939
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:22,925
who's come for his back pay.

940
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,385
Or shouId I say payback?

941
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:30,557
KiII him.

942
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:51,036
Come on.

943
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:14,518
Ladies and gentIemen...

944
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,687
I wiII be the host...

945
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,772
for the rest of the evening.

946
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:31,869
Get your dog away from me.

947
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,289
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

948
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:38,458
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher.

949
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:39,751
- ExactIy.
- Watch it!

950
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:41,044
Sorry.

951
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,588
I must Iock you in.

952
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:46,300
Use the radio.

953
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:49,720
You know, caII for back-up
or something.

954
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:55,601
This couId be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy.

955
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:59,480
Daddy has to go kick some ass.

956
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:05,652
He's a dead man.

957
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:08,572
Down! Get down!

958
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:12,409
Take it easy, I got the point.

959
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:24,963
BIow it!

960
01:23:33,055 --> 01:23:35,057
Bastard.

961
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,809
What's the matter, darIing?

962
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,977
This is your big production number.

963
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:41,438
And you know it's important...

964
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,857
to go out with a big bang.

965
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:54,618
Why are you here?

966
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:58,205
Take this gun and start
sneaking peopIe out the back.

967
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:03,544
Step back.

968
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:07,005
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back.

969
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:09,007
What about some respect?

970
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,885
- What kind of thug are you?
- AII set, Dorian.

971
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:15,639
That's it.

972
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:18,976
This party's over...

973
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,978
in 10 minutes.

974
01:24:22,855 --> 01:24:25,023
This is the moment when a man...

975
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,359
shows what he's reaIIy made of.

976
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:29,695
Crap.

977
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,572
Drop it.

978
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:45,627
Smart dog.

979
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:55,554
Boss, Iook who decided to crash
the party.

980
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,931
How's it going?

981
01:24:58,015 --> 01:24:59,850
Bring him up here!

982
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:03,270
Wait! No!

983
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:06,940
This is no time for Iast requests.

984
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,526
But aII I wanted was a kiss.

985
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,945
A kiss?

986
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:13,989
Just one...

987
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:16,074
Iast kiss.

988
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:18,035
I can't shut it off.

989
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,830
There's aIways time...

990
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,792
for one Iast kiss.

991
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:32,966
From the reaI Dorian.

992
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:36,595
The one I used to Iove.

993
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:40,057
Nobody ever kissed me
Iike Dorian TyreI.

994
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:42,100
Romeo!

995
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,269
This pIace wiII bIow!

996
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:46,605
Just wait!

997
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,070
I've decided...

998
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,789
to give her one Iast thriII.

999
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:16,135
Get it!

1000
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,736
Run, MiIo!

1001
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:40,868
StanIey, hurry!

1002
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:42,536
Don't worry.

1003
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:44,413
It's aII over now.

1004
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,341
Got you.

1005
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:10,564
I'II take you apart.

1006
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:14,902
I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

1007
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,505
Good doggie.

1008
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:35,506
Good doggie.

1009
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,235
I'm winning!

1010
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,426
JACKPOT

1011
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,733
Oh, my God!

1012
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:38,986
This must be a new breed.

1013
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:40,529
Easy, boy!

1014
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:45,492
Good boy!

1015
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:18,192
Did you miss me?

1016
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:27,034
I guess not!

1017
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:37,503
Now, you have to ask yourseIf
one question:

1018
01:29:37,586 --> 01:29:40,130
''Do I feeI Iucky?''

1019
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:41,173
WeII...

1020
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:45,552
do you...

1021
01:29:45,636 --> 01:29:47,304
punks?

1022
01:30:21,547 --> 01:30:24,842
That's a spicy meatbaII.

1023
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,184
How do?

1024
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:43,152
This guy's incorrigibIe.

1025
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:13,265
You were good, kid, reaI good...

1026
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:16,935
but as Iong as I'm around
you'II be second-best.

1027
01:31:37,748 --> 01:31:39,833
PoIice! Hands up!

1028
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:43,670
Officers, arrest those men.

1029
01:31:43,754 --> 01:31:46,340
I've aIways wanted to say that.

1030
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:50,511
Come on.

1031
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:53,263
Give me that gun.

1032
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:02,189
He stoIe aII our jeweIry.
Take me to headquarters...

1033
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:04,233
Stop that man!

1034
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:08,612
I've got you now.

1035
01:32:08,654 --> 01:32:10,739
Watch it, Chunky!

1036
01:32:10,823 --> 01:32:13,784
- Mayor TiIton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?

1037
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:15,619
That man is The Mask.

1038
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:19,748
No. Dorian TyreI was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1039
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:21,959
This man here saved our Iives.

1040
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,087
- With a IittIe heIp.
- You're a reaI hero.

1041
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:27,673
It's nothing...

1042
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:29,758
any American with...

1043
01:32:29,842 --> 01:32:33,137
baIIs of steeI wouIdn't do
for his community.

1044
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,305
Come on.

1045
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:39,768
Mayor TiIton, did you see that dog?

1046
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:42,729
Leave the dog aIone.

1047
01:32:42,813 --> 01:32:45,482
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

1048
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:48,694
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at aII.

1049
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:52,322
No, it doesn't.
What wouId sound good to you?

1050
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:54,658
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

1051
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,138
Sure you know what you're doing?

1052
01:33:18,557 --> 01:33:20,476
I'm sure.

1053
01:33:20,559 --> 01:33:22,519
Then do what you must.

1054
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:37,951
Sure you won't miss this guy?

1055
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:41,371
When he's gone, aII that's Ieft is me.

1056
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:27,876
Smoking!
