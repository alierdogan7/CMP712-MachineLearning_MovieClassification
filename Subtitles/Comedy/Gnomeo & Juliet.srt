Lovingly cooked by BakeMaster

4
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,099
(Audience talking)

5
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:06,318
(Orchestra tuning up)

6
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,158
(Baton tapping)

7
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,270
(People whispering...shhh)

8
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:18,600
(Feet pitter pattering on floor)

9
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,703
(Clears throat)

10
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:22,708
The story you are about to see,
has been told before.

11
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:24,352
A lot.

12
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,833
And now we are going to tell it, again.

13
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,349
But different.

14
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:30,693
It's about two star crossed lovers,

15
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,503
kept apart by a big feud.

16
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:35,179
No one knows how this feud started,

17
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,652
but it's all quite entertaining.

18
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:40,106
Unfortunately, before we begin.

19
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:43,944
There is a rather long boring prologue,
which I will read to you now.

20
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,135
(Clears throat)

21
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:47,962
Two households.

22
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,862
Both alike in dignity.

23
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,429
In fair Verona.

24
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,971
Where we lay our scene.

25
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,670
From ancient grudge.
Break to new mutiny.

26
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,730
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

27
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:06,319
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.

28
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,360
Mr. Capulet: Ah Miss. Montague.
How you just love to ruin my day.

29
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,310
Miss Montague: My Sisters dear cardigan.
Mr. Capulet, it suits you.

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,195
-Capulet: Feisty old hag.
-Montague: Grumbly old codger.

31
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,206
(Horns honk)

32
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,258
Oink...oink

33
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,149
(Rooster crows)

34
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,112
(Rooster crows in distance)

35
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,582
(Grunts)

36
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,374
Oh, great.

37
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,469
(Man shouts, falls from roof)

38
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,123
Sniff...sniff.

39
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,155
(Stretching sounds)

40
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,502
I got one! I got one!

41
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,277
I got one! I got one!

42
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,429
(Moans) Oh.

43
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,616
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.

44
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,847
*Background music 'Crocodile Rock'*

45
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,269
(Gagging)

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
Huh, Tybalt!

47
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,625
(Choking)

48
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,554
Hold on. Blues are at it again.

49
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:53,663
(Pop!)

50
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,382
Lady Blueberry: Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.

51
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,833
Lady Blueberry

52
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,996
Your tulips are looking a little limp this
year, aren't they.

53
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,758
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.

54
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,573
The proper word is 'insinuating'.

55
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,046
Illiterate.

56
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,456
I am not illiterate.

57
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,749
My parents were married!
(Clunk!)

58
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,832
(Sound of stone on stone)

59
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,150
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.

60
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,596
(Giggles)

61
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,011
'Shroom all clear?

62
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,811
Lady Blueberry sings: Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

63
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,334
Benny: Gnomeo, it's your mum.

64
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,094
Gnomeo: Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.

65
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,716
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.

66
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,969
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,607
...our beautiful, beautiful garden,

68
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,998
from this angle?

69
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,275
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.

70
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,993
Lady Blueberry: That tree was your
father's pride and joy.

71
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,270
May he rest in pieces.

72
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh, how you remind me of him.

73
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,078
Oh which is why I wanted to say.

74
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,197
I know, I know. My chores.

75
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,420
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting, pruning,
consider it all done.

76
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,560
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!

77
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,556
...done.

78
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,174
All I wanted to say was...

79
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,285
Good luck.

80
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:19,529
Thanks, mom.
(Foot steps sound like stone on stone)

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,596
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.

82
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,297
Red, I hate the word.

83
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,669
(Slamming door)

84
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,482
Wow.

85
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,014
Juliet: A 'Cupids Arrow' orchid.

86
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,771
Oh, Juliet!

87
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,457
Oh!
Whoa!

88
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,926
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.

89
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,241
Oh, you want to get smashed?

90
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,928
A flower that will put that
blue garden to shame.

91
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,177
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.

92
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,436
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...

93
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,706
Uh, I am a Red after all.

94
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,276
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was.

95
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,360
Bless her to bits.

96
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,337
Now, back where you belong.

97
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,166
I  can't just stay tucked away on
this pedestal all my life.

98
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,557
Don't you see.

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,062
When will you realize you're delicate.

100
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,963
I'm not delicate.

101
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,899
She's definitely not delicate.

102
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,880
Lord Redbrick: Stubborn girl.

103
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,934
Oh, right.

104
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,228
Delicate, hmm.

105
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,159
I'll show him who's delicate.

106
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,282
(Gnomes cheering)

107
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,015
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

108
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,867
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.

109
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,510
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
-Okay boys,  ya all know the rules.

110
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,289
And I don't need to repeat them, but I'm gonna.

111
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,628
'Cus I wanna.

112
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,674
And here they are.

113
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,767
No biting, no scratching, no kicking.

114
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,358
No burping, no slurping, no prancing.

115
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,704
No squalling, no laughing,
no heeing, no hawing.

116
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,358
And more than anything...

117
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,169
nooo cheating!

118
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,769
No cheating?
Hey, that's not fair.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,956
*Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)*
-On your marks.

120
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,752
Get going.

121
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:18,201
*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*

122
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:24,429
*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*

123
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:30,477
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*

124
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,077
*My sister looks cute in her braces and boots.
A handful of grease in her hair.*

125
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:45,643
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*

126
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:51,354
*Whoa, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in.*

127
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:57,365
*Get about as oiled as a diesel train.
Gonna set this dance alight.*

128
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:05,328
*Cause Saturday night's the night I like.
Saturday night's all right, all right, all right.*

129
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,955
*Woo, oo, ooo.*

130
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,607
(Sings in tune with Saturday)
*Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.*

131
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,649
(Sings in tune with Saturday)
*Tybalt, Tybalt.*

132
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:18,703
*Saturday, Saturday, Saturday.*

133
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:21,132
*Saturday night's all right.*

134
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:22,216
Whoa!

135
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,208
*Saturday...*

136
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,328
(Taunting laugh)

137
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
(Wheels rumble on sidewalk)

138
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,813
-(Laughs)
-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.

139
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,546
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.

140
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,282
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.

141
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,618
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
............-Huh?......................................

142
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,721
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.

143
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,551
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.

144
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:02,983
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth
is getting even bigger than your hat.

145
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,633
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.

146
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,517
Yeah, the 'finish' line.

147
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,811
Adios, loser.

148
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,261
(Taunting laughter)

149
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,876
Benny: Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.

150
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,208
No body won't come out.

151
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:23,685
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.

152
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,901
(Crowd angrily shouting)

153
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,894
Well if he won't come out.

154
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,908
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-(Benny gasps in shock)

155
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,831
(Crowd gasps in shock.)

156
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,935
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.

157
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,485
Then I say. It's about time someone did.

158
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,199
And payback is gonna be fun.

159
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,232
(Sound of ripping tape.)

160
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,533
Click...click...whirl.

161
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,602
'Shroom, let's go kick some grass.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,719
This mission into Red garden territory,

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,351
is gonna require maximum stealth.

164
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,996
Benny in deep voice: Well you won't get
much stealthier than this.

165
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:15,796
(High pitched voice) Hello.

166
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,666
(Ball in spray can rattles)
(Benny giggles)

167
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,218
(Snoring)
Mumbles: I got one.

168
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,991
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

169
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,369
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.

170
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,990
(Whines) Oh.

171
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,840
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

172
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,858
(Dog growling)

173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,061
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.

174
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:19,836
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.

175
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,225
And I'm going to need you to cover me.

176
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,116
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.

177
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,965
I'm washing my hair.
I don't have hair.

178
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,273
He'll know it's a lie.

179
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:31,307
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.

180
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,949
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

181
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,951
I'll be quick.

182
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,980
-(Gasps in fright)
-Growling.

183
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,905
-(Barking)
-(Juliet screams)

184
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,370
Out, out!

185
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,236
Man: Ben stop, over here boy.

186
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,792
Wow! That was quick.

187
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,129
I'm to easy to see.

188
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,007
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.

189
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,167
Oooo, a new outfit.

190
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,276
I'm on it.

191
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,099
Here.

192
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,481
That is cute.

193
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:00,963
Give it a turn.

194
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,979
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.

195
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,426
Now go get your flower.

196
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,861
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?

197
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,237
How much less?

198
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,723
Try black.

199
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,779
Aaaaaaah!

200
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,286
(Happily giggles)

201
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:30,002
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you
any attention in that.

202
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:31,196
Then it's perfect.

203
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:41,456
Oooo,
(Speaking Japanese)

204
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,556
I'm going in.

205
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,995
Take care.

206
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:57,351
(Shouts) I'm telling your Dad
you're doing your hair.

207
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:58,353
(Tiredly sighs)

208
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,359
Let's play a game.

209
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,353
I'm thinking of a movie.

210
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,173
It's a...it's one word.

211
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,841
And it starts with a...'spider'.

212
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,349
All: Is it, Spiderman?

213
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,621
Oh you're good, okay.

214
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,602
(Snores)

215
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,441
(Small gnomes giggling)

216
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,234
Great, I love going commando.

217
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,179
Shh, I know, just the key.

218
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,731
(Ball in can rattling)

219
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,057
(Can rattles)

220
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,347
Shhh.

221
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:56,983
(Can rattle's loudly)

222
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,508
Okay, I have another one.

223
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,732
Two words.
The first word is, 'Spiderman'.

224
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,890
All: Spiderman Two?

225
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,069
Okay, who's cheating?

226
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:13,542
(Door creaks)

227
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,352
Benny, give me the paint.

228
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,609
Benny?

229
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:23,858
Gnomeo whispers: No!

230
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:27,892
(Snoring.)

231
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,514
(Shakes can, ball rattling.)
-Benny!

232
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,518
Benny!

233
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:43,991
-Huh?
-Huh?

234
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,633
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.

235
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,475
Run for it, now.

236
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:51,622
(Sound of dropping bowling pins)

237
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:57,422
Tybalt: Where did he go?

238
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,928
Small red Gnome: He's in the begonia's.

239
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,135
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.

240
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,155
Find him!

241
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,556
-Not here.
-Not here, either.

242
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,608
Nothing but Pansies here.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Come on.

244
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,969
Hold on.

245
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,947
Whoa, whoooa!

246
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,970
-Hey, Benny
-What?

247
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,140
-See you on the other side.
-Benny: Gnomeo!

248
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,159
Benny: Nooo!

249
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,554
Ah, ha, ha.

250
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:40,999
(Both angrily shouting)

251
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,546
Capulet: Hmm.

252
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:55,844
(Growls in anger)

253
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,234
I wish I could stay but...

254
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:06,316
...gotta fly.

255
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!

256
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,189
(Sound of branches breaking)

257
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:24,908
Huh!

258
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,132
(Birds chirping)

259
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,540
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*

260
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,568
*Feel I'm feeling light*

261
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:48,771
(Stone feet tapping on wall)

262
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,668
*I like to see the sights.*

263
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,227
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*

264
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,916
*Ducking up and down*

265
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:08,669
*All these crazy sights and sounds*

266
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,874
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*

267
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:20,120
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*

268
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:24,269
*Famous last lines of a fool*

269
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,104
*Just when you think.*

270
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,872
*Your chain is just one link.*

271
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:35,371
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*

272
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,310
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

273
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,062
*My, my, my what have we here?*

274
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,183
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

275
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,712
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

276
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,734
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*

277
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:56,206
*Someone's out there saying hello.*

278
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,834
*Heeeellooooo.*

279
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,505
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.

280
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,208
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.

281
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:09,777
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't...this isn't my garden.

282
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,782
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.

283
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,225
-Oh, this?
-Yes.

284
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,226
(Sniffs)

285
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,555
I don't know. I think I'm going to
have to keep ahold of this one.

286
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,762
What? But I saw it first.

287
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:22,866
So why don't you just hand it over.

288
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,441
Well I grabbed it first.

289
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,252
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

290
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,602
But if you want it.

291
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,546
-Come and get it.
-All right.

292
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,950
Thanks.

293
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,006
Aaaah!

294
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,401
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.

295
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,420
What, and miss this view?

296
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,865
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?

297
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Whoa!

298
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,519
((Clang))

299
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,095
Who's your Gno-me now?

300
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,665
*Hello, Hello.*
-Hey!

301
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,573
*My, my, my what have we here?*

302
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,886
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

303
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:02,092
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*

304
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:05,360
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*

305
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:10,074
*Someone's out there saying, hello*

306
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,420
*Hello.*

307
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:18,577
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*

308
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:21,145
*Hello, hello.*

309
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,755
*Heeeellooooo.*

310
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:27,670
*Hello,
hellooooooooooo.*

311
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,123
(Sound of branch breaking)

312
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,257
Oh no, he's a blue.

313
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,345
Not a blue.

314
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,179
(Gasps)

315
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:08,035
Juliet. You're not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?

316
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:12,446
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same
question, Tybalt.

317
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,036
We're looking for a blue Gnome.

318
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,640
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.

319
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,613
Got a scratch, right here.

320
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,430
And his name's Gnomeo.

321
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,551
You haven't seen him, have you?

322
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,248
Uhhhhooo, um.

323
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,435
Uhh, he sounds awful, no.

324
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,766
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.

325
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,986
Well lucky you.

326
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,850
Come on, let's get inside.

327
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,612
Juliet.

328
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,234
Gnomeo: A red.

329
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,329
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?

330
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,382
Sooo, where is the oh so important,
life changing orchid?

331
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,389
Juliet: Um...

332
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,345
Um...

333
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,717
What, what orchid?

334
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:20,688
What?

335
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,115
Hmmm?

336
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:24,766
Shut up!

337
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,110
You met a boy.

338
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,693
What? No! Well maybe...

339
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:32,537
Sort of, um...yes!

340
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,786
Yes I did.

341
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,793
I need details.

342
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,606
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?

343
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,184
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?

344
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,921
Well let's call it sturdy.

345
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,274
And his uh..(Whistles up)

346
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,201
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?

347
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:51,296
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.

348
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,516
You might say it looks sort of...

349
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:54,868
...blue.

350
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,096
Blue.

351
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,616
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.

352
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:05,768
(Madly laughs)

353
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,508
No, I don't get it.

354
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:12,923
(Gasps) Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep,
you cannot take with a blue.

355
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,883
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.

356
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:15,980
Zzzzip.

357
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,803
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!

358
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:24,430
-Is it?
-It's doomed.

359
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,952
-What?
-A red and a blue.

360
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:28,949
*Romantic music*
It just can't be.

361
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,297
So it's a doomed love.

362
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,405
And that's the best kind.

363
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:34,913
You'll never see him again.

364
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:39,184
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".

365
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,098
"I only saw him once".

366
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,119
(Gasps and moans with sorrow)

367
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,920
(Whines, moans, and groans with longing and pain)

368
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll only see...what do you mean?

369
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,549
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.

370
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,674
How romantically tragic.

371
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,544
Your love is doomed.

372
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,869
Your love is dead.

373
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,115
Your love is doomed.

374
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,378
Your love is dead.

375
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,847
It's doomed.

376
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:08,195
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?

377
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,233
Nanette: Dooomed!

378
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,239
Conjoined Gnome: I've never seen
Lord Redbrick so riled up.

379
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,592
We have to find Gnomeo.

380
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,814
Let's split up.

381
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,173
(Sighs) I wish I could quit ya.

382
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,356
Both: Hmm.

383
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:32,397
Oh well.

384
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:33,445
Let's go fishing.

385
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,086
(Gate creeks)

386
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:38,996
((Sniffs))

387
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,814
All right, mate.

388
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,908
Go find, Gnomeo.

389
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,400
Nanette: Doomed!
Dead!

390
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,493
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.

391
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,888
Oh, Gnomeo.

392
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:09,956
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.

393
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,558
To never see each other again?

394
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,754
Why must you wear a blue hat?

395
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:16,207
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or...

396
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,580
green like a leprechaun, or...

397
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,346
or purple like, um...

398
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:23,621
like uh, like some weird guy.

399
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:24,808
I mean what's in a Gnome?

400
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,780
Because you're blue my father sees red,
and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.

401
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,982
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing
to keep us apart.

402
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,413
-Should it?
-Gnomeo: No, no! It shouldn't.

403
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:35,058
I couldn't have said it better myself.

404
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,587
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?

405
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,781
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...

406
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,903
I came here, to...

407
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,751
Well... I don't know,
I just wanted to see you again.

408
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:46,097
Are you crazy?

409
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,914
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.

410
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,806
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.

411
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:53,873
(Creaking and Tiki room song slowly starting)

412
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,329
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

413
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,229
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.

414
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,939
I'm trying.

415
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,926
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

416
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:07,923
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Juliet: Do something.
-The button's stuck.

417
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,390
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*

418
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,120
Ah, Juliet!

419
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:16,318
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.

420
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,633
There's somebody behind you!

421
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,891
Gnomeo: Shroom!

422
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,012
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!

423
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,141
Juliet! What's the big....

424
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,050
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.

425
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:27,896
Excuse me, little help here.

426
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,629
Juliet: My dad's coming.

427
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,704
So, you must be, Gnomeo.

428
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:32,968
Lovely to meet you.

429
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,157
Even though it's seconds,
before you're discovered and killed.

430
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,494
-Quick, hide.
-Lord Redbrick: Juliet!

431
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:40,570
I told you before, no music in the
grotto after ten o'clock.

432
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,540
What's going on here?

433
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,178
Um, It was a...

434
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,006
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.

435
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:50,066
And he...he...

436
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,148
...dropped his nuts.

437
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,239
Yes, nuts.
The size of...boulders.

438
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,341
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.

439
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:58,944
Well, okay. But no mucking about.

440
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,184
Especially not tonight.

441
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,259
We've been attacked.
By a blue!

442
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,530
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?

443
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,560
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.

444
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,486
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.

445
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,267
Lord Redbrick, I've been having
problems with my...(Mumbles incoherently)

446
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,575
-Your what?
-(Mumbles incoherently)

447
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,791
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.

448
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,833
It's not ideal.

449
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,953
-But I...
-Just go.

450
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,136
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.

451
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,553
-Um...
-What?

452
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,709
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!

453
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,217
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?

454
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,642
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.

455
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,553
I mean it's just as pondy as ever.
(Nervously laughs)

456
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,848
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?

457
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,087
Lord Redbrick: What? What was it?

458
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,182
-Juliet: That thing, over there.
-Lord Redbrick: What did it look like?

459
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,412
-Juliet: Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.

460
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:45,483
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince,
and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, or whatever.

461
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,873
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

462
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,269
(Dejected) Oh!

463
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:58,185
(Hopeful) Oh.

464
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,200
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?

465
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,928
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.

466
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,984
What?

467
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:06,928
Whoa!

468
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:11,016
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.

469
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,673
Thank you.

470
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,337
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.

471
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,246
No, really. I'm stuck.

472
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,693
(Both Laugh)

473
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,677
So, uh, heh...

474
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,071
Can I see you again tomorrow?

475
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:41,503
Yes, but not here.

476
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,972
Back in the old Lawrence place then?

477
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,426
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.

478
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:45,573
I can do 11:45.

479
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:46,523
Done.

480
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:48,053
That frog was right.

481
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:50,889
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

482
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,385
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you,
when he finds how much you weigh.

483
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:06,043
Shroom, you see this face?

484
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:07,783
It's a happy Gnome face.

485
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:09,211
Now come here.

486
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,550
Come on.

487
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,656
(Wild birds singing)

488
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:28,016
(Miss Montague singing happily)

489
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:33,755
(((Crash)))
(Miss Montague screams)

490
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,237
Mr. Capulet: Outrage, infamy!

491
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,235
Mr. Capulet: The gardening gloves
are off then, are they?

492
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,782
Miss Montague: You, wrecking my mower.

493
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,963
Mr. Capulet: Dear lady,
you are insane in the brain.

494
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,123
Miss Montague: I never thought that even you'd
stoop to such levels.

495
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:51,251
Mr. Capulet: Oh, and by the way, kindly stop
stealing my underwear.

496
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:54,803
Miss Montague: In your dreams,
you jacked off cabbage.

497
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:58,265
Mr. Capulet: Oh, how could she do this
to Tybalts wishing well?

498
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,775
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.

499
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,044
Why would anyone ever pick on you?

500
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:07,952
Miss Montague: Who thinks I should
order the best, new lawnmower?

501
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,846
Money can buy.

502
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,834
(Laughs)

503
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,619
(scrubbing)

504
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,151
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?

505
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:21,885
All: Because nobody likes him.

506
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,111
-(Growls)
-So what are we going to do?

507
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,745
Find their weak spot.

508
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,972
Then what are we going to do?

509
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,250
Damage.

510
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,950
Lot's and lot's of damage.

511
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:43,388
(Both evilly laughing)

512
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,909
(Minions continue to laugh)

513
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,967
(Keys tapping)
Miss Montague: Right.

514
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,533
Mess with me will you, Capulet.

515
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,785
I'll show him what, that old pompous.

516
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:05,533
It's not over, not by a long shot.

517
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,947
Miss Montague: Yeah, uh, right.
What have we got here?

518
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:14,009
Show the world the mighty web.

519
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,439
Miss Montague: Oh, no. No, no, not good.

520
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,857
Pick one.

521
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,830
-Yes, that one.
-Miss Montague: No.

522
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,789
Benny: Oh, yes that one.

523
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:23,627
Miss Montague: What's this?

524
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,179
<i>(Excited Male announcer) Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>

525
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,558
<i>Well brother maybe it's time
for a secret weapon.</i>

526
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,572
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

527
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:34,444
<i>It's the most useless, 500 horse power...</i>

528
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:38,030
<i>ground dominating piece of hardware,
the world has ever seen.</i>

529
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,962
<i>TERRAFIRMINATOR!!</i>

530
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,156
<i>It's unnecessarily volatile.</i>

531
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,186
<i>Now with 75% more power!</i>

532
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,110
<i>It clears
Echoes: Clears.</i>

533
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,698
<i>It digs
Echoes: Digs.</i>

534
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,309
<i>It mow's
Echo: Mow's.</i>

535
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,841
<i>Your lawn will be afraid to grow.</i>

536
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,020
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

537
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,604
<i>Get the weapon that plans destruction!</i>

538
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,237
(Babbling side effects and disclaimers)

539
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,983
(Greedily Laughs) That one.

540
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,221
Miss Montague: Oh my.

541
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:09,653
Benny pleads: Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.

542
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,553
Benny: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

543
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:14,180
Miss Montague: That's a bit in-your-face.

544
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,452
Miss Montague: This is more my speed.

545
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:17,972
(Meow)

546
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,447
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.

547
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,289
Oh, no.

548
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,061
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*

549
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,347
Definitely not.

550
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,259
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*

551
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:48,320
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*

552
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:49,353
(Strong wind)

553
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:56,860
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*

554
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:04,109
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*

555
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:11,322
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*

556
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,855
*When I was down*

557
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,778
*I was your clown*

558
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,254
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*

559
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:25,656
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*

560
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:33,388
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*

561
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:36,253
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*

562
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,663
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

563
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:41,340
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*

564
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:43,772
*I won't go breaking your heart.*

565
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:45,742
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

566
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,857
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*

567
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:50,754
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

568
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:56,402
*Don't go breaking my.
I won't go breaking your heaaaaaaart.*

569
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:59,778
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*

570
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,398
Lord Redbrick: Juliet. There you are.

571
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,496
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our
little discussion yesterday.

572
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,843
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.

573
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,387
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.

574
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:13,631
Who'll keep you safe.

575
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,254
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.

576
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,686
Yes, yes of course, why?

577
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,918
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.

578
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,497
-Dad!
-All right, all right.

579
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,199
No one will ever say I don't
know when I'm not wanted.

580
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,907
-Lord Redbrick: Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.

581
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:26,561
Here it is, gypsaphilla.

582
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:29,123
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.

583
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,180
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.

584
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:35,115
You think you got it down and bram,
you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.

585
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:36,544
Even though you thought
it was a level of chalk.

586
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:37,551
Weird.

587
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:41,328
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.

588
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,209
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit,

589
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,081
rude to leave me on a first date.

590
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,770
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.

591
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,072
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.

592
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:53,676
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.

593
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,757
A small token of my affection.

594
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:57,914
Oh, wow!

595
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,663
Juliet, do you realize what this is?

596
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,825
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.

597
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,062
Oh, a love triangle.

598
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:07,366
Which I call, Foxcup.

599
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,617
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.

600
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,504
Well, I mean I know,
I've got my dark side, sure.

601
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,664
Hey there, Juliet.

602
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,190
What a name, it's a great name.

603
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:19,846
Goes with your, eyes.

604
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,570
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.

605
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,865
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?

606
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,477
That's a killer, man.

607
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,474
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.

608
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,269
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?

609
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,507
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!

610
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,991
Uh, (uneasy laugh) never better.

611
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,208
(Wood pile creaks)

612
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,589
Do you think anyone heard that?

613
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,855
(whispers) There's nobody here.

614
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,376
(Whispers) Then why are you whispering?

615
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,263
(Softly) Why are you whispering.

616
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:47,457
(Giggles)

617
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,294
Oh, look at that.

618
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,798
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.

619
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:58,405
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.

620
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,829
Let's start her up.

621
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,123
Yeah, okay.

622
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,347
Check out the power on this beauty.

623
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:04,429
(Engine sputters)

624
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:08,750
She's empty.

625
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:10,750
Bingo!

626
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:15,350
-Juliet: Hey, try this.
-Thanks.

627
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:23,867
(Breeze blowing out)

628
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:26,661
(Both coughing)

629
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:36,525
(Creaks, door slams)

630
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:44,994
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

631
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:46,063
Yeah, it's me.

632
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,571
(Unknown voice) It's me, too!

633
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,589
(Both screaming)

634
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:53,446
What was that?

635
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:54,785
I have no idea.

636
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:59,098
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.

637
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,725
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.

638
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,602
And...and I'm not afraid to use it.

639
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,477
Do you think I scared it?

640
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,992
(Spanish accent)
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.

641
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:13,127
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.

642
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,321
(Scats) Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.

643
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,937
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.

644
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,361
And setting me free.

645
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:22,187
I love you!

646
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you know what it's like to
be trapped for thirty years?

647
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,821
All alone, by yourself.

648
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,721
No one for to talk at.

649
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:32,817
Hola, Featherstone,
como esta usted? (How are you?)

650
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,718
Ah, bueno, Featherstone,
how's the other leg?

651
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,605
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.

652
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:42,407
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?

653
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,519
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.

654
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,468
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.

655
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,754
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.

656
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,624
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.

657
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh, oh, oh. Pup, pup, pup.
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes.

658
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:02,319
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.

659
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,512
Both: Date! No, no not dating.

660
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,470
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.

661
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,141
-Juliet: Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?

662
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,963
-He's a blue.
-And she's a red.

663
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,540
And I'm pink!

664
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,875
Who cares?

665
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,584
Anyway, I got to ask.

666
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:18,102
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?

667
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,068
Ohh, I know, I know.

668
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,356
Un momento, I'll be right back.

669
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:26,926
(Engine starts)

670
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,833
Juliet, wait.

671
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,424
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?

672
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,450
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.

673
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:36,602
Oh, really?

674
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,692
Yeah.

675
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:39,211
(Laughs with joy)

676
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,353
Gnomeo: GO!

677
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:44,821
Whoo, hoo, hoo!

678
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,425
Ta da!

679
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,189
Featherstone: Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.

680
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,905
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...

681
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,578
We still got to do something about these weeds.

682
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,941
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.

683
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,544
Well I don't know. A weed
by any other name is still a weed.

684
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,300
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.

685
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,129
(Takes in deep breath. Blows over it)

686
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:20,316
(Takes in deep breath)

687
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:24,171
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?

688
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,514
Kinda pass you out, huh?

689
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,014
I going to sit down now.

690
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,036
(Both laughing)

691
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,161
I've got a confession to make.

692
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,142
I've never actually driven a mower.

693
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,535
No, you're a natural.

694
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:42,331
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.

695
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,510
You know this is crazy, right?

696
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:53,202
Yeah.

697
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:56,055
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.

698
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,369
Oh and me a blue.

699
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:59,027
No way.

700
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,227
My whole life my mom raised me to
hate you guys. You reds.

701
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,142
So, this could never work.

702
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,774
Could it?

703
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,765
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.

704
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,383
Can it?

705
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,385
(Featherstone blowing)
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.

706
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,385
Oh baby, you know I
getting into this now.

707
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:20,940
See the trick is to go like... (Blows sharp)

708
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,237
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...(Blow's short)

709
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:28,928
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.

710
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:32,131
And uh, I promise.

711
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,030
Your secret is safe with me.

712
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,420
Well, should we?

713
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,565
I can do 11:45.

714
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,309
Not soon enough.

715
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:57,863
(Sighs contentedly)

716
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:03,021
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.

717
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,233
Careful there, you're going to kick something.

718
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:06,531
What's eating you?

719
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,086
Huh?

720
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:12,834
(Lady Blueberry Crying) How?

721
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Lady Blueberry: How?

722
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,276
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.

723
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:19,626
How could this have happened?

724
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,505
Well, where were you?

725
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,661
I was...

726
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:24,076
(Sniffles)

727
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,591
I was nowhere.

728
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,242
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.

729
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:32,465
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed,

730
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:35,486
the most beautiful thing we blues have.

731
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:39,314
Your father planted her.

732
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:42,566
We raised her from a seedling.

733
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,165
(Bunnies sobbing)

734
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,447
(Sobs)

735
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,292
Those blasted Reds, come on.

736
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,214
We'll make them pay.

737
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,542
(Gnomes shouting for revenge)

738
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,032
Every last one of them.

739
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,282
(Shouts in anger)

740
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,550
Every last one?

741
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:11,977
(Strums Elton John's 'Your song')

742
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:18,136
*It's a little bit runny.*

743
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,403
*This pesticide.*

744
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:25,369
-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.

745
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,409
-Oh, this is painful.
-Oh, sweet torture.

746
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,022
*(Elton John Singing)
Don't have much money.*

747
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,391
*But, but if I did.*

748
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:39,703
*I'd buy a big house where.*

749
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:42,974
*We both could live.*

750
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:51,764
*If I was (Paris's voice) a sculptor...*
-Ooo, sexy, sexy.

751
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:58,197
*A man selling stuff for plants
it's called, Miracle grow.*

752
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:03,316
Uh, Gnomeo!

753
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:10,778
(Humming 'Rock-a-bye baby')

754
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,018
Okay.

755
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,830
Then we go need a bunch of coconuts.

756
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:35,863
-(Gasps)
-Wha...?

757
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:47,731
Gnomeo: Juliet no, wait.

758
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,592
I...I um...

759
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:50,759
(Hum’s 'Rock-a-bye baby')

760
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:55,872
A blue, a blue!

761
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:57,793
-Abort, abort the mission.
-What?

762
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:00,121
-What happened.
-Ah, the nozzle jammed, let's go.

763
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:09,398
Gnomeo!

764
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:15,418
((Squirts))

765
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Hmmm.

766
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:25,651
Tybalt: Such a big hat,
on such a small gnome.

767
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,307
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?

768
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:31,931
Let's take this baby out into the alley.

769
00:43:31,932 --> 00:43:33,336
Then what are going to do?

770
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,010
We're gonna have a smashing time.

771
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:39,143
(Mower rumbles)
(Evilly laughs)

772
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:41,860
Gnomeo: Oh come on, Juliet.
It's  not as bad as all that.

773
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:43,700
Is that your big move on a second date?

774
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,580
You wine them, dine them and
then spray them with weed killer?

775
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:47,948
You got to admit, it is original.

776
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,888
Hola, my fellow funsters are back already.

777
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,598
I mean be reasonable.
I didn't have a choice...

778
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,610
...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?

779
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,677
Just a toilet in the middle of a yard,
with nothing growing out of it.

780
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,049
Oh you blues are so infuriating.

781
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,463
Wait a minute, us blues?

782
00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:03,580
So, what you guys want to do?

783
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:05,703
-Featherstone, we're busy.
-Come on guys.

784
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:09,800
-Let us have some-a fun.
-Let me tell you something about you reds.

785
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:12,908
-Us reds?
-Oh, can't we all just laugh about this?

786
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:15,157
I know the little mushroom can.

787
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:16,515
Both shout: Featherstone!

788
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:18,181
-We're in the middle of something.
-You wouldn't understand.

789
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:20,114
-We're talking.
-All right, so just leave us alone.

790
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:25,114
Right,
I'm sorry.

791
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:29,993
You know sometimes I get
a little over excited.

792
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:33,172
Especially having such great new friends.

793
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:35,060
Like you and...

794
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:37,495
But I know I can be a bit...

795
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:39,376
...much.

796
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,547
Wait, Featherstone.

797
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:46,524
-Hey.
-Juliet: Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry.

798
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,602
Featherstone: I may not be a smart bird.

799
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,003
But I know what love is.

800
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:32,737
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*

801
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:39,166
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*

802
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:46,713
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*

803
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:52,113
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*

804
00:45:52,644 --> 00:45:53,644
*Then*

805
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:06,335
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*

806
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:13,200
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*

807
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:18,687
*There's only so much you can do,
to keep some things alive*

808
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:25,606
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*

809
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:32,242
*Each one of us knowing,
every inch of it was us.*

810
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:39,019
*We pulled it all together,
hoping and believing.*

811
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:45,736
*That love built this garden
for the two of us to dream in.*

812
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:06,166
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.

813
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,532
And...

814
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,193
I couldn't do nothing about it.

815
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,981
But you...

816
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:16,758
...you can.

817
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:29,107
You know I think that crazy pink
plastic bird might be right.

818
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,038
What if we never went back?

819
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,479
Never go back?

820
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,205
But what about my Dad?

821
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:37,044
And Nanette and the red garden?

822
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:40,276
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.

823
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,086
But here, here we're a matching pair.

824
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:49,320
Juliet, will you stay here, and
build a garden with me?

825
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,935
I'd love to.

826
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:12,432

00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:27,248
What are you doing?

829
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:31,233
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.

830
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,515
BENNY!
Benny, wait.

831
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,629
Well, well, well.

832
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,413
If it isn't little-big-hat, Benny.

833
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,287
Mess with the red garden, will ya.

834
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,563
(Chuckles)

835
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,866

836
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,046
(Crash!)
NO!

837
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:05,029
Ooo, that felt good.
(Blows)

838
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:07,963
Oh no!
Oh, no.

A hat for a hat.

843
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:21,781
Gnomeo, no!

844
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:36,662
You wouldn't attack an
unarmed Gnome, would ya?

845
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,209
Sucker.

846
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,125
Pity.

847
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,922
Tybalt, the wall.

848
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:47,944
You don't I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do ya?

849
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:49,582
Ha, ha, what wall?

850
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:56,895
Ut oh, that wall.

851
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:58,940
(Shatter)
Blast!

852
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:02,589
What was that?

853
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,614
What's happened?

854
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:08,716
Tybalt?

855
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,430
Tybalt.

856

Tybalt?

857
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:18,540
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.

858
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,644
(Gasps) Ooo.

859
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:30,006
Smash him hat.

860
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:34,105
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?

861
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,792
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.

862
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:37,097
No, he didn't do it.

863
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,813
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.

864
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:40,500
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.

865
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:44,934
-Catch.
-What?

866
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:47,320
((Clang...clang))

867
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:52,682
Smash him back.

868
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:54,906
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!

869
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:57,744
(Crowd angrily shouting)

870
00:50:58,051 --> 00:50:59,481
Stop, stop that.

871
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,690
Revenge!

872
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:12,817
Whup!

873
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:25,804
(Panting, gasping in shock)

874
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,620
Woman: Woo...

875
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:39,371
(Cars whizzing by)

876
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:47,185
-What were you doing?
-No!

877
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:48,830
-I love him.
-What?

878
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,373
Doomed.

879
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,370
Oh, someone do something.

880
00:51:54,226 --> 00:51:55,226
(Shattering)

881
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,713
(Gasp in shock)

882
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,137
Gnomeo!

883
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,319
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.

884
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,817
(Juliet crying)
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.

885
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:12,069
(Sobs) He's gone.

886
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,131
(Crying) Oh Gnomeo.
(Sobs) No, no not Gnomeo.

887
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:25,257
Let's get you home now.

888
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:29,127
Lady Blueberry sobbing:
Oh, my poor, poor boy.

889
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:34,445
(Sniffing)

890
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,349
(Shattering)

891
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,451
Hmm?

892
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:57,401
Stay, stay!

893
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:58,416
Gnomeo: Good boy.

894
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,138
(Gasps...moans)

895
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,711
Gnomeo: Shroom!
Shroooooom!

896
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:15,376
Duhhhh!

897
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,901
(Dog panting)

898
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:38,304
(Barking!)

899
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:43,742
(Barking)

900
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:48,805
(Panting)

901
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:58,762
Gnomeo: No!

902
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:14,187
-First boy: A gnome?
-Second Boy: Yeah, Mate.

903
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,459
Second boy: It looks like your sister.

904
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:17,357
(Boys laughing)

905
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:43,630
Lord Redbrick: You left me no choice, Juliet.

906
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:45,702
I've lost your mother.

907
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:47,917
I am not going to lose you.

908
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,902
(Thunder rumbles in distance)

909
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:09,463
(Pitter patter sound of rain falling)

910
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,632
(Sniffling)

911
00:55:47,623 --> 00:55:50,179
(Lady Blueberry softly crying)

912
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:55,636
(Sadly) Mmmm.

913
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,192
Hmm?

914
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:07,469
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.

915
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,190
All right, we've got to
avenge, Gnomeo.

916
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:11,555
Here's what we're going to do.

917
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,429
Now...(Mumbles softly)

918
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:16,647
No, not now Shroom.

919
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:18,178
(Continues to softly confer)

920
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:19,478
Right, got it.

921
00:56:34,536 --> 00:56:37,903
Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.

922
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:39,404
What, what you trying to say?

923
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,648
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?

924
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,964
No, did he jump?

925
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,153
Little Mustafa?

926
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:47,457
Little Richard, what?

927
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:53,694
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.

928
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,764
Well what?

929
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,728
Featherstone: Oh, no.

930
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,544
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?

931
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:04,083
No, little mushroom.

932
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,770
He was a smashed.

933
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,257
I saw it myself.

934
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:12,695
What, you want I still to follow
you some more. Okay fine.

935
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,247
I go with you, I go.

936
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,402
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.

937
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:20,698
And where is this well
everyone has fallen into?

938
00:57:29,335 --> 00:57:30,335
(Creaking)

939
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,753
Psst.
Oink, oink.

940
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:38,195
(Ears tapping)

941
00:57:45,022 --> 00:57:46,022
Ready?

942
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:54,334
(Disgusted groan)

943
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,305
Aaaah!

944
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,850
Ooohh.

945
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:08,201
Hmm?

946
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,014
Benny: Huh, oooh, hello.

947
00:58:20,188 --> 00:58:21,188
(Groans)

948
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:23,724
Whoa!

949
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,249
Hmm?

950
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:45,007
Aaaaaaaaaah!

951
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:47,312
(Computer dings)

952
00:58:52,434 --> 00:58:54,762
(Keyboard sounds like piano keys)

953
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:08,465
*Upbeat 'Benny and the Jets' playing*

954
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:22,499
(Commercial roars on)

955
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:25,060
<i>Excited male announcer: Terrafirminator!</i>

956
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,371
<i>Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>

957
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,658
<i>-Never!
-Well brother, maybe it's time for a secret weapon.</i>

958
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:33,911
<i>-Bring it on.
-TERRAFIRMINATOR!</i>

959
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:35,595
This one's for Gnomeo!

960
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:38,491
Announcer roars: Meoooooww!

961
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:43,105
(Shopping cart roars off)

962
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:48,689
(Brakes squeal)

963
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,185
(Squealing madly)

964
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:58,529
(Ears tapping frantically)

965
01:00:06,451 --> 01:00:07,451
(Silently shakes head)

966
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,030
(Frantically taps ears)

967
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,452
Benny: Hah, hah, yeah.

968
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:24,532
Huh?

969
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:26,826
(Worriedly whines)

970
01:00:28,943 --> 01:00:29,943
(Whines) Come on.

971
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:31,553
Ohhh!

972
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,495
Miss Montague: Oh, ruddy purse.

973
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:40,118
(Door slams)

974
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:44,637
Call me.

975
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:51,247
Gnomeo: So Juliet and me we decided that we
wouldn't carry on this horrible feud.

976
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,808
It was great, but then my
best mate Benny found out.

977
01:00:54,957 --> 01:00:57,403
And Tybalt, who's a right
piece of bad gnome, mate.

978
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,773
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.

979
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:04,356
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed.

980
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:05,996
Which wasn't my fault.

981
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,060
Then I was chased down.

982
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,626
Exiled.

983
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,347
Stuck up here on your head.

984
01:01:11,562 --> 01:01:13,044
Far away from, Juliet.

985
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:16,013
Extraordinary.

986
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,482
Your story,

987
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:20,614
it does put me in mind of another.

988
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:22,621
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.

989
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:25,076
There are remarkable similarities.

990
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:26,579
What happens?
Did they get back together then?

991
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,743
Get back together?

992
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:29,332
Um, no.

993
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,752
Not exactly.

994
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,456
What exactly do you mean?

995
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,825
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!

996
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,840
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!

997
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:40,582
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.

998
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,028
Takes his own life.

999
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,762
She wakes, finds him dead.

1000
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,588
Takes her life, both dead!

1001
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:48,754
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!

1002
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:51,690
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!

1003
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:53,767
Author, author!

1004
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:55,912
Hmm?

1005
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,185
Gnomeo: What did you say?

1006
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:59,761
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?

1007
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,444
Shakespeare: My dear boy, this is a tragedy.

1008
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,287
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.

1009
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,638
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.

1010
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,193
Well I suppose that he could have made
it back in time to prevent disaster.

1011
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,314
But I like the whole death part better.

1012
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:16,186
Oh dear.

1013
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,501
Aaaaahh!

1014
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,155
((Clunk))
Whoo hooo!

1015
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:25,159
Featherstone.

1016
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:27,544
One word.

1017
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
Plastic.

1018
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,959
How'd you find me?
Shroom!

1019
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,875
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.

1020
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Whispers: Not yet.

1021
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,286
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head.

1022
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,230
What is it, boy?

1023
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,828
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.

1024
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:44,981
Featherstone: He's been going on and on
and on since the alley.

1025
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:48,983
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers,
chocolates and strangers....

1026
01:02:48,983 --> 01:02:50,237
Juliet's in danger.

1027
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:51,441
No, that's not it.

1028
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:54,273
Juliet's in danger!

1029
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:56,372
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.

1030
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,972
I've got to get back to Juliet,
and save her.

1031
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:02,777
That's what he said, but she was
dead before he got home.

1032
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,781
Gnomeo distantly shouts: We'll see about that.

1033
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,021
Whoa...

1034
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,950
(Gulps)

1035
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,580
Tada!

1036
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:32,032
(Blue Gnomes cheer)

1037
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:35,377
-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?

1038
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,482
This baby is fully equipped.

1039
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,751
Equipped for what?

1040
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:40,588
It has settings for edging,

1041
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:42,170
trimming, mulching,

1042
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,170
and revenge!

1043
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:45,392
(Gnomes cheer agreement)

1044
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,997
Do it, Benny.

1045
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,827
Do anything it takes.

1046
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:53,672
Make them rule the day they destroyed my son.

1047
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:58,429
Unleash the gods of war.

1048
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:00,106
