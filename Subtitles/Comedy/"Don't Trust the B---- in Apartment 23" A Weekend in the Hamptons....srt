1
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,133
It's an emergency!
We have to evacuate!

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,601
What?

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,736
Hurry! Get your stuff
and meet me downstairs!

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,838
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
We're under attack.

5
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:14,306
We're under attack.

6
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,808
This is what
the disaster kit is for.

7
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:17,809
Hurry!

8
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,877
Okay! Okay.

9
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,646
The bras, mom. Dad.

10
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:24,582
I should've bought a drill!

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,018
Hurry! Go! Go! Go!

12
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,120
Where is our emergency
rendezvous point?!

13
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:29,621
What is the mayor saying?!

14
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,189
Kidding. We're going
to the hamptons.

15
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,224
What?

16
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,926
Whoo!

17
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,261

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,239
I thought
we were under attack.

23
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,408
I flushed my diary
down the toilet.

24
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:54,477
I know you would've never agreed
to come unless I tricked you.

25
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,479
You haven't even left
the apartment in days.

26
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,114
You've just been waiting
by the phone

27
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,650
For some dumb guy you like
to call you back.

28
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,784
I am waiting to hear back
about a job interview

29
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:04,420
At harkin financial.

30
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:05,821
The c.E.O. Is in town
from london,

31
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,957
And I'm waiting to hear
if he wants to meet with me.

32
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,725
Well, whoever it is, I hope
you let them touch your boob.

33
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:14,396
Why are you wrapped
in tinfoil?

34
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,565
Chloe, I can't go
to the hamptons

35
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,099
With you this weekend.

36
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,134
My whole plan was
to stare at my cell phone

37
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,570
And reread old report cards
to calm my nerves.

38
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:24,905
June, that is the beauty
of cell phones.

39
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,475
You can take them with you
and stare at them anywhere.

40
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,909
James needs us.

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,345
He's so depressed

42
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,946
From his flameout
on "dancing with the stars,"

43
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,114
Not to mention being the butt
of every jimmy kimmel joke.

44
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,716
So we are taking him
on a weekend bender.

45
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:38,151
I've never seen him like this.

46
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,919
He stopped googling himself.

47
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:42,155
Well, I guess I could go.

48
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,424
I'll have my cell phone with me
the whole time,

49
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,926
And if I need to come back,
it's only a 2-hour drive.

50
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,495
Give or take.

51
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,329
Depending on whether or not
billy joel's ass is on the road.

52
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,565
I've always wanted to go to
a real life hamptons lighthouse,

53
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,067
In rainy weather,

54
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:56,935
In a fisherman's sweater,

55
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,004
On a bike,

56
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,806
With a sandwich
and my thoughts.

57
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,110
I almost just hit you.

58
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:06,212
I almost just lost control
and hit you.

59
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,114
Okay, so it's settled.
We'll get drunk on the drive up,

60
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,416
And then we'll stay at our
crazy friend katarina's house

61
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,184
And then we'll hit
the willoughby party.

62
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:14,285
The what?

63
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,521
The willoughby party.

64
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:17,055
It's the best party
of the year.

65
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:18,857
It's hosted by this mysterious
guy named willoughby.

66
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,093
I've never actually met him,
but his parties are beyond.

67
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,795
<i>(woman) ♪ never,

68
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:26,597

70

71
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,237
Whoo!

72
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:36,941
This is the year
I'm gonna meet willoughby...

73
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,208
Well, it's always nice
to meet the host.

74
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,877
And have sex with him.

75
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:41,945
Of course.

76
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,479
Yeah, you know, this year,

77
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:45,314
I was thinking, I really want
to do something special,

78
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,250
You know,
something that matters.

79
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,621
James is about
to come down.

80
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,690
Don't treat him any differently,
but don't look directly at him.

81
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,126
Compliment his outfit,
but not too much, or he'll know.

82
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,328
(footsteps approach)

83
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,469
They hate my hat.

84
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:12,173
That hat was given to you
by mr. Jason mraz.

85
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,642
Let them hate it.
They lose.

86
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,578
(bottles rattle)

87
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:17,579
He knew.

88
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:22,617
<i>(man) ♪ I got my love

89
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:25,252
<i>♪ put your hands in the sky

90
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,388
Weekend bender! Whoo!

91
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,457
So where'd you get this car?

92
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,292
My cousin edgar has
a limo business,

93
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,994
And this is one
of his party s.U.V.S.

94
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,395
I borrowed it

95
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,965
So that chloe would let me
come to the hamptons.

96
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,467
(cell phone ringing)
oh, my gosh! It's from a 2-1-2
number that I don't recognize.

97
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,735
It's probably about
my job interview.

98
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,737
Hello.
This is June colbern.

99
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,305
Scrotum!

100
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,974
(laughs) funny, right?

101
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,709
That's an important call.

102
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,645
Sorry. That was from
a very immature passerby.

103
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:53,813
Whoo-hoo!

104
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,549
Oh, hello, debbie
from dr. Curtis' office.

105
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,151
Another 64-calorie,
low carb beer.

106
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,519
(horn honks, tires screech)

107
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:04,089
That's what my blinker's for,
dumb-ass!

108
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,323
(clink)

109
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,060
Whoo! Yahoo!
Weekend bender!

110
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,862
(June) bye, goats.

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,031
Did you guys see me
milk that goat?

112
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,565
June, this is supposed to be
a party drive.

113
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,133
When you said you wanted
to milk a goat,

114
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,668
I thought you had to pee.

115
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,202
If I'm gonna do
the hamptons,

116
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,038
I am going to do
the hamptons right.

117
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,940
I made a list of everything
I want to see and sample

118
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,441
While we're here.

119
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,309
You're not supposed to have
a list on a bender.

120
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,978
You're supposed to go
where the moment takes you.

121
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,114
Now if "little house
on the prairie" is done,

122
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,214
We can get on with it.
Bender.

123

125
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:36,686
(June) great peaches.

126
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,655
That farmer says
that the barefoot contessa

127
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,256
Shops there
every other Tuesday.

128
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,159
(door closes)
when I tell katarina
why we're late,

129
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,162
You just wait, ho.
You just wait.

130
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,830
I need another beer.

134
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,843

It's "dancing with the stars"
post-traumatic stress disorder.

138
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:12,452
D.W.T.S.P.T.S.D.

139
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,593
Well, June, you ruined
the drive up here

140
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,595
With your stupid fruit
and vegetable parade,

141
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,230
But now the bender
really begins.

142
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,033
What we need is
a dose of crazy katarina!

143
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,002
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

144
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,904

oh, thank god you're here.

147
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:39,044
Take one.
This one's ass exploded.

148
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,014
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

149

00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,347

157
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,185
From last year's naked party.

158
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,254
Well, if I had known,
I wouldn't have stayed here.

159
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:08,357
When you said you had new twins,
I thought you meant a boob job.

160
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:11,861
I need adult interaction.
I haven't showered in four days.

161
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:13,428
I'm a milk monster.

162
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,964
Look at my roots!

163
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,064

164
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,632
No! The babies!

165
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,735
Oh. Ooh.
It's a private caller.

166
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,537
Oh.
This might be it. Hello?

167
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,272
Scrotum!

168
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,841
Oh. Hi, aunt nancy.

169
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,811
You know, you really should stop
calling from a blocked number.

170
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,081
Do we go in
or do we just wait out here?

171
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,783
What's the etiquette?

172
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,418
I love rocking chairs.

173
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,487
I have two in my apartment--

174
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,289
One in the living room

175
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,692
And one in the bathroom.

176
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,760
You wouldn't think it would
get much use in there,

177
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,328
But it does.

178
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:52,398
Mm. (chuckles)

179
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,033
It smells like poo
in this house.

180
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,334
Well, why don't
we just yell "cut"

181
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,236
And have them
take the babies away? Cut.

182
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,438
Katarina, would you mind
if I borrowed your bicycle?

183
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,140
I'd love to go bird-watching.

184
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Help yourself...

185
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:05,510
To the bike and anything else
I used to enjoy.

186
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,212
Yeah! Bender!

187
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,513
<i>(baby crying)
no!</i>

188
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:11,883
(object thuds)

189
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,221
Okay. So you're going to need
this map,

190
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,890
Binoculars, a whistle,

191
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,592
Sunscreen,
a mosquito netting--

192
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,128
I don't need mosquito netting.
I'm just going bird-watching.

193
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,263
Ah. Okay. Um...

194
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,664
(under breath) west nile.

195
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,933
What?

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,169
Oh, nothing. Just asking
if you want to die.

197
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:33,771
June?

198
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,740
Mark! Hey!
What are you doing here?

199
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,507
Jennifer wanted a romantic
weekend in the hamptons

200
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,443
So we borrowed
her parents' house.

201
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,246
We're sleeping in their bed.
It's not weird at all.

202
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,314
Oh.
What are you doing here?

203
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,682
Aren't you waiting
to hear about that job?

204
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,719
Oh, yeah, well, I have
my phone with me, so...

205
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,354
(horn honks)

206
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,788
Oh. I better hurry.

207
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,623
Jennifer doesn't like
when I shop mom and pop.

208
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,558
She thinks the food
gets dusty.

209
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,093
So see ya.
(horn honks)

210
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,895
Okay.

211
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,797
(dog barks)

212
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:02,865
(whines)

213
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:08,736
Great capris.

214
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,172
Excuse... Me?

215
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,974
Look at me--a bow tie.

216
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,575
I'm full of regret
and self-loathing,

217
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:17,145
But you, you're so bold.

218
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:18,913
You're ahead of the curve.

219
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,916
Or I'm just wearing pajamas
and a sweater that I borrowed.

220
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,950
Presto. Instant success.

221
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:27,120
Willoughby,
currently of east hampton.

222
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,224
Wait. You're
willoughby the party guy?

223
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,493
You're judging me,
and it stings,

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,095
So keep doing it.

225
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:37,998
This is a riddle invitation
for my party tonight.

226
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,500
What do you think
of the font?

227
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,302
You would've picked
a different one.

228
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,736
How do you do it?

229
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,071
(crow caws)

230
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,441
(snoring)

231
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,277
I guess we're all just one
small hole in the condom away

232
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,613
From having our lives
totally destroyed.

233
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:55,782
(sighs)

234
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:59,250
Chloe, I got some pretty serious
soul searching to do.

235
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,287
I think I'm gonna have
to take this bender solo.

236
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,457
You gotta follow the bender.
I understand.

237
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:09,260
If you need me, I'll be trudging
down a quiet hamptons road...

238
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,729
Alone.

239
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,332
(continues snoring)

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,700
Wake up, bitch.

241
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,602
(birds chirping)

242
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:38,555
I just worry about your arches
in those shoes.

243
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:45,327
(door opens and closes)
perfect.

244
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:46,862
So I just met willoughby.

245
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:47,963
What?

246
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,399
Oh, my god!
A willoughby riddle.

247
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,501
"on this day occurred
a love massacre,

248
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,870
"when the clock struck
a manic gay actor

249
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,572
Who does not like
to work subtle."

250
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,306
It's his new address
or something.

251
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,508
(gasps) the valentine's day
massacre was February 14th.

252
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:01,909
Everyone knows that.

253
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,012
I'm instantly picturing
a grandfather clock. Oh!

254
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,314
Who is that actor who I thought
was claymation?

255
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,617
Oh! Oh! Oh! Nathan lane!

256
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,619
Oh.
That's it!
214 grandfather lane.

257
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,188
That's it. That's the address
of the party. We're so going.

258
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,556
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.
I have to get up super early.

259
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,958
I'm going to get, uh,
scones at maude's.

260
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:21,361
They run out of the blue--

261
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,329
My list!

262
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:26,700
(spits) June, you have to go
where the bender takes you,

263
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,368
And I am telling you,
your bender is

264
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,203
Taking you
to willoughby's party,

265
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,872
Where you will introduce me
to willoughby,

266
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,706
And I will meet him
and I will bang him.

267
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,307
Well, what if my bender was
taking me

268
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,410
To do a sunset tour
of the cranberry bogs?

269
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,845
Ugh! You are
the worst bender-er ever.

270
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,113
You might as well
have just stayed home

271
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,215
And stared at your phone
on the coffee table.

272
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,017
(beep)
no one's called
since aunt nancy.

273
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,219
Exactly. So relax.
Come on.

274
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,954
There is a fabulous party
with our names on it.

275
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,156
I'm sure you could borrow
something to wear of katarina's.

276
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,626
I know.
Something with a crotch.

277
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,429
Chloe asked me
to look after james.

278
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:59,363
She deputized me...

279
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,200
With her eyes,
not with her words.

280
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,735
(horn honks)

281
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,870
Yeah! Pass me!
Look at you go!

282
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:10,774
You're an asian-american
driving poorly,

283
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:15,111
And I'm an african-american
sitting in the back of the bus,

284
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,713
Both chasing

285
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,782
A distant white man.
(high-pitched squeak)

286
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,418
This is not why my mother
marched on washington.

287
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:26,322
Oh, sweet freedom,
where is james?

288
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,724
(grunts)

289
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:33,195
Coffee guy?
What are you doing here?

290
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,130
What are you doing here?

291
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,198
Well, I heard
a-a high-pitched squeak.

292
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,667
I thought a little girl
was in trouble.

293
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:42,303
It was my girlfriend jennifer.

294
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:45,474
She broke up with me again,
this time for good.

295
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,642
She thought I was gonna
propose to her this weekend,

296
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,578
So she kept looking
for an engagement ring

297
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,879
In everything I handed her.

298
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,481
She tore apart a pinecone
with her bare hands.

299
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:54,849
(luther) james!

300
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,016
James!

301
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,384
I see you're on a bender.

302
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,687
I, too, am trying
to drink my pain away.

303
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,455
I thought I wanted to do
the lonely bender,

304
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:04,291
But the quiet
just makes it worse.

305
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,793
(luther) james!

306
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,928
My lonely road
has brought me to you.

307
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,396
I think we're supposed to be
bender buddies.

308
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,733
(clink)

309
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,602
(luther, singsongy)
I have cookies!

310
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,036
(blows nose)

311
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,806
Excuse me. Pollen.

312
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:23,175
<i>(woman) ♪ oh ♪</i>

313
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,811
God, put that pie away.
What is the matter with you?

314
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,080
It's my host gift.
Every time you try

315
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,549
To slap it out of my hands,
it only makes me grip it harder.

316
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,551
Okay, where's willoughby?
I want to find him

317
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,086
And sex him
and then have a martini.

318
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,288
Oh, I just had
one of those moments

319
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,923
Where I realize
what a great girl I am.

320
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,893
Wow! This house is amazing!

321
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,427
And I love this dress
of katarina's.

322
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,730
It's tight, but I get it.
It even has a cool phone pocket.

323
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,765
Oh, my god!
Katarina's pill pocket!

324
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,501
A lot of good times
in that pocket.

325
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,635
A lot of memories.

326
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,538
Oh, no. Oh, no.
There's no bars.

327
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,140
There's no signal.

328
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,874
Katarina should've used
that pocket

329
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,275
For some birth control pills.

330
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,577
Ha ha ha ha! That's hilarious!

331
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,213
I'm gonna text her that
right now.

332
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,416
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

333
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,783
Boo.

334
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,984
Willoughby.

335
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,387
'tis I, June.
'tis willoughby.

336
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:11,855
What are you doing up here?

337
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,389
I actually hate parties.

338
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,191
I just like
to find a dark corner

339
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,860
And watch all the puppets dance
from afar.

340
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,062
Is that a pie?

341
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,864
Oh. Yes!
This is for you.

342
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,399
You know how many people
have been to my parties

343
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,534
Over the years?

344
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:26,802
5,342.

345
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,371
You wanna know
how I know that?

346
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,106
It's this antique clicker.
(click)

347
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:32,974
You know how many people have
ever brought me a pie?

348
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,242
Zero.

349
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,279
Go downstairs
and get us two pastry forks.

350
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,714
I've got something important
I need to say.

351
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:42,917
<i>(dance music playing)</i>

352
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,852
Excuse me. Can I have
your attention, please?

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,621
(raises voice) excuse me!

354
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,356
(normal voice) excuse me.

355
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:50,357

zing!

356
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:54,894
I... Am willoughby!

357
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,196
(guests gasp)

358
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:58,298
Bernard, what the hell
are you doing?!

359
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,665
You're not willoughby!

360
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,367
Chloe, what are
you talking about?

361
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:02,768
That is willoughby.

362
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,905
No, that's bernard,
my husband.

363
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,773

What do you mean
he's your husband?

366
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:17,987
I mean he's my husband.
We got married

367
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,089
At a wedding party
when I first moved to new york.

368
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:23,658
Ha ha! This party is awesome!

369
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,793
People are
getting married upstairs.

370
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,595
We should
totally get married.

371
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,731
Oh, my god! I thought
you were gay! Okay!

372
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,432
(cheering)

373
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,268
I met him that night
and I haven't seen him since.

374
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,871
Honestly, I thought he was dead.
I saw some news report

375
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,772
About a skinny guy
who got hit by a garbage truck,

376
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,140
And I figured, welp,
I'm a widow now.

377
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
Hello, wife.

378
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,709
(chloe scoffs)

379
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,178
I still think
of you daily.

380
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:45,712
Bernard, what the hell
are you doing?

381
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,147
You're not willoughby.

382
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,649
I thought willoughby was
a cosmopolitan man of mystery.

383
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:50,817
It's just you?

384
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,586
Exactly. Just me,

385
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:54,921
Bernard koppelman,
a former fat teenager

386
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,756
Who still swims
with his t-shirt on.

387
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:00,927
Thank you, June, for exploding
this prison of my own creation.

388
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:03,763
I-I have
a-a-a lot of questions,

389
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,999
But right now, I was gonna ask
you, may I borrow your laptop?

390
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,201
I need to access my voicemail
over the internet.

391
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:11,169
Yeah, I don't have a computer.
They're disgusting.

392
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,005
But I do have a vintage
typewriter collection

393
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,606
In case you want
to compose a sonnet.

396
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,712
Okay.

397
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:23,949
Oh! You got the sunglasses.
That's a foul.

398
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:25,150
My bad. I--

399
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:28,052
Steal.

401
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:33,925
"dancing with the stars" is
haunting me.

402
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,993
You see, I practiced,

403
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,429
I was--I was--I was...

404
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,697
Ready.

405
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,533
I didn't get
a chance to do it.

406
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,234
You know what you have?

407
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,303
You have performance
squelchings, brother.

408
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,940
I mean, you're trapped
in a bag with memory cats.

409
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,875
You gotta punch your way
out of it.

410
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,411
I had...

411
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,180
I had a chance to dazzle,
you know?

412
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,882
It got taken away from me.

413
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,249
Who cares, man?

414
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,418
Make your own opportunity,
james.

415
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:04,987
You want to dance,
then dance.

416
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:08,090
We just gotta find you
a floor.

417
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:09,391
Ow! Dude!

418
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,293
Chloe just texted me
willoughby's address.

419
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,728
Willoughby has a floor.

420
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,230
Yeah! Yeah!

421
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,832
Whoa!

422
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:17,899
So close.

423
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,335
So close.

<i>(dance music playing)</i>

425
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:26,107
I went up on the roof with
willoughby

426
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,876
And got a signal.
No messages.

427
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,278
Also, he said that
your marriage wasn't legal.

428
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,513
The priest was some club kid
named stinklord

429
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,949
Who had a tattoo
of a cross on his neck.

00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,786
Is everything okay?

432
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:42,457
Willoughby was one of the last
new experiences I had left,

433
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,925
And it turns out I married him
six years ago.

434
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,928
There are no new mountains
to climb, June.

435
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:50,430
I've seen it all.

What's next for her?

00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,613
Good lord, June, you're,
like, obsessed with her.

456
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,584
Where is she going?
She shouldn't be alone.

457

Chloe,
what--what are you doing?

469
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,122
Oh, every year
when I'm in the hamptons,

470
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,924
I have sex in the bushes
with lenny kravitz.

471
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:22,358
He texted me earlier.

472
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:23,860
I don't know why
you keep complaining

473
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,362
About your cell phone service,
'cause mine's fine.

474
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,431
So you're okay
with all of this?

475
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:31,334
Well, when I was having sex
with lenny, I was thinking,

476
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,169
I've had sex with him
for five years in a row,

477
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,937
And it's still great.

478
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,505
Just because I've done it before
doesn't mean it's not awesome.

We lost a lot of good
party girls along the way.

482
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:44,713
We're not gonna lose
this one.

483

Aah! Don't get all
sentimental on me, james.

the bender takes you, June.

If this is where your bender is
taking you, then so be it.

00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm a celebrity.

525
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,965
Oh, no. Did I say anything
to June last night?

526
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,366
Oh, yeah. (laughs)

527
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,935
You said a lot
of things to June last night.

528
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:24,072
I could eat, like, eight
string cheeses in a row.

529
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,941
You ever seen
that movie "rat race"?

530
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,744
It's like this side of my face
but then this side of my face...

531
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,979
Toenails.

532
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,179
Ugh.

533
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,480
I wrote the script
last night.

534
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:34,581
What?

535
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,950
"dancing with the stars" is

536
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,384
The greatest thing
to ever happen to me

537
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,320
Because it forced me to
make my own opportunities.

538
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,288
I'm gonna make this movie.

539
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,357
It's called "fingered."

540
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,960
It's a cop drama. Luther
read it, said it's amazing.

541
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,461
(luther) it's amazing.

542
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,562
Now don't wash it
till Thursday

543
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:52,899
And don't blow-dry it on high
ever...

544
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,001
Ever again.

545
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:56,535
Bless you. (giggles)

546
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,304
Before we leave,
I want to steal

547
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,306
One of p. Diddy's
white lawn jockeys.

548
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,875
I do it every year.
It's tons of fun.
(door opens and closes)

549
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,542
Good afternoon, all.

550
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,180
Say hello to harkin financial's
newest junior analyst.

551
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:09,281
I got the job!

552
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,849
Whoo! Yeah!

553
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,017
(robin) yay!
Congratulations, June!

554
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:14,987
And I got the car washed.

555
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,855
(under breath)
congratulations, robin.

556
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:18,790
(normal voice) yay!

557
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,091
Yay. (chuckles)

558
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,959
So why did you come back?

559
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,727
I wanted to celebrate
with my friends,

560
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:26,530
And I brought everybody scones
from maude's.

561
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:28,165
Ooh! Delish!

562
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,634
That'll go perfectly
with my kahlua and cream.

563
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:31,903
Ooh!

564
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,371
I made it from
katarina's breast milk.

565
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,705
It's super smooth.

566
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,208
You just drank milk made
from boobies.

567
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:39,242
 - (spits)
- Ew.

568
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:48,634
