00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,858
I don't resent him.
I've told you that.

173
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,561
You know, I happen to think he's
a pompous ass. You don't see it

174
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,567
- 'cause you're in love with him.
- What are you muttering?

175
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
- I'm not muttering anything.
- You certainly are.

176
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,446
You're running down
Lester under your breath.

177
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,742
Hey, I like your brother Ben.

178
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,912
Sure. Ben is a saint.
You're not jealous of Ben.

179
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,409
You think I'm jealous of Lester

180
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,889
because he's a television producer?

181
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,121
No. I think you're jealous
because he's a much-honored,

182
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,920
highly-respected man and he's
a millionaire 10 times over,

183
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,542
and he's doing what
you'd like to be doing.

184
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,920
Hey, listen,
I can't watch his stuff, ok.

185
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,171
It's submental.

186
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
I think he wants to talk
to you about a job.

187
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,679
I don't need a job.

188
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,678
And didn't I get honorable mention
at that festival in, in, in...

189
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,764
In Cincinnati? The Cincinnati
Documentary Film Festival?

190
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,186
This is what you're clinging to?

191
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,514
Everybody got honorable
mention who showed up.

Yeah, well,

- Mmm-hmm.

- Hello, Lester.

Oh, hi. Hello, darling.

204

- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.

205
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,094
- It's a beautiful party.
- Thank you.

to both sides, but,

heavily slanted to the left.

to make a film about, uh,

00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,785
But I promised her nothing.

339
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,962
But did I?
See, I don't even know anymore.

340
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,549
In the heat of passion,
you say things.

341
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,927
All I know is, after two years
of shameful deceit,

342
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,219
where I led this double life,

343
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,888
I awakened as if from a dream

344
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,849
and realized what I'd be losing.

345
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,642
It's called wisdom.

346
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,720
It comes to some suddenly.

347
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,600
We realize the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

348
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,316
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

349
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,155
You know,
I kidded myself about loving her,

350
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,066
but deep down I knew,

351
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,947
knowing I behaved selfishly.

352
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,741
For pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

353
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,990
Sometimes when there's
real love and

354
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,493
true acknowledgment of a mistake,

355
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,795
there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.

356
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,540
I know Miriam.

357
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,375
Her values, her feelings,

358
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,511
her place among
our friends and colleagues...

359
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,670
But what choice do you have

360
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,631
if the woman is going to tell her?
You...

361
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,342
You have to confess the wrong

362
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,927
and hope for understanding and

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,763
maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too,

364
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,771
and you have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

365
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,437
And maybe you and Miriam
can never go back to the old life,

366
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,865
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding.

367
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,362
Maybe I...

368
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,114
Maybe even a richer one.

369
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,655
You know what's funny?

370
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,541
Our entire adult lives,

371
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,498
you and I have been having

372
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,750
this same conversation
in one form or another.

373
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes, I know.

374
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,882
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

375
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,963
You see it as harsh
and empty of values and pitiless,

376
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,221
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

377
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,643
a moral structure with real meaning

378
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,811
and forgiveness.

379
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,973
And some kind of higher power.

380
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,479
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.

381
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,020
And I know you well enough to know

382
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,856
that a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.

383
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,117
Now, you're talking to me
like your congregation.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

385
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,246
It's true.
We went from a small infidelity

386
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,994
to the meaning of existence.

387
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,620
Miriam won't think two years
of scheming and dishonesty is a...

388
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,830
ls a small infidelity.

00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,356
I give up.

God, you're in such
wonderful shape.

- Yeah?

You know,

401
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,804
I don't think we
should do this here.

402

Well, why not?
We're all alone.

- Oh.

I have an idea.

439
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,267
I thought if we could get away.
Just...

440

Just for a little while
on one of our trips.

441
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,057
Our trips are the warmest
memories I have,

442
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,642
not just in our relationship,

443
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,148
but some of the loveliest
times I've ever had.

444
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,196

more relaxed away from home.

- I can't.

and it...

463
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,868
it occurs to me, I mean, if I...

464
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,992
If I have caused you
to miss out on any opportunities

465
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,793
that might have been
lucrative for you,

466
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,963
I'm... I'm perfectly prepared
to, to reimburse you.

467
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,006

want to feel I've cost you...

468

I'm not after your goddamn money!

469
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,381
I want to speak to Miriam.

- Now keep her out of it.

- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it, all right?

472
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,147
I think she should know her husband
is a liar and an embezzler.

Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

I'm not blind.

475
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,911
I know what went on between those
philanthropies and your stocks.

476
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,408
I took nothing, not a nickel, ever.

477
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,286
My conscience is completely clear.

478
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,083
You needed money
to cover your losses.

I mean, after a lifetime of hard work,

482
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,589

himself go down the toilet.

I mean, does he?

484
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,013
And moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

485
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,164
- Without asking or telling anyone?
- Look, listen to me.

486
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,223
Every cent was accounted
for with interest.

487
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,352
I don't think they
would see it that way.

488
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,604
So this is it, right?
This is what you plan on doing.

489
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686
You're gonna hold on
to me with threats, right?

490
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,363
Stupid threats and slander.

491
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,759
This is your idea of love, right?

492
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,617
I will not be tossed out!
I want to speak to Miriam!

493
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,403
Think, for Christ's sake!

494
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,784
Well, think... Think what the hell
you're doing to me, will you?

495
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,164
Please.

496
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,162
I can't figure it out.

497
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,035

just looking for a punch line,
you know?

504
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,139
And what makes New York
such a funny place, is that

505
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,977

and misery and craziness here.

some distance from it.

00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,527
if it's... If it bends, it's funny.

00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,454
If it breaks, it's not funny.

512
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,657
So you gotta get back from the pain.
You see what I mean?

513
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,912
But the... The, uh...

514
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,540
Like they said, they asked
me up in, uh, at Harvard,

515
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,713
a bunch of kids asked me,
"Why... What's comedy?"

516
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,879
So, I said...
And then this is...

517
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,299
This is part of what I'm trying
to say about getting back from it.

518
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,423
I, I said,
"comedy is tragedy plus time."

519
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,797
Tragedy plus time.

520
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,757
See, when...
The night Lincoln was shot,

521
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,093
you couldn't joke about it.
You couldn't make a joke about that.

522
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,473
You just couldn't do it.

523
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,852
Now time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

524
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,771
See what I mean?
It's tragedy plus time.

525
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,352
CLIFF: Okay. We're out.

526
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,687
That's it? So fast?

527
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,818
I shot up 10 rolls on
your first question.

528
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,946
All right, I gotta...
I gotta get to CBS Anyway.

529

Remember where we were.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

530
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
Just... Just remember
what I was saying.

531
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,288
- What do you think? All right?
- Excellent.

532
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,866
- Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

533
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,041
I'm gonna do it more...

534
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,618
I'm gonna be more relaxed
tomorrow, you know?

535
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,328
I'm gonna do that tragedy stuff.
I got good stuff on that.

Would you excuse me one second?

538

Listen, I know I told
you this before,

539
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,927
but if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

540
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,563
Wouldn't you rather
leave it to science?

541
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,089
- That's okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
- Will you listen?

542
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,052
Will you listen? I'm offering you my heart.
You're squashing it. Come on.

this organization, come work for me?

I'm much too opinionated.

That's very good.

I'm sorry, but we've got...

551
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,987
OK, I'll be...
I'll be right with you.

- Would you please come?
- Yes.

- You promise?
- Wait in the car. Wait in the car.

It's Halley Reed.

Sorry. I freckle.

562

I can't do any better than that.

563

Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

Yeah. It's Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

569

Okay.

Excuse me.
We haven't officially met.

I'm one of the associate producers.

I'm Clifford Stern.

574
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,205
Can I ask you the same
question that I asked the producer?

575
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,032
What do you bother
with this guy for?

576
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,368
I mean, he's, you know,
he's such a pompous bore,

577
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,704
- and your show does such great profiles.
- Well, listen,

578
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,163
I'll tell you just
between you and me.

579
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,214
I wanted to do
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

580
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,382
That's perfect.

581
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,552
They like to mix it up.
They like a little variety.

582
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503
After all, he is an
American phenomenon.

Yeah, but so is acid rain.

Boy, you really don't
like him, do you?

585
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,926
I love him like a brother.

00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,896
So, why... Why are
you doing this show?

588
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,895
It's very unusual for them to bring
in an outside person like this.

589
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,648
Well, yes, I know. I'm... I'm
doing it strictly for the money.

590
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,247
I wanna, you know... I'm trying to
make my own documentary on...

591

I'm doing a profile on a guy

592
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,158
who would be absolutely
perfect for your show.

593
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,951
- He would be worthy.
- Yeah, who's that?

<i>that you behave morally.</i>

602

for the series.

You know, we could scrap Lester...

We can't dump Lester,

a little financing for you.

if all this comes together right,

we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

623
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,270
That would be wonderful.
For me to get something on your series

<i>So we both came back here,</i>

679
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,896
<i>and, um, Jenny was away.</i>

680
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,604
<i>You know, she was sleeping
over at a friend's house.</i>

681
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,777
<i>And it was like 1:00
in the morning or something,</i>

682
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,534
<i>and we both had,
had a little to drink.</i>

683
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,700
You know, I want to
tie you to the bed.

684
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,077
- Really?
- And rip your dress off.

685
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,282
Oh.

686
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,623
Have you ever, uh, been bound up,

687
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,709
tied up, and made love to?

688
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,792
(STUTTERING)
Um, I'm... I'm... I'm a...

689
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,668
I'm a sensible gal.

690
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,675
No more, you're not.

691
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,880
Oh.

692
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,633
God, Murray, God.

693
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,142
God, uh...

694
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,971
Barbara, I'm shocked
at what I'm hearing.

695
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,306
You're my sister.

696
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,312
You're this nice
middle-class mother.

697
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,064
What...
What are you telling me?

698
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,982
I couldn't move.

699
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,530
I was tied tightly to the bedposts.

700
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,361
Oh, Jesus.

701
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,614
By a...
A guy that you didn't know?

702
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,492
Well, now... Now you're gonna tell
me that he robbed you, right?

703
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,247
No.

704
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,538
He got on top of me and...

705
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,788
- And what? What?
- I can't say it.

706
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,794
I just... I can't say it.

707
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,251
What? Tell me.
What's so terrible?

708
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,753
He sat over me

709
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,047
and went to the bathroom.

710
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,508
Oh! Oh! Oh!

711
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,514
That's so disgusting!

712
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,977
Oh, my God.

713
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,021
That's the worst thing
I ever heard in my life!

714
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,190
Then he took his clothes and left.

715
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,984
Oh, Barbara, you idiot!

716
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,687
This guy could've cut your throat.

717
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,067
He could've murdered you.

718
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,773
I would've preferred it.

719
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,361
Oh, Jesus,
you're such a dope!

720
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,239
I wish I could have
sympathy for this.

721
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,696
- That's the...
- Oh, that's so easy for you to say,

722
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,656
but I'm so lonely.

723
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,992
You don't know what it's
like to be by yourself

724
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,543
all the time.

725
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,996
Look, I'm sure you're lonely,
I know it's painful,

726
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,379
but promise me that you're never
gonna place another ad again.

727
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,380
Because that's just,
you know, it's ridiculous.

728
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,803
My whole life is
passing me by,

729
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,176
and I don't have
anyone to love.

730
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,850
I know that's so hard
for you to comprehend

731
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,393
because you're married.

732
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,596
But it's just so lonely out there.

733
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,431
I mean, you have a
wife and you love her,

734
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,812
and that's so nice.

735
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,063
Let me tell you something.

736
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,520
Things are not so good
between my wife and myself

737
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,230
just so you don't
get any illusions.

738
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,317
You know, we're... We... We've been
coming apart for the last year.

739
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,656
You know, it's just that
neither of us has the energy

740
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,987
to do anything about it,

741
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,663
but it's not so great.

742
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,759
A strange man

743
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,054
defecated on my sister.

744
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,140
Why?

745
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,565
I don't know.

746
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,396
Is there any...
Is there any

747
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,854
reason I could give you that would
answer that satisfactorily?

748
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,440
You know, it's just so...

749
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,817
Human sexuality is just...

750
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,035
It's so mysterious

751
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,284
which I guess is, you know,

752
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,206
I guess is good in a way.

753
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,003
Yeah, well, I gotta be up at 7:00.

754
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,309
JACK: I knew it had to be some
kind of a deep, dark secret

755
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,852
for you to stoop to call me.

756
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,645
I mean, to actually
invite me to your home.

757
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,689
JUDAH: Come on, Jack,
don't hit me while I'm down.

758
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,357
I mean, who should I
turn to but a brother?

759
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,980
I've been there for you.

760
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,060
I'm here, aren't I?

761
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,693
So don't make sharp cracks.
I didn't stoop to call you.

762
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,274
I'm in serious trouble.

763
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,448
She won't take money,
she won't listen to reason.

764
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,162
I even toyed with the idea of
telling everything to Miriam,

765
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,740
but she'd never be
able to live with it.

766
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,835
Add to that, her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

767
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,037
Not that I stole, but I...

768
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,588
I was indiscreet and

769
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,716
if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

770
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,593
What would you like me to do?

771
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,550
I don't know, but she's killing me.

772
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,553
Want me to have
somebody talk to her?

773
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,301
Like what?

774
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,768
Straighten her out.

775
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,354
What do you mean, threaten her?

776
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,601
That's all I need.

777
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,270
How else do you expect
to keep her quiet?

778
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,103
I don't know.
Jack, I don't know.

779
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,530
Well...

780
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,033
Christ, Jack,
what are you suggesting?

781
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,490
What did you call me for?

782
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,198
I don't know. I... I hoped

783
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,749
you'd have more experience
with something like this.

784
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,711
You called me because you
needed some dirty work done.

785
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,334
That's all you ever call for.

786
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,751
Look how bitter you are.

787
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,592
You've staked me plenty of times.

788
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,891
I don't forget my obligations.

789
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,430
Threatening her would
only make it worse, Jack.

790
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,975
Okay. Forget about it.

791
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,351
What do you want me to say?

792
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,524
How the hell can I forget about it?

793
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,067
I'm fighting for my life.

794
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,979
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

795
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,026
That's what I'm saying, Judah.

796
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,574
If the woman won't
listen to reason,

797
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,322
then you go on to the next step.

798
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,612
What, threats? Violence?

799
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,117
What are we talking about here?

800
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,573
She can be gotten rid of.

801
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,124
I mean, I know a lot of people.

802
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,701
Money will buy whatever's necessary.

803
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,144
I'm not even going to comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

804
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,464
Well, what did you want me
to do when you called me?

805
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,004
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

806
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,304
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam, now. She's...

807
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,804
She's talking financial doings.

808
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,970
I'm out of ideas.

809
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,687
I don't know what I expected from you,
Jack, but maybe some help.

810
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,358
You know, you're not aware

811
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,981
of what goes on in this world.

812
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,653
I mean, you sit up here
with your four acres

813
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,402
- don't give me any of that stuff.
- ...and your country club

814
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,733
- I don't want to hear about my success.
- ...and your rich friends and

815
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,783
out there in the real world,

816
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,953
- it's a whole different story.
- Come on.

817
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,826
I've met a lot of characters
from when I had the restaurant...

818
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,824
I know you have.
I've heard these stories before.

819
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,959
From 7th Avenue,
from Atlantic City,

820
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,129
and I'm not so high-class that I can
avoid looking at realities.

821
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,922
I can't afford to be aloof.

822
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,634
And you come to me
with a hell of a problem,

823
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,552
and, uh, then you
get high-handed on me.

824
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,969
Jack, I don't mean
to be high-handed.

825
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,088
I haven't been sleeping nights.
I'm irritable, okay?

826
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,889
- Okay. Okay. Forget I said anything.
- Okay.

827
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,146
Now let me just get
something straight here.

828
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,188
Am I understanding you right?
I mean...

829
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,900
Are you suggesting
getting rid of her?

830
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,078
You won't be involved.

831
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,989
But I'll need some cash.

832
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,499
What will they do?

833
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,214
What'll they do?
They'll handle it.

834
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,007
I can't believe I'm talking
about a human being.

835
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,215
Jack, she's not an...
An insect.

836
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,844
You don't just step on her.

837
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,681
I know.

838
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,808
Playing hardball was
never your game.

839
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,352
You never liked to get
your hands dirty.

840
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,059
But apparently this
woman is for real,

841
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
and this thing isn't
just gonna go away.

842
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,649
I can't do it.

843
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,198
I can't think that way.

844
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,405
No.

845
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,282
Mmm-mmm.

846
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,208
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

847
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,667
<i>I don't want to know
anything about it.</i>

848
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,252
<i>This is a work of art.</i>

849
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,546

00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,353
Alva's gonna play a small
part in the, uh, new series.

1022
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,828
I don't know what she's gonna
do, but I just know I want her.

1023
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,266
- It's wonderful. You look great.
- Thank you.

1024
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,429
- It's wonderful.
- Thank you.

1025
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,152
Trust me, they love you.
Wonderful. Be right out.

1026
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,528
All right, okay.

1027
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,026
Don't do that while
he's shooting. Don't.

1028
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,778
It's messing my hair up.

1029
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,279
All right, now, you
understand what I'm saying?

1030
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,530
- MAN: No.
- Think of Oedipus.

1031
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,238
Oedipus is funny. Oedipus...
That's the structure of funny

1032
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,322
right there.

1033
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,873
"Who did this terrible
thing to our city?

1034
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,541
"Oh, my God, it was me."
That's funny.

1035
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,369
See, but the difference is one...

1036
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,874
Don't do it while they're shooting!

1037
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,671
What the hell are you doing?

1038
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,297
<i>LEVY: You will notice</i>

1039
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,345
<i>that what we are aiming at</i>

1040
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,345
<i>when we fall in love is
a very strange paradox.</i>

1041
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,052
<i>The paradox consists of the fact</i>

1042
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,137
<i>that when we fall in love,</i>

1043
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,103
<i>we are seeking to re-find</i>

1044
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,356
<i>all or some of the people</i>

1045
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,980

attached as children.</i>

1046
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,777
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1047
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,858

<i>or siblings inflicted on upon us,</i>

1051
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,166

00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,840
<i>the attempt to return to the past</i>

1053
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,676

No bimbos.

1056
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,425
You know, just a, a,
a thinker, an intellect.

1057
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,056
You know, I was just thinking.
I was thinking

1058
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,432
when you...
When you ultimately show this

1059
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,640
to the pro... Uh, the people
that make the final decision...

1060
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,442
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...l think you should emphasize

1061
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,268
his overall view of life.
I mean, 'cause it's great.

1062

(STAMMERING)
It's large and life-affirming.

1063
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,817
- Well, well, I plan to.
- They love a positive statement.

1064
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,068
- Good.
- See, this is what I need, a little...

1065
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,866
A little interest in my work. A little
encouragement or something, you know.

1066
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,865
It's, uh...
Let me ask you something.

1067
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,572
<i>I got a, a bottle of
champagne as a prize.</i>

1068
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,454
It was sent to me from Paris.
I, uh, got honorable mention, you know,

1069
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,877
for a little documentary
that I did on leukemia.

1070
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,078
And, and, um.

1071
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,629
(STUTTERING)
You want some champagne?

1072
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,106
I... I... I...

1073
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:32,448
We can open it and
celebrate or something.

1074
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,125
I never say no to
champagne or caviar.

1075
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,208
Ok, that's perfect.
I, I have no caviar, of course.

1076
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,425
I have oat bran which
is better for your heart.

1077
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,011
He was very eloquent on the subject
of love, didn't you think?

1078
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,477
Yeah. Wish I had read him
before I got married, you know?

1079
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,983
It would have saved me
a gallbladder operation.

1080
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,560
Sorry. What did you say?

1081
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,735
Nothing.

1082
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,654
You know, he wrote a
very interesting book

1083
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,653
on human relationships.

1084
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:01,032
He speaks very, very highly
of love at first sight.

1085
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,239
My ex-husband and I fell
in love at first sight.

1086
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,749
Maybe, I should have
taken a second look.

1087
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,995
<i>No, actually, it was...
it was my fault as much as his.</i>

1088
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,205
I noticed that you,
you still wear a wedding ring.

1089
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,585
- Uh, urn.
- Is there any reason for that?

1090
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,665
Well,

1091
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,801
I don't know. I guess I'm
just not ready to take it off.

1092
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,171
It's good, you know?
You know, it keeps me

1093
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,131
from, from getting
asked out on dates.

1094
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,254
Really, you must have had
a pretty terrible marriage

1095
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,306
if you... If you don't want to
be asked out on any dates.

1096
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,763
Well, no.
I mean, he, he was great.

1097
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,167
He was, you know, very brilliant.

1098
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,382
- He's an architect.
- Uh-huh.

1099
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,979
Real handsome and everything.

1100
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,687
But if you're gonna have an
affair, not with my best friend.

1101
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,818
- Really?
- In my four-poster bed.

1102
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,867
And they definitely didn't have
to finish all my pistachio nuts.

(PHONE RINGING)

1104
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,243
Really?
That inconsiderate? Well,

1105
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,243
I hope it hasn't soured you
on, on marriage or men...

1106
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,450

sounding like a bore.

Just the opposite.
Hello.

1108
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,999
(STUTTERING) Yeah, she's here.
How did you know?

1109
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,040
Oh, hold on one second.

1110
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,500
It's Lester.

1111
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,298
Hello.

1112
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,795
Yeah.

1113
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
Sure, if you want me to.

1114
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,057
Yeah, okay.
At the office at what time?

1115
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,724
- 9:O0?
- 9:O0?

1116
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,772
- The building will be dark.
- Okay, that's no problem.

1117
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,565
The floor is dark.
There's nobody at the office.

1118
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,642
I didn't... Didn't hear that.

1119
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,398
The office is closed.
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

1120
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,229
no, I won't forget the outline.

1121
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,735
Yeah, the office is kind
of a spooky place at 9:00.

1122
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,067
Definitely.

1123
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,026
(STAMMERING) Sure.
The hotel's even nearer.

1124
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,351
- That's... That's better for me.
- Don't go to the hotel.

1125
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,206
- What was that? Okay, room 1911. Sure.
- Hey, you...

1126
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,830
(STAMMERING) Okay.
I'll see you there. Okay.

1127
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,408
You're not gonna go
to a hotel with him.

1128
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:33,982
Yeah, sure.

1129
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,414
- What's the matter with you?
- It's crazy. I better go with you.

1130
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,795
- Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
- This guy, I know this guy.

1131
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,421
He won't be able to
take his hands off you.

1132
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,094
He'll get you in the room,
you know, and he'll...

1133
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,716
He'll read you your Miranda rights,

1134
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,469
- and he'll tear your clothes off.
- No, he's interested

1135
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,141
in producing something of mine.

1136
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,593
- Your first child.
- Oh, God.

been seduced by a guy

Much less one who says "nucular."

1140
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,183
And he also says "foilage."

1141
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,068
- I don't like it.
- What are you doing with a copy

1142

of <i>Singin' in the Rain?</i>

1143

It's a...
It's a very good 16 mm print.

1145

- I play it every couple of months...
- Gosh.

1146
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,536

1147

1148
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,491

years ago. I remember loving it.

1149

television very, uh, very frequently.

1152
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,496
I could play it on this thing,
reel by reel.

- Yeah. You want to have dinner?

00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,675
- Anything to do right now?
- No, no.

1155

you got till 9:00. I, uh, I...

You know, why not, well,

right near. I'll send out.

I wish you'd go back
to your old job.

1349
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,964
I used to edit
newsreel footage, so,

1350
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,259
you know, floods,
and fires and famines

1351
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,257
and, uh, it's depressing.

1352
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,976
Listen, we don't all
have to go, you know.

1353
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,343
Oh, no. I do.

1354
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,799
You know what?
I'll tell you what. We'll go,

1355
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,385
and why don't you two stay, and you
have business to talk over, right?

1356
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,789
I could go with you, if you like.

1357
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,936
Let's just go. Okay?

1358
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,935
Why don't... Why don't
we go someplace quiet for a drink?

1359
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,607
I wouldn't mind that.
It's fine.

1360
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,481
I'm... I'm just exhausted.

1361
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,856
From what? It's early.

1362
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,062
(SIGHING)
Some other time.

1363
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,237
Come on, one little drink.

1364
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,190
Really. Some other time.

1365
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,657
(SIGHING) Jesus, Lester was
so pushy tonight, you know.

1366
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,283
He comes on with Halley

1367
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,990
like it's business,
but he's after her.

1368
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,666
Oh, please,
what are you talking about?

1369
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,021
She really likes him.
I can tell.

1370
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,170
Oh, you've got to be kidding.
You tell me she likes him?

1371
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,417
What, kidding?
What's not to like?

1372
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,214
What, you think I'm crazy?
He's, he's attractive,

1373
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,792
he's, he's rich.
He's the most charming man.

1374
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,154
He's your brother is what he is.

1375
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,303
You know, you're prejudiced.
She put him down pretty good

1376
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,595
when he said,
"Let's go have a drink."

1377
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,843
She said, "Some other time."
I loved that.

1378
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,344
- Oh, come on.
- The way she said, "Some other time."

1379
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,379
Just socked it right to him.

1380
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:24,952
All right. Oh, fine,
fine, you made your...

1381
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,432
- Some other time.
- Yes, enough already. That's enough.

1382
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,513
That was pretty witty.
What makes you think she likes him?

1383
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,768
- That's so annoying.
- What makes me...

1384
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,049
Didn't you see the way
she was staring at him all night?

1385
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,317
She was staring at him all night.

1386
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,940
She probably can't believe her eyes.
I stare at the guy.

1387
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,239
No, come on.
You wouldn't pick up on those things

1388
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,315
if they hit you over the head.

1389
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,696
You're not the least bit
romantic, and that's the problem.

1390
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,075
Hey, honey, you're the one who
stopped sleeping with me, okay?

1391
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,952
It'll be a year come April 20th.

1392
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,659
I remember the date exactly
'cause it was Hitler's birthday.

1393
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,868
I'm not discussing that anymore.

1394
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,328
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

1395
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,754
It's just enough about that.
Meantime, I'll bet you,

1396
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,331
she's out having a drink
with him right now.

1397
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,381
For how much?

1398
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,459
For how... I'm serious.
For how much, huh?

1399
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,385
You really know how to get my goat.

1400
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,368
Hi, it's Clifford.

1401
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:28,948
Yes, I... I...

1402
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,376
I knew you'd be in.
I just... I just wanted, you know...

1403
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,703
Tonight was a lot of fun.

1404
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,914
Wasn't Lester so silly?

1405
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,879
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

1406
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,336
The guy presses. I was... I was
frankly embarrassed for him.

1407
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,721
(STUTTERING)
What is he doing there?

1408
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,140
What do you mean, you're talking
business at 12:00 midnight?

1409
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,767
Well...

1410
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,397
Gee, that could be very dangerous.

1411
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,026
You, you want me to...
You want me to come over?

1412
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,320
Oh, okay, if you, you...
if you can handle it.

1413
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,158
(STUTTERING) Okay. Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1414
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,543
I'm completely in love with Halley,

1415
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,220
and Lester is starting
to make his move. I can see it.

1416
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,094
And he, he wants it just
for conquest. I can tell.

1417
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,642
You know, it's so shallow
and I'm crazy about her.

1418
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,186
You know, and how can I compete
with the guy because he's rich

1419
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,222
- and he's famous, he's successful.
- Oh, come on,

1420
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,107
he's no competition for you.

1421
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,302
Oh, God bless you for saying
that, sweetheart, really.

1422
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,231
You know, but you'll find
as you go through life

1423
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,235
that, that great depth
and, and smoldering sensuality

1424
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,658
does not always win.
I'm sorry to say.

1425
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,906
Meanwhile, his brother Ben,
you know, Ben the rabbi?

1426
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,659
He's a wonderful guy.

1427
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,956
The poor guy called me last night.
He's going blind.

1428
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,749
He's got a terrible eye disease

1429
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,042
and he's losing his sight.

1430
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,758
He's gonna be blind in
another few months.

1431
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,547
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

1432
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,842
JUDAH: All right. Look left.

1433
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,383
Now, straight ahead, Ben.

1434
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,758
Now, to the right.

1435
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,052
That's good.

1436
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,561
My mother said

1437
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,980
that I should go to the doctor.

1438
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,280
Uh-huh.

1439
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,905
'Cause I was, you know,
my eyes weren't so good.

1440
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,863
- Well, you're an ophthalmologist.
- Yeah.

1441
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,074
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

1442
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, I believe they're windows,

1443
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,169
but I'm not sure it's
the soul they see.

1444
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,588
My mother taught me I have a soul.

1445
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,008
And it will live on after
me when I'm gone.

1446
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,136
And if you look deeply
enough in my eyes,

1447
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,009
you can see it.

1448
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,757
Hmm.

Look, I'd like to get this resolved
before my daughter's wedding.

1452
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,652
Judy is getting married?

1453
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,946
Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

1454
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,864
Remember, she was just a baby?

1455
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,613
Well, yours, too.

1456
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,444
Yes.

1457
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,538
Are you okay, Judah?

1458
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,286
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't look so good.

1459
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:18,539
I'm fine. I, I just haven't
been sleeping that well.

1460
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,583
Tell me, if I'm not prying,

1461
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,257
did you ever resolve
your personal difficulties?

1462
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,381
JUDAH: Uh, yes, actually, uh...

1463
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,714
Resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

1464
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,140
Did she?

me to be, my old self?

1471
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,441

No good can come of this, Jack.

Hey, don't be so guilty.
I kept you uninvolved.

The guy who's responsible is gone.
He's back in New Orleans.

1475
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,750
It's pure evil, Jack.

1476
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,913
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

yourself a million times.

Jack, I went to her place after.

1485
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,563
I had to retrieve some
incriminating things. I...

1486

to work out for him.

1514
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,312
What are you putting everyone
through this mumbo-jumbo?

1515
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,568
Bring on the main course.

1516
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,400
I apologize for my
disrespectful sister.

1517
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,992
This is the 20th century.
You have young boys sitting here.

1518
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,671
Don't fill their heads
with superstition.

1519
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,083
Oh, the intellectual.
The schoolteacher.

1520
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,628
Spare us your, your, your
Leninist philosophy just this once.

1521
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,172
What, you're afraid if you don't obey
the rules, God's gonna punish you?

1522
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,215
He won't punish me, May.
He punishes the wicked.

1523
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,668
Oh, who? Like Hitler?

1524
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:55,798
How do you say that?

1525
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:58,756
Six million Jews burnt to death
and he got away with it.

1526
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:02,263
- How did he get away with it? How?
- Come on, Sol. Open your eyes.

1527
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,853
Six million Jews and millions of
others and they got off with nothing.

1528
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,521
MAN: How could human beings
do such a thing?

1529
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,190
Because might makes right.

1530
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,185
That is, until the Americans
marched in and started to...

1531
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,272
- I don't like this talk at my seder.
- Okay, okay, okay, all right.

1532
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,823
- BOY: I think this is interesting.
- Yeah, yeah.

1533
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,116
(ALL LAUGHING)

1534
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,832
You know, wait a minute.
There's this joke

1535
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,283
about the prizefighter
who enters the ring,

1536
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:27,117
and his brother turns to the family
priest and says, "Father, pray for him."

1537
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,079
And the priest said, "I will,
but if he can punch, it'll help."

1538
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,504
So, what are you saying, May?

1539
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,958
You're saying you challenge the whole
moral structure of everything?

1540
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,338
What moral structure?

1541
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,258
Is that the kind of nonsense
you use on your pupils?

1542
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,807
Do you not find human impulse
is basically decent?

1543
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,509
It's basically nothing.

1544
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,720
Such a cynic,
my sister, a nihilist.

1545
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,895
Go back to Russia.

1546
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,270
Well, listen.
I happen to agree with May

1547
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,484
when it comes to all
that mumbo-jumbo.

1548
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,651
SOL: How can you say that?

1549
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,571
You come to every seder,
you pray in Hebrew.

1550
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,859
Yes, I'm going through the
motions, just like any ritual.

1551
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,943
It's a habit.

1552
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,747
What are you saying, May? There's no
morality anywhere in the whole world?

1553
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,374
Listen, for those
who want morality, there's morality.

1554
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,706
Nothing's handed down in stones.

1555
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,038
Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

1556
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,044
It's like an, an ear for music
or the talent to draw.

1557
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,672
He believes, and you can
use logic on him all day long,

1558
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,843
and he still believes.

1559
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,466
Must everything be logical?

1560
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,005
If a man

1561
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,349
commits a crime, if he...

1562
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,268
If he kills.

1563
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,101
Then one way or another,
he will be punished.

1564
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,773
If he's caught, Sol.

1565
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,773
If he's not caught, that which
originates from a black deed

1566
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,274
will blossom in a foul manner.

1567
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,440
Eh, you're relying a little too
heavily on the Bible, Sol.

1568
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,197
No, no, no, no. Whether it's the, uh,
the Old Testament or Shakespeare,

1569
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,619
murder will out.

1570
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,158
Who said anything about murder?

1571
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,739
You did.

1572
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,618
Did I?

1573
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,749
And I say, if he can do
it and get away with it,

1574
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,338
and he chooses not to be
bothered by the ethics,

1575
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:01,669
then he's home free.

1576
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,843
Remember, history is
written by the winners.

1577
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,761
And if the Nazis had won,

1578
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,388
future generations would understand

1579
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,061
the story of World War
ll quite differently.

1580
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
SOL: Your aunt is a
brilliant woman, Judah,

1581
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,974
but she's had a very unhappy life.

1582
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,232
- And if all your faith is wrong, Sol.
- Yeah...

1583
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,939
I mean, just what if, huh?
If, hmm?

1584
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,117
Then I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

1585
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,488
Wait a minute?

1586
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,242
Are you telling me that you
prefer God to the truth?

1587
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,575
If necessary, I will always
choose God over truth.

1588
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,749
I agree with him.

1589
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,247
(ALL CHATTERING)

1590
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,830
I say, what goes around,
comes around.

1591
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,795
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yes.

1592
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,846
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

1593
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,924
- Mrs. Ames is waiting.
- Yeah.

1594
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,684
- Any messages?
- Yeah, you got an odd one.

1595
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:54,143
A Detective O'Donnell called and said he
wanted to talk to you about something.

1596
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,894
Well, I tried to get
him to tell me what,

1597
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,146
but he said he only
wants to talk with you.

1598
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,114
<i>He says, murder, he says</i>

1599
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,739
<i>Every time we kiss,
he says, murder, he says</i>

1600
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,570
<i>Keep it up like this
and that murder he says</i>

1601
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,032
<i>In that impossible tone</i>

1602
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:17,003
<i>Will bring on nobody's
murder but his own</i>

1603
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,298
That was not such a great
movie, but, but, you know, it's fun.

1604
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,375
Yeah, I liked it.

1605
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,964
I think maybe when I'm older
I wanna be an actress.

1606
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,405
I don't want you to be an actress.

1607
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,388
I want you to be on the Supreme Court

1608
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,716
or a doctor or something.

1609
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,427
You know, show business
is, is dog eat dog.

1610
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
It's worse than dog eat dog.

1611
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,309
It's, it's dog doesn't return
other dog's phone calls.

1612
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,606
You know, which is terrible.

1613
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,730
Which reminds me,
I should really check my service.

1614
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,688
Although I don't know why. I haven't had
a message in seven years, you know?

1615
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,023
I call up and I hear the girls
on the other end giggling.

1616
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,325
- Oh, how's Halley?
- She's great.

1617
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,572
I'm going to make my move there,

1618
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:49,732
- I think, you know?
- Yeah.

1619
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,487
But I have this ethical dilemma
'cause I'm married.

1620
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,074
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't know about that.

1621
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,375
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

1622
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,537
Yeah, my, my heart says one thing,
my head says something else, you know?

1623
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,043
Very, very hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

1624
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,670
Let me teach you that, you know.

1625
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,501
In my case,
they're not even friendly.

1626
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,711
Yes?

01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,098
No.

01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,151
Okay, thank you.

01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,065
What's wrong?

1631
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,623
Professor Levy committed suicide.

1632

<i>But we must always remember that we,</i>

1633
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,714
<i>when we are born,</i>

1634
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,633
<i>we need a great deal of love</i>

1635
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,259
<i>in order to persuade
us to stay in life.</i>

1636
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,640
<i>Once we get that love...</i>

1637
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,399
- (PHONE RINGS)
<i>- ...it usually lasts us.</i>

1638

<i>But the universe is a
pretty cold place.</i>

1639
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:00,603
<i>It's we who invest it
with our feelings.</i>

1640
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,484
<i>And under certain conditions,</i>

1641
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,148
<i>we feel</i>

1642
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,488
<i>that the thing isn't
worth it anymore.</i>

1643
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,740
HALLEY: I came as soon as I heard.

1644
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,738
I... I thought
you might not want to be alone.

1645
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,785
Oh, God.
It's been terrible, you know.

1646
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,115
(STAMMERING) I called...
The guy was not sick at all.

1647
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,292
And he left a note, he left a
simple, little note that said,

1648
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,743
"I've gone out the window."

1649
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,750
I mean, this is a major intellectual,
and, and this is his note.

1650
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,910
"I've gone out the window."

1651
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,172
I mean, what the hell
does that mean, you know?

1652
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,768
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

1653
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,633
What... Did he...
Did he have family or anything?

1654
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,840
No. You know, they were
all killed in the war.

1655
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,140
That's what's so
strange about this.

1656
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,685
He... He's seen the worst
side of life his whole life.

1657
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,309
He always was affirmative,
always said yes to life. Yes, yes.

1658
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,604
Now, today he said, "no."

1659
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,273
Boy, can you imagine his students?

1660
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,272
Imagine how shattered
they're gonna be?

1661
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,773
Listen, I don't know
from suicide, you know.

1662
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,776
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

1663
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,357
You know, everyone was too unhappy.

1664
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,863
Boy, you know,
this will put a damper on the show.

1665
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,696
Well, I got 600,000
feet of film on this guy,

1666
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,781
and he's telling how great
life is and everything.

1667
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,036
And now, you know.

1668
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,495
You know, what am I gonna do?
I'll...

1669
01:17:01,521 --> 01:17:03,190
I'll cut it up and make
it into guitar picks.

1670
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:06,373
HALLEY: I'm just thinking, I mean,
no matter how elaborate

a philosophical
system you work out,

in the end

1673
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,549
it's, it's gotta be incomplete.

1674
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,130
I've been so...

1675
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,307
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1676

here for several years now.

- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1709
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,451
Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

1710
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,162

she phoned you here

1711
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,664
- and at your home a number of times.
- Mmm-hmm.

1712
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,704
She was worried about her eyes.

1713
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,039
What was she suffering from?

1714
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,295
Nothing serious, I mean, she, um,

1715
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,427
she had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

1716
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,631
And I could never find anything
very wrong with her, but, uh...

1717
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,967
And I told her that, you know, it was
just a common occurrence.

1718
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,597
She was a hypochondriac?

1719
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,147
No, no. I wouldn't say that,
but she was concerned.

1720
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,892
And there's nothing she ever said

1721
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,735
that you think might be
relevant to the case?

1722
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,858

01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,446

she phoned me a lot.

1737
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,281
I lied, but I know
they saw through it.

1738

I can't take this, Jack.
This is not for me.

1740

you're gonna blow the whole thing.

and now I'm gonna pay.

1742
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,288

make a clean breast of it to the police.

1743

and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

ideas about confessing

I'm not gonna let that happen.

be a man. You're in the clear.

rubbed out, too?

you meant by that remark,

01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,313
"You won't let it happen."
What did you mean by that?

1755
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,861
You're my brother. You've helped me
out in the past, financially.

when you needed it, all right?

1757

Now all of a sudden
you get this urge to confess?

1758
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,910
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress.

1759
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,363
Not about this. This is murder.

1760

01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:06,748
It's probably just as well.

2002
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,674
I plagiarized most of it
from James Joyce.

2003
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,432
You probably wondered why
all the references to Dublin.

Well, Ben, uh,
that's what Ben told me.

01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,009
He says you make films.

2019

about changing the world.

'Cause he's a man who thinks
he can change it.

And after the awful deed is done,

he, he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

2060
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,364
Little sparks of his
religious background,

2061
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,404
which he'd rejected

2062
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,243
are suddenly stirred up.

2063
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,377
He hears his father's voice.

2064
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:34,706
He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

2065
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,884
Suddenly, it's not an
empty universe at all,

2066
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,337
but a just and moral one,

2067
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,264
and he's violated it.

2068
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:46,509
Now, he's panic-stricken.

2069
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,474
He's on the verge of
a mental collapse,

2070
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,934
an inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

2071
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,146
And then one morning,

2072
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,232
he awakens

2073
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,406
and the sun is shining
and his family is around him.

2074
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:08,991
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

2075
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,036
He takes his family on
a vacation to Europe,

2076
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,840
and as the months pass
he finds he's not punished.

2077
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,417
In fact, he prospers.

2078
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,841
The killing gets attributed
to another person,

2079
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,014
a drifter who has a number of
other murders to his credit.

2080
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:28,218
So, I mean, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

2081
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,179
Now he's soot-free.

2082
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,979
His life is completely
back to normal.

2083
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:40,276
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

2084
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,987
Uh, yes, but can he
ever really go back?

2085
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,539
Well, people carry sins
around with them.

2086
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:53,164
I mean, oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment,

2087
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,915
but it passes.

2088
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,547
And with time, it all fades.

2089
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,501
Yeah. But, but, so then, you know,

2090
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:05,259
then, then his worst...
His worst beliefs are realized.

2091
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,966
Well, I said it was a
chilling story, didn't I?

2092
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:11,223
I don't know.

2093
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,976
It... It'd be... I think it'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

2094
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,729
You know, it's... Very few
guys could actually live,

2095
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:19,186
you know, to live with something
like that on their conscience.

2096
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,396
What do you mean? People carry
awful deeds around with them.

2097
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,153
What do you expect him
to do, turn himself in?

2098
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,822
I mean, this is reality.

2099
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,195
In reality, we, we rationalize.

2100
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:32,452
We deny or we,
we couldn't go on living.

2101
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:39,414
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

2102
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,422
'Cause then you see, then your
story assumes tragic proportions.

2103
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,924
Because in the absence
of a God or something,

2104
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,098
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.

2105
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,016
Then you have...
Then you have tragedy.

2106
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,852
But that's fiction, that's movies.

2107
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,932
I mean... I mean,
you've seen too many movies.

2109

I mean, if you want a happy ending,

2110
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,521
