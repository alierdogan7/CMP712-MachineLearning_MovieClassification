- Thank you.
- Thank you, Bryant.

48
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:13,505
For years, you were told

49
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,298
by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne

50
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,425
that the world had ended.

51
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,011
Yes, Reverend Richard told us

52
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:20,846
that there had been a nuclear apocalypse

53
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,347
and that the Earth was scorched

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,975
and there were lakes of fire and stuff.

55
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,434
Cyndee, you were the first young woman

56
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:28,162
forced into this cult.

57
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,497
Yes, I had waited on Reverend Richard

00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,792
at a York Steak House I worked at,

60
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:35,294
and one night he invited me out to his car

61
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,004
to see some baby rabbits.

62
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,090
And I didn't want to be rude, so...

63
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,675
here we are.

64
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,386
I'm always amazed at what women will do

65
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,763
because they're afraid of being rude.

66
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:45,931
- Yeah.
- Gretchen.

67
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,766
You joined this cult willingly.

68
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,853
Yes, the Reverend had bought
some of my hair on Craigslist,

69
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,897
and we started emailing,

70
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,609

had some real good ideas.

00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,253
particularly the shark gummies,

181
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,421
which I hadn't seen elsewhere.

182
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:56,383
And I'm interested
in any employment opportunities

183
00:08:56,467 --> 00:09:02,056
that you might have... [suspenseful music]

184
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,560
- Where do you live?
- [boy] Stranger danger!

185
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:12,900
[bell ringing repeatedly]

186
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,529
Thank God. Are you the dog masseuse?

187
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,198
No. Ma'am, I found your son.

188
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,826
Buckley? Where's Hunong?

189
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,329
She never picked me up,
so I was just walking home.

190
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,454
Liar!

191
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:26,872
I'm sorry. And you work for the school?

192
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,374
- No.
- So you're an Uber driver.

193
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,542
- No.
- So you are the dog masseuse?

194
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,378
Ma'am, I'm a stranger.

195
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,879
Buckley, please get in here.

196
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,631
You know I'm not allowed outside.

197
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:40,052
Okay.

198
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,805
Ma'am, what do you mean,
you're not allowed outside?

199
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,641
- I had a face peel.
- Is that your reverend?

200
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,687
- Did he peel your face?
- I'm sorry?

201
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,147
Do you need help?

202
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:56,194
Answer me honestly. Do you need help?

203
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,530
I do.

204
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:02,241
It's $17 an hour cash, under the table.

205
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:05,036
You'll need to sign an NDA and a DNR.

206
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,704
Do you get sick in helicopters?

207
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,247
I never have.

208
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,707
You'll need to be here by 6:00 every morning

209
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,292
to get Buckley up for school.

210
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,211
Then get me up at 10:00,
but don't wake me up.

211
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:14,545
Can I just say how grateful I am

212
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,880
for this opportunity?

213
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,548
I'm sorry. What is your name?

214
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:18,966
- Oh, it's Kimmy.
- Kimmy.

215
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,385
Are you good at braiding hair?

216
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,761
- I'm awesome at it.
- Fantastic.

217
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,930
Of course, you'll have to meet
the horses first.

218
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,567
Do you want a water?
- No, thanks.

219
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:28,850
- Okay.

220
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,353
This is Charles. He's a tutor.

221
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,146
He'll help you do Buckley's homework.

222
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,023
Also, it's Buckley's birthday tomorrow,

223
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,441
so you'll need to make a cake that's cute

224
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,109
but also paleo.

225
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,111
Swedish, 90 minutes, medium pressure.

226
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,321
I'm going to bed.

227
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:45,993
What in the ham sandwich? I just got a job.

228
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,494
Please tell me that you're normal.

229
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,996
I need someone here to talk to.

230
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,539
Oh, I'm very normal.

231
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,833
I've had everything normal happen to me.

232
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,294
What?

233
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:57,588
Lillian, why is my
doll furniture on the curb?

234
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,132
Because it's all I could carry.

235
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:04,387
Tomorrow real movers come,
Titus, and evict you.

236
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,972
- How dare you?
- You know I love you.

237
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,807
Lillian, I helped you take a shower once.

238
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:09,975
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, white weirdo.

239
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,394
I got a job.

240
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,687
It pays $17 an hour, under the tables,

241
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,857
but I can pay in advance right now

242
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,859
with my... tax refund.

243
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,111
I can have his things out by tonight.

244
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:21,528
[clears throat]
Lillian.

245
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,406
I have decided I will be
taking a roommate.

246
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,740
Oh, you have decided, have you?

247
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,325
Yes, I've decided.

248
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,453
Well, I'm the one that placed the ad...

249
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,913
Actually, I would rather live with someone.

250
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,290
I'm kind of used to having roommates.

251
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:36,252
- Okay. J'approuve.
- [gasps]

252
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,628
When will I be getting my money?

253
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,796
What about my money?

254
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,425
- Slavery reparations, Lillian.
- Touché.

255
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,927
You people have suffered.

256
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:50,808
[exhales sharply]

257
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,018
Is that a real robot?

258
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:54,752
Do people have robots now?

259
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,210
- What?
- Huh?

260
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:57,523
That's my bedroom.

261
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,067
You'll be staying in my office.

262
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:03,737
Ha! I will be very comfortable in here.

263
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,948
It's like two Cyndees by a Gretchen.

264
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:10,244
[gasps] A window. My own window!

265
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,164
[gasps] And it has this.

266
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,097
Where's the rest of your stuff?

267
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,932
Oh, this is it.

268
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:34,143
- You got a secret.
- What?

269
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,812
You moved to New York City
today with a bag full of cash,

270
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,772
no stuff, and what is clearly a wig.

271
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,442
Somebody in here got beans. Spill them.

272
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,902
Okay.

273
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:47,239
Well, the truth is, I'm from Indiana...

274
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,824
Oh, okay.

275
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:49,992
That explains why you're so basic.

276
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,035
Say no more.

277
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:54,205
So let's get this dirty
rent business out of the way.

278
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,625
[clears throat]

279
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,004
As you know, we owe Lillian
two months' back rent,

280
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,923
so that's $950.

281
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,260
Plus this upcoming month.

282
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,683
And, of course, there's a
one-month security deposit.

283
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:21,607
Also, ever since you moved
in, this lamp stopped working.

284
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,943
[switch clicking] So that's another $100.

285
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:26,571
Nice try, Titus.

286
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:27,738
There's no light bulb in there.

287
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:31,909
You got me! You are so very cosmopolitan.

288
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,661
So what do you want to do tonight?

289
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,789
Honestly, listen to Diana Ross albums alone

290
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:39,708
while I do my stretches
to alleviate my gas.

291
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,085
We should go out to celebrate.

292
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,503
I mean, I got a job today.

293
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:46,591
I got an apartment. I met you. I envy you.

294
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,175
I've never been able to meet me.

295
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,261
Come on, we should go
dancing someplace cool,

296
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:52,304
like Club Bombay from Moesha.

297
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:55,266
Whoo! Things are behind in Indiana.

298
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:58,603
I'll pay for everything.

299
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:02,694
- ♪ I'm going out I'm going ♪
- [upbeat music]

300
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,120
Hey, do you want to party with us?

301
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,788
Are you into molly?

302
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:21,250
Am I? She's my favorite American Girl doll.

303
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,300
Titus, dancing is about butts now.

304
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:30,468
It is, girl.

305
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,596
It's really, really good.

306
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,055
Yeah, it's easier to dance.

307
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,225
- Yeah. I'm gonna go get us drinks.
- Okay.

308
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,729
Hello. I do not want to abandon you,

309
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:43,939
but I've been invited to have Korean food

310
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:46,317
- with that pretty chorus boy.
- Oh!

311
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,194
Yes, go have fun. Oh, hey, Titus?

312
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,071
Does this backpack look babyish?

313
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,990
It is a backpack.

314
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,378
- Hey.
- You know what?

315
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,922
- You're the hottest girl in here.
- [scoffs]

316
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,342
As if. Opposite day.

317
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:18,849
Ugh, alcohol... tastes good. I like it.

318
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:23,228
[people cheering and talking]

319
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,858
Your hair smells good.

320
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:30,944
They checked it for lice at the hospital.

321
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:33,989
- I kind of want to kiss you.
- Yes.

322
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:35,866
Do it. I'm fine.

323
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:41,622
What the fudge? My backpack.

324
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,582
Someone yanked my backpack!

325
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,916
Don't worry about it.

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,919
- Shut up. My money's in there.
- [crash]

327
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,672
All right, let's go.

328
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:51,590
But you got to help me find it.

329
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:53,509
It's a purple JanSport.

[sighs]

332
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,462
Actually, Buckley, this isn't
your worst birthday ever.

333
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,923
You worst birthday ever was
when you busted my genitals.

334
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,801
I'm so sorry. I was up all
night. All my money got stolen,

335
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,053
and I haven't had a clock
since my Tamagotchi died.

336
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,431
Uh-uh, this is strike three.

337
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:42,600
What were strikes one and two?

338
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,937
Has baseball changed?

339
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:53,527
Hey, walk of shame. Me, too. Just sat down.

340
00:16:55,821 --> 00:17:00,701
You're okay. You're okay. You are a person.

341
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:03,203
This is your home now.

342
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:04,663
Look, you have a window.

00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,377
Come on, Kimmy.

00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,504
Come on! You're garbage, Kimmy!

Reconsider, girl. I was sleeping.

346
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,760
They stole my backpack.

347
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:19,303
- What?
- I can't do this.

348
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,847
- Reverend Richard was right.
- Wait, who?

349
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,265
Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne,

350
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:24,975
senior prophet and CFO of Savior Rick's

351
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,894
- Spooky Church of the Scary Apocalypse.
- Foo?

352
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,605
I am one of the Indiana Mole Women.

353
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:32,107
From the news. Why didn't you tell me?

354
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,359
Because I just want to be a
normal person, and I can't.

355
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:35,820
I don't know anything.

356
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:37,279
I can't tell phones from cameras.

357
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:38,947
Even policemen have tattoos.

358
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,449
Pack up your trifles and whatnots.

359
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:41,659
- What?
- Get your things and go home.

360
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:42,785
New York City is not for you.

361
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,036
You don't understand. Oh, I do understand.

362
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,497
- But, Titus...
- Girl.

363
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,332
My name is not Titus.

364
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,501
My name is Ronald Wilkerson.

365
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,919
I came here in 1998 on a damn bus

366
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,839
from Chickasaw County, Mississippi.

367
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:56,006
You know who leaves Chickasaw County?

368
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,508
Nobody.

369
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,050
Have you ever met a
person from Mississippi?

370
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,594
No, but I haven't met anybody.

371
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,138
My point is...

372
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,893
This was me then.

373
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:09,895
I was cute, just like you.

374
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:11,938
Showed my teeth when I
smiled, just like you.

375
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,859
I changed my name to Titus Andromedon,

376
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,027
and I marched myself in to
audition for The Lion King.

377
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,904
You were in The Lion King on Broadway?

378
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,114
Yes, except I was not.

379
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:24,785
I auditioned for The Lion
King 20 times in 15 years

380
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,286
until they finally told me,

381
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,577
"You are not passing
as a straight giraffe."

382
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,495
But you are such a good
singer. I heard you.

383
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,123
I have not sung in public in three years.

384
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:34,708
You want to know what I do now?

385
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,043
I dress up in that robot
costume in Times Square,

386
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,879
and I pass out flyers for an arcade.

387
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,089
My boss is 17 years old,
I get paid in quarters,

388
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,507
and I'm starting to think

389
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:43,801
cab drivers are hitting me on purpose.

390
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,343
Well, you got out of Mississippi.

391
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,221
Escaping is not the
same as making it, Kimmy.

392
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,642
I'm very scared to ask you this...

393
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:54,478
Yes, there was weird
sex stuff in the bunker.

394
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,271
Let me finish.

395
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,189
How much money was in your backpack?

396
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,609
$13,000.

Wow.

401
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,831
Take your rent money back,
buy yourself a bus ticket,

402

and leave this place.

403

But you will be evicted.

404

[rat squeaking]

412
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,353
[Reverend Richard] I was talking...

413
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,981
to my good friend God earlier.

414
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,984
We were talking about why
he allowed his creation

415
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,652
to be destroyed,

416
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,822
the earth of the land and
all the fowls of the air

417
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,574
and the sea monkeys of the sea.

418
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,284
And do you know what he hath told me?

419
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,704
That we're all dumb and bad

420
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,372
and that's why he let
the world be destroyed?

421
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:38,832
That's exactly right, Sister Gretchen.

422
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:41,579
Reverend Richard?

423
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:44,708
I was wondering, the
whole world was destroyed,

424
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,418
and everything died, right?

425
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,212
Except for all you dum-dums here, yes.

426
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:49,735
Then how come,

427
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:51,978
when I was cleaning out
the air filter earlier,

428
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:54,451
- I found this!
- [women exclaim]

429

What are you doing here, Amelia Bedelia?

436

you get tooken by a cult
