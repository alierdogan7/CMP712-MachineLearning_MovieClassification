as a minor circulatory problem of the head.

348
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,546
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.

349
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,091
Doctors report that he should be up
and back to his normal schedule soon.

350
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,719
Now, let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.

351
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,681
The president has complete use
of his faculties...

352
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,350
...and retains full executive authority.

353
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,601
Any questions?

354
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,271
The White House classifies
the president's condition...

355
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,107
...as a slight circulatory problem
of the head.

356
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,608
While technically a stroke...

357
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,320
...White House spokesmen say the
president's condition is far from serious...

358
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,698
...and he should be up and about
sometime soon.

359
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,285
Do you know how many different
kinds of laws we've broken?

360
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,455
It's simple, Alan.

361
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,500
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.

362
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,670
We dig up some dirt on him
and then we force him to resign...

363
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,339
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.

364
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,383
The whole thing
takes a couple of weeks.

365
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,262
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?

366
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,308
- I was a senator, you know?
- Oh, I know.

367
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,227
And when our poor president
has another stroke...

368
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,563
...of course this time
much more serious...

369
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,441
...our newly appointed VP becomes....

370
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,359
Jeez.

371
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,069
What about containment, Al?

372
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,280
Thanks.

373
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,329
Okay. We got the nurses for 50 grand
apiece, and the doctors for 100.

374
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,874
- The older guy wanted head of the CDC.
- Is that everybody?

375
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,543
Duane's guys,
he's got them all under control.

376
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,462
Good. What about her?

377
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,796
Her?

378
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,507
Oh, the first lady?

379
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:20,471
She was giving a speech at Bryn Mawr.
I managed to catch her before she left.

380
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,847
And?

381
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,602
I told her his blood pressure went up
after a little incident at the hotel.

382
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,937
She seems to hate him now
more than ever.

383
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,397
Fine.

384
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,693
Everybody else is buying
the "minor stroke" story.

385
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,907
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.

386
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,910
DOCTOR: These are amazing results.
I must say, Mr. President...

387
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,912
...even for a man with a minor stroke...

388
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,915
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.

389
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,583
Oh, that's great.

390
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,543
I'm feeling much better.

391
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,797
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.

392
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,091
Your ECG is completely normal...

393
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,053
...and, uh, your blood pressure
has even gone down.

394
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,098
Have you been exercising recently?

395
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,060
Yes. I mean...

396
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,938
...bicycling and, uh...

397
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,314
...weight lifting.

398

Like that.

401
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,953

I see no reason why you can't, uh...

- No, I don't think so.

As I was saying, nobody expects
you to be Bill Mitchell overnight.

487
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,082
The most important thing to
remember is his general presence.

488
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,541
- Presence.
- Right.

489
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,502
Now, whenever he stands at a podium...

490
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,714
...President Mitchell always has
one hand in the pocket of his coat.

491
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,510
That's at a press conference. Otherwise,
they're almost always on the podium.

492
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,971
Um, I'm not certain about that.

493
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,597
Remember the convention speech?

494
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,934
"An America,
stronger than the one we were given.

495
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,020
An America,
prouder than the one we found."

496
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,774
Right on the podium.
Except on "America," he points.

497
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,734
You know, that is very good.

- Yeah.

America isn't what we say here tonight.

...when the sun goes down."

510
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,608
Can I keep this?

511
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,410
- Thought I wasn't gonna see her.
ALAN: - It's five minutes.

512
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,912
She walks in, you wave
to the press, she leaves.

513
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,999
The first lady. I mean, uh,
couldn't I start with a cousin?

514
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,127
She hardly ever sees him.
She won't have a chance to tell.

515
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,837
Stop whining.

516
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,798
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.

517
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,342
All right.

01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,674
She's terrific. She can do anything.

1529
01:43:43,842 --> 01:43:47,386
- Just the flyers.
- Okay, well, she's changed.

1530
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:51,599
It's the middle of winter. They're gonna
turn off her heat. She needs a job.

1531
01:43:55,729 --> 01:44:00,483
Open. Like this. Like this. Neat. Neat.

1532
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,860
ALICE: - Hi.
- No buttons.

1533
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:05,321
Would you like to volunteer?

1534
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,657
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, you're a good man.

1535
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:11,327
Uh, did you get the fund-raising thing
I sent you? Yeah, City Council.

1536
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,747
- We have flyers here.
DAVE: - Thanks. All right.

1537
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,874
We're on a roll now.
Karen, you got a job.

1538
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:18,334
WOMAN 3: - Thank you.
- It's Monday.

1539
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:22,255
ALL:
And everybody works on Monday.

1540
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,269
DAVE: - Hi.
- Hi, heh.

1541
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:39,272
I understand you find people jobs?

1542
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:40,815
- Well....
- This is great, heh.

1543
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:44,485
Yeah, I'm, uh, running...
You look great.

1544
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:50,324
I saw you on TV at the funeral and....

1545
01:44:50,492 --> 01:44:51,742
Well....

1546
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:53,869
That's finally over.

1547
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:01,877
Uh....

1548
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:04,880
Uh, why don't we go into my office?

1549
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,300
Excuse us.
