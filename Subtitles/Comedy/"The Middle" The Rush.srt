00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:09,916
January means one thing... sorority rush.

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,752
Parties, teas, and dressing to impress.

4
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:13,820
Oh!

5
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,022
Which one do you like better?

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,624
The one with the missing strap

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,759
or the one with the broken heel?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,662
I checked on kickinltcollegestyle.com

9
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,831
in the "brush up on rush" section,

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,100
and they said to be casual but memorable...

11
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,068

13
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:31,704

14
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:33,339
Years.

15
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:35,975
I just really feel like a sorority

16
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,777
is finally gonna be my thing, you know?

17
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,018
I mean, I've made friends
with people in the dorm,

18
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,921
but I just don't feel like
I've really found my people.

19
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,522
Or even my person, really.

20
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:45,490
Well, just remember.

21
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,025
If you get in, that's great,

22
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,927
but if you don't get in, that's fine, too.

23
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:50,862
Angelina Jolie was never in a sorority,

24
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:52,530
and she married Brad Pitt.

25
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,766
Not that marriage is the answer
if don't get into a sorority.

26

Or even if you do.

27
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,802
Marriage is not the answer,
is what I'm saying.

28

Okay. Here's all you got to know.

Kappas, Thetas, Alphas,

Okay.

535
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,522
Just because my life is
over doesn't mean yours is.

536
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,259
Go on. Open it.

537
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm not gonna.

538
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,902
What? Of course you're gonna.

539
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,771
This... this is the year of Sue.

540
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:06,906
You've got big things coming.

541
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:11,177
I do, and I don't think
it's being in a sorority.

542
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,079
What if I got in?

543
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,015
That would mean that next
year I would be a person

544
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,151
who helped make someone feel like this.

545
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,886
Don't be silly.

546
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,322
Yeah, it hurts now, but I'll get over it.

547
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,957
Believe me.

548
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,827
I am all about sisterhood and philanthropy,

549
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,996
but ever since the candle ceremony,

550
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:32,765
I can't stop thinking about that book.

551
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:35,034
And now I wonder... maybe we're not

552
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,003
supposed to just sit around

553
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:40,206
waiting for someone to love
us enough to make us real.

554
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,875
Maybe it's our job to love someone else

555
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,444
for them to become real.

556
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:47,146
We're not the rabbit.

557
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,148
We're the boy!

558
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,451
Wow.

559
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:54,187
That must have been some ceremony.

560
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:56,522
All right, come on. Let's get out of here.

561
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,057
Wait.

562
00:19:58,058 --> 00:19:59,392
Don't you even want to know if you got in?

563
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:00,861
Uh...

564
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,330
Nope, didn't get in.

565
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:06,165
Come on, you're just saying that

566
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,433
to make me feel better.

567
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,501
Honestly, I didn't.

568
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:09,503
Oh, wow. You really didn't.

569
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:13,072
I...

570
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:17,176
I have all these weird,
unfamiliar feelings inside.

571
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,178
Is this what rejection is?

572
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,913
Yep.

573
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,815
Luckily, you're with a pro.

574
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,218
Now, here's what you're gonna want to do...

575
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,186
Cry.

576
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:28,454
But not into your pillow,

577
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,789
'cause you're gonna have
to sleep on it later.

578
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,524
I suggest a sweatshirt or...

579
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:34,827
So, Sue had found a sister,
just not the sorority kind.

580
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:36,462
And the brochures were right.

581
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:38,364
If you go through rush,

582
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:41,801
sometimes you do find exactly
what you're looking for.

583
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,837
And as for Brick, well, we
finally did go bowling.

584
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,839
This is gonna be fun, huh?

585
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,975
Hey, maybe we can even
grab some dinner after.

586
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,810
You know, next time we go to the mall,

587
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:52,078
I think I'm gonna buy a shirt.

588
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,412
Me too.

589
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,815
I'm gonna get a tasteful zombie
shirt that girls would like.

590
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,817
Ooh. You know, I could help.

591
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,151
After the dark-wash jeans,

592
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,954
I really feel like I'm
developing a sense of style.

593
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,090
A person can only wear so much stripes.

594
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,158
I guess it was the natural order of things,

595
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,427
and it was good Brick finally had a friend.

596
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,796
I mean, he didn't talk
to me the whole night.

597
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:12,465
I was basically the chauffeur.

598
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,033
But that's okay,

599
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,501
'cause he'll be driving soon enough.

600
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,436
And who knows?

601
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:20,239
This could be the last time I
ever get to be his chauffeur.

602
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,043
And I was going to enjoy
every minute of it.

603
