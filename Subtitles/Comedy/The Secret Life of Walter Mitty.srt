00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,045
DON: Moving on, as they say.
TED: Yeah.

183
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,180
DON:
Uh, conference room,

184
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,216
uh, more of these stations here

185
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,751
where people sort of
do their thing.

186
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,451
Uh, layouts here for...

187
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,864
Morning, Hernando.

188
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,799
There's a new nut pouch.

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,167
Did you hear?

190
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,902
Uh, yeah.

191
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,704
I... met him.

192
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,072
We're gonna be evaluated.

193
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,306
They won't be able to.

194
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,008
We do intricate
details back here.

195
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,343
Yeah.

196
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,978
It's tricky and bewildering.

197
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,247
I should evaluate you;
you should evaluate me.

198
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,249
(CHUCKLES) I don't think
they'll let us do that.

199
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,382
Just saying.

200
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,256
Hey, how long has
this neg roll been here,

201
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,323
out in the open?

202
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,462
It's a Sean O'Connell.

203
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,830
It came in this morning.

204
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,098
There's a present, too.

205
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,101
He sent you a present
on your desk.

206
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,737
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

207
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,871
That results for me
in a man crush.

208
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,876
Hey, you want to mount these?

209
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,178
Seriously?

210
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,511
Sure.

211
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,950
(CHUCKLES)

212
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,392
SEAN:<i> Heard rumblings</i>
LIFE's<i> done, man.</i>

213
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,894
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

214
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,329
<i>Take a look inside.</i>

215
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,132
<i>A gift for all the years</i>
<i>of hard work.</i>

216
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,101
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

217
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:19,438
<i>I spilled some blood on it while
self-stitching a gun wound to my abdomen,</i>

218
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,008
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

219
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,444
<i>The quintessence of</i> LIFE,
<i>I think.</i>

220
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,280
<i>I trust you'll get it</i>
<i>where it needs to go.</i>

221
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,181
<i>You always do.</i>

222
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,470
What'd you get?

223
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,606
Um, it's a wallet.

224
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,282
With<i> LIFE's</i> motto on it.

225
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,559
Here you go.

226
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,267
Where's 25?

227
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,468
It's not there.

228
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,870
(KNOCKING)

229
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,138
Hey.

230
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,107
We need negative 25.

231
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,310
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.

232
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,511
An actual telegram.

233
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,513
A 100-year-old dude came
in a little hat.

234
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,249
Uh, so there's a floor meeting.

235
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,350
Bring 25.

236
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,290
It-it's here somewhere.

237
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,591
We'll find it.

238
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay, make a contact sheet
of these frames

239
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,029
as soon as you can, and don't
say anything to anyone.

240
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,163
Yeah.

241
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,399
I just wanted to inform you all,

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,533
uh, reluctantly, that...

243
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,275
I guess just start back
from the beginning.

244
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,944
(MAKES REWINDING NOISE)
Okay.

245
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,545
I just wanted to inform you all

246
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,381
reluctantly that, uh,
this month's issue

247
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,083
will be our last.

248
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,218
(CROWD MURMURING)
What?

249
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,919
Yeah, what?

250
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,255
That's some bull.
DON: Yeah.

251
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,222
Sad...

252
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,595
news for sure.

253
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,197
Now, you're all valued employees,

254
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,233
but as we undergo this transition

255
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,901
to, uh,<i> LIFE Online,</i>

256
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,337
we wanted to be candid
with you that, uh,

257
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,340
some of you will be determined
non-vital employees

258
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,108
to the new, uh...
the new partnership,

259
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,178
and we'll be deciding which of those
positions will be remaining with us

260
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,180
over the course of the next week.

261
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,416
Uh, also, we feel sad about that,

262
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,085
as you can see.

263
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,354
(GROANS)
Now, for some good news.

264
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,056
We are very excited for...
All right, Don.

265
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,126
Ted Hendricks, managing director
of the transition.

266
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,662
Never fun, this stage.

267
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,197
Uh-uh.

268
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,598
But we do have ahead of us

269
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,334
the privilege
of publishing what will be

270
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,604
the very last issue
of<i> LIFE</i> magazine.

271
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,373
(CLAPS)
And for the final issue,

272
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,442
we just received a telegram...
come on...

273
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,444
from Sean O'Connell,

274
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,513
who has never, I'm told,

275
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,916
been willing to speak
with the executives here.

276
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,984
(CHUCKLES)
Well, he broke his long silence

277
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:23,589
and shared his thoughts with us
through that... that old man.

278
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,492
Sean O'Connell.

279
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,093
"I expect full consideration

280
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,964
"of negative 25 for cover.

281
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,966
"My most grand,

282
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,635
the quintessence of<i> LIFE."</i>

283
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,605
The... what is that?

284
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,440
What-what is that?
It means, like, the fullest

285
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,175
and most rich.
Okay.

286
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,244
So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever

287
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,347
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

288
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,416
Very full and so rich.

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,221
So let's see this thing, huh?

290
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,656
Let's see it.

291
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,491
Can we... What do we...
What am I doing up here?

292
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,960
What's going on?

293
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,161
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

294
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,262
This gentleman here.
Negative Assets.

295
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,330
Last man in.
What's that?

296
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,265
Ah, Major Tom.

297
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,433
Can I, uh,

298
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,334
get that?

299
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,640
Uh, it's, uh, being processed.

300
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,342
All right, well, let's do it.

301
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,210
Let's process some quintessence.

302
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,212
Come on.

303
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,047
Go.

304
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,582
Now.

305
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,317
That's why I'm clapping.

306
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,418
Wait, when do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

307
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,724
CHERYL (WHISPERING): Please don't worry.
You're going to be fine, okay?

308
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,392
You've been here forever;
I'm sure he won't...

309
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,694
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

310
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,197
It was nice talking to you.

311
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,232
Well, guess I'll talk
to you later. Okay.

312
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,167
Hi.

313
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,336
Hi.
Hi.

314
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,472
I'm, uh, Walter.

315
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,573
Cheryl.

316
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,241
Mitty.
Melhoff.

317
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,610
Yes, You, uh...

318
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,712
you work in Photo Accounts,
right?

319
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,014
I do.

320
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,081
Negative Assets.

321
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,516
Yes. I'm...
Yeah.

322
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,485
Processing the last cover photo.

323
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,220
That's-that's a big deal.

324
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,554
Yeah, it's, uh... there's, uh...

325
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,722
We have a glitch.

326
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,391
Mini on that one right now.

327
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,026
I wanted to say to you,

328
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,293
do you maybe

329
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,697
have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

330
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,466
Um, it's not really
that easy with him.

331
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,468
He moves around so much.
I don't.

332
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,603
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

333
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,204
I don't know where,

334
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,140
and he doesn't have a phone.

335
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,608
No phone? He's old-school.

336
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,675
Yeah.

337
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,577
(CHUCKLES) Well...

338
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,446
Um, but, you know, um,

339
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,747
why don't I check with Peg?

340
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,616
I know she just processed
a check for him,

341
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,418
and we could track
his payout, maybe,

342
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,652
find him that way?

343
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,753
Cool.

344
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,355
Very cool.

345
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,523
Okay.
Okay. Walter.

346
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,524
Yes.
All right.
(BELL DINGS)

347
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,525
All right.
I'm on it.

348
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,526
Okay.
(CHUCKLES)

349
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,693
Thanks.

350
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,095
Yes, okay. Oh,
are you coming?

351
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,663
Yes, I'm not.

352
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,231
Yes, I have to stay.

353
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,867
Here's the contact sheet.

354
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,710
HERNANDO:
What do you see?

355
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,446
WALTER:
This photo cluster, these three,

356
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,514
they're the only printable ones.

357
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,217
He took them around
the same time he took 25.

358
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,453
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

359
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,787
Blow them up, all right?

360

I think I'm just really wiped out

1494
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:56,191
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1495
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:59,528
I think I just need to go
to yoga and then just crash.

1496
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,863
MOTHER:
What is it? A class?

1497
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,865
Yeah, it's yoga.
It's a class.

1498
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,067
I go to the hot kind,
where they heat the room.

1499
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,202
Have you heard of that?
Mm. Sure.

You have?
It's good for you.

ODESSA:
Oh, It's great for you.

1502
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,206
You just get it
all out of your system.

1503
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,574
You just get all your sweat out,

1504
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,076
you just get everything,
all your fear.

01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:15,978

about an audition, and I just...

Ooh, that<i> Grease</i> show?

1507
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,580
Yeah.

excited about it.

1509

even heard of that.

1510

ODESSA: But I just
gotta get it... I just...

1511
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,219
what's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1512
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,220
Just get out of my head.

Is that good, too?

1514
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,624
ODESSA: I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1515
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,093
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1516
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,728
It's not about money.
Ah, wonderful.

1517
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,196
And I feel like, you know,

1518
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,864
it's just for kids,

1519
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,734
but I think it's important
for them to start early.

1520
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,068
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1521
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:42,571
You know, I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1522
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,273
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1523
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:46,909
MOTHER: You'll be
good at that.
Yeah.

1524
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,011
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1525
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:52,147
Hey, Mom?
MOTHER: Yeah.

1526
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:56,250
Did somebody take a picture
of your piano, like, a week ago?

1527
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,889
MOTHER:
I did.

1528
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,256
With Sean's camera.

1529
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,196
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1530
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,964
Yeah, he came to visit.

1531
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,668
Mom, what?

1532
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:14,937
Yeah.

1533
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,872
He wanted to know about
your work schedule,

1534
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,907
when you left,
when you came home.

1535
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,276
He said you really
understood<i> LIFE.</i>

1536
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:23,278
He was really interested
in your work.

1537
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,213
You...

1538
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,049
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1539
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,183
I told you.

1540
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,918
I told you in the produce aisle.

1541
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,354
I remember that.

1542
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:34,056
Oh, maybe you were...

1543
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,857
Odessa, what is it you call it

1544
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,926
when he goes into
one of his little places?

1545
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,828
Oh, zoned out.

1546
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,929
You do that now and then.

1547
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,832
MOTHER:
What's the matter?

1548
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,071
I got fired.

1549
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,939
I lost a picture of his.

1550
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,808
Can you find it?

1551
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,077
No, I don't know where he is.

1552
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:59,247
He's some... someplace
with warlocks or...

1553
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,917
Warlords.

1554
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,685
No, warlocks.

1555
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,354
No. Warlords.

1556
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:09,024
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon,

1557
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:11,860
and maybe he would take my cake

1558
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,362
so that he could get permission

1559
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,964
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1560
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,966
He said he wants to
photograph snow leopards.

1561
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,101
How about that?

1562
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:20,434
Who?

1563
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,446
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1564
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,719
MOTHER:
Mm-hmm. That's where Sean is.

1565
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,889
Crazy Afghanistan.
Yeah.

1566
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,692
In the upper Himalayas.
Mm-hmm.

1567
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:46,194
They can't let you go.

1568
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:49,698
You were Sean's partner.

1569
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,800
He told me that you
were the person

1570
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,368
who worked the hardest

1571
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:57,505
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1572
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,945
You finish his work.

and it just...

1904
01:41:43,531 --> 01:41:46,299
got me where I wanted to go.
