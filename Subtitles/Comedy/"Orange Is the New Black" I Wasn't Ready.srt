00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,690
Both, nice.

373
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,150
That's all you've gotta say?

374
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,870
I've gotta look good.

375
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,870
My first dance is gonna go on Youtube.

376
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,680
Look!

377
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,030
I found a rock that looks like a penis with one ball.

378
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,430
No.

379
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,030
It's my Lance Armstrong rock.

380
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,720
[laughs]

381
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,380
Hold it up. Lemme see, lemme see.

382
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,750
Nice.

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,310
Okay, now lick it softly and tenderly like you would've when you thought he was clean.

384
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,030
-Oh, Jesus shut that thing off.
-You're making a huge mistake. This could go viral.

385
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,750
-Seriously. Shut it off.
-What?

386
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm so fat from all the stress eating. I really don't want a record of it.

387
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,710
You know that's one thing I'm gonna do in prison.

388
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,110
I'm gonna get... ripped.

389
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,860
Like Jackie Warner ripped.

390
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,470
And I'm gonna read everything on my Amazon wishlist...

391
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,470
And maybe even learn to craft.

392
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,470
You know? I could be crafty.

393
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm gonna make it count Larry.

394
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,970
I'm not gonna...

395
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,800
Throw away a year of...

396
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
My life... What the hell are you looking for?

397
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,780
[clears throat]

398
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,910
Oh no.

399
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,460
What is that?

400
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,430
Paper.

401
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,890
Oh Jesus Larry. Why would you want...

402
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,240
Why would I want a felonious...

403
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,020
Former lesbian...

404
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,650
WASP shiksa who's about to go to prision to marry me?

405
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,880
Yes. And all of the stress eating...

406
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,120
Well... because...

407
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,750
This... peculiar...

408
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,930
Underachieving...

409
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,820
Underemployed Jew boy...

410
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,960
Loves her.

411
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,430
And...

412
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,660
Knows that he will never be bored...

413
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,840
And...

414
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,560
Can't believe...

415
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,300
How lucky he is that he met her.

416
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,740
I gotta lock this shit down before you leave, Pipes.

417
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,810
I love you.

418
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
You wanna marry me?

419
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,960
When I get out, right?

420
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,450
Whenever you want.

421
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll be so ripped.

422
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,380
[laughs]
I'll be so ripped.

423
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,460
[laughs]

424
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,440
You can wear a... wedding dress that's like a...

425
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,270
Like a half shirt, you know?

426
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,480
Show off those abs.

427
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,710
Yeah.
[laughs]

428
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,870
This for the grandmothers?

429
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,420
No, my mom's saving that one for my sister. This is my...

430
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,250
Great aunt Marcia's.

431
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,060
She had thyroid cancer and a series of Schnauzers...

432
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,430
All named Schnapps.

433
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,580
That's all I know.

434
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,760
Put it on.

435
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,240
I had it sized.

436
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,160
Good.

437
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,630
[sniffles]
-It's beautiful!

438
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
And that's a yes, right?

439
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,270
Yeah.

440
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,080
Will you say that o- just one more time for me?

441
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,910
And... This time...

442
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,570
Just lean to the camera for the photo.

443
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,750
Oh you asshole!
[laughs]

444
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,320
-Come on, I haven't captured the moment! What?
-Turn it off!

445
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,210
Give me that!
[laughs]

446
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,050
[kisses]
Oo, you're cold. Here.

447
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Bounce your legs up and down. It keeps your feet warm.

448
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,950
Thanks.

449
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,610
You think your man is still gonna be around when you're out?

450
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,930
Yeah he'll be there.

451
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm the love of his life.

452
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,430
34 months is a long time.

453
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,660
Yeah, but she's the love of his life.

454
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,290
[scoffs]
And who the fuck asked you.

455
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,670
Head on out.

456
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,670
[doors slam shut]

457
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,280
Alright. So his tie is gonna match the bridesmaids' dresses

458
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,460
There's gonna be 6 bridesmaids. My cousin's being a bitch...

459
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,000
So I'm thinking about dropping her.

460
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,810
[doors squeak open]

461
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,540
[doors slam shut]

462
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,590
Alright. Let's go.
[doors slam shut]

463
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,140
Alright. Let's go.

464
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,990
[wolf whistle]

465
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,310
[murmuring]

466
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,060
[laughter]

467
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,870
[sizzling sound]

468
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,480
[buzzer goes off, door unlatches]

469
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,660
Hello, Miss Claudette.

470
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,800
Morello.

471
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
You watch out for that one.

472
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Don't get me wrong, she's a good lady.

473
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,450
But you don't wanna get on her bad side.

474
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,630
Go ahead. Go.

475
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,790
Okay, I gotta send you all to other processing. You've got your room assignments...

476
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,080
And I'll meet you back here, show you your bunks.

477
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay?

478
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,860
Don't look so bummed. It'll give you wrinkles.

479
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,060
Alright. Raise your head and look at the lens.

480
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,930
Ah, crap.
[smacks table]

481
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,360
New guy.

482
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,130
What's your name? Bennett?

483
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,480
Bennett, it's not fucking working again.

484
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,950
-Did you turn it on?
-Yeah. I turned it on.

485
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,950
[clears throat]

486
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,270
[typing sounds]
Wait I think I got it.

487
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,450
Ready?

488
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah. Yep.

489
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,830
[error sound]

490
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,320
Wait, no.
[error sound]

491
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,210
-What does this button do?
-No! Don't touch that.

492
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,550
Sorry, princess.

493
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,960
There's a cord right there. D-Do you think that that needs to be connected to something?

494
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,800
Shut your mouth and stand still.

495
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,290
[beep]

496
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,240
-She's right.
-Okay, fine.

497
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,790
[shutter sound]
Got it.

498
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,100
You... I wasn't ready.

499
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Tough shit. Next!

500
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,290
This is a TB test.

501
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,720
Nice veins.

502
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,210
No track marks!

503
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,120
Thanks.

504
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,270
Tattoos?

505
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,990
Oh, yeah.

506
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, fish. You like fish?

507
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,370
Saw it on a scuba diving trip.

508
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,070
Thought it was beautiful.

509
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,440
Mm. I don't like fish.

510
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,620
I like pork, chicken.

511
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,790
But, uh... It's a pretty fish.

512
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,570
Thanks.

513
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,800
It's gonna rub off when I sweat.

514
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,580
No, it won't. It's waterproof.

515
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,890
Stop.

516
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,330
So when this dries...

517
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,250
Should be good to go.
[kisses]

518
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,710
How am I gonna get it off?

519
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,090
Acetone.

520
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,160
Alright Alex, I don't... I don't know if I can...

521
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,420
Hey...

522
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,900
Hey, hey, hey...

523
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,340
Shh...

524
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,030
[inhales, exhales]

525
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,040
You, are a nice...

526
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,700
Young lady, aren't you?

527
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,940
A proper young lady.

528
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,830
[inhales, exhales]

529
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,350
Just picking up her sensible bag in the baggage lane.

530
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,980
Before heading on to her mid-range hotel to go over her schedules.

531
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,390
Museum visits... and fancy dinners.

532
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,750
It's all fine.

533
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,210
It's all good.

534
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,400
And I will meet you in Brussels and everything will work out perfectly, babe. I promise.

535
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,520
It's all gonna be okay.

536
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
Are you okay?

537
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,820
Fine.

538
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,420
I guess.

539
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,880
[papers rustle]

540
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
What's Po-pey?

541
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,260
Popey.

542
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,730
It's a bath products line I'd started with my friend Polly.

543
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,480
Polly and Piper. Popey.

544
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,830
We're gonna be in Barney's.

545
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,370
Barney's?

546
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,780
It's a nice store.

547
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,220
[papers rustle]
It's a pretty big case.

548
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,450
Criminal conspiracy.

549
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,050
That's what they charged me with.

550
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,800
I carried a suitcase of money.

551
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,090
Drug money.

552
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,470
Once.

553
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,760
Ten years ago.

554
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,880
What's that Statute of Limitations on that?

555
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,510
12 years.

556
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,800
That's tough.

557
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,060
Well...

558
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,810
I did it.

559
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
That one time.

560
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,900
10 years ago.

561
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,400
What did your lawyers say?

562
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
Except with the mandatory minimums with drug crimes...

563
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,550
He wouldn't recommend risking a trial so I pleaded out.

564
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,100
And here you are.

565
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,700
Here I am.

566
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,850
Costing the tax payers money... and...

567
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,800
Sweating in my armchair.

568
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,470
Y'know. I've been here for 22 years and I still can't figure out how the system works.

569
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,300
I've got a crack dealer who's doing 9 months...

570
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,370
And then I have a lady who accidentally backed into a mailman...

571
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,780
Who's doing 4 years.

572
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,350
I mean the guy broke his collarbone. But come one.

573
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,610
I just don't get it.

574
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,620
[gulps]

575
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,020
Are you gonna barf?

576
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,230
Tell me if you're gonna barf because there's a can behind you.

577
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,720
I won't barf.

578
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,100
I will be truly displeased if you barf anywhere but in that can.

579
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,220
Not gonna barf.

580
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,600
Ms Chapman.

581
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,180
No one's gonna mess with you here...

582
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,780
Unless you let them.

583
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,130
This isn't Oz...

584
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,770
Women fight with gossip and rumors.

585
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,630
They might peg you for rich... and...

586
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,630
Try to hit you up for a commissary.

587
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,300
And there are lesbians.

588
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,930
They're not gonna bother you...

589
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,930
They'll try to be your friend...

590
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,430
Just stay away from them.

591
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,000
I want you to understand...

592
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,840
You do not...

593
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,040
Have to have...

594
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Lesbian sex.

595
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,000
I have a fiancée.

596
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,440
Oh.

597
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,010
His name is Larry. He's a writer.

598
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,450
Can he come visit me?

599
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,510
-Is he in here?
-Yes, everybody's in there.

600
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,370
All the people in the PSI are cleared to visit.

601
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,610
He can come this weekend.

602
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,780
I'll make sure the list is in the visiting room.

603
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,960
Thank you so much, Mr. Healy.

604
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,710
You just keep to yourself.

605
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,490
And you'll be fine.

606
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,490
And don't make friends.

607
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,780
And remember...

608
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,070
Nothing... goes on here...

609
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,900
That I don't know about.

610
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,390
You know everything about me.

611
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,390
I d... I tell you everything!

612
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,150
What the webcam horror, the penis shaving incident. How do I not know this?

613
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,440
What was I supposed to say? It was...

614
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,790
It was a phase.

615
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,140
It was my... lost soul...

616
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,260
Post college, adventure phase.

617
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,460
I...

618
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,270
I was so embarrassed. I can't...

619
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,560
I can't believe that she did this.

620
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,450
I can't believe you did this.

621
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,970
I mean who are you? I-I...

622
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,660
Feel like I'm in a-a Borne movie. Have you killed?

623
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,660
[sobs]

624
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,150
Jesus. I don't know.

625
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,040
Baby. Stop, stop, stop.

626
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,530
Come on. Come here.

627
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,190
[shushes]

628
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,340
Okay.

629
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,110
You should break up with me.

630
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,000
-What?
-You didn't sign up for this.

631
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,170
Okay. Stop it, stop it. Come on...

632
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,530
Shh... It's okay.

633
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,680
Okay?

634
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,170
Witness states Piper Chapman carried drug money.

635
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,410
Piper Chapman was part of the ring.

636
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,610
Were you?

637
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,590
I was 22!

638
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,170
I thought that I was in love.

639
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,920
I was in love.

640
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,120
And it...

641
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,700
Was all crazy. And then it got...

642
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,730
Scary.

643
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,450
And I ran away...

644
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,290
And I became the nice blond lady that I was supposed to be.

645
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,770
I knew...

646
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,520
That she wasn't a good person. But...

647
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,900
Fuck her.

648
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,880
Fuck her.

649
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,000
This is not gonna be okay.

650
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,970
-No.
-No.

651
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,040
-It's not.
-Mm-mm.

652
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,560
But we'll deal with it.

653
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,220
Okay?

654
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,780
We'll figure it out.

655
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,750
Have you called a lawyer?

656
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,330
[inhales]
I'll call my dad.

657
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,020
No, no. Please don't call your dad. He already hates me.

658
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,630
Yeah. Well...

659
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,120
I love you.

660
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,430
And...

661
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,980
And he loves me.

662
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,240
So...

663
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,700
Here we go.

664
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,820
Alright we gotta hustle 'cause the count's soon.

665
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,340
Uh, room up there... Dorms are down there.

666
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,120
Now you are not allowed down there.

667
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,440
It's out of bounds for you guys until you got son there. You understand?

668
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,010
Ah! Namaste, Jones!

669
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,160
Namaste.

670
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,620
She teaches yoga, if you ever want. And she's good.

671
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,160
She's very spiritual.

672
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
Alright we got some offices here...

673
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,210
This is the... dining hall... common room... counselor's office...

674
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,810
Who-who you got for a counselor? 

675
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,070
Um, Healy.

676
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,680
Okay, yeah.

677
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,540
What?

678
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,740
Oh... it's fine. It's fine. He does his paperwork. That's the good thing.

679
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,610
When do we get outfits like everybody?

680
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,980
I dunno... maybe...

681
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,960
Tomorrow... after breakfast... you go down and you speak to a lady...

682
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,130
[slap]
[gasps]

683
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,200
What the fuck?

684
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,200
Friend of yours?

685
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,920
No.

686
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
It's... It's my mom.

687
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,500
Alright. Chapman, Diaz...

688
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,880
This is you.

689
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Uh, De Marco, this is Chapman.

690
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,170
She's new. So surround her you show her what's what?

691
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,140
Sure.

692
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,980
Okay, Mendoza this is Diaz, hm? Go, go. She'll help you.

693
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,500
Be with you in a sec. Just gotta finish here.

694
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Um... uh, I don't speak Spanish.

695
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,140
Great, another fucking coconut.

696
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,260
What's the matter with your mother, she don't teach you Spanish.

697
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,640
Here you go.

698
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,300
Here's some tissues.

699
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
It's always nice to always have.

700
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,820
And... a toothbrush.

701
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
They don't give you one.

702
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,690
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for everything.

703
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,240
Aw. No, no, it's no problem.

704
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,780
We look out for our own.

705
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,900
Our own?

706
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh don't get all pissy on me. It's tribal.

707
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,080
Not racist. I'll see you around.

708
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,580
[fading footsteps]

709
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,160
Come your name again?

710
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,250
Piper.

711
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,250
Chapman.

712
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,250
That's Ms. Rossa.

713
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,430
And that's Nichols.

714
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,610
Just got out of SHU, a week ago.

715
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,070
Told the CO, to kiss her ass.

716
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,330
Dumb.

717
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,160
Why make trouble for yourself, y'know?

718
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,050
SHU... that's solitary?

719
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,050
Yep. And you don't want it honey.

720
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,200
Trust me.

721
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,920
Here's some toilet paper.

722
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,240
Gotta take it with you.

723
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,010
Thanks.

724
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,190
What's that thing?

725
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Oh. That's my machine.

726
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,310
I need it at night.

727
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,890
When I first got here, I had a massive heart attack.

728
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,580
You know 'bout the count?

729
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,190
Wait, can you go back to the heart attack?

730
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,450
I don't like to dwell.

731
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,510
How do I make a phone call?

732
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,880
You need a pack number.

733
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,230
Fill out a form, over the morrow.

734
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,210
But maybe Caputo will let you make a call later.

735
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,960
It helps, if you cry.
