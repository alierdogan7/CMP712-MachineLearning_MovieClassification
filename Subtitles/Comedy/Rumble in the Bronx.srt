1
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,679
Aalst, Belgium - end 19th century

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,875
Pick up those bobbins!
Put that basket away!

3
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,940
Watch out!

4
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,754
What's this?

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,990
Go on, pick it up.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,672
Pick that up!

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,836
Work, or I don't need you.
Get out, son of a bitch!

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,031
And you, 20 centimes fine!
I didn't do anything!

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,033
20 cents or out too.

10
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,871
Professor Daens,

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,632
is it true that you want to leave
the college of Dendermonde?

12
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,358
I've had nine beautiful years,
Monseigneur. That's enough.

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,911
You've had nine years of troubles
with everybody.

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,595
Them with me, maybe.
I won't deny that.

15
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,752
Anyhow,
now I want to go to Aalst.

16
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,511
I have a spot as a junior priest
in Drongen.

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,398
You're expected there tomorrow.

18
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,634
You know very well that I've had
real problems in Drongen.

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,717
and indeed, with everybody.
- I remember, because you still have.

20
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,152
I don't think I'm welcome there.

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,074
You can hold your own.
And you're a difficult man.

22
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,189
Shouldn't you consider in peace
what you actually want?

23
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,834
You're not happy anywhere!

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,238
You're right, Monseigneur. That's
why I'm leaving for Aalst tomorrow.

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
If you really need me,
you can find me there.

26
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Please, Lord,
free us from Daens.

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,554
In the name of the father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen!

28
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,395
May St. Ursula protect our factory
in these troubled times.

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,597
Hail Mary, Mother of God.
Lord be with you,

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,355
blessed above all women
and blessed is your Son Jesus.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,640
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, now and forever. Amen.

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,390
Go away, there! Get out!

33
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
There, there are more!

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,640
There's Nini!

35
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,677
Those coals are ours. Get out!

36
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
You don't need coals.

37
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Aalst!.... Two-minute stop!

38
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Two-minute stop.

39
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,638
And? Where are these socialists?

40
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,908
All this panic for nothing!

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,476
Well, well! Father Daens!

42
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,918
Adolf...What a surprise!
- Am I not welcome?

43
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,311
Or is Aalst yours only now?
- No, no.

44
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,473
But the bishop did not inform us

45
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,428
Where do I send this, Father?
-to my brother's, printer Daens.

46
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,877
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!

47
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,350
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!

48
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,678
Please sirs, for you it's free!

49
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,594
Don't hit me!

50
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,592
According to Belgian law, I can...
-I'm the law here

51
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,752
you can nothing. Back to Ghent!

52
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,633
Guys, dirty Lisette has potatoes.

53
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,912
Lisette!

54
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,392
Gee, what a potato.
-My potatoes!

55
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,876
There's another fat one.

56
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,551
Thieves!
Let's go, fellows. Run!

57
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,153
My potatoes, thieves!
Bunch of bastards!

58
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,919
What are you doing?
This is no cemetery or dunghill.

59
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,278
Why are you bringing this here?
-Throw them away at your place.

60
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,637
Throw it away!
I'm fed up with the child.

61
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,756
Look there!

62
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,835
Father, do you agree with him?
Dumping his corpses here.

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,753
What can I do with it?

64
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,237
It's not up to me to bury her.

65
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,591
Besides, I need my cart.
I've got work to do.

66
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,473
What happened?
-Frozen to death, Father. Feel it.

67
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,192
It's the same every day.

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,920
Farmers find them and bring them
here instead of burying them.

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,196
Does anybody know her?
Everyone knows her, Father.

70
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,989
Nini, with the wet cherry.

71
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,869
So, potato-thief, maybe you also
know where her parents are?

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,715
Yes, over there somewhere.
Around the corner, under the bar.

73
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,640
Whose arse is this.

74
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
Whose arse is that.

75
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
Whose arse may this well be.

76
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,640
But man, this is the coal bag.

77
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,640
That coal bag belongs to me...

78
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,470
Fellows, they've released a crow!

79
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,955
Cover your bum, your man is here!

80
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,238
Gust! That's a priest!

81
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,150
Doesn't have to look for favours
around here. Do you Father,

82
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,878
or are you looking for the devil?

83
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,757
I'm looking for Nini's parents.
-Hot Nini, with the wet cherry?

84
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,674
Gust!
Over there, Father.

85
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,549
Listen, if you're here
to lecture us, don't bother!

86
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,712
And certainly not about that whore.

87
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,998
It's everyone for himself here
And our poor-box is empty.

88
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
But...
do you know what happened to her?

89
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,189
Did you see her?
-She's banged up.

90
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,033
We know. And leave my man alone.
None of your business!

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,590
Indeed.
- This is the one.

92
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,230
Red swine, I didn't do anything.

93
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,914
You haven't either, did you, Jef?

94
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,709
She liked it.
She came to ask for it herself.

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,434
Here.

96
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,955
Don't let them bury her like a dog.

97
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,674
Buy her a coffin.

98
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,149
Hey, more thieves!
-Uncle Adolf!

99
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,075
Are those boxes for us?
-Of course! Choose, you skunks!

100
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,870
Adolf...
gee! It's been a long time!

101
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,077
Can I move in here?
-Run off again?

102
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,073
I hate priests,
the college makes me sick.

103
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,437
I could teach you in private
and finally pay you back.

104
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,639
Don't be silly. you're welcome!
Peter will be glad!

105
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,509
I hear you're still kind to your readers.
-Adolf!

106
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,476
What a surprise!

107
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,632
Travelling through?
-No, I'm staying!

108
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,190
Does your bishop allow this?

109
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,396
Here, competition.

110
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,790
You trust yourself on the streets
with such a newspaper?

111
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,511
Where did you get it?

112
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,513
A socialist's gift at the station.

113
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,037
Any room for me on the front page?
- If you want...

114
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,870
ENOUGH DEAD CHILDREN IN AALST

115
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,398
Did you read this, Borremans?

116
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,156
A catholic paper against our ideas
agitating the workers against us.

117
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,394
You must talk about it to Woeste.
-You do it. There he is.

118
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,670
Have you read it Mr. Chairman?
-I'm aware, my friends.

119
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,317
I will bring reason to
that little printer.

120
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,234
It's going too far.
Aalst is getting more dangerous by the day.

121
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,996
They insult and loot us
and threaten our women.

122
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,958
They terrorise the country
and this newspaper.

123
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,350
Don't exaggerate, Druwé.
-Do I?

124
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,398
Let's not waste our time.

125
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,189
That paper I can handle.

126
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,510
These workers shouldn't bite the
hands that feed them.

127
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,477
The church should take care of that.

128
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,156
As an employer you take care of
their of salvation too.

129
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,709
You don't know these workers.

130
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,635
They have the same worries
as us directors.

131
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,192
How many factories will
survive the crisis in Aalst?

132
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,876
If the government won't subsidize
me, I will close down.

133
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,511
There will be no subvention.
-But you promised...

134
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,037
My colleagues in the government
don't want state intervention.

135
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,953
The recommend the English method.

136
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,954
Limit production costs to
enable competition.

137
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,476
Lower the wages?
That's impossible.

138
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,509
It's not, I pay them 1.60 franc
for 14 hours work.

139
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,114
Cumont pays 2 franc for 11 hours.

140
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,238
And he's still complaining,
he's going to go down.

141
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,396
If we all draw the line, they
even will accept 1.40 franc.

142
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,631
While a loaf of bread costs 60 centimes
and a bag of coal 1,50?

143
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,950
Pay them with potatoes.

144
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,032
Why not?
The money goes to booze anyway.

145
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,792
They won't survive...

146
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,151
They also won't survive
if the factories closes

147
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,032
Poverty is not the problem.
-I agree with that.

148
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,354
But to me it's dangerous
to lower the wages now.

149
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,750
People are already upset.

150
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,836
We could implement the Scottish system.
Three workers to four machines.

151
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,915
And if we only let the women work
we safe half.

152
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,550
You can't mean that?

153
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,629
It's an interesting idea.
-The Scots still do it as well.

154
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,477
Three female worker to four machines.
12, 13 or 14 hours per night?

155
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,399
Are there not enough accidents
already?

156
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,236
How many fatal accidents have you got?
And you, Antoine? And you lot?

157
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,793
Safe us your demagogy.
In every war there will be casualties.

158
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,673
You are monsters. The lot of you.

159
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,756
We liberals stand up for our workers
who live in total poverty.

160
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,438
No aid from you and Aalst loses
its industry and you your constituents.

161
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,197
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Woeste and you gentlemen...

162
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,954
...but now it's time
to relax.

163
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,319
What a charming thought.
-Don't hide, Junior.

164
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,755
Say hello to Mr. Woeste.

165
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,715
Hello, Junior.

166
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,072
Work hard and you be as big and
important as your dad.

167
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,757
Who is teaching you?

168
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,516
We are looking, They have recommend
Father Daens to us.

169
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,193
The brother of that printer.
Let's hope he thinks differently.

170
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,439
It doesn't say a-e, but e, consul-e

171
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,636
The root always stays the same.

172
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,112
Carry on.

173
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,834
Again, carry on.
-Latin bores me, Father.

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,199
Don't recite it like a parrot,
without knowing what you say.

175
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,590
What is written there?
-Consul.

176
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,433
Do you know what that is
-No.

177
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,592
Only women and children. Go away.

178
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,795
Let those children pass.

179
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,552
Out, Scholliers, no work for you.
-Because you say so?

180
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,032
Too old. Try to work in Germany
Let my dad in.

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,952
What's your name?
-Nette.

182
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,078
Take his place at the spinner.
-I work in the laundry

183
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,151
Shut up!

184
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,473
Here.
Don't work on bare feet.

185
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,349
No work, Andre!
Scottish system, you're off.

186
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,512
I'm going to work.
Or do your machines work alone?

187
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,875
You cost too much.
-Too much?

188
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,669
Must we pay to work here now,
according to your Scottish system?

189
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,631
I don't speak Flemish,
but I know what you write.

190
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,395
I received countless letters.
I cite :-

191
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,039
Daily children die
at the gates of the factories.

192
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,874
If I didn't know better...

193
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,119
...I would think this is written
by a socialist.

194
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,910
But it's true.
Too many children die.

195
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,835
You only stir up commotion.
Don't forget your catholic subscribers.

196
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,230
As leader of the Catholic Party...

197
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,359
...I won't let you smear the
pillars of our society.

198
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,397
I assure you...

199
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,917
May I introduce my brother Adolf to you?

200
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,431
This is our chairman.
-Pleasure.

201
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,996
You've arrived at the right moment.

202
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,870
I just warned your brother
about the context of his article.

203
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,676
As a priest why don't you try
to reason him.

204
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,231
That would be difficult.
-And why so?

205
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,872
Because I wrote the article
myself.

206
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,113
Decent of you to protect him....

207
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,511
But your cassock makes me
disbelieve you

208
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,391
I hope your conceptions
do right to your costume.

209
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,235
That goes without saying.

210
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,269
But some of your ideas don't
match your clothing.

211
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,834
If you want to keep your soutane,
don't start again.

212
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,875
You're crazy!
Talking to him like that....

213
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,795
What'll we do now?
-We? You just carry on....

214
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,393
...with another article.

215
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,677
Come. Take these two to the six and
from now on take the five as well.

216
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,879
Sort it out among you.

217
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,556
You lot, get to your machines!

218
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,036
To your machines!

219
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,071
Hang your coat there.

220
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,552
Watch out.
Wait till the machine is stationery.

221
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,191
Tie up your hair.
It's dangerous like that.

222
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,638
Keep your hands off me.
-Don't be afraid

223
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,269
I'm not as bad as they say
-Leave me alone

224
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,751
If he touches you once more,
I'll beat him up.

225
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,357
I'll smash his face.
I'll beat Borremans as well.

226
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,279
You don't believe me, do you?
You'll see...

227
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,480
Show Ponnet in!

228
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,552
Monseigneur
-Is what Daens writes true? Or not?

229
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,471
Depends on the point of view
the facts are considered from.

230
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,277
I'm a priest, a shepherd.
-That's not what I asked.

231
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,993
Nobody can deny that poverty
reigns in Aalst, Monseigneur,

232
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,358
just like in many other cities,
but we do our best to help.

233
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,270
Did....Daens ever show you
his sermons?

234
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,271
No. I'm not good enough!

235
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,159
Sometimes he doesn't even
bother to speak to me.

236
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,428
I try to behave like a Christian,

237
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,515
but my feelings do not
really matter here.

238
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,069
You can have it for a week.

239
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,710
You can kiss it at your leisure.

240
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,875
Wear your helmet, because
a bad blow is easily given.

241
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,438
So, Catalina comes in
and you speak to him directly

242
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,199
an remember :

243
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,716
you only have one hour
to save your life.

244
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,117
Borremans, come out,
I'll hit you!

245
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,029
Come out, if you dare!
-Get him, Titus!

246
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,198
Don't!

247
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,929
Stop that dog! - Titus!
Titus!.....Heel!

248
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,511
Leave me alone.
-I want to help you.

249
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,875
Priests are for the rich.

250
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,428
Father, what is going on?

251
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,478
Father, come...your wounds
need treating.

252
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,639
No need to clean up St. Ursula.

253
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,075
No celebration for her this year.

254
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,391
And neither for us. No mass.
No party.

255
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,757
Leave them alone, dad.
Come on, go home, dad.

256
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,953
But father, you are hurt!

257
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,389
You scare people
-Guess so.

258
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,790
But this needs to be tended to.

259
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,919
What's your name?
-Nette, Nette Scholliers.

260
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,071
Come.

261
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,311
We have nothing as it is.
-Mama , this is father...

262
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,879
...Daens.

263
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,192
Good morning, Madame, Monsieur.
Sorry to bother.

264
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,952
I bumped into something.

265
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,829
Sit down, Father. Nette...
Take a clean towel.

266
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,434
Welcome, Father.

267
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,108
Kids, look here!

268
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,034
A real priest in the house.

269
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,279
Frans! Forgive him, Father.
He was fired at the factory.

270
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,518
Louis...Wannes
-No need to wake them.

271
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,234
If they don't seen you
they won't believe you were here.

272
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,037
Come on, Wannes, open your eyes!
Open your eyes Louis!

273
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,118
Doesn't matter. They have to go
to work anyway. On the night-shift.

274
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,432
They never go to school?

275
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,149
The two youngest do, sometimes.
The others work

276
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,959
-Good workers.
All of them. And our Louis....

277
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,989
Louis....
He's a porter at the town hall.

278
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,835
Close your eyes, Father.

279
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,912
Louis, get up, the priest is here.

280
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,072
Let him, he's drunk.

281
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,233
Nette! - Louis is a Buck.
At night the beat up the reds.

282
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,789
Shut up. The Bucks are bastards.

283
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,589
What is going on here?
Someone needs a beating?

284
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,630
If you want to, do like the priest
and beat up your friend Schmitt.

285
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,679
He can't keep his claws to himself.
- Nette, don't discuss this now.

286
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,353
But ma! -Schmitt is boss.
That doesn't mean he can touch me!

287
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,919
No more of this.

288
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,958
Schmitt is not the only one, eh?
-Louis!

289
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,588
-Say that again if you dare.

290
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,076
Let's pray first.
In the name of the Father and the

291
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,157
In the name of the Father and the
son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

292
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,796
Lord bless us and this meal.

293
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,909
In the name of the Father and the
son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

294
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,274
A potato, Father?

295
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,238
Or a cup of coffee?
-Thanks - They're Polders.

296
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,228
Nora is a good cook. Enjoy yourself.

297
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,991
Now that you're here, Father,
may I ask you something?

298
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,677
What would you do?

299
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,311
For 30 years you work for a director
through thick and thin.

300
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,070
Shut up!

301
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,075
All these years, you walk in his beautiful procession,
his procession for St. Ursula.

302
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,430
And then, suddenly, he says:
"Get out!"

303
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,277
What would you do, Father?

304
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,194
You'd still go to his procession?

305
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,476
Not me!

306
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,598
No, Father, not me.

307
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,429
Provided his sermon is decent
and deals with higher ideas,

308
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,230
nothing actually opposes a priest
to share with a large audience.

309
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,234
But Father Daens' sermon
is of shocking triviality.

310
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,598
and I regret to say, is revealing
a shameful demagogy.

311
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,116
Quite right, Mr Woeste,
quite right.

312
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,518
But after all, this subject is only
inspired on Rerum Novarum

313
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,712
...and on paternal preoccupations of his holiness
Leon XIII, for the condition of the workers.

314
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,874
This encyclical doesn't mention the stirring of
the workers against those who feed them!

315
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,316
Now, Daens has created such suspicion

316
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,634
that the government considers to
send an investigation committee to Aalst.

317
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,877
What a triumph for our enemies!
-On the contrary, Mr Woeste.

318
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,318
If, as you say,
we are talking about slander

319
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,155
an inquest will prove
that Father Daens is wrong.

320
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,677
A word from you would suffice,
to reduce him to silence.

321
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,510
Father Daens is careless,
Mr Woeste,

322
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,108
But...he has a brilliant mind,

323
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,558
and in that case, I'm not sure
that a remonstration is enough.

324
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,033
Monseigneur, you have other means than a
mere remonstration to ensure his obedience.

325
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,633
When a priest uses his cloth to spread
hostilities, it can be taken away.

326
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,990
Mr Woeste, I'm afraid that only the ecclesiastic
authorities are capable to judge this.

327
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,474
Of course, Monseigneur.

328
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,236
But you must understand me.
I came in everybody's interest,.

329
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,518
to avoid this matter from going
beyond this diocese

330
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,470
and leading us to appeal
to higher instances.

331
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,759
An energetic cure at the right moment
can prevent complications.

332
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,358
Don't you agree?

333
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,195
I understand you perfectly
my son.

334
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,398
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!

335
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,711
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!

336
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Read "The Worker"!
Read Father Daens' new article.

337
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,351
Read "The Worker"!
The paper of good Catholics!

338
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,910
Read "Forwards!"
The real paper for the worker!

339
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,670
Large demonstration in Ghent
for general voting rights!

340
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,436
Read "Forwards!"
the socialist newspaper.

341
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,270
You there. Yes you miss!

342
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,911
He wants you.

343
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,432
You must buy this.
I wrote something for you.

344
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,717
I will read it to you.....
....in your ear.

345
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,110
Leave it. It's a fool from Ghent.

346
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,352
You, Reds, can't read.

347
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,230
Your paper smells of hell.
Give me a clean catholic paper.

348
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,873
Hey, Fonske! - Read "Forwards"!
The real newspaper for the workers!

349
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,599
Here. Read this to me,
I can't read.

350
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,152
Me neither...

351
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,395
Read "The Worker"! - You there, big mouth.
What is written here? Can you tell?

352
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,509
I can't read this catholic jargon.
-I told you he couldn't read.

353
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,877
Give that paper to me.

354
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,035
Ladies,
great news.

355
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,234
"Thanks to Doctor Dupont
and his magical salts,

356
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,309
constipation is a thing
of the past!"

357
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,797
That's not what it says. - No?.
-Who can read? You or me?

358
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,997
Then read us Daens' article!
-Here is your article:

359
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,152
Common sense has prevailed.

360
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,235
The government has
decided that a committee

361
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,678
of 6 honourable personalities

362
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,358
will investigate
the factories of Aalst.

363
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,356
They will be able to interrogate
the workers directly....

364
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,592
Surely, you don't believe, what the
priest says, that they'll listen.

365
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,752
They're all the director's friends.

366
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,876
If you want respect from them,

367
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,079
you must change the government
Hence, the parliament first.

368
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,314
But since we don't have a say in parliament,
we need voting rights first!

369
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,233
Who are you to criticize Daens?

370
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,789
There is no one like him in Ghent.

371
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,758
Your priest says the same as we do.
But we did it first.

372
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,070
So loud that we didn't hear it!

373
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,239
Besides, Daens is in our paper and
not in yours, you red cabbage!

374
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,437
This committee only comes to eat.

375
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,354
No potatoes, but fat steaks.
- What?

376
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,479
That Daens is a saint.
He will change the factories.

377
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,955
Priests are sly and change nothing.

378
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,237
You don't know what a committee is.

379
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,756
We, socialists,
demanded 2 francs for 12 hours.

380
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,879
So what?
Daens asked 12 francs for 2 hours.

381
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,237
You wise ass!

382
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,313
The riddle has been solved
by a great catholic

383
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,314
Put all your children to work.
They'll never get ill.

384
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,031
Here my friend, sell mine too.
You'll be more successful.

385
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,518
So no more schools to raise.
Children. Weavers.....

386
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,518
Sold out already?

387
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,750
Do I get anything?
-For what you want from Nette,

388
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,639
you'll have to do more than read.

389
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,271
Buy us a drink and we'll forget
you are a socialist.

390
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,953
The Bucks!

391
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,916
And our Louis!

392
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,549
There! Let's get him, fellows.

393
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
Red dog, damn it!
-Shit ass!

394
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,954
Brussels? This is Aalst.

395
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,509
May I speak to Mr Woeste?

396
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,277
Doesn't work?

397
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,068
Eugene, I've never interfered,

398
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,232
but this concerns my family.
Please, I beg you..

399
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,995
For Junior's sake.

400
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,589
to reconsider the whole thing.

401
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,435
Mr Daens has always been welcome,

402
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,515
but he has gone too far! Christ, he demands
that my factory be investigated.

403
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,319
You must separate matters.

404
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,189
Tell Daens!
-No, I'm telling you.

405
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,796
This is about our son.
-My son will not be educated by a socialist!

406
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,396
Not a word about it!

407
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,237
Shut your mouths!

408
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,156
Take off those rags!

409
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,279
Off!
-They're all I have.

410
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,590
Then go home!

411
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,753
And no stupidities, you hear?
You know what to say!

412
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,035
And us?
-You can't all speak!

413
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,476
These are serious people from
parliament. At your machines!

414
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,551
At your machines!

415
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,548
Marie, ask Julia to
swap places with me.

416
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,157
Julia...Do you want to swap
with Nette?

417
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,352
Schmitt..... An excellent foreman,
knows the factory very well.

418
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,909
Ask him any question you like.

419
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,075
Aren't these machines dangerous?

420
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,553
No, sir. The director has had
new modern machines installed.

421
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,678
It's only dangerous when you drink.

422
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,032
I feel that I am going to find
me a spot here!

423
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,671
Do you like to work at night?
-What about your husband? Any kids?

424
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,798
She only speaks Flemish.
-What does she say??

425
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,394
She's happy.
She says she's very happy here.

426
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,190
She wants to work nights,
so she stays with her kid in the day.

427
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,679
Excuse me. Any toilets here?

428
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,593
I'd like to go to the bathroom.
-No, no, it's ladies only.

429
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,231
What about the men? -This way.
Is it far? - No, at the director's.

430
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,470
Do you speak Flemish?
The locked the children in there!

431
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,715
What is it, my child?

432
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,833
They're lying!

433
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,919
Go on! Tell him!

434
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,190
We're treated like animals.

435
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,271
We...

436
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,709
Every day there are accidents
because we are too tired.

437
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,918
What is she saying?

438
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,196
We're running late, sir.

439
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,397
Problems Schmitt?
-No, sir.

440
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,875
Scholliers !

441
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,550
Satisfied?

442
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,235
Two francs fine.

443
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,798
Stupid cows.
Why didn't you say something?

444
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,272
It was our only chance.
-We tried, but they didn't understand.

445
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,838
You were wiggling with your hips.
We should have pulled together.

446
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,876
There won't be another committee..

447
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,512
We will die like rats!

448
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,756
Come on, Milleke, get on!

449
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,873
This isn't your bed, come on.

450
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,198
Get to work!

451
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,877
At your machines!
Faster, come on!

452
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,271
Milleke!

453
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,155
Damn it, watch where you going.

454
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,995
Mother, is dad coming home tonight?
-Yes, honey, he'll be right there,

455
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,392
but be quiet now...

456
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,269
I'm so hungry, mother.
-I know, son,

457
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,477
but... Listen!
-Josee!

458
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,229
There's daddy..

459
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,269
Josee....Where's my dinner?
-You smell of booze again!

460
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,991
Drink is our downfall!
-Give me food, I tell you,

461
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,719
or I'll go back to the pub!
-A piece of bread is all

462
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,351
there is left in the house.
It's for Fonske.

463
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,434
Give it here!
And speaking about Fonske...

464
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,876
I'll go and ask the factory
When he can start!

465
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,917
No !

466
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,672
He's old enough!

467
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,756
But Jules! He is only six!
-I was only five!

468
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,520
Go away, all of you !

469
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,950
He is dead!

470
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,595
Clarisse, Julia, take him away.
I will get water.

471
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,075
Nette, don't - Get off!
-Come on, Nette..

472
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,513
This is understandable not only
in Flemish.

473
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,750
Everybody, to your machines!

474
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,434
Wait a minute
-Let me through.

475
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,031
Josee.

476
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,470
We are rich!

477
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,275
Jules, did the director give you a raise?

478
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,398
Yeah, as from today, I am working
one floor higher up!

479
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,552
But you're home so early!
Yes, I really hurried.

480
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,115
By the way.., where is our Fonske?

481
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,317
He's gone to rehearse at the choir.

482
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,755
Good. I like that.

483
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,916
"Even without knowing the result,

484
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,629
the coming of the committee
is an important step forward".

485
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,112
"The Committee"? The Committee!

486
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,636
Pieter, Father!
Borremans is closed.

487
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,439
Something must have happened.

488
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,391
Gendarmes!

489
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,116
Draw your sabres!

490
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,717
Officer!

491
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,111
What do you want?

492
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,313
We want to see the committee.

493
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,949
Gentlemen, please come these way.

494
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,832
You can come along if you like .

495
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,715
They have a dead child, commander.
-Take it from them. - But....

496
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,513
Execution!
-Yes, commander.

497
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,836
Charge!
- Oh, no!

498
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,189
Where is Milleke?

499
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,915
It's coming from Mijlenbeeck!

500
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,235
Hey, no! Stop!

501
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,799
Look what you've done.

502
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,828
Fool! Look what you've done..

503
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,160
Get out of here.

504
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,431
Get lost! Get out!

505
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,391
I suggested to Stillemans that you
give a sermon on Rerum Novarum,

506
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,790
but he insisted that I do it.

507
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,277
Have you read my sermon?
-Yes.

508
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,076
What do you think?
-Very bad.

509
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,550
The gospel we just heard is telling

510
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,590
us about the multiplication
of the bread and fish.

511
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,040
Lots of them hundreds,
thousands of them, women and children,

512
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,228
rich and poor, had followed Christ
and had been listening to Him.

513
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,073
When the evening came, the apostles

514
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,509
asked him to send the crowd home,
or to the surrounded villages

515
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,759
to find food and shelter. And he said
"Why don't you feed them?"

516
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,039
They told him there was barely,
enough for themselves,

517
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,953
5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes

518
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,553
He looked reproachfully at them,

519
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,439
asked the people to sit,
looked towards heaven,

520
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:30,628
blessed the loaves of
bread and the fish

521
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,635
and had his disciples share them

522
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,396
There were 5,000 people.
They all ate.

523
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,997
They all had their fill.

524
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,396
Dearly beloved,

525
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,551
if Christ teaches us
that it is our duty

526
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,669
to share without prejudice
of rank or class,

527
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,790
if he gives away the little food he
has to perfect strangers,

528
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,271
then why shouldn't this be the duty
of the Belgian bourgeois class

529
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,355
toward the poor, who they know?
Who work for them!

530
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,998
Or do these people, who claim to be
faithful servants of the pope,

531
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,113
think that the gospel
is not meant for French ears,

532
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:34,118
because it is written in Latin? People scream:
"We're hungry"! Loud and clear.

533
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,913
And these words should not
be thrown to the wind.

534
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,678
It is time the voices of the
poor were heard in this country.

535
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,118
Besides, my dear friends, how come,

536
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,598
the voice of the rich is always
much louder than a poor man's?

537
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,154
Why is a poor man's vote
worth less than a rich man's?

538
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,237
Who has a right to say: ''you
are good and you are bad,''

539
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,597
''you can vote,
and you cannot.'?"

540
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,192
Unbelievable!
He preaches universal suffrage!

541
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:21,949
Gentlemen, directors. What does the pope,
whom you like to quote so much,

542
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,910
what does he say,
in his encyclical Rerum Novarum?

543
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,711
"We are convinced
that we should improve

544
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,314
the fate of the lower class
because a large part of them

545
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,315
live in undeserved misery."

546
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,350
My dear friends, it is clear that

547
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,640
our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII, and Christ
are speaking the same language

548
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:09,716
and that an end should be put
to this organised, established injustice.

549
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,758
And remember, my friends:
you don't have anything.

550
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,198
It is not you who have to share,
but those,

551
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,876
who have just left this church.

552
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,029
How can you be so clumsy?

553
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,510
Thanks to your brutality,
Daens has all the trumps.

554
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,639
Be more clever with you workers.
Give them soup,

555
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,634
knit them scarves...
That will make us popular.

556
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,078
The pope wants more charity.
That's the right policy!

557
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,274
I'm not sure that's enough.
The situation is too serious.

558
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,151
They demand the universal suffrage.
-They'll never have it!

559
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,312
I'm sorry, but...
a lot of people think otherwise.

560
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,273
Half of the factories are striking

561
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,000
for the universal suffrage.
The agitation is such that,

562
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:23,030
it would be a miracle if Aalst
escapes this revolution.

563
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,358
Mr Woeste, the strikers find support
everywhere, even within our own party.

564
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,590
Father Daens runs a campaign
for the universal suffrage,

565
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,469
within our party.
-Throw him out.

566
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,950
Him, his brother and the others.
-No, that's not enough.

567
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,918
That would turn him into a martyr.

568
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:52,274
There's only one way to finish him
unfrock him!

569
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,476
In civil clothes
this priest will be a nobody.

570
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,796
I'll go all the way to the Vatican.

571
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,113
Not in that thing, you won't!
-Very funny...

572
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,633
We must be aware that many workers
will turn their back on the Church.

573
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,078
More so the reason not to hesitate
and to be firm to Daens.

574
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,598
I'd love to, but I won't be degraded
to Mr Woeste's errand boy.

575
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,117
Send Daens to the Congo.
They're short of missionaries.

576
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,999
Then Daens will choose for the

577
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,550
blacks and everyone will return.
I know Daens.

578
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,277
Hurry up Willem,
I have work to do.

579
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,433
Sorry Monseigneur, the only solution
here might be a prayer.

580
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,433
Arise, ye wretched of the earth.....

581
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,955
Monseigneur....
- This is the result of your reckless talk!

582
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,396
Father Daens!

583
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,712
You are a priest
to spread God's word,

584
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,872
not the socialists'.

585
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,756
If there is inequality on earth,
it is because God wants it.

586
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,915
I wouldn't say that.
You reason like Woeste..

587
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,837
He turns God into a Belgian
and bars everyone who doesn't

588
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,835
belong to his Belgian heaven.
- Quiet... Daens!

589
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,917
I haven't asked you here
to discuss politics.

590
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,075
Once more, you embarrass me
with your difficult character.

591
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,316
Instead of visiting pubs in your robe,

592
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,156
don't you think you should look at
yourself and try to find out

593
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,471
whether all this popularity

594
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,431
doesn't stem from the pursuit
of pure vanity?

595
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,077
You don't listen to anybody,

596
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,193
because you want them
to listen to you!

597
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,595
That is not the issue.

598
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,356
The seriousness of the situation
in Aalst escapes you.

599
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,240
You and I are facing hard times.

600
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,837
Flanders is lost if Aalst becomes red.

601
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:17,109
That's what catholic workers think.

602
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,516
You are stumbling over your own brains.

603
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,749
To give you a chance
to do penance for this,

604
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,278
you will temporarily celebrate
the mass in solitude.

605
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,834
I forbid you to preach
in Sint-Martinus church again!

606
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,720
Don't do that, Monseigneur!

607
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,073
I beg you....
- Kneel,

608
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,673
so that I can bless you.

609
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,990
More....
-No, or there'll be

610
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,875
nothing left for the little ones..
- Let them work, if they want to eat.

611
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,679
I'm on strike. - Lazy!
Ask Louis!

612
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,116
Louis is a rat.
-Don't speak about him like that.

613
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,876
You don't work either.
-Don't talk to father like that.

614
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,509
You shut up too, you're on strike!

615
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,956
Give it back, you can't do that!
It's for Jannes.

616
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,429
Give that potato back!

617
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,511
Enough!
- If that's how it is,

618
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,598
there's free soup at the factory

619
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,436
Sit down you.
We only eat what we work for.

620
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,515
That soup is for the poor.
-We are poor, Dad!.
