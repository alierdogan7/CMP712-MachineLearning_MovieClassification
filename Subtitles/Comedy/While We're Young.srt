CORNELIA: There were three little pigs
and they made a house out of twigs

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,129
and the wolf came...

4
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,006
He blows it down?

5
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,844
Yeah, but what happens in the middle?

6
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,082
I keep wanting to do
this little piggy went to market,

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,326
but that's with the toes.

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,170

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,768
And the, uh...
And the pigs keep making different houses.

- (BABY CRYING)
- And... No, no. No, no, no, no.

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,486
- What the fuck do we do?
- JOSH: I don't know.

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,168
Okay, who's ready to eat?

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,322
Oh, who's ready to eat?

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,766
Ah! I love how she stretches,
it's just like we do.

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,126
It's so funny.

17
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,160
It never occurred to me
that stretching is innate.

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,282
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,166
Okay, it got infected with staph,
but it's not the bad staph.

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
- What is it?
- FLETCHER: Guess.

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,203
You can come closer, it's not bad staph.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,770
I still don't want the baby touching it.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,330
I can't tell.

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,408
It's Willow's sonogram.

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,084
JOSH: Oh, yeah.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,561
I did it for Marina.
I was just so fucking proud of her.

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,086
Why it's for me, I still don't understand.

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,730

she didn't even get the epidural.

(GASPS) It's a mother fucker.

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,770
It's a ring of fucking fire,

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,691
but it was the most beautiful
experience of my life.

- (CORNELIA SIGHS)
- FLETCHER: I fell in love immediately.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,886
A love I've never felt.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
Don't take that the wrong way, Marina.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,489
- No, I know exactly what you mean. It's pure.
- Aw.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,330
- Oh, you guys should do it!
- Yeah.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,851
You would make such good parents.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,445
- I'm sorry. I know you...
- No, no, it's fine.

39

We, uh, you know, we...

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,650
MARINA: It's just such a game changer.

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,206
When I saw her, I thought, "I know you."

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,770
It's true, I recognized her immediately.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,046
FLETCHER: Because I'd read to her
in the womb,

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,481
she knew my voice immediately.
I read Stephen King's <i>The Tommyknockers.</i>

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,244
MARINA: It's like in one moment,
everything is different.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,322
FLETCHER: It's like all the stuff before...
MARINA: It's a gift.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,566
FLETCHER: Fine, you know,
we're figuring it out.

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,641
MARINA: I mean, we're just animals.

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,611
FLETCHER: But now, okay, real life.
You know?

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,887
I can't remember Goldilocks either anymore.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,883
The porridge part, but not what happens.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,327
JOSH: She gets eaten, right?
CORNELIA: Does she?

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,482
There's, like, an oven that's too hot.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,080
CORNELIA: You don't want kids, right?

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,925
Because I don't.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,606
I'm sorry, I feel so
guilty for saying that.

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,727
I mean, I did.

If we'd had the magic sexy version

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,562
and one day suddenly had a baby.

60

But all those drugs
and shots and miscarriages.

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,128
I don't want to do it again
and it not to work.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,362
I know. And I like our life as it is.

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,047
Yeah. I mean, if we wanted to take off
to Paris tomorrow, we could.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah, I mean,
I think we might have a hard time

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,651
finding an affordable fare
on such short notice, but yeah.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,240
No, I know, and I couldn't leave work.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,851
If we're going to do it, we should plan it
at least a month in advance.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,401
A month is still in the
realm of spontaneity.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
No, I know.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,285
I mean, the time we spent in Rome,
what was that?

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,646
2006.

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,165
- It wasn't 2006.
- Yeah, it was.

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,248
Because I was working
with my dad on his dance film.

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,322
Rome was eight years ago already?

75
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,365
- Shit.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,689
I looked at the pictures recently.

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,041
We were two younger people
standing at the Trevi Fountain.

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,721
- We look similar.
- We look younger.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,810
I tried to get you to go
to Mexico last summer.

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,770
I needed to finish my documentary.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,569
But you didn't finish it.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,960
Well, maybe the point
is we have the freedom.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,207
What we do with
it isn't that important.

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,523

had sex in nearly a year.

by the pregnancy.

What is that, a 75-watt?

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,881
I can't see, it's too bright.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,722
It's too high a wattage.

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,529

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,605
Those dogs were just there
and, uh, I said, "Hey, shoot those dogs."

172
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,807
And we did.

173
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,041
Beautiful.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,605
I've been working on this other one
for about eight years now,

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,047
but I think I'm zeroing in on it.

176
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,201
JAMIE: I'd love to see it.

177
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,441
You want to come get a bite with us?

178
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,081
Oh, I'm meeting my wife
around the corner at this Chinese place.

179
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
My wife and I are going
to the same goddamn place!

180
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,811
I've learned along the way
you can discover more

181
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,609
by not knowing all the answers,

182
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
by allowing yourself
to be surprised by what you encounter.

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,082
- Yeah, yeah.
- And sometimes that means waiting

184
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,242
years for something to happen.

185
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,527
How did you start out?
Like, who influenced you?

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,568
Oh. Well, I steal from everyone.

187
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,450
Wiseman, Maysles, Pennebaker.

188
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,251
My first job out of graduate school
was working for Leslie Breitbart.

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,050
Jeez Louise.

190
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,327
That's also, incidentally,
how I met Cornelia.

191
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,209
- He's her dad.
- What?

192
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,282
This is before they hated each other.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
We don't hate each other.

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,570
- Cornelia also produces her dad's films.
- JAMIE: He's amazing.

195
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,250
He's a giant.
He's a guy I'd love to meet.

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,209
Do you also produce Josh's films?

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,810
No, Josh likes to work alone.

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,848
Josh, what's your new film about?

199
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,604
Well, I'm trying to solve the problem

200
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,762
that Eisenstein never solved,

201
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,081
that is, how to make a film
that is both materialist

202
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,128
and intellectual at the same time.

203
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,040
Uh, it's about the distinctly
American relationship

204
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,009
between biography and history,

205
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,521
theory and method

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,922
and how that relates
to power and class in our country,

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
particularly the political,
military and economic elite.

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,121
- It's really about America.
- JAMIE: Eisenstein's astonishing.

209
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,804
- I just watched <i>Strike.</i>
- Oh.

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,690
I'm obsessed with Europe in the '20s, see.

211
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,840
The interwar period,
ex-patriots, that sort of thing.

212
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,480
I keep trying to get Jamie
to do something with before-and-afters.

213
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,249
All humans love before-and-afters.

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,371
Any TV show
with before-and-afters will succeed.

215
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,046
Before you said that. After you said that.

216
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,285
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

- (JAMIE CHUCKLES)

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,531
What do you do, Darby?

219
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,285
- Darby makes ice cream.
- Yeah, I make ice cream.

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,571
I brought some of it to
the Whole Foods near us. They're pumped.

221
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,880
It's Jamie's idea to sell it,

222
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,246
I just do it because I like it.

223
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,810
CORNELIA: And you guys are married?

224
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,962
That's so nice and old-fashioned.

225
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,321
Yeah. We said our vows
in an empty water tower in Harlem.

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,880
There was a mariachi
band and a Slip'N Slide.

227
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,081
- Wow!
- Oh!

228
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,491
It was beautiful.
Some rituals exist for a reason.

229
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,766
Jamie wanted a big wedding.

230
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,724
We did it at City Hall.

231
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,490
Isaac and Benny are walking the tracks.

232
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,164
Oh, have you done this?

233
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,447
We walked through
the subway tunnels of the D line last week.

234
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,760
- No, no, we haven't.
- DARBY: They're at a bar on Essex.

235
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,450
- Do you want to come?
- JOSH: Oh!

236
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,326
Do we?

- (JAMIE PLEADING)
- CORNELIA: Uh...

238
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,721
It's already past our bedtime.

239
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,606
Yeah, we're usually in bed by 11:00.

240
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,046
- Let me get it.
- Thanks.

241
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,527
Yeah, thanks.

242
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,849
No, yeah, I'll get it.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,401
If you've got any time,
and I know you're super busy,

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,209
I'd love to show you what I'm working on.

245
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,770
Come by our place this weekend.

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,285
I have my fall flavors.

247
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,010
They don't make this film anymore.

248
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,731
I bought 400 packs
before they discontinued it.

249
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,161
Let's go, worm!

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,083
Jamie is always moving.

251
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,529
I can't leap as fast as that kid.

252
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,971
I don't move as quickly.

253
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,605
You should see him on Rollerblades.

254
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,046
I like how engaged they are in everything.

255
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,647
They're all making things
and they're so excited for each other.

256
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,165
It's selfless.

257
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,770
And they're so respectful of us.

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,605
I mean, compared to
when we go out with Marina and Fletcher,

259
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,251
I feel like we're all just
talking about ourselves.

260
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,446
They asked questions.

261
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,170
They didn't ask me any questions.

262
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,571
When I was their age, I never would have

263
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,130
come up to me like that and invited me out.

264
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,725
I would have been too scared.

265
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,962
They're really not nervous.

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,931
I just wish
you hadn't told him I work with my dad.

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,047
Why?

268
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,521
I don't know, he seems ambitious.

269
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,648
No. I don't think he thinks that way.

270
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,051
It's about process.

271
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,929
How has he even seen anything of yours?

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,206
EBay.

273
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,691
I love his shoes.

274
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,603
I have some wing tips here somewhere.

275
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,520
I stopped wearing them
when I got shin splints.

276
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,041
It was almost like he was studying you.

277
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,441
Can we go to their place this weekend?

278
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,443
We never see our real friends.

279
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,603
Why do you suddenly want to hang out
with a couple of 25-year-olds?

280
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,841
We were just 25.

281
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,604
I mean, we weren't, but you know.

282
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,966

Now everybody say, choo-choo!

511
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,125
- Choo-choo.
- MAN: That's right.

512
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,441
- Choo-choo.
- Together. Choo-choo.

513

<i>All aboard
Here at the station</i>

514
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,091
<i>All aboard
We want to say hello</i>

515
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,044
<i>All aboard
Pick your destination</i>

516
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,687
<i>All aboard</i>

517
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,921
Holy shit!

518
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,047
<i>Come on, here we go</i>

519
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,646
Now everybody say choo-choo!

520
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,451
- Choo-choo!
- Say choo-choo!

521
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,522
CORNELIA: I mean, I love her,
she's a great mom,

522
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,568
but I always felt like if I had a baby,

523
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,722
the baby would just fold into my life.

524
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,646
I mean, if you spend all your time
at baby classes, you become a baby.

525
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,688
It's like the mothers are infantilized,
you know?

526
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,171
I know, just, like, have a baby.

527
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
You're cool, you know,
cool people who have a house

528
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,641
and, I don't know, just have a baby.

529
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,120
You're going to Mexican food
and there's a baby on the floor.

530
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,969
I know. That's how I grew up.

531
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,120
I want a baby.
Maybe I'll just have a baby right now.

532
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,288
You should. You can.

533
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,647
I like kids who don't speak English.

534
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,529
When are you going to have babies?

535
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,683
A couple of times I got pregnant,
but it didn't happen.

536
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,330
I'm sorry.

537
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,090
The longest only went eight weeks.

538
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,322
After 35, it's a shit show.

539
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,640
DARBY: I'm sorry.
You don't have to tell me.

540
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,324
CORNELIA: No, it's okay.
It's what happened.

541
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,447
I like telling you.

542
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,966
I like how you give Josh a hard time.

543
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,690
I don't think I give him a hard time.

544
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,410
It reminds me of my mom.

545
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,209
How she was with your dad?

546
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,441
No, with my brother.

547
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,922
God, she'd yell at him,
but then iron all his weird racing T-shirts.

548
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,525
I mother Jamie.

549
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,967
Ugh. (SNIFFS)

550
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,405
Sorry, I stink.

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,050
CORNELIA: It's okay.
INSTRUCTOR: Here we go, here we go.

552
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,726

- Hip-hop.

554
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,250
I like that one.

556
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,924
No, it's between these and these.

557
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,805
Whoo! Ow!

558
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,801
Ah.

559
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,005
Hey, Jamie!

560
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,726
Jamie!

561
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,128
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a strained muscle.

562
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,965
But the more concerning
thing here is your arthritis.

563
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Arthritis?

564
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,207
Yes. You have arthritis in your knee.

565
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,245
Is, uh, arthritis a catch-all

566
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,561
for some kind of injury to the...

567
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,564
No, arthritis is a
degradation of the joints.

568
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,563
Yeah, I know what traditional arthritis is.

569
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
But...

570
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,446
I'm not sure what you mean by "traditional,"
but this is arthritis.

571
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,764
Arthritis arthritis?

572
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,770
Yes. I usually just say it once.

573
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,251
At my age?

574
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,721
You're what, 42?

575
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,211
Forty-four.

576
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,046
Well, it happens at 42
and it happens at 44.

577
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,928
I'm going to get you a prescription
for paracetamol.

578
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,765
We'll start there
and see how it progresses, okay?

579
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,131
Have you had your eyes checked recently?

580
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,887
I have genetically great eyes.

581
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,966
You're growing up.

582
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,041
It's weird, you know?

583
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,286
I'm at that age where things you think

584
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,681
are only going to happen
when you get older are actually happening.

585
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,291
If I'm going to be totally
honest with myself,

586
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,850
I don't think I'm ever going to die.

587
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,570
- I know that's crazy.
- It's crazy.

588
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,369
I think I'm pathologically happy.

589
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,687
I mean, Cornelia and I,

590
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,570
for a while, the fact
that we got married was so amazing.

591
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,210
I mean, we were married!

592
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,887
Now we're just married, you know?

593
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,366
Do you ever feel that?

594
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,885
Best decision I ever made.

595
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,369
- I really like this place.
- Oh, hey!

596
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,204
I got my first response on Facebook.

597
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,328
- Yeah?
- This guy, Kent Arlington.

598
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,329
I haven't seen him
since high school in Santa Cruz.

599
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,408
Did you flesh it out more, the idea?

600
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,323
A little, yeah.
He's living in Poughkeepsie.

601
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,720
Tipper and I are gonna
ride the old zip there and find him.

602
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,764
- Mmm. Shit.
- What?

603
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
JOSH: My father-in-law.
What is he doing here?

604
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,642
- Where?
- How are you?

605
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,529
Good, Leslie, you?

606
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,568
Good. Gearing up for my memorial.

607
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,530
Leslie is having a tribute
at Lincoln Center

608
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,011
- next month.
- Whew.

609
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,206
What are you doing here?

610
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,406
How do you even know about this place?

611
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,040
Are you kidding? I've been coming here
for pizza since it opened.

612
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,449
This is Jamie, my friend.

613
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,726
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

614
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,168
but both Wedding
and <i>Arlo Takes a Bath</i> changed my life.

615
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,004
It made me want
to tell stories in the non-fiction mode.

616
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,081
Oh, thank you.

617
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,521
No, thank you for your films.

618
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,728
- How's my daughter?
- How does she seem to you?

619
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,848
- Seems well.
- So, why are you asking me?

620
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,846
Cornelia tells me
you're looking for finishing money.

621
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,251
Maybe. it depends on the grant.

622
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,129
If this guy leaves his wife or not.

623
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,810
I met a guy, hedge fund or something,

624
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,600
he's interested in putting money into docs.

625
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,080
I can arrange a meeting if you want.

626
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,040
- JOSH: I think I'm okay.
- Don't be proud, Josh.

627
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,491
I'll call you with his number tomorrow.

628
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,846
- Okay.
- Nice to have met you.

629
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,041
JAMIE: Same.

630
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,370
Jeez Louise, working with him
must've been astonishing.

631
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,441
It's complicated.

632
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,885
I felt I was seen as his protégé,

633
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,611
and I married his daughter.
I needed to establish my own voice.

634
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,082
I think he thought I rejected him,
or that I was arrogant.

635
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,921
I don't know. Maybe I was.

636
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,206
But you'll take that meeting?

637
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,408
- Probably not.
- You have to, Yosh.

638
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,164
I mean, money's money, right?

639
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,691
Yeah, but I never pitch.

640
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,564
I just don't think in sound bites.

641
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,007
I understand we're a culture
of sound bites, but...

642
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,407
I'll help you, you know,
make it sound beautiful.

643
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,165
It is beautiful,
but beautiful to some suit.

(INAUDIBLE)

645
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,325
- Maybe.
- You can totally say no to this,

646
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,641
but would you have any interest
in co-directing with me?

647
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,841
Oh!

648
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,489
No, it's your thing.

649
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,966
Isn't it? Yeah, it should be your thing.

650
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,321
- I totally get it, yeah.
- Yeah, it should be your thing.

651
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,682
- I got this.
- Cool.

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,084
Shall we go?

653
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,367
Uh, you go ahead, I got to take a leak.

Yeah.

661
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,967
What do you mean, "you know"? Which part?

662
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,451
About credit.

663
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,965
My dad always said that about you.

You don't collaborate well.

He "always" said that? What's "always"?

I don't know, twice.

667
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,130
Remember that time
I wanted to do that thing

668
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,730
about the public school in the Bronx,

669
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,962
and you were really excited about it

670
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,530
until I suggested we do it together

671
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,490
and then you...
Then you just kind of dropped it.

672
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,722
Well, maybe we should have done it.

673
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,801
We still could.

674

00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160

What's an ayahuasca ceremony?

699
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,885
I guess there's a shaman
and you have to wear white clothes

and you drink this sludgy liquid
that is made from a Peruvian root

701

and vomit up your demons.

- Yep.

860
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,043
He was this, kind of, beautiful combination

861
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,010
of jock and brain, and he could sing.

862
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,321
He was in the a cappella group
called the Night Owls.

863
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,846

- JAMIE: Oh.

868
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,889
Will he be back soon?

- What's...
- JAMIE: We went to school together.

870

It's been a while,
but he contacted me recently on Facebook.

871
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,489
It would mean a lot to
me if I could see him.

I cut my wrists.

You were the guy.

- Yeah.

a tough time in high school.

You had written a poem for English,

I mean, you were this athlete,
and you wrote this beautiful poem.

- Do you know what poem I'm talking about?
- KENT: Uh...

893
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,687
- I wrote a lot of poems.
- It was a line,

894
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,802
very simple, but effective,
"I want to be unbridgeable."

895

You know, that one line
got me through my mother's illness.

he was part of a massacre in Wanat.

They opened fire on a
bus full of civilians.

921

He then spoke out about it publicly.

922
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,726
And then refused to fight.

923
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,166
He was jailed briefly,

924
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,324

was injured and given the Purple Heart.

a lot about war and the politics of war.

an ice cream cake for Saint Patrick's Day

He doesn't really do that kind of thing.

1361
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,088
Well, I think if you asked him, he might.

1362
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,047
Did you ever see <i>Power Elite?</i>

1363
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,167
What's that?

1364
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,441
Josh's movie! God damn, yes.

1365
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,602
I told him that.
I loved that scene with the dogs.

1366

1367
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,242
you knew Josh and I were married,
didn't you?

1368
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,924
And that Leslie was my dad.

1369

Hey, I admire lots of people.
I want lots of things.

1370

You know what I mean. We all want stuff.
It doesn't mean we're douche bags.

1371

You're a hip chick. You kissed me,
you're married to my friend, but I get it.

1372
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,610
I thought you were Josh.

if other people heard about it,

1375
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,368

1377
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,807
I was dancing with Darby
in an after-hours gay club.

1378
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,211
Is this some kind of a private meeting?

1379
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,931
- Did you follow me here?
- I follow him on Twitter!

1380
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,809
We can't lie like we used to lie anymore.

1381

Everything's reported. Nothing is private.

1382
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,810
- There's nothing going on.
- Don't lie to me. You kissed him.

1383
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,565
- I know all about it.
- I thought he was you, Joshy.

1384
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,484
Don't call me Joshy!
You don't call me Joshy.

1385
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,688
- Sorry.
- It's all a pose.

1386
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,004
It's like he once saw a sincere person
and has been imitating him ever since!

1387

And you're falling for it.

1388
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,760
I didn't even like them!

1389
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,008
You convinced me how awesome they were.

1390
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,082
They're entitled little brats.

1391
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,003
And don't you see? It's all a plan.

1392
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,128
He's trying to destroy me.

1393
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,605

1394
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,131
You know what?
You and your father can have him.

1395

You always wanted a more successful me,
so go for it.

that you'd wanna play kissy face
with 25-year-olds.

1399
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,886
I didn't know that either. And I didn't
know that you'd never finish your movie.

1400
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,201
I'm gonna finish it!
I just need to get it right.

1401

It's obsession. It's fear.
I don't know what it is. It's...

1402

- Please? Will you go back inside?
- JOSH: What the...

1403
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,128
It's not really about making anything.

1404
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,043
At least Jamie makes something.

1405
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,282
Do not compare what I do with him.

When you felt a part of it, you loved it.

as an excuse not to do anything.

But, to be honest,

1422
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,082
it's a little hard for me
to relate to an infant.

You know...

Before you have a kid, everyone tells you,

"it's the best thing you'll ever do."

back from the hospital,

"Don't worry, it gets better."

- Josh!
- Sorry I'm late, Leslie.

1697
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,281
I caught your speech
from the lobby, though,

1698
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,601
and it was really inspiring, spot on.

1699
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,806

Do you wanna sit down?

1700
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,282
Jamie has something
he wants to tell all of you.

1701
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,360
Go ahead.

1702
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,210
Not all of the stuff in my movie
happened exactly as I said it did.

1703
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,964
I played around with some of the timeline.

1704
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,041
Okay.

1705
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,326
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and...

1706
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,487
And what?

1707
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,604
You did a lot more than that, come on.

1708
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,251
He didn't even know Kent. Darby did.

1709
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,402
Darby's mother died of ovarian cancer.

1710
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,562
Jamie's mom
is probably alive and kicking in Idaho.

1711
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,884
Josh, this is kind of my night.

1712
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,482
- You just need to hear this.
- JAMIE: That's basically it.

1713
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,962
That's not basically it!
You knew that Kent had tried to kill himself.

1714
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,166
- Right.
- Say it!

1715
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,241
Josh, let him speak.

1716
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,889
The gist is the same.
I authored a bit of how I came to it.

1717
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,366
I mean, I'm not that good a writer.

1718
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,522
If I made it all up,
I'd be the best writer in Hollywood

1719
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,688
and Kent would be Marlon Brando.

1720
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,128
I never said it was amazing.
I just said it was faked.

1721
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,531
And some of the timeline was adjusted...

1722
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,011
Would you stop with the timeline crap?

1723
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,082
Jamie knew that Kent had
tried to kill himself.

1724
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,686
That he'd been in Afghanistan.
We didn't just stumble upon it.

1725
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,841
It was rigged.

1726
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,049
Jamie invented the whole Facebook thing
because he knew it would play better.

1727
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,690
Kent wasn't in Afghanistan?

1728
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,489
No, Kent was in Afghanistan.

1729
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,722
- So, what's the problem?
- It's...

1730
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,521
It's the way... The way
that he said that he found him is not true.

1731
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,523
Kent served our country,
you're being offensive.

1732
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,090
Is what Josh is saying true?

1733
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,323
Well, I did know,
but I don't think it really matters, though,

1734
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,606
the movie's not about that.

1735
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,843
Of course it matters. Leslie, explain.

1736
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,366
I don't know
that it totally matters in this case.

1737
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,487
- What?
- I don't care.

1738
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,721
I didn't expect you to care.

1739
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,406
Leslie, are you kidding me? You don't care?

1740
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,767
You just gave a speech about authenticity!

1741
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,241
The movie works on so many levels,

1742
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:13,006
the happenstance of it, to be honest
with you, is the least interesting part.

1743
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,286
I can't believe it!

1744
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,086
This movie isn't worth
the RAM it's stored on.

1745
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,686
He's a con artist, Leslie.

I don't know.

But you acted in it.

1765
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,526
