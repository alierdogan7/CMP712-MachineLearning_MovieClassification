1
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,920
" do the afrodisiacos work? "

2
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,055
Goes...

3
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,392
this is an excellent banquet.

4
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,857
Soon we will move back
to the real bedroom.

5
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,403
But earlier, since I have gone out victoriously
in battle this week...

6
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,782
wished to entertain me.
Bring my buffoon!

7
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,795
Good night, your Majesty.
It is a pleasure to return to the palace.

8
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,633
Already knows what is the palace.
24 rooms and a dungeon.

9
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,597
But, already seriously,
the king adored.

10
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,849
Is one of the strongest men
here: not?

11
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,311
Is the only one between us that
everything long of the pit can swim.

12
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,192
Know that they are there. I
hear them breathing.

13
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,362
Good, checkers and horses, I
want to say that...

14
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,864
this plague is something serious: truth?

15
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,158
does not it turn out to be quite black?

16
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,287
Certainly, is a black plague.

17
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,623
Keep the applause by the end.

18
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,836
I love the exercise that
your Majesty does to be supported in form.

19
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,463
calls Himself " to receive taxes
from the plebeian ones ".

20
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,886
Indeed,
the best thing of everything--

21
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,599
I do not support already any more! It
is not graceful!

22
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,144
Have cut the people in two
for saying pranks as bad as those.

23
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,231
- But, Majesty-
bring a graceful buffoon!

24
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,067
finished the banquet.

25
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,236
is not graceful at all.

26
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,864
Was all.

27
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,533
Do a pair of very good imitations.

28
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,245
Am one of the few ones that can imitate
the king of France. His way of walking.

29
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,582
do not know if they have noticed that sometimes it
moves rarely when it walks.

30
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,127
goes away a little of side. It
has a species of--

31
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,173
do not pop in in spontaneous applauses.

32
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,486
what do you do, buffoon?
- Madame, allow me your puberty.

33
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,698
I will not allow it to you. You have thrown
the rubies and the real emeralds.

34
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,035
Then I will gather them and will place them
in your real breast.

35
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,370
- My brooch.
- Bring for here his breast, Majesty.

36
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,957
And I, therefore, it place
and touch the grapefruits. Perfect.

37
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,792
am I wrong?

38
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,297
or did I feel that your two hands
were handling my majestic body?

39
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,174
Madame, I never...

40
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,094
would put my hands in the real melons
in front of the checkers.

41
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,348
melons? If my husband, the king,
and my son, the doctor...

42
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,475
were approaching these homes...

43
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,977
and they were listening what you say
with regard to groping me...

44
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,063
your life would cost
not even a cent.

45
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,024
But, madame, they seem very beautiful,
one in every side.

46
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,735
- This way were done, idiot.
- An unbeatable pair.

47
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,994
Me cai on my bells.

48
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,122
to see...

49
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,625
or not to see?

50
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,628
This is the enema.

51
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,297
what can we do in this respect?

52
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,259
To cough, to cough.

53
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,469
holy sky!

54
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,805
My pranks become mellow.

55
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,100
Would take my life
as a naked cuerpecito.

56
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,562
If only he could see
the naked body of the queen...

57
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,523
or to whom it belongs, really.

58
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,818
Or even a body
with scarce clothing.

59
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,153
I feel very melancholy.

60
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,906
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz
have died.

61
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,075
your tailoring is closed.

62
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,202
Felix?

63
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,204
who said my name?

64
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,168
it is known Nobody that I am here.
Not even my telephone service.

65
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,298
Am the bogey of your father.

66
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,758
My father.

67
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,469
Have died after I was born.

68
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,347
cannot rest...

69
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:56,560
unless you do it
with the queen.

70
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,939
But she is a queen,
and I plebeian buffoon.

71
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,192
cannot copular
ignoring my social condition.

72
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,904
Must know, my son...

73
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,072
that your uncle...

74
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,158
your father...

75
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,702
put me hemlock in the ear.

76
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,872
why?

77
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,625
do not ask me why.

78
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,419
Does the same thing with the whole world.

79
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:26,298
Whenever he sees an ear...

80
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,927
he likes to put hemlock.

81
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,846
Oh, father!

82
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,517
Sees the wizard, my son.

83
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,686
magical AI!

84
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,193
went away Already.

85
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,614
will I dare to put myself to bed with the queen?
And she: will he go to bed with me?

86
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,409
Although he goes to bed with the king
and he uses tights.

87
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,245
magical EI.

88
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,415
Ah, an afrodisiaco.

89
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,463
you want the soft one...

90
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,465
one fortress...

91
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,801
that-?

92
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,055
Any thing
that it could obtain without medical recipe.

93
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,811
This, if you place it...

94
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,814
in the drink of the queen...

95
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,483
will do that he boils the blood.

96
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,945
your passion will be wild...

97
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,947
lustful.

98
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,783
- In other words ...
- It will be burning for me.

99
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,787
Exactly.

100
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,914
But be careful.

101
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:45,419
Because if your Majesty the king will find out
your intentions...

102
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,130
will cut you the legs...

103
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,591
the arms...

104
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,010
and the head.

105
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,346
Good, five of six is not bad.

106
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,265
Now, you go.

107
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,144
Believe that his eggs are ready.

108
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,030
- High place. Who walks there?
- I am only the buffoon.

109
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,282
what matter do you have
in the real bedroom?

110
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,243
bring to your Majesty
his juice of orange.

111
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,954
why?
Where is his servant of custom?

112
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:25,959
Is thrown in the soil of the kitchen
with chicken pox in the socks.

113
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,505
- Enter, then.
- Yes, I hope to be able to enter.

114
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,467
did you like the form
in which I cheated these guys?

115
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,858
Crafty buffoon
what do you do in my bedroom?

116
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,655
Madame, I thought that perhaps it should long for
something to you of drinking. A tranquilizing philter.

117
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,324
Confess that I have be.
Bring it to me.

118
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,328
Yes. To drink the philter
before he is finished the bubbles.

119
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,206
is not it wonderful?
- It is effervescent in end.

120
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,583
To swallow it, my lady.

121
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,294
- Health.
- Money and love.

122
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,887
Has great quantity of bubbles,
but it is well.

123
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,015
To take her to you.

124
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:28,188
Good, now I have to return
to the dungeon...

125
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,524
to which they return
the amount of the glass.

126
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,736
Wait. Buffoon, come here.

127
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,574
Feel an extraordinary heat
in the body...

128
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:42,661
that flows for my veins,
making to wish - not, to gasp...

129
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:47,082
that you touch my body frantically
and make me love immediately.

130
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,085
- Devastate me and take me now.
- It will be a pleasure.

131
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,962
- Take me to the bed.
AI bed?

132
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,423
- And make me love.
- Yes, to the bed.

133
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,550
- Take me, buffoon.
- There we go.

134
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,927
- This passion is growing in me.
- Skylight.

135
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,889
- Come rapidly.
- I cannot walk rapidly, buffoon.

136
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,350
- The passion is very big.
- Excuse to me if I jump to the bed.

137
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,020
- Guide me to the bed.
- Somewhere here.

138
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,065
The philter will be
under the pillow.

139
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,652
In case you lose the fever, you
will be able to recover her.

140
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,114
to approach!
Explore my body with your hands.

141
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,575
I will do It. I
will cover you the brakes.

142
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,997
Needed to feel
our naked skins touching itself.

143
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,792
do not have naked skin
but what looks like to you the velvet?

144
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,378
not! Kiss me rapidly.
where is it?

145
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,466
can you undress me now?
- I am kissing my own arm.

146
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,595
Yes. I will take the real garment from you.

147
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,394
do not pull me so much.

148
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,483
To put yourself of foot, buffoon.
This is not a game.

149
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:00,906
finally!

150
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,283
what is this?
Interior special clothes.

151
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,037
EI belt of chastity
that the jealous king has placed me...

152
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,208
so that no other man enjoys
the best of my body.

153
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,627
Bad luck for all
those that we inhabit in the palace.

154
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,631
Wait here. I will go.

155
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,511
Now, with incredible urgency...

156
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,848
will open the lock
to come to the sabrosura.

157
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,397
This key is too big
for this padlock.

158
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,492
Forgive me.

159
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,165
Must think about something rapid, because
before we realize...

160
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,168
will come the Renaissance
and we all will be doing.

161
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,049
- your Majesty needs this.
what?

162
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,970
Has jammed meal between the teeth
and it needed to be extracted.

163
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,848
Excuse me.

164
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,405
To this was called him a hunt of monkeys.

165
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,205
Perhaps let's must force the padlock.

166
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,253
Listed.

167
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,255
we achieve It.

168
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,592
- Now I am yours.
- AI end, the portals of the delight.

169
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,594
Have portals of the delight: truth?

170
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:49,723
Prepare you. His Majesty woke up
of his siesta for a noise sobrecogedor.

171
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,560
Prepare you. His Majesty woke up
of his siesta for a noise sobrecogedor.

172
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:57,231
- will divide You in two.
- Yes, it will divide me in two.

173
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,192
One somewhere here and other
to another side of the bedroom.

174
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,194
Yes, of an alone blow.

175
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:06,698
And I do not turn out to be divided well in two. My
suits are for a finished person.

176
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,909
Then I will not satisfy this passion.

177
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:13,080
Good, close the this thing
that you have there.

178
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,208
EI real padlock.
Rapid, before--

179
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,795
- Help me.
- I am helping You, but--

180
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,380
Listed.

181
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,133
Perfect. Closed solidly.
This is more solid than--

182
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,636
My hand is jammed
in the belt of chastity.

183
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,931
Always find me
with the hands in the mass.

184
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,975
approaches.
What will we do?

185
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,142
EI king?

186
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,773
Yes. Rapid, to put yourself on the garment
immediately.

187
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,944
my queen!
Where is my queen?

188
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,655
very informal,
as if nothing had happened.

189
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,786
my Queen, a noise sobrecogedor
has woken up me...

190
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,164
putting myself of terrible humor.

191
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,791
my Husband, you
have startled me.

192
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,879
Yes, your majestad. Be a good king
and bring to me a water glass.

193
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,799
EI buffoon has said to me the most graceful
details in your absence.

194
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:09,094
This way is, your Majesty. It
was almost like to tickle him.

195
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,639
Is that I feel very alone
when you sleep your siesta.

196
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,308
I also.

197
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,476
Still...

198
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,354
does not seem to me graceful.

199
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,899
Have a few riddles
for Your Majesty.

200
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,611
what is white and black, white and black
and white and black?

201
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,113
A nun falling down for the stairs.

202
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,159
Give me a kiss.

203
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,578
- Skylight. Extract the language.
not, you!

204
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,289
be enough!
Out of here, buffoon.

205
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,919
- I go away Already.
- I will accompany You on the door.

206
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,173
AI end.

207
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,884
AI end we are alone.

208
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,011
Yes, my husband.

209
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,055
Majesty, wanted--

210
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,728
The key. I need the key.
Where is it?

211
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,439
ah, here is.

212
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,296
you tickle Me.

213
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,557
Hello, Majestad.

214
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,102
do you remember that you have said to me
that it should cause pleasure to your wife?

215
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,608
do not know for what the whole world it
is so shaken.

216
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,152
do not copolish.

217
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,907
Clean me a little the neck,
make hair enough above.

218
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,755
" what is the sodomy? "

219
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,959
Says "ah".

220
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,755
In this side of my arm,
on everything at night.

221
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,926
did not notice it very much in the day,
but it bothers me at night.

222
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,553
I do not want to hurt her
but up to where it can raise it?

223
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,765
Mr. Milos
does it want to come with me, please?

224
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,524
Pass, Mr. Milos.
feel here.

225
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,860
Want that it gives me
some information first.

226
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:18,116
how is it called?
- Stavros Milos.

227
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,119
where does it live?
- In Armenia.

228
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,330
Armenia?
- I am from Armenia.

229
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,124
- I Came to visit my brother.
- I see Already.

230
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,419
his occupation?
- Shepherd.

231
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,965
is he a shepherd?
- We all in my family it are.

232
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,009
Less my brother, which lives here.
EI sells carpets.

233
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,263
has it had
any illness important?

234
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,265
None. Well.

235
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,228
what problem does it have then?

236
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,397
Am in love with a sheep.

237
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,857
how did he say?

238
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,652
Am in love with a sheep.

239
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,760
I see ah, already.

240
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:23,265
Looks, doctor. In the mountains
where I shepherd to my cattle...

241
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,642
is so beautiful,
under the starred sky...

242
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,896
and I am alone.
Sometimes I feel very solitary.

243
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:33,275
Spend the hours,
and prompt desire to a woman.

244
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,777
But there are no women, doctor.

245
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,280
am not married and--

246
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,909
Good, one night,
last summer...

247
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,244
was already not lasting.

248
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:47,664
My body needed satisfaction.

249
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:51,627
- And then the vi.th
to whom?

250
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,254
- To Daisy.
the sheep?

251
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,799
I took her to Myself to a side
of the mountain...

252
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:01,428
and there, down the Armenian sky, we
had sexual relations.

253
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,685
did it do it with the sheep?
- Naturally.

254
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,692
holy Sky.

255
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,363
Was the best knocked down one
of all my life.

256
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,492
Mr. Milos, forgive me...

257
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:27,955
if I seemed scandalized. I
feel it.

258
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,416
Doctor, Ms. Goldblatt wants
to speak with you with regard to his hernia.

259
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,418
Then.

260
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,256
Mr. Milos...

261
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,009
am very satisfied for you two...

262
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,763
but I have other patients.

263
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,934
And unless there is
something specific...

264
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,144
in what could help him--

265
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,189
Doctor, please.
A minute.

266
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,067
Looks, the problem is that...

267
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,653
she already does not love me.

268
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,655
Because of it I came.

269
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,158
Because she is not already won the love of me.

270
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,786
how is it known it?

271
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,665
For certain details. He
behaves cold, indifferent.

272
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,711
Speaks with her.
Him attention will pay to you.

273
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,379
Mr. Milos...

274
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,007
you are...

275
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,175
madman.

276
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,677
I brought It from Armenia.

277
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,930
My brother says that he is a great doctor.
Once it saved the life.

278
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,893
you need a psychiatrist.
I am a doctor of medicine.

279
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,604
Speaks with her, please.

280
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,315
cannot speak with a sheep.
Is he crazy?

281
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,317
Is out,
in the truck of my brother.

282
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,861
does it want to go out of my office,
please?

283
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,113
I am a doctor!
Not a veterinarian!

284
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,615
I will bring It.

285
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,910
do not bring sheeps to my office!
My mother has just stopped paying it!

286
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,954
Doctor, I am a simple man. I
do not meet wise men.

287
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,540
- My brother says that you it are.
- I it am not.

288
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,418
Am a common and current doctor,
that is quite.

289
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,421
- I Will go for her.
- Mr. Milos, you do not understand.

290
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,923
it is not normal...

291
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,635
to experience mature love
for something that has 4 paws!

292
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,637
Hopes that he should know her.

293
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,764
I cannot believe it.

294
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,861
- I cannot.
- The recipe is not working.

295
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:25,280
I feel It.
Does it want to sit down?

296
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:29,201
does it want to sit down, Ms.-? I
will speak with you--

297
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,164
Dr. Ross, it is a Daisy.

298
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,250
Ah. Very well.

299
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:40,337
Take her to my office.

300
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,092
Will have to forgive me.
The sheep has...

301
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,135
sore throat.

302
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,017
Mr. Milos, I am going to have
to call the police.

303
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:58,313
can we speak?
Do not put it in my office, please.

304
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,108
must not do that.

305
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,736
is not it a beautiful Daisy?
- Yes, it it is.

306
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,198
Mr. Milos,
you are a good man.

307
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,200
I do not want to see it
getting into difficulties.

308
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,996
what I do not believe that he understands is that...

309
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,498
has...

310
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,792
a psychiatric problem.

311
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:22,296
Really needs to see one--

312
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,883
To someone who devotes himself
to the psychiatry.

313
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,093
I am a general practitioner.

314
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:42,649
Know that it did not want to make anything bad...

315
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,235
on having brought to this sheep here, but...

316
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,864
have patients: does he know?

317
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,866
With problems of kidneys...

318
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,536
and of the heart, and...

319
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,372
seeing to a sheep like that--

320
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,837
Hello, Margarita.

321
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,096
Am the doctor Ross.

322
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,308
Doug Ross.

323
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,081
I would like to see
the two again...

324
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:43,585
but in this moment
my office is full.

325
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,004
Knew that it could help us.

326
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,881
Thank you, doctor.

327
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,092
In fact...

328
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,594
if it could see to alone to Daisy...

329
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,888
perhaps could--

330
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,391
what is.
Any thing.

331
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,861
what happens to you, fondness?
- Not at all.

332
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,280
I am Only a little tired,
that is quite.

333
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,700
Then vetoes to putting to bed early.

334
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,461
what bundles?

335
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,964
Not at all.

336
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,925
were not without doing anything. You
were caressing your pullover of wool.

337
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,432
is not true.

338
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,684
why would it do something like that?

339
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,770
Only God knows it.

340
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,195
Doctor...

341
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,864
Mr. Milos brought to his sheep.

342
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,033
is she here?

343
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,664
That happens.

344
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,687
Thank you. It
can go away.

345
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,451
Hello...

346
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,496
fondness.

347
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,125
Know that this must to you seem
very strange.

348
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,256
You are of the hills of Armenia,
and I am of Jackson Heights.

349
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,216
Nevertheless...

350
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,844
believe that it might work...

351
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,054
if we try it.

352
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,189
A room, please.

353
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,032
Thank you very much.
A moment.

354
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,245
Here has.

355
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,625
does he want the sign of " not bothering "
in the door?

356
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,753
Not.

357
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,424
Good, is well.
Thank you very much.

358
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,726
service to the room? He
speaks Dr. Ross of 525.

359
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,813
Want to arrange white cold wine...

360
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,900
caviar,
and a little of grassland.

361
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:57,487
green normal Grassland.

362
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,783
For 525.

363
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,452
Thank you.

364
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,294
Small Daisy.

365
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,215
Are tender: do you want?

366
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,227
cannot. I
am exhausted.

367
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,573
Goes...

368
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,909
that was incredible.

369
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,830
I never thought that it might be like that.

370
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,416
Not in my craziest fantasies.

371
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,380
Really you are very special.

372
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,800
I love our bedroom
in the shape of L.

373
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:04,346
I will never forget the evenings
that we have spent together.

374
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:10,519
am not thinking about having known
this peace and happiness in my life.

375
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,273
Hoped that you should feel the same thing.

376
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,125
I feel It, wanted. It
was out when you called.

377
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,670
Had to do an
emergency consultation. You smell well.

378
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,424
Fondness...

379
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:43,886
is it my imagination, or
do you always smell to chops of ram?

380
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,514
how that to chops of ram?

381
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,350
what class of foolery is that one
of the chops of ram?

382
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,854
how might it to smell to ram?
That is not logical.

383
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,065
what class of cheap suit is this one?

384
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,151
Is enough of these suits.

385
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:17,252
Ann! He waits. I can explain it. We
are only friends!

386
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:20,464
how could you do that?
- She is Ms. Bencourse.

387
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,549
Is one of my patients.

388
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:26,053
believes sheep.
That is quite.

389
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,096
Nothing more.

390
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:32,601
marked EI committed an act
of adultery with a sheep.

391
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:37,439
Is even worse for the fact that
the sheep is a 18-year-old minor.

392
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,274
and what?

393
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:43,654
Ann left me. It took all my money,
all my savings.

394
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,615
took my doctor's license from Me.

395
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,201
But it does not matter for me.

396
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,955
If you are arranged, we
will get them ready.

397
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,374
Will obtain an employment, I do not know.

398
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,315
do not be called me a waiter! I
am a doctor!

399
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,193
do they understand? I
am not a waiter! I am a doctor!

400
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,279
do not be called me a waiter! I
am a doctor!

401
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,199
Says "ah".

402
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,371
Come here.
Open the legs.

403
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:37,082
could not it
remain at least on an empty stomach this morning?

404
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,002
was not it that what I said to him-?
What filth is those?

405
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,223
Daisy. Fondness.

406
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,813
" Finally I saved
sufficient money...

407
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:03,817
to return to the United States
and to lead to me to my Daisy to house.

408
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,361
you made me slightly terrible.

409
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:10,199
But I took already to Daisy
again to the mountains...

410
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,868
where he will never find her.

411
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,288
Stavros Milos ".

412
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,264
" Detergent for Wool "

413
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:44,274
" why to any women
is it difficult to come to the orgasm? "

414
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,956
Have waited for so much time
this moment--

415
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,420
Fabrizio, my love...

416
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,797
be careful with my hymen.

417
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,383
Gina, for me your body
is a cathedral.

418
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,262
Now take the trousers from yourself.

419
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,727
did you like?

420
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,563
Yes.

421
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,400
did not seem to me
that you were enjoying it.

422
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,655
Yes. You were wonderful.

423
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,118
But you remained passive...

424
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,662
as a cold salmon.

425
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:26,168
But: did to you like?

426
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:29,922
to me? Are you joking? It
is more entertaining that to laugh.

427
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:37,679
Perhaps the next time is
more relaxed.

428
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,151
Marcello: do you know anything
with regard to the frigidity?

429
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:58,325
Everything consists of exciting the woman
before possessing it.

430
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,160
how much time?

431
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,746
Fifteen minutes, half an hour. It
depends on the woman.

432
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,665
and your wife?

433
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,834
Thirty seconds.

434
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,169
what luck you have!

435
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,881
do not say to me
that your wife has problems.

436
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,884
Not, is not that.

437
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,886
you handle her...

438
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:20,430
before getting it?

439
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,725
to put him what? Ah!

440
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:27,938
I do not like to speak 440 about Gina
as if she was a slut.

441
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,440
how much time do they take of married?

442
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,734
Six weeks.

443
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:37,698
Plays with her.
Caress her. Excite it.

444
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,369
Is a fault of the man.
Any woman is possible to make come to the delight.

445
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,082
Marcello, last week
when we were--

446
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:50,335
She saw the television.

447
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:53,755
Must be harming.

448
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,218
Some women are late more.

449
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:03,015
Finds his erogenous zones.

450
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:06,643
your father gave me
a diagram of them...

451
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,688
and nevertheless--

452
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,406
Good, dates the return.

453
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,201
Dates the return.

454
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,996
Want to check rapidly
a few parts to that I did not attend.

455
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,127
To get excited.

456
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,129
To get excited.

457
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:01,490
Fabrizio, there is nothing
that the church could do for you.

458
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:06,119
If it could, would try to do
that one was coming your wife...

459
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,121
but that is impossible.

460
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,457
AI fewer you obtain pleasure of her.

461
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:13,418
Perhaps some day
she obtains it of you.

462
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,205
Here will be
my new offices.

463
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,542
Hundred persons will work for me.

464
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,878
Yes.

465
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:59,089
But speak to me about your sexual life...

466
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,341
of your wife.

467
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:06,346
Wails, shouts...

468
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,974
and the back scratches me...

469
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,768
one comes 469 six, seven times.

470
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:15,230
Is like a wolf in brama.

471
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:18,233
Mine remains there stretched out,
looking at the roof...

472
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,944
as if she was dead.

473
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,989
you have it ... small?

474
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:29,745
small? As a French bread.
Small!

475
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,581
Then I do not understand.

476
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,760
Still you are still depressed.

477
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,472
Not. I am well.

478
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,978
Continue thinking about that.

479
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,398
Because I love you.
Because you are very beautiful...

480
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,859
and I want that you wish to love you.

481
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,861
Please, Fabrizio.

482
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,129
what bundles?

483
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:24,967
Take me. Do it to me.

484
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,469
here?
- Yes.

485
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,353
- There Are the people around us.
- it does not matter for me.

486
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,234
might see Us.

487
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:45,654
I know It. Do it.

488
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,658
Take me now.

489
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,661
Golly. He
wants it now.

490
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:27,321
In the gallery of art one comes 490...

491
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:31,742
as an express train.

492
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:35,454
And the following night,
remains put to bed without moving.

493
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,666
Is the danger, friend.

494
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:43,170
EI fear of which they see them.

495
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:48,842
The perverse tension of the danger.
Do you understand?

496
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,721
This is what he needs.

497
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:58,143
me Pay attention.

498
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,688
there is no doubt.

499
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,483
Is one of these rare girls.

500
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:18,997
did anybody see Fabrizio?

501
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,631
Fabrizio, listens carefully
what I say to you.

502
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:31,593
are going to see You.
It is dangerous. Do not do it.

503
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:36,598
Almost found us doing it
last week.

504
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,101
In the church.
In the confessional.

505
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,145
Still I have
the legs got cramps.

506
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,652
Stops doing it,
before it is too much late.

507
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:33,864
are you angered by me?

508
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:37,201
loved You. AI less we know
that you are not frigid.

509
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:42,289
Are a wonderful husband.

510
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,835
Vamonos to sleep.

511
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,837
why?

512
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:52,841
do not you remember?
Tomorrow we will go to the Vatican.

513
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:38,095
" are the transvestitas homosexual? "

514
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,682
do we have to come so early?
Where does he say that we have to do it?

515
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:45,310
Sam, are the dads of the fiance
of Julie. Do you want to come late?

516
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:49,231
Listening, Tess, I
have not felt good lately.

517
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:51,525
Is psychosomatic, a fondness.

518
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,111
do you believe that a headache
for tension is psychosomatic?

519
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,905
suddenly did you turn
into psychiatrist?

520
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,907
you Stops complaining, Sam.

521
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:01,785
Are the parents of Alvin,
so it is an obligation.

522
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,454
Sight, Sam,
I do not like 522 either.

523
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,374
or should he say
that they look at us over the shoulder?

524
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:10,919
I Already heard it, and I believe that the two
little paranoiacs are.

525
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:15,465
The parents of Alvin are charming.
They like you very much.

526
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,934
To that was called him a lawn. Cut good
not too grown as mine.

527
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:28,437
who is his gardener?
- I.

528
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,772
are you the gardener?
- it cannot be.

529
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:34,568
- Sam: does it dress the roses?
- I cultivate them.

530
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,888

- This is exquisite.

531
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,224
Adonde do you go?
- AI bathed.

532
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,809
Is above. The first door
of the left side.

533
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:30,457
Yes, we prefer the Bermudas
to Puerto Rico.

534
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,000
Is much nicer.

535
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,842
Of course, I like 535...

536
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,427
to dress of label
occasionally...

537
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,638
but when I am away on holiday...

538
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,266
I like to put oneself on commode
and to use trousers...

539
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:51,311
or falditas and smocks
with pretty sombreros.

540
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:54,982
your husband and I had
a pleasant conversation.

541
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:58,652
Is a very kind man.
Very interesting.

542
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,203
I would love 542. I have never seen
engravings in wood.

543
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,916
Are African heads
and we buy them in--

544
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,251
Bimini.

545
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:18,255
Were a real bargain. He
would not believe us how much they cost us.

546
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,508
does he want to see engravings in wood?
Him mostrare some. Say it to him.

547
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,386

551
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:02,758
In the top shelf,
in the cupboard.

552
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,885
In of above.

553
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:42,172
Bimini is a free port
and we obtained a magnificent price.

554
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,596
Are from Bimini, from the Bahamas.

555
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,640
Beautiful: truth?

556
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:53,725

Sam is late so much.

562
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:21,003

- Skylight.

563
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,172
- ? one finds good, lady?
- it is not at all.

564
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:26,175
Is only another crime in the street.

565
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:29,469
Is something that every day happen,
and now it finishes of happening to me.

566
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,848
- Is very lucky.
lucky? I do not know it.

567
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,560
- Certainly, could have been worse.
- It has the whole reason.

568
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:40,230
did it have valuable articles in his purse?
- I do not believe it.

569
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,858
Probably wonder
why I put myself on this.

570
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:47,571

do not fit myself.

The young people of today.
Is she sure that it is well?

572
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:53,660
what can do one? She
is the society in whom we live.

00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:55,496

574
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,541
Sam: what did you do?
You do caiste enter?

575
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,756

576
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:11,553
Good, to seeing.
From whom did they steal the purse?

577
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:15,724
Everything is well, official. I
excuse the small crooked one.

578
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,935
I feel It, but I will have to do
a report.

579
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:21,730
do not want to present any accusation.
Indeed, idiot.

580
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,032
what causes so much clamor, Alvin?
- There is a multitude, and the police.

581
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,201
police officer?
- exciting What.

582
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:37,204

there is nothing of which to be alarmed.
It is a theft of routine purse.

590
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,939
Purse--

00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:01,129
Every week we give to the public

695
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:05,008
we ask Them that they should write to us
saying to us what is his perversion.

696
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,928

bring for plane the candidate...

697
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:12,432

the rabbi Chaim Baumel.

701
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:31,618
A lot of congratulations, Chaim Baumel.

702
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,454
Forgives.
It is not Chaim.

703
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,290
is not Caim.

704
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:39,334
- declares himself Jaim.

705
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,003
very well.

706
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,839
Have understood that, in addition to being
a very distinguished clergyman...

707
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:47,009
has a very interesting fetish.

708
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:50,512
- Wants to say an obsession.
- Yes.

709
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:54,183
Yes. The averages of silk.

710
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,019
the averages of silk?
- I love Them.

711
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:00,189
I like to touch them, to embrace them--

712
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,651
Wrote in his letter
that he would like to be...

713
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:07,154
tied.

714
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:11,033
Because of it we need the help
of one of the members of the panel.

715
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:14,495
who wants to tie it? You
govern Philbin: does it want to do it?

716
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:18,248
Forgives. She
must be a girl.

717
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,918
Have two charming girls.

718
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:24,129
Wide-brimmed straw hat: does it want to do the honors
and to tie the rabbi?

719
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:26,548
- I would love 719.
- Rabbi.

720
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:34,431
Now Wide-brimmed straw hat is going to tie
the rabbi Baumel...

721
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:37,893
in agreement with his desires
expressed in the letter.

722
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:42,022
have not had a lot of experience,
rabbi, but I believe that I can do it.

723
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:45,609
If it has special instructions,
warn me.

724
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:49,404
If there is some certain area
that wants that it ties him.

725
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:51,406
not too tight.

726
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:56,537
Well. Now a model
of the agency Lucy Jones...

727
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,916
is going to claim that she is
the governess of rabbi Baumel...

728
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,710
and it is going to give him lashes.

729
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:08,882
- Has been a very bad rabbi.
- But at the same time--

730
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:11,885
Not so loudly. I have to be
in the synagogue in the morning.

731
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:16,557
Ms. Baumel, the wife of the rabbi,
who flew even here from Indian...

732
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,934
will sit down to the feet of the rabbi...

733
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:21,687
and he will eat pig.

734
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,398
you have behaved very badly.
Bad rabbi!

735
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,900
not do it again.

736
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,735
villain!

737
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:31,572

738
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,407
There have it, friends.

739
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:37,077
Another lucky winner
manages to realize his fantasy.

740
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,874
Am Jack Barry, wishing them
good night, and good luck.

to which the doctors come...

743
00:59:56,471 --> 01:00:00,476
that do investigations
and sexual experiments? "

744
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:22,122
deme 50 cents
of regular gasoline.

745
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,790

01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,978
As to eleven kilometers and a half.

751
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,313

753
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:51,151
did I hear her saying that it was going
to the house of Dr. Bernardo?

754
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:53,612
does he want that it takes her? I
go for there.

755
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,072
Would be fabulous.

756
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,073

757
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,491
Good, vamonos.

758
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,622
is he a friend of Dr. Bernardo?

759
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:07,376
am not precisely his friend. I
am going to help him with his experiments.

760
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,920
do you also study
sexual phenomena?

761
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:13,382
Yes. I studied biology
in the university.

762
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,260

produced by an erection.

766
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,353
- Yes, I know it.
ah, yes?

767
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,732
Yes, I am a correspondent of the Globe. I
am going to interview Dr. Bernardo...

768
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:33,318

Believe that he wants that we happen.

777
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,691
EI doctor is waiting for us.

778
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:02,574

01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,159
Yes, is magnificent.

780
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:05,994
still does his decorator live?

781
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:07,454
Is Cold.

782
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:12,793

Is Dr. Bernardo or not?

783
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:14,920
I am Dr. Bernardo.

784
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:20,509
you may be Victor...

785
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,135
and Miss. Lacey.

786
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:27,683
Igor, I you was thinking about having said
that you should remain in your room.

787
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,651
Forgive it.

788
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,195
Generally remains
in his room.

789
01:03:40,946 --> 01:03:43,615
There Is an enormous problem
with the servitude in the actuality.

790
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:44,700
Come.

791
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:47,953
do they want to have dinner?

792
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:53,208
Say that it is famous
for his dad's omelettes.

793
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:56,211
Dr. Bernardo, it is not known it thrilled
that I am for being here.

794
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:58,380
Have waited for a lot of time
to know it.

795
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,884
Am anxious for it helping
with his experiments.

796
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:04,595
do not know if he has read
my last book...

797
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:07,639
" sexual advanced Positions -
How to achieve them without laughing "...

798
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,683
but it is turning
into the classic one.

799
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:11,518
Am acquainted by me with him.

800
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,190
Is wonderful that the scientists
finally approach the topic of the sex.

801
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:20,903
the girls like 801 his work
" The respiration during the orgasm ".

802
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:23,363
A trifle compared
with my real work.

803
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:25,532
Doctor, I read that you affirmed...

804
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:30,329
that thinks that I divide equally the length
of the penis must be 48 centimeters.

805
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:32,331
does not it seem to him a little long?

806
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,750
do I chatter?

807
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:38,086
Friend, I am doing discoveries
that he would not imagine.

808
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,256
Yes, I know it, but 48 centimeters--

809
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,884
- That is -
- is not a madness.

810
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:48,555
This way call me in the clinic
of Masters and Johnson. Madman.

811
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:52,309
Because I had visions of exploration
in sexual areas...

812
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,853
unimaginable
for human low beings.

813
01:04:54,937 --> 01:05:00,150
I discovered how to make
a man impotent hiding his sombrero.

814
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:03,111
Was the first one in explaining
the connection...

815
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:06,448
between the excessive masturbation
and entering the politics.

816
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:11,787
Was the first one who said that the orgasm
clitoral not must be only for women.

817
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:16,959
laughed at me, ridiculed me. They
said that he was crazy.

818
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,962
threw Me of Masters and Johnson.

819
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:22,798
Without indemnification. It
was deserving it to me.

820
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,258
but I showed them!

821
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:29,763
are we going to eat dessert?

822
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:35,561
Come. I want to teach them
my laboratory.

823
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,609
Clean this table.
And date hurry.

824
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,323
Forgive Igor.

825
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:51,952
Was a part of one of my experiments
that went out badly.

826
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:56,623
Using an electrical generator, I
gave him an orgasm of 4 hours.

827
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:59,960
amused himself, but it finished this way.

828
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:06,925
Takes care of your position.

829
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,474
Here is.

830
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,643
Here is where I am discovering
new facts with regard to the sex...

831
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:19,229
that some day they will turn me
into a great man.

832
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,419
Dr. Bernardo
what is all this?

833
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,005
Come somewhere here and they will see it.

834
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,810
Here I am studying the
premature ejaculation in a hippopotamus.

835
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,813
what so often presents to himself
this problem in a hippopotamus?

836
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:06,193
Here I am forcing a man
to copular with an enormous bread of rye.

837
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:08,195
do It of marvel.

838
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:12,491
Here, I am going to take
the brain of a lesbian...

839
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:17,037
and to put it in the body of a man who
works for the company of phones.

840
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:19,665
but why?
Of what will it serve his that the people?

841
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:22,876
will serve as lesson the idiots
who are called me a madman. Come.

842
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:27,714
But, doctor, this is immoral.

843
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:31,677
Bullshit. The human mind is capable
of many strange things. Look.

844
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,347
Every day, for one year, I
have not given him anything any more than silicone.

845
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,349
Earlier his breast was flat.

846
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:40,060
Give me another year, and care.

847
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,484
Is an insane person.

848
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:50,654
This was what they said
in Masters and Johnson.

849
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:54,283
And quite because I constructed
a diaphragm of 120 meters.

850
01:07:56,451 --> 01:08:00,080
control of the birthrate
for an entire nation!

851
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:07,629
you will be the subject
of my most recent experiment.

852
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:08,922
I?

853
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,300
Yes. Look.

854
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,805
Have here 20 explorers.

855
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:20,559
Want to measure his respiration
when they violate it collectively.

856
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:22,394
not!

857
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,610
Move away from her.

858
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:33,405
why does not it allow her to relax
and to enjoy it?

859
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:36,074
If it shoots him, I will demand it
for bad medical practice.

860
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,956
Victor, do something!

861
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:45,125
Manten the crossed legs.

862
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:06,415
Now we owe to them a dinner.

863
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,712
what raisin, Victor?

864
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:14,965
Believe that the battery is dead,
and we have gasoline, neither oil nor water.

865
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,308
are you well?
- Yes.

866
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,396
what was that?
- It sounded as Igor.

867
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,856
Victor! Look!

868
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:35,319
golly!

869
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:37,279
A giant nipple.

870
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:41,742
what are we going to do?

871
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:45,287
do not know what you are going to do, but
I am going to bring my glove of baseball.

872
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:48,165
Looks. It turns out to be angry.
EI nipple is erecto.

873
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,541
they see! Vamonos!

874
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,753
not so rapid.
In my family they all are males.

875
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,397
Deputy, I want to denounce
to a nipple that escaped.

876
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:13,440
one what?

877
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:17,611
Already killed two persons,
Dr. Bernardo and his assistant.

878
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,947
- Is an enormous nipple.
have they been drinking?

879
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,949
have no time to discuss.

880
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:26,078
EI field is being destroyed
by a colossal nipple.

881
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:33,836
Have a few beautiful bosoms.

882
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,840
Hears, something walks badly with the radio.

883
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:41,218
- do not worry.
- Something walks badly with the radio.

884
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,553
do you see?

885
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:47,182
moan, my God!

886
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:49,768
holy sky!

887
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,149
run!

888
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,831
Are alert
to an enormous feminine bosom.

889
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,333
Is an approximately a height 4,000
with glass the Xth.

890
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,336
Carves 4,000 with glass the Xth.

891
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,671
Vamonos.

892
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:21,675
" Everybody Needs Milk "

893
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:32,478
Is too much late. He
is dead.

894
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,564
I know It. The cream delayed it
and the milk killed it.

895
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,941
talks each other itself about a very crafty nipple.

896
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,526
Shoots half cream
and half milk.

897
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,322
what will we do to stop
to this diabolical nipple?

898
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:47,117
Have an idea,
but I am going to need camouflage.

899
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,119
Can obtain
the whole camouflage that he needs.

900
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,371
Please do not make anything dangerous.

901
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:54,541
do not worry. I
know what to do with the nipples.

902
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:06,530
Victor! I am very proud of you. You
achieved it.

903
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,783
Worried much.
Were you afraid?

904
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,952
do you joke? Do I look like the type
of man who is scared?

905
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:14,037
I it was. I believed that it
was going to nurse you to death.

906
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:17,082
Good, now quite is sure. They
do not have to worry for anything.

907
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:21,086
But I ask myself about a thing.
Is he sure that it was the only one?

908
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:24,506
- Yes.
- In general they travel in pairs.

909
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:27,301
- does not have to worry because of it.
- I have never seen the only one.

910
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:29,428
Two, yes.
But the not one.

911
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:33,640
So we will take a trace pezonal,
to be able to identify her.

912
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:38,187
Believe that we will set her
free for approximately 90 days...

913
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:42,774
and we will take her to the orphan-asylum
to which I fed the hungry babies.

914
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:45,194
Look after.

915
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:51,742
Were magnificent.
Then I knew that he was wishing you.

916
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:54,661
Good, did not want to say anything
on this, Helen...

917
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:57,748
but it had a personal interest
in this case.

918
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,541
had never said it to anybody...

919
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:03,712
but when he was a baby,
fed me with false bosoms.

920
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:07,633
The truth is that I have learned
a thing of all this.

921
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:11,887
When it is a question of the sex, there are things
that must always be left without know.

922
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,807
And with my luck,
probably will never be known.

923
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:30,697
" what happens during the ejaculation? "

924
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,082
Room of the brain.

925
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:42,042

01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,194
- Is lowering meal.

937
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:12,239
- Fettuccini.

938
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:15,284

939
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:16,702
Italian Meal.

940
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,667
Stomach proceeding
to crush the fettuccini.

941
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:26,378
speaks to Them the control of the mission.

942
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,380
Be Prepared
for a system review.

943
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:31,258
Good: what do you think?

944
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,260
Not, thank you.

945
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,012
do you believe that we are going to have
sexual relations this night?

946
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:38,098
I feel very optimistic.
The girl is very beautiful.

947
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:40,017
does it already dress her?
- Not, I have not been able.

948
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,561
Have been too busy.

949
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,646
Is charming. You
should see her.

950
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:49,026
Brain to eyes. Forward.

951
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,569

01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:53,822
Approach in the girl with whom it is
having dinner. I want to see something, please.

953
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,741
EI finished body?
- Yes, please.

954
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:04,082
Would be a shame to lose this one.

955
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,501
Definitively.

956
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:09,087
some indication?

957
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:13,050
Brain to ears.
Can they send to us anything of voice?

958
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,303
seems To me that...

959
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:20,474
Norman Mailer has exactly
the same type of relevancy.

960
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:23,310
This duality affirmative answer - denial...

961
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:27,231
that only Proust or Flaubert
could achieve.

962
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:29,942
do not know if we are going to achieve it. It
does not seem very probable.

963
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:32,736
I graduated of the University
of New York.

964
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,404
we Are going to achieve it.

965
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,906
Worry.

966
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:39,326
- For a possible defeat: not?
- Yes.

967
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:41,995
Anyone can suffer a fiasco
occasionally...

968
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:45,707
but two followed ones can cause
a serious loss of confidence.

969
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:49,127
you Already see what it is doing to him
to the general frame of mind.

970
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,796
do not worry.

971
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,339
Are going to have success.

972
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:56,260
your house or mine? It
does not matter for me where we do it.

973
01:17:56,343 --> 01:17:58,095
Hears: why do you turn out to be so scared?

974
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:01,473
tongue is!
Who showed the expression of fear?

975
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:06,228
did anybody oppress " fear "?
- Not. There must be a short circuit.

976
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,980
This is what we needed.

977
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,484
Here the control of the mission.
Be prepared for throwing.

978
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,863
Seems that they are going to do it.

979
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,656
Attention, sperm.

980
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,075
Ready.

981
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:22,619
Good, here we go again.

982
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:26,081
do you believe that we go out this time?
- I hope that it should not be another false alarm.

983
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:28,500
Are having problems below,
in engineering.

984
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,252
Say that it was a mental question.

985
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,005
you are treading Me on the tail.

986
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,381
Forgives.

987
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:37,968
Factors of the heart, balanced. We
need more adrenaline.

988
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:41,054
This is the adrenal glands. We
are working very hardly.

989
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,891
Skies, Sydney.
Cannot you wait?

990
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,226
do you want to do it here
in the parking?

991
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:48,604
Do the sign so that the voice
answers affirmatively.

992
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:51,732
Alerts all the systems. We
will try to throw her to ourselves in the car.

993
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,821
rapid! Ears!

994
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:01,492
I have done It in cars,
but in the convertible one never.

995
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:04,453
- Be Prepared for the throwing.
- Brain to sexual organs.

996
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:06,914
- Proceed with the erection.

997
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,707
Go, boys.

998
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:13,462
Do that it is given birth, friends.
All together.

999
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,717
Extract the language.

1000
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:26,183
Here comes the kiss.
Fight!

1001
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:32,981
Activate the center of pleasure.

1002
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,489
can we have an erection, please?
What devils is it happening there below?

1003
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:43,075
Know that they can do it, boys.
Strongly!

1004
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,665
what happens to them?
Do not remain there stop.

1005
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,668
what happens, Sydney?

1006
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,545
Support the hands in the bosoms.

1007
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,505
Yes, gentlem. we are having difficulties
with the respiration.

1008
01:19:56,588 --> 01:19:58,799
we pass Already of the limit.

1009
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:01,885
If the erection is not achieved,
something walks badly.

1010
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,221
Proceed with the erection.
All the systems, forward.

1011
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:08,725
we go, boys! All together! We
have to stop it.

1012
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:11,061
what beams is it spending here?

1013
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:12,563
I need an erection!

1014
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:15,482
Need more help of the brain.

1015
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,110
did you already check if there is some problem
in the stomach?

1016
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:21,405
EI fettuccini
is moving well.

1017
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,700
But here there is a pair of wounds,
due to the veal.

1018
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:27,995
I am not laughing, Sydney.
Indeed.

1019
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,248
Kiss me.

1020
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:34,209
Have an erection of 45 grades.

1021
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:37,254
must we try the penetration?
- Be Prepared for the penetration.

1022
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:43,635
Seems that everything is OK.

1023
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,512
do they know what is on the outside?

1024
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:48,098
what they said to us in the school
of training. An egg.

1025
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:50,601
Am Afraid. I
do not want to go out.

1026
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:53,562
For this was the whole training.

1027
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:56,440
Yes: but who knows
how it will be on the outside?

1028
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:58,358
Dresses the slides
in the classes.

1029
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:02,404
Yes, but one hears strange histories...

1030
01:21:02,488 --> 01:21:05,199
as that of a tablet
that some women take.

1031
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:09,244
Or sometimes the type strikes the head
of his penis against a wall of rubber.

1032
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:11,246
That has no sense.

1033
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,875
or how is if it was
a homosexual meeting?

1034
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,336
