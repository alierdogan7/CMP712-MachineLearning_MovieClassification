Are you sitting quite comfortably?

00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,073
Then I'll begin.

will be on the air at 6:45,

Not to me, but to our producer.

Cheerio! See you next week!

00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,110
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, James. Straight to bed.

-Good night, James. Sleep tight!

It's 9:00 at night
and the dull dudes on the planet

are sitting in their slippers
sipping their sherries,

14
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,316
but the people who love to rock and to roll

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,777
are ready to ride
the rock 'n' roller-coaster once more.

You are listening to Radio Rock and I'm
the Count, and I'm counting on you,

as we count down to ecstasy
and rock all day and all of the night.

-No time at all. There she is.

20
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,380
Where she is?

21
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,049
There she is.

22

-I'm here to see Quentin.
-Come, come.

-Carl?
-Yes.

26
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,621
My favorite godson.

27
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,458
-Have we met before?
-I don't think so.

28
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,962
No. There was a lost decade,
so I always have to check.

29
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,297
-How's your mum?
-She's fine.

30
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,801
Not over-fond of me at the moment.

31
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,887
She's a very attractive woman.

32
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,181
-(CHUCKLES) Well, l. . .
-No, seriously.

33
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,060
I mean, to you, she's your mum,
but to people of my age,

34
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,521
she's a sexual legend.

35
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,731
So. . .

36
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,818
Expelled?

37
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,404
-That's right.
-What for?

38
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,574
I suppose smoking was the clincher.

39
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,576
Drugs or cigarettes?

40
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,287
Well, both.

41
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,164
Well done.

42
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,417
Proud of you.

43
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:58,630
So your mum sent you here in the hope that
a little bracing sea air would sort you out?

44
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,675
-Something like that.
-Spectacular mistake.

45
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,681
But, if you don't drown, we can at least help
you to give up smoking and drug-taking.

46
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,851
I just have and I feel so much better for it.

47

-Cool name.
-Why Thick Kevin?

70
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,537
-I don't. . .
-It's 'cause he's really, really thick.

Why am I queuing up my own records?

82
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,991
While I was swimming,
I passed by a squirrel.

83
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,701
I just broke the knob off the record player.

84
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,621
Let's do it right now. I'm busting for a wee.

85
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,914
A small knob. I like it.

86
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,500
I said, "Mr. Squirrel,
why are you swimming on your back?"

00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,918
Voila!

00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,838

to keep my nuts dry."

I'm on fire! All right, I'm out.

90

You're probably still at school,
it's 20 to 3:00.

91
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,804
Or you might be bunking off,
in which case, good on you.

-Carl?
-Yes.

93

-How you doing?
-Quite good, thank you.

94

-Are you nervous?
-A little bit.

95

-Come over here. Yeah, come over here.
-There?

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,815

CARL: Okay?

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,469
Don't worry, it's not because
I'm actually thick that I'm called Thick Kevin,

106
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,429
it's just a nickname.

107
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,224
That's right. So, who wants to go first?

108
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,684

Was he?

163
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,614
Now, there is one final matter to discuss.

164
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,200
-Pirate radio.
-MAN: Goodness.

165
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,330
-In whose department does this fall?
-That would be me, Prime Minister.

166
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,583
What's the plan, Sir Alistair?
They're very popular.

167
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,252
And they're not actually
breaking any law that we know of.

168
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,422
We're going to shut them down

This was the deal.

I asked all of you to demand of me
to do a very foolish thing,

177

178

But one idea has defeated them all,

185

nothing actually happens.

Well, sir, I think I may have had
a little breakthrough.

469
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,640
The pirate stations only exist
because they sell advertising.

470
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,517
Yes, you can listen to our pop music,

471
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,062
but only if you also buy
Findus Frozen Fish Fingers.

472
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:15,651
Exactly. So what we can do immediately
is make advertising on the stations illegal

473
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,653
for British companies.

474
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,155
We would cut off the boats' cash
with one fell swoop.

475
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,615

483
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,476
-Ouch.
-So, I've had to stir myself

485
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,567

more attractive to new commercial partners.

something terrible happened,

487

and we lost the greatest DJ
pirate radio has ever known to America,

ambition, and alcoholic poisoning.

489
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:13,167
And then something wonderful happened
and we got, in return, from America,

of filling those enormous shoes.

Hello. Can I help you?

696
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,044
Yes, hello. Got a bit lost.

697
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,421
More than a bit.

698
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,174
In order to get here,
you have to open a really quite heavy door

with the words "No Entry" on it.

700
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,721
Well, I didn't see that,
so it must have been left open.

You look suspiciously square
to be a fan of this boat's output.

-No, no, no, I'm a real fan.
-I hope so.

Because if word gets out
that you're here to spy on us,

704
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,610
I think you may have trouble
hanging on to your testicles.

Do you know what, I think I am.

707
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:29,118

and you look like a twat to me.

721
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,759
So, what did you find out?

722

The boat itself is in very bad condition.

or even move, they won't get far.

Bravo, mission accomplished.

726
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,654
So tell me, Twatt, what's the plan?

727
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,826
I think we should work
to get public opinion on our side.

728
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,788
Then, January the 1 st,
we make pirate radio totally illegal

729
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,208
on the grounds that they are endangering
the lives of the brave men and women

730
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,295
of the nation's shipping community,
upon whom the economy

731
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,548
and fish and chip shops
of the country depend.

732
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,676
And if they try to dety the law,
we take them out.

00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,136
Splendid.

734
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:15,516
I think we can call it
the Marine Offenses Act.

The Marine Offenses Act. I like it.

possible place in the world to do that.

-Without the sex.
-My theory is that you're here

812
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:22,781
because it's exactly the right time
for a young man like you

to get to know his dad.

815
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:39,256
I therefore think that your dad
is on this boat.

01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:03,941
-ANGUS: Me neither.
-You know what? He is now one of us.

1191

ANGUS: Yes, he is!

1192
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,821
We would like him

1193
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,365
to stay forever.

1194
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,994
And just to finish off, Kev.

1195
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:19,748
Bless you, rabbits are Easter, not Christmas.

1196
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,751
That's why they call it the Easter Bunny.

1197
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:24,712
Right.

1198
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,424
-I am seriously thick, aren't l?
-ALL: You are.

-Jokes, jokes, jokes!

What is the largest living mammal on Earth?

1203

-I don't know.
-What is the largest living mammal on Earth?

1204
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,691
The blue whale! Weighing over 1 50 tons.

1205

These are facts. These are the fact ones.
They're not jokes.

01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,134
I think you might have a joke.

1208
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,476
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1209
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,895
Yes, it's funny.

1210
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,863
Would you like a mince pie?

1211
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,117
Yes, I would. Thank you.

1212
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:45,250
Shall we have another go at the thing?

-Cracker, sir?
-Yes, the cracker thing.

1214
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:52,216

for one day.

Well, goodbye, Mum.

1218
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:17,449
By the way, our late-night DJ Bob

1219
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:21,203
sent you a message, which is

1220
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,831
"Muddy Waters rocks."

1221
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,919
-Oh, my God. He didn't tell you, did he?
-What?

1222
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,423
-What?
-What do you mean, "What"?

1223
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,174
What do you mean,
"Oh, my God, he didn't tell you."

1224
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,344
-Nothing, darling.
-No, Mum, it's not nothing.

1225
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:39,847
Mum.

1226
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,558
-Really?
-What?

1227
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:45,227
-Please tell me you didn't sleep with him?
-Of course I slept with him.

1228
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,980
Everybody slept with him.
He was absolutely gorgeous in those days.

1229
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:49,982
Hold on a second.
Are we talking about the same Bob?

1230
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:53,819
This is the late-night DJ here?
The beast with the beard?

1231
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,656
Well, he was indeed a beast.
But at that time,

1232
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:01,201
-as far as I can recall, he was clean-shaven.
-When?

1233
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,412
-When did you sleep with Bob?
-For heaven's sake,

1234
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:06,206
will you stop badgering me?
I don't know when.

1235
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,175
How old are you?

1236
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,304
Eighteen-and-a-half.

1237
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:24,391
Well, then it must have been
1 9-and-a-quarter years ago, then.

1238

Give or take.

1239

Anyway, I better go.
That poor man's been waiting forever.

and out of the way, aren't you?

Bye-bye, darling.

I think I've got some pretty big news for you.

01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,435
Cool.

In the House of Commons today,

was passed unanimously.

all pirate radio stations,
including, of course, Radio Rock,

1288
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,264
will be breaking the law.

and indeed everyone who listens to them,

will be in contravention of the new law

1291

-Yeah.

And instead of crushing the thought
the moment it came l. . .

Not wanting to sound rude or anything,

1326
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,519
but don't you think that might be

1327
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:09,439
an ever so slightly monotonous experience
for the listener?

without my comedy,

I intend to stop you doing so.

01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:56,319
As some of you know,
my wife left me after 1 7 hours of marriage,

1337
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,990
but I survived that because I live for music.

1338
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:05,579
And now, with nothing else to live for,
I'm willing to die for it as well.

1339

1340

01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,175
Especially the weather.

I've got nowhere else to go.

1343

Yes, for fun !

-Hey.

Do you think you could ever love a man
with a funky Fu Manchu?

No, I don't.

1393

-I could shave it.
-Still no.

-I hate Scrabble.

1698
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:46,358
-Give me your hand.
-Thank you.

1699
02:02:46,442 --> 02:02:49,069
Thanks very much, very good of you.

1700
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,238
(ALL CHEERING)

1701
02:02:57,453 --> 02:02:59,204
Give me your hand.

1702
02:02:59,997 --> 02:03:02,123
-We've got him !
-Thank you.

1703
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:06,795
Let me look at you. You're gorgeous.

1704
02:03:11,342 --> 02:03:13,968
-Angus!
-Yes! I'm alive!

1705
02:03:14,136 --> 02:03:15,887
WOMAN 3: Simon !

1706
02:03:16,013 --> 02:03:18,515
Come over and we'll have a warm bath !

1707
02:03:20,267 --> 02:03:21,601
Margaret!

1708
02:03:21,769 --> 02:03:24,145
Keep swimming, you're doing really well !

1709
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:26,022
-MARIANNE: Carl !
-Marianne!

1710
02:03:26,107 --> 02:03:27,273
Carl !

1711
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:39,536
It's lovely to meet you.

1712
02:03:40,121 --> 02:03:41,371
Thank you.

1713
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:42,497
I don't know what I would have done

1714
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:46,584
if anything would've happened to you !
I listen to your show every single morning.

1715
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:51,089
-Who are you?
-I love you.

1716
02:03:51,465 --> 02:03:53,508
My name is on your boobies.

1717
02:03:53,634 --> 02:03:55,009
Oh, my God !

1718
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:08,189
Calm down.
There's plenty of Dr. Dave to go around.

1719
02:05:20,095 --> 02:05:21,179
Yeah !

1720
02:05:21,263 --> 02:05:22,514
My man !

1721
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:28,603
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1722
02:05:30,773 --> 02:05:31,856
MAN: Yeah, man !

1723
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:38,863
Rock 'n' roll !

1724
02:05:39,782 --> 02:05:42,033
That's rock 'n' roll, baby!

1725
02:05:42,117 --> 02:05:52,210
Rock 'n' roll !

1726
02:06:14,483 --> 02:06:17,443
(LET'S DANCE PLAYING)

1727
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:08,995
8:00 till 1 1 :00 , Gavin Kavanagh, and it says
here, "Coolest man on the planet."

1728
02:07:09,079 --> 02:07:13,207
And that is, strangely,
in his own handwriting.

1729
02:07:13,334 --> 02:07:15,293
Some people say that
they don't bother listening to it.

1730
02:07:15,377 --> 02:07:19,547
-JOHN: Who says that?
-Well, Dave said that he didn't really like it.

1731
02:07:21,884 --> 02:07:23,551
And he did that.

1732
02:07:24,386 --> 02:07:26,721
-Yeah.
-Actually, from out there they glint

1733
02:07:26,847 --> 02:07:29,390
and make you look sort of satanic.

1734
02:07:31,393 --> 02:07:32,518
-See you later, John.
-Okay.

1735
02:07:32,603 --> 02:07:36,230
So, Dr. Arthur Sea Measure.
That's an interesting name.

1736
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:38,483
Do you mind if I just call you
Doctor For Short?

1737
02:07:38,567 --> 02:07:40,276
(IN CHARACTER'S VOICE) Yes, that's fine.

1738
02:07:40,569 --> 02:07:43,279
Good. So, Doctor For Short,
tell us, oceanographer. . .

1739
02:07:43,405 --> 02:07:48,034
Dr. Dave. Not quite so nutty,
but good for your medical requirements.

1740
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:49,619
(EXCLAIMS)

1741
02:07:49,745 --> 02:07:54,082
It does not surprise me that you are single.

1742
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:57,877
Yesterday's anti-war demonstrations
in Bolton. . .

1743
02:07:59,129 --> 02:08:02,965
-Today will be mainly wet. Hey. . .
-I'm trying not to. . .

1744
02:08:03,258 --> 02:08:05,426
-I didn't mean what I said.
-You didn't?

1745
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:09,639
No, I think you're a good guy
and you're a good egg, you know?

1746
02:08:10,432 --> 02:08:11,641
Thanks.

1747
02:08:13,602 --> 02:08:15,103
What a prick.

1748
02:08:18,148 --> 02:08:20,441
It's a shame you're a lezzer.

1749
02:08:21,652 --> 02:08:23,528
I would be nuts deep.

1750
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:34,288
I'm gonna talk into the microphone of love.

1751
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:40,712
And that was Spirit from their first album
entitled, not surprisingly, Spirit.

1752
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,839
He's doing it. He's doing it!

1753
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:46,134
You can't see this,
but he has just clicked on this record

1754
02:08:46,218 --> 02:08:48,970
with the right boot of his Cuban heel.

1755
02:08:54,017 --> 02:08:55,393
Very nice.

1756
02:08:57,229 --> 02:08:59,647
That's how you do it, isn't it?

1757
02:14:56,004 --> 02:14:57,338
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

1758
02:15:01,593 --> 02:15:03,594
Cheers, H. What's next?
