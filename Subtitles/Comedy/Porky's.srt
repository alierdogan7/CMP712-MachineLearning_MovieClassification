Patience, my boy.

You call her a dog?

219
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,533
Fred, that's angel food cake.

220
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,034
You touch her...

221
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,527
the food and drug administration

But did you see the way

00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,595
Right, Pee Wee.

234
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:58,535
TOMMY: Boy, Miss Balbricker...

235
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,505

Coach, would you kindly...

Beg your pardon?

239
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:10,540
The basketballs.

240
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,482
Would you kindly keep them
in your court?

241
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,382

00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,887

253
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:42,743
You aren't even allowed...

255
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,177
Little dip.

257
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,427
TlM:
Why do we gotta invite a Jew?

258
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,019
All we need now
is a communist and a spic...

259
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,927
and we'd have the whole thing.

260
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,459

262
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:06,963
TlM: Broads are broads.

263
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,200
l just don't see
why we gotta invite a kite.

264
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,707
BlLLY: Brian's a good guy.

265
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,369
He's only been here
a couple months.

266
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,672
Why don't you
give him a chance?

267
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,372
TlM: He's a jerk,
and a Jew jerk at that.

268
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,881
BlLLY:
All right! We won't ask him.

269
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,476

but l've got him now...

1376
01:07:59,237 --> 01:08:03,139
and l'm not going to let him
slip through my fingers again.

1377
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:06,837
Now, all l'm asking
is that you give me...

1378
01:08:06,878 --> 01:08:10,644
five boys for a few minutes.

1379
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:12,547

1380
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:14,017

1381

you see fit to choose.

1382
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:18,922

1383
01:08:18,957 --> 01:08:20,447
And we...

1384
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,555
can put a stop to this menace.

1385
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:27,030
And it is a menace.

1386
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:32,429
Well?

1387
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,768
What are you gonna do about it?

1388
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:42,935
MR. CARTER:
Five young boys in the nude?

1389
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,142
A police lineup...

1390
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:48,152
so that you can identify...

1391
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:49,813
his tallywacker?

1392
01:08:49,854 --> 01:08:51,151
Please, please.

1393
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:54,317
Can we call it a tallywacker?

1394
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:58,090
Penis is so person--uh...

1395
01:08:58,129 --> 01:08:59,426
Penis is so personal.

1396
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:03,659
BALBRlCKER: We can put hoods
over their heads...

1397
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:04,668
MR. CARTER: Hoods?

1398
01:09:04,702 --> 01:09:06,397
BALBRlCKER:
to avoid embarrassment.

1399
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:07,904
Now, listen.

1400
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:10,908
We have got to do it...

1401
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:15,208
as distasteful as it is.

1402

1403
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:20,444

1405
01:09:24,222 --> 01:09:25,849

1406
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:29,792
And that mole is the key to it!

1407
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:30,919
MR. CARTER: Miss Balbricker...

1408
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:34,261
do you realize the difficulty
of your request?

1409
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,732
Now, l would be very happy...

1410
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:38,930
to apprehend
the young man myself.

1411
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:39,959
But can you imagine...

1412
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:41,835
what the board
of education would say...

1413
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:43,704
if you were granted a lineup...

1414
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:48,075

their private paaa--paa--paa--

1415

1419
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:58,415

1420
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:03,387
BALBRlCKER: But Mr. Carter...

1421
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:04,918

a way out of this.

1423
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:11,669
We, uh, call the police...

1424
01:10:11,703 --> 01:10:14,695

one of their sketch artists--

1425
01:10:18,443 --> 01:10:21,708
and Miss Balbricker
can give a description.

1426
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:30,882
We can put up wanted posters
all over school.

1427
