1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,629
Yeah?

2
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,990
(Barry) No, sit properly
like you’re gonna mean it,

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,519
like you mean it.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,868
No, Waj, don’t muck about.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,433
Cos the battery’s gonna go. Sit...

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,152
Who’s mucking about, Barry?
I’m not mucking about.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,429
Well, you can’t sit like that.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,709
What’s wrong
with how he’s sitting, Barry?

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,319
(Barry) Come and have a look. It’s wrong.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,668
There’s nothing wrong with it.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,597
- (Barry) Not you!
- (Waj) Show me.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,280
(Barry) No!
Right, what are you looking at?

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,674
There’s nothing there.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,870
No, there’s nothing there.
Go and sit down.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,798
- You can’t see yourself, you mug!
- (Waj) I thought you were recording it.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,399
(Barry) Right, sit, sit.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,397
- Faisal, go away.
- I’m ready, I’m ready.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,988
- (Barry) All right.
- Waj, just relax your face.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,873
Focus on what you’re going to say.
Get on with it.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,956
- Go, before the battery goes.
- (Omar) One, two...

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,479
Three... action!

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,909
Ey up,
you unbelieving kuffar bastards.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,429
- I’m gonna turn you baked beans...
- (Barry) No, no, no.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,276
- What?
- What’s with the gun?

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,798
- Proper replica, man.
- What for? Action Man?

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,592
Replica AK-47.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,995
- It’s too small, man.
- Not too small, brother.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,352
- My hands.
- Waj...

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,879
Big hands.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,479
He can’t do it with that gun.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,636
Shut up, Barry.
Try it without, our kid, and let’s go.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,829
It’s too small, believe me.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,712
I’ll hold it near the camera.
That’ll bigger it.

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,990
- That’ll what?
- That’ll bigger it.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,873
<i>- (Waj) Yeah.
- (Omar) Go now.</i>

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,877
<i>Ey up, you unbelieving kuffar bastards.</i>

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,072
<i>(Barry) No, no, no!
This is absolutely stupid.</i>

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,554
These are the outtakes.
You know, the bloopers.

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,231
<i>- He looks good.
- (Omar) Today is a wake-up call.</i>

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,033
<i>Today is an opportunity
for you to look in the mirror</i>

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,516
<i>at western imperialist culture.</i>

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,710
<i>Superficial materialism</i>

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,230
<i>ends at the capitalist church
of McDonald's.</i>

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,828
<i>Flipping idiots.</i>

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,236
<i>It's as though you just had a Big Mac,
completely oblivious to the amount...</i>

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,158
<i>Complete flipping idiots.</i>

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,556
<i>You could've gone Chicken Cottage,
proper halal,</i>

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,636
<i>bargain bucket £6.99.</i>

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,513
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I'm taking about Chicken Cottage.</i>

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,189
- There’s one where he doesn’t say that.
- Your bit’s good, Dad.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,109
<i>(Barry) Take the box off.</i>

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,310
<i>I can’t show my face
cos it's an image.</i>

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,589
<i>And images aren't allowed.</i>

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,869
You know what? They’re all bloopers.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,638
<i>(Barry) Take the box off.</i>

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,433
What am I going to do
if he does that at the camp?

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,357
Is Uncle Faisal ready to go to Pakistan?

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,950
<i>(Barry) You can't do your jihadi video
with a box on your head.</i>

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,035
No way.

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,672
Ran 23K on the weekend.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,472
6K Saturday morning.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,116
Had a light lunch:
Snack -a-Jacks and a medium apple.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,755
5K in the afternoon,
cos obviously it was after lunch, so...

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,511
Same again Sunday.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,636
Although in the afternoon
I only did 4K cos I d had a roast.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,399
Would've gone further, you know,
but I started to run a bit lopsided.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,717
I’m not slagging my right leg off,
but my left leg is definitely stronger.

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,998
I think lefty just wants it more, you know.

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,031
Right leg’s bone idle.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,628
He’ll just wait there,
let lefty pick up the slack.

71
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,955
Before you know it,
you’re running in curves.

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,640
I’m going to have
to put my foot down, you know.

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,594
Really show him who’s boss. Yeah.
Know what I mean?

74
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,995
You do know you can talk to your legs,
don’t you?

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,076
- I need tomorrow off.
- What?

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,919
I need tomorrow off,
and the two weeks after that.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,998
Jesus, I thought you were serious
about this job, Omar.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,111
I’ve got to go to a wedding in Pakistan.

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,152
You’ve got to ask yourself
where you’ll be in five years time.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,909
- It’s an emergency.
- What, an emergency wedding?

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,076
Like a shotgun wedding?

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,316
Like a shotgun wedding, yeah.

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,634
Right.

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,956
Well, I’ll have a look at the rota.

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,478
(Barry) The Feds can track your phone
even if the battery’s out.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,388
- (Faisal) Really?
- Really. They can see you underground.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,431
(Waj) Can they see you if you’re not there?

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,232
(Barry) Where’s there?

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,759
(Waj) I don’t know.

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,313
They can see you everywhere, Waj.

91
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,998
(Faisal) Are they looking at us
through cameras?

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,554
- Space cameras, yes.
- But...

93
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,438
My dad says I’m not supposed
to be on camera. It’s haram.

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,711
With the greatest of respect, Faisal,
your dad eats newspaper.

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,434
- Not any more. He eats moths.
- Exactly, bro.

96
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,870
Look, the way to stop the Feds
tracking you is very simple.

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,755
You eat your SIM card.
Get your SIM cards out.

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,190
You remove the SIM card and...
Yes?

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,711
- Can I cook mine?
- No. You must eat it raw, like this.

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,272
Good boys.

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,556
Salaam, lads.

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,318
Walaykum asalaam.

103
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,670
- Right.
- We’re eating our SIM cards.

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,472
Anti-surveillance.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,238
You know they still work
inside you, Barry.

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,191
- Eh?
- They can still track them inside you.

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,117
That’s not going to be
very helpful in Pakistan.

108
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,513
- What?
- In Pakistan.

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,073
Answered the call, bro.

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,474
- What call?
- Training camp.

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,598
We’re upgrading.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,914
We’re going.

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,315
Why did you get the call?
Why didn’t I get the call?

114
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,556
You don’t have an uncle in Pakistan
last time I checked.

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,069
You got an uncle in Folkstone.
Are there any training camps in Folkstone?

116
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,668
Why do we need a training camp, anyway?
We’re primed.

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,439
We don’t need some tramp up a mountain,
telling us to set a fuse.

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,552
We don’t need some Paki Steptoe
telling us when to go.

119
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,079
You’re right, Barry.
We can go whenever we want.

120
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,679
Exactly. Whenever we want, bro.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,190
Yeah, if you want to be some kind of
sad loner trenchcoat mafia twazzock.

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,309
What do you mean?

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,035
What I mean is, you can either be
a stupid nutter Muslim

124
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,038
who blows a bag full of nails
into his own guts at a toilet at TGI s,

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,472
or you can be a proper soldier
in the Mujahideen.

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,239
- I’m already in the Mujahideen.
- No, you’re not, bro.

127
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,237
No, not until you join the army

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,793
and hold the sword

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,480
and touch the sky -
proper chain of command,

130
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,670
right to the very top.

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,154
- All right, I’m coming.
- Oh, you want Paki Steptoe now?

132
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,316
Listen, I am the most Al Qaeda one here.

133
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,192
Think of the group.
Think of what we’re trying to do.

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,515
It’s best you stay here, bro.

135
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,596
You’re a liability
and you’re a loose cannon.

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,358
Bollocks, I’m a liability.

137
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,799
I am the invisible Jihadi.

138
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,239
They seek him here,
they seek him there.

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
But he’s not there,
he’s blowing up your slag sister.

140
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,519
- Invisible?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,518
Like the time you got on the local news
for baking a Twin Towers cake

142
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,551
and leaving it at the synagogue on 9/11?

143
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,874
That is part of the plan.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,230
Hide in plain sight, you mug.

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,191
And I am coming!

146
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,790
You realise, if I don’t come
with you to Pakistan, bro,

147
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,114
Islam is finished.

148
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,754
Listen, bro, we need you over here
to keep a lid on things.

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,472
So what if I’m not here?

150
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,876
Cos I’ve bought a ticket at the airport
to come with you anyways.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,149
You want to come, Fess?

152
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,795
Yeah, it’s just... my dad s
seeing creatures that’s not there.

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,797
- So he’ll keep it ticking over here, bro.
- Barry, listen.

154
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,831
- If you answer this question, you can come.
- All right.

155
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,318
(Speaks Urdu)

156
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,758
- Don’t fuck with me, man!
- (Speaks Urdu)

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,678
Don’t fuck with Azzam al Britani!

158
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,551
(Omar) Barry, what are you doing?

159
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,398
Barry, this is crazy.

160
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,638
- Barry, what are you doing?
- Right, if I’m not going, no one is.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,794
Spit it out.

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,879
(Waj) It’s gone down his neck.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,876
Right, frog him.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,275
- Frog him in the back.
- Omar, we agreed, no frogging.

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,153
That was before you swallowed the key.
Every time I’ve had to frog you.

166
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,271
- (Barry) Listen, we...
- (Waj) Come on. Come on.

167
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,269
We said no frogging!

168
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,115
What if you get caught?
I’m not going down.

169
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,356
Just cos you can’t take
a drill in the kneecap.

170
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,311
They’ll crack you like babies fingers.

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,874
They’ll pump you full of Viagra,
make you fuck a dog.

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,793
(Waj) Good prattle, Barry.

173
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,839
(Grunts)

174
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,558
(Engine starts)

175
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,114
You’ll end up on YouTube,
blowing Lassie in a ditch.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,513
(Engine revs)

177
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,991
(Tyres screech)

178
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,759
Are they gonna make me fuck
a dog out there, brother Omar?

179
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,915
My uncle’s connected out there.

180
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,553
Only time we’re going to see cops
is for weapons upgrade.

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,274
All right, Omar,
I’m letting you go to Pakistan.

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,470
My unit stays here.

183
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,909
- But my unit’s the main unit.
- Barry, shut up, mate.

184
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,952
Because I tell you, your little brain cell
might go off now and again,

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,479
but if your hands even go to move

186
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,397
and you try setting up
the Islamic state of Tinsley again,

187
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,317
going to university lectures,
opening your big mouth,

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,590
buying some more silver nitrate
from Amazon,

189
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,709
I’m gonna rip your plugs out.

190
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,114
Not if you’re not here, you won t.

191
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,468
Aargh!

192
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,910
No, Uncle.

193
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,599
It’s my prayer bear.
He does my prayers.

194
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,949
<i>(Electronic voice praying)</i>

195
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,593
<i>In the name of Allah...</i>

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,110
Which way are we going?

197
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,274
All right. OK.

198
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,039
What the fuck’s he done
to his rabbits, bro?

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,076
They’re not rabbits, bro.
They’re chickens.

200
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,236
They’re fucking rabbits.

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,918
Bro, if they’re rabbits,
where are their ears?

202
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,559
That’s what I’m saying.

203
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,470
(Speaks Punjabi, then Arabic)

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,274
What?

205
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,309
(Waj) What’s he saying?

206
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,192
I’m asking, would he kill you?

207
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,669
Pack up.

208
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,998
If you make me trouble...

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,513
(Waj) Alaykum salaam.

210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,639
- Would you kill me, then?
- No, course not.

211
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,398
Come on.

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,719
I d kill you, bro.

213
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,749
Would you?

214
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,429
- Yeah.
- Right, good.

215
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,509
Cos I would kill you, bro.

216
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,309
Bro, seriously, I d kill you.

217
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,839
Course I would.

218
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,757
Aye, I would. I d kill you like that.

219
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,598
- Flipping heck, man. Would you?
- Yeah, course.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,070
I sort of thought
I were joking a bit there, bro.

221
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,350
We’re soldiers, bro.
Whatever’s asked, you do it.

222
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,232
You do the right thing.

223
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,349
Right?

224
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,436
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

225
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,597
It’s life, isn’t it? It’s just life.
What is that? It’s nothing.

226
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,109
It’s like being stuck
in the queue at Alton Towers.

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,629
Do you want to be in the queues
or do you want to be on the rides?

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,116
You want to be on the rides, don’t you?
You want to be on Nemesis, Oblivion.

229
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,753
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

230
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,592
- Yeah. You with me?
- Yeah.

231
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,393
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids.
- Yeah, Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

232
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,839
Right?

233
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,916
- OK, I would kill you, brother Omar.
- Would you?

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,712
- Yeah, I would.
- What would you do?

235
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,155
- I d smash your head off with a thing.
- Yeah. Know what I d do?

236
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,590
I d grab one of these hooks, Waj.
I d dig it in your belly, rip your guts out.

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,836
Spill it all out on the floor,
like Mortal Combat.

238
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,996
I d fucking... I d take this, right?

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,190
- Yeah?
- And I d fucking run you over with a tractor.

240
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,390
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Soldiers.

241
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,953
Soldiers, brother. Mujahid.

242
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,195
Mujahid.

243
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,958
(Chickens cluck)

244
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,513
Good lad.

245
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,993
Come on. You want some?

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,838
Yeah, you do want some, rabbit.

247
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,951
You fucked-up rabbit with no ears.

248
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,275
- I’ll fucking... I’ll have you.
- They’re chickens, man.

249
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,868
- I d roast you.
- Waj, they’re chickens.

250
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,513
(Music on radio)

251
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,559
(Music stops)

252
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,428
(Waj) I’m coming. Coming.

253
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,232
I’m coming.

254
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,752
- Come on, Waj.
- (Speaking in Arabic)

255
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,758
(Speaks Arabic)

256
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,152
Fuck off, bro. East is that way.

257
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,354
- That way is East, bro.
- (Replies in Urdu)

258
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,595
That way is East.

259
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,517
- We’ve flown over Mecca now.
- Paki’s gone mental, bro.

260
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,995
Mecca is in the East, yeah.

261
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,829
Where the sun... where it rises,
you behn choad paki prong!

262
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,959
(Omar) Turn around. I’ll explain to you later.

263
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,031
(Omar) Fuck! Waj, come on. Come on!

264
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,153
(Omar) Go, go, go. Come on.

265
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,554
- Come on, Waj.
- OK, OK.

266
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,710
(Drone of aircraft)

267
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,551
Hey, brother Emir, I’ll take it out.

268
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,749
(Speaks Arabic)

269
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,279
Too high, too high.

270
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,551
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking actually.
What is that, 2,000 feet?

271
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,358
- What?
- Nothing.

272
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,835
I’ve never stood up in public and
professed any in-depth knowledge of Islam,

273
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,192
but what I do know is that most British
Muslims don’t want to be out abroad,

274
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,311
fighting British foreign policy.

275
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,319
What they want to do is get on
peacefully with their daily lives.

276
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,953
- And we support that.
- (Barry) Yeah, yeah.

277
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,355
A good Muslim
always keeps his mouth shut.

278
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,792
Yeah? Yeah? Are you all surprised
kids are going off to training camps?

279
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,753
- That is not what I am saying.
- Why are kids going to training camps?

280
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,474
First off, I object
to the term 'training camps '.

281
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,909
- You just used it.
- No, I did not.

282
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,871
It’s a western fantasy.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
You people think of Muslims
running around the mountains

284
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,715
with guns and bombs.

285
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,910
That d suit you
down to the ground, wouldn’t it?

286
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,396
- But they do exist, don’t they?
- I’m not saying they don’t exist.

287
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,919
What I’m saying, if you’ll listen,

288
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,112
is that if they didn’t exist,
you people would have to invent them.

289
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,435
- (Storge) That’s absolute rubbish.
- Yeah, man.

290
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,235
- This whole debate is twisted, man.
- We’ll take questions later, please.

291
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,237
You think we’re all bombers, don’t you?

292
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,112
- That is absolutely...
- No, no, no.

293
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,834
When you look at someone like me,
you think 'bomber ', right?

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,076
- Yeah, you do.
- That is not the case.

295
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,838
Why shouldn’t I be a bomber
if you treat me like one?

296
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,350
- Mashallah, brother.
- Yeah, Mashallah.

297
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,872
Yeah.

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,036
<i>(Raps) I'm the Mujahideen
and I'm making a scene</i>

299
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,196
<i>Now you's gonna feel
what the boom-boom means</i>

300
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,880
<i>It's like Tupac said,

you 're just smashed tomatoes</i>

302
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,554
- Allahu Akbar!
- (Audience screams)

303
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,789
Mashallah, brother.

304
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,512
(Murmurs from the audience)

305
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,755
Oh, what, man? Come on.

306
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,758
<i>What? Just cos I’m Muslim,
you thought it was real?</i>

307
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,599
- (Shouts from audience)
- (Barry) Oh, here they come!

308
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,712
Here come your stooges, Mr. Storge.

309
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,229
Police state! Police state!

310
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,272
- Police state! Police state!
- (Applause)

311
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,915
Remember my name, brothers and sisters.
I’m going to Cuba!

312
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,192
He’s being rendered!
He’s being rendered!

313
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,152
(Barry) Hey, bro, bro. Down here.

314
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,909
Need a lift?

315
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,834
Yeah, man. Wait. Yeah.

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,838
Oh, man!

317
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,756
Yo!

318
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,553
You’re a lege. You’re a lege, bro!

319
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,796
Not so bad yourself, brother.
What’s your name?

320
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,514
Hassan Malik. 'The Mal '.

321
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,278
- The Mal?
- Yeah.

322
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,960
Nice little stunt back there.

323
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,798
And you know what?

324
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,797
You’re a total piece of shit, mate.

325
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,428
You’re worse than the specially trained
rapists they use in Guantánamo.

326
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,028
- You what?
- Yeah, you’re not ignorant like them!

327
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,196
You know you should be doing something.

328
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,311
- I am doing something.
- What, that?

329
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,989
<i>I'm the Mujahideen and...
thingy, thingy, rap, rap</i>

330
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,109
Eh?

331
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,590
It was jihad of the mind,
the gesture that messed yer.

332
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,109
<i>Was the prophet, Sal Allaahu
Alayhi wa Sallam, about gestures?</i>

333
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,152
Hm? Did he smash the pagan statues

334
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,032
or did he just stand there,
making a gesture?

335
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,832
(Engine starts)

336
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,916
Is this a gesture?

337
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,389
- That was for real, brother.
- Yeah...

338
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,193
Is you as for real as that?

339
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,959
- Yeah.
- How often do you go to mosque?

340
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,550
When I can. Most weeks. Friday prayers.

341
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,117
Once a year is too often.
The mosques have lost it, brother.

342
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,391
They’re full of losers and spies.

343
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,351
These are real bad times, bro.

344
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,835
Islam is cracking up.

345
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,951
We got women talking back.

346
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,356
We got people playing stringed instruments.

347
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,552
It’s the end of days.

348
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,511
Do you want to be for real?

349
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,117
Well, yeah, of course.

350
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,151
Are you sure?

351
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,474
100 percent.

352
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,318
Yeah, come here.

353
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,593
Fuck you, Omar!

354
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,193
(Gunfire)

355
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,151
Big enough for you now, Barry?

356
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,477
Am I blowing a dog in a ditch
or am I Paki Rambo?

357
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,670
(Speaks Arabic)

358
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,155
I’m getting my pictures, Mujahid-style.

359
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,279
- James Fuck Bond?
- No, no.

360
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,469
What the fuck are you doing, Waj?

361
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,318
(Speaks Arabic)

362
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,957
(Continues in Arabic)

363
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,237
(Shouting in Arabic)

364
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,029
Stay here and clean the guns.

365
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,038
No, no, listen. We need an Al Qaeda emir.

366
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,272
It was my fault, bro, OK?
Let Omar go.

367
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,795
You fucking Mr. Beans.

368
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,798
- But we haven’t got an emir yet.
- It’s good.

369
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,031
- Just getting my pictures, bro.
- Waj, go away right now.

370
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,109
Come on.

371
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,798
- Where is it?
- Down here.

372
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,709
(Barry) Whoa, whoa, whoa!

373
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,028
Liquid peroxide.

374
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,957
Three years of stockpiling.

375
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,038
- Where did you get it all?
- A wholesale shop down the road.

376
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,752
- All from the same shop?
- Yeah.

377
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,314
- You mug, you’ll get us nicked!
- No.

378
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,237
I use different voices every time I go in.

379
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,557
Different what? Different voices.
Show me.

380
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,671
- What?
- Show me the voices. Come on.

381
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,435
- One of them s... It’s my voice.
- Right.

382
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,839
Can I have 12 bottles of bleach, please?

383
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,076
I know what that sounds like.
Give me another one.

384
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,078
IRA voice.

385
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,997
IRA voice?

386
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,235
They’re terrorists, Faisal.

387
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,749
Why do you want to do a terrorist voice?
You’ll get us nicked!

388
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,678
- I’ll be disguised then, won’t I?
- Yeah, but as a terrorist.

389
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,949
Let’s hear the voice.

390
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,756
(Normal voice) Can I have...
12 bottles of bleach, please?

391
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,551
And then I’ve got one like this as well.

392
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,952
(Same voice)
Can I have 12 bottles of bleach, please?

393
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,195
What’s that?

394
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,075
It’s a woman’s voice
because I got loads of liquid peroxide.

395
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,077
Probably thought that she d go and...

396
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,428
(Barry) And what?

397
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,552
...dye her hair or something.
- And her beard?

398
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,148
- You got a beard.
- I covered it.

399
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,591
You covered your beard. How?

400
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,872
Right, so you went into a shop,
with your hands on your face like that

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,672
and asked for 12 bottles of bleach?

402
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,120
So, why has she got her hands
on her face, Fess?

403
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,679
Cos she’s got a beard.

404
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,153
I’m sorry, brother Omar.

405
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,316
Maybe it were God’s will.

406
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,874
Maybe it were God’s will
I would do my video so...

407
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,635
- So maybe it’s not my fault.
- No, it is your fault.

408
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,673
It were God’s will that you were acting
like a complete prat, apparently.

409
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,677
It was defo your fault.

410
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,555
So, if that were God’s will,
then am I God’s fault?

411
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,035
Maybe I’m God’s mistake.

412
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,118
- Does that mean I’m going to hell, brother?
- Sh, sh, sh.

413
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,753
- Do mistakes go to hell?
- Shh, Waj.

414
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,869
What?

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,839
- That’s a drone.
- Hide!

416
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,151
- It’s flying low. It’s going to attack.
- Let’s go!

417
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,157
Where are we gonna go, Waj?
We’ve got to take it out.

418
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,236
Take it out with what?
We ain’t got no bullets.

419
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,432
- This is my mistake, bro.
- No, no, no. Waj, listen.

420
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,599
Think about it. This is God’s plan.
He’s put us here to defend the camp.

421
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,073
This is our jihad.

422
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,270
- Think about it.
- This is my mistake, brother.

423
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,595
That’s the devil that’s in your brain
giving it the wasa-wasa.

424
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,870
Don’t listen to him.
God’s in your heart, bro.

425
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,309
Right? What does your heart say?
Trust me. Come on.

426
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,149
It says maybe we should...

427
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,793
Huh?

428
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,514
Maybe we should flipping pop it, brother,
get back on jihad.

429
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,517
Good, Waj.

430
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,309
(Omar) Right, OK.

431
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,033
What are we going to use?

432
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,754
<i>- Fucking yes, bro.
- Shh, shh. Right, come on.</i>

433
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,279
- Proper Mujahid, yeah?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,197
- Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother?
- Mind out the way now.

435
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,548
- All right, OK.
- Come on.

436
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,148
- Flipping pop it, brother.
- OK.

437
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,876
Brother Omar!

438
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,309
The Arabs!

439
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,670
The emir!

440
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,279
(Explosion)

441
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,313
Flipping shit.

442
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,995
Is this God’s will, bro?

443
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,396
- (Shouting)
- Tell me it is, bro. Tell me it’s God’s will.

444
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,556
- (Explosion)
- Fucking hell, bro.

445
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,115
We’ve got to go, Waj.
We’ve got to get out of here.

446
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,837
I can’t hear nothing!

447
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,717
(Waj) I can’t hear nothing!

448
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,475
Morning, officer.

449
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,352
You’ve been rumbled.

450
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,993
My plan is, right, to put a bomb on a crow

451
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,795
and fly it into one of them towers
full of Jews and slags.

452
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,673
I keep crows in here. Have a look.

453
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,109
We’re way beyond crows now, Faisal.

454
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,117
We are really going to blow the lid off.

455
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,276
Yeah, I’m all about blowing the lid off, man.

456
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,308
<i>- Blow my lid off.
- Bomb the mosque!</i>

457
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,714
What?

458
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,516
- The Masjid?
- Yeah, the masjid, the mosque.

459
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,959
But we go in dressed like kuffars.

460
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,039
They think it’s the unbelievers attacking
so all the Muslims rise up and fight back.

461
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,914
Stoke things up proper big time,
fast-track the final days - total war!

462
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,113
<i>- That is sick, man.
- What does Omar say?</i>

463
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,878
(Hassan) Who is this Omar?

464
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,195
Don’t sweat that.
He’s one of my boys.

465
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,276
I’ve sent him off to training camp
to bring him up to scratch.

466
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,551
But my dad goes to the masjid.
What if he’s in masjid?

467
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,671
Has your dad ever bought
a Jaffa orange?

468
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,549
Once or twice.

469
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,319
Right, he’s buying nukes for Israel, bro.
He’s a Jew.

470
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,839
- (Waj) Barry!
- (Omar) Where?

471
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,269
- Where is he?
- What are we going to say, again?

472
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,109
Waj, we’re going to say we’re being
sent for special training in Somalia.

473
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,913
- Somalia?
- Yeah, OK.

474
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,308
- You all right, Barry?
- Yeah. What happened?

475
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,157
Nothing happened.
We’re being sent to...

476
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,273
Bollocks!
You fucked up, you fucking losers!

477
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,958
I told you, you should have taken me.

478
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,469
- We’re going to Somibia, Barry.
- Somalia.

479
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,955
- Special training.
- (Mocks Waj) 'Special training. '

480
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,959
- Bollocks! Something happened.
- Nothing happened, Barry.

481
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,753
Look at the state of you.
No luggage, back early.

482
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,108
Yeah, something happened.

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,232
- Yeah, something did happen.
- Yeah, you fucked up.

484
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,511
No, we got an emir
and he told us that we’re on.

485
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,629
What?

486
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,189
We’ve got an emir
and he says that we’re on.

487
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,869
- Are you on as well, bro?
- Yeah, for real.

488
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,399
- Good.
- Alhamdulillah.

489
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,039
What about the Arabs, bro?
What about the Arabs?

490
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,438
They weren’t Arabs,
they were bad tribesmen.

491
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,074
- What?
- Bad tribesmen.

492
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,031
- So it were good, what we did?
- Yeah.

493
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,510
What the fuck is Special Branch doing here?

494
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,232
Oh, no, no, no.
That’s Hassan. He’s in.

495
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,828
- Since when, Barry?
- He’s one of us.

496
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,633
- Is he fuck?
- (Hassan) How was it? Was it amazing?

497
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,351
What, my dad’s funeral?
How could that be amazing?

498
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,954
You’re joking!

499
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,038
He was pecked to death by chickens.
Why would I joke about that?

500
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,075
Ignore him, bro. This is Omar,
this is Waj and this is Hassan Malik.

501
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,713
Yeah, man, I’m the Mal.

502
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,229
Frog him.

503
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,954
No, don’t sweat it, bro.
He’s been tested.

504
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,399
- Really?
- Yeah, he tested me, man.

505
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,158
How did he do that, then?

506
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,477
- He made me do that bean thing, man.
- What bean thing?

507
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,714
You know, when you put a bean
up the end of your knob, man.

508
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,676
We’re on the parking. Let’s go.

509
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,597
- Barry?
- We’re on the parking.

510
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,154
- What’s he saying about a bean, Barry?
- You mean, I didn’t have to?

511
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,316
Bro, he’s landed you right in it.

512
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,989
I’ve got no need for a beanfucker
or a TV Paki or a coconut spook.

513
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,109
Now, frog him!

514
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,037
Omar, he’s loaded. His dad’s loaded.

515
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,833
- What, from Ml5 payroll?
- No, he’s got a clothes factory.

516
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,315
- Great. Merry Christmas. Frog him.
- I can get you a van.

517
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,591
- I can nick a van.
- So you d steal from your own dad?

518
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,031
Well, yeah, yeah.

519
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,515
Right, well, you’re still walking.

520
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,871
Listen, behn choad, next time I see you,
you d better have a fucking van,

521
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,877
or I’m gonna floss your balls
with razor wire.

522
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,075
You played that wrong, mate.

523
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,358
- You’re on one, Omar.
- Drive!

524
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,348
(Car won’t start)

525
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,630
- Did you fix this, Barry?
- Yeah, I fixed it.

526
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,877
- Did you do it yourself or something?
- Yes, I did it myself.

527
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,631
(Engine judders)

528
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,239
(Barry) So is he in or what, Omar?

529
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,796
What choice have I got, Barry?
He’s either in or I’ve got to kill him.

530
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,559
(Barry) Good. I knew you d like him.

531
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,312
Simba and Pumbaa were out on their own.

532
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,274
And Scar was looking for them and
if he found them, he d kill them, but...

533
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,469
- Dad?
- Yeah?

534
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,431
Did you blow up any kuffars?

535
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,039
What?

536
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,513
At the wedding?

537
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,393
Do you want to hear
what happened to Simba or not?

538
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,954
- Yeah!
- Right, so...

539
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,595
Simba and Pumbaa
were out on their own,

540
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,109
when all of a sudden they saw this...

541
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,794
...this big evil bird, this big bird,
that Scar had sent out to look for them.

542
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,629
This big, evil vulture, coming right at them.

543
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,830
'There it is, ' said Simba.
He spotted it,

544
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,349
this big evil vulture,
coming straight for them,

545
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,913
coming right at them.

546
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,915
Then what, Dad?

547
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,918
Well, Simba had to bring it down,
otherwise it d kill them.

548
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,838
So, what he did was,
he grabbed a stone

549
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,793
and he chucked it at the bird,
only he chucked it so hard,

550
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,595
it was such a strong powerful throw,
that his arm went all the way round.

551
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,951
Behind. He threw it so hard,
it went a mile behind him.

552
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,672
And it hit Mufasa.

553
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,473
Wise, strong Mufasa, Simba’s dad.

554
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,160
It hit him accidentally on the head
and killed him.

555
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,635
But didn’t Scar kill Mufasa?

556
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,593
Yeah, in the film.
This is real life, I’m talking about.

557
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,392
So Simba had a choice.

558
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,556
He could either tell his friends
what had happened and create confusion,

559
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,719
or keep it a secret and lead all his friends
in a big fight against Scar.

560
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,637
What do you think he did?

561
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,352
He had to tell the truth.

562
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,115
But he’s got to fight Scar, hasn’t he?

563
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,959
Telling the truth means giving up.

564
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,308
Would Simba give up?

565
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,431
- Simba would never give up.
- Exactly.

566
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,719
Exactly. So...

567
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,548
Simba kept it all a secret.

568
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,589
And he led Pumbaa and Timon
and all his friends,

569
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,474
he led them all in a fight against Scar.

570
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,192
And he vanquished Scar,

571
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,436
and Simba became the new Lion King.

572
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,396
- Yes.
- Yeah.

573
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,313
Bedtime for you,

574
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,839
soldier.

575
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,639
(Omar) All right, lads, this is it.

576
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,798
This is it, boys.

577
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,515
I’ve spoken to the emir.
I have, and...

578
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,198
How did you do that?

579
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,273
Email drop box and the children s
instant messaging site, Party Puffin.

580
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,753
I’ve been on that.

581
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,598
- Good, Waj.
- Proper good.

582
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,109
(Barry) Do we have to be puffins as well?

583
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,629
Yeah, I’ll give you all usernames
and passwords after this meeting.

584
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,034
I’m not sure I want to be a puffin.

585
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,673
You don’t have to be
if you don’t want to, Barry.

586
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,916
- Bagsy a blue one, yeah?
- Good, Waj.

587
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,551
Now, I’ve spoken to him.

588
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,195
My puffin has communicated with his puffin.

589
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,715
And he’s told us to make some bombs.

590
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,513
So we’re going to take Faisal’s gear
to the secret flat.

591
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,757
We can hide it under the costumes
in Hassan’s van.

592
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,599
We’ll put the bleach on the boil.

593
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,389
We have instructions to bring havoc
to this bullshit, consumerist,

594
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,431
godless, Paki-bashing,

595
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,199

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,031
- Mashallah!
- Mashallah, brother Omar.

600
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,037
- Mashallah.
- (Waj) Fuck mini Babybels.

601
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,149
Puffin says, 'Find a target. '

602
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,952
Well, we got a target, bro.
We’re all agreed.

603
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,832
(Omar) What is it?

604
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,598
- It’s the mosque.
- What?

605
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,153
Bomb the mosque,

606
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,078
radicalise the moderates,
bring it all on.

607
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,758
OK, right. No, I like that.
I do like that, that’s brilliant.

608
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,633
Let’s take out a bunch of Muslims
because they’re the real enemy.

609
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,513
Once we’ve done that,
why don’t we truck -bomb a kebab shop

610
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,359
and fly a jumbo jet
into Waj’s mum’s head?

611
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,189
Why don’t we get a pig
and staple -gun it to our foreheads?

612
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,357
But if we bomb the mosque,
it will make all the Muslims rise up.

613
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,715
My cousin, Faz, died,

614
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,673
defending a mosque in Bosnia.

615
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,472
Did he flipping rise up, bro?

616
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,153
Let’s bomb Boots.

617
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,509
They sell condoms
that make you want to bang white girls.

618
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,870
- I second that. Boots.
- (Faisal) Right.

619
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,151
- They nabbed me nicking Lynx display.
- (Omar) Think bigger than a chemist s.

620
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,477
I’m not blowing my guts out over
a bunch of tampons and cotton buds.

621
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,319
What we’re going to do
has got to last in history,

622
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,839
echo through the ages.

623
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,713
- Like bomb a mosque.
- Barry, we’re not bombing a mosque.

624
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,717
You don’t get it, do you, Omar?

625
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,512
We radicalise the moderates!

626
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,870
The ummah rises up, it all kicks off!

627
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,310
I do get it. I’ll tell you what it’s like.
It’s like you’re in a fight with someone,

628
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,590
and they’re punching you
in the face, right?

629
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,190
And so what you go and do is,
you punch yourself in the face.

630
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,355
So what if he’s not?

631
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,755
I’m having a fight
with this fictionary man,

632
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,953
and he’s not punching me hard enough
to make me go mental and win.

633
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,719
Let’s do an experiment, Barry.
We’ll have a fight right now.

634
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,831
When you start losing
and you’re not doing very well,

635
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,269
you punch yourself in the face,
go mental and start winning.

636
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,675
- Show them all how it works.
- I’m not gonna punch myself.

637
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,075
Why not? You’re the Muslims.
You’re getting attacked.

638
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,317
Go fucking mental, Barry.
Show 'em how it works.

639
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,670
- Come on.
- (Barry) I’m not a mosque!

640
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,119
This is not how it works!

641
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,595
(Shouting)

642
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,039
Punch yourself, Baz.

643
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,628
(Omar) Bomb the mosque, Barry!
Bomb it!

644
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,829
Bomb the mosque!

645
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,872
Bomb the mosque, Barry!

646
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,308
He’s bombed the mosque!
He’s just bombed the mosque!

647
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,590
Barry, where are the moderates?
The moderates should be coming now.

648
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,075
Right, if I was a mosque,
which I am not,

649
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,998
then there would be all moderates
behind my nose,

650
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,997
bursting to come out and rise up.

651
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,475
Would there?
Ooh, they are, bro, eh?

652
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,433
Barry, the Sufi Muslim Council s
coming out your nose.

653
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,472
Oh, you’ve just wiped them out.
You’ve just wiped them out.

654
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,956
Do you think we should still
bomb the mosque, Barry?

655
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,676
- Come back.
- Barry, I got you a J-cloth for the...

656
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,798
- Oooh!
- (Omar) Barry!

657
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,751
For fuck’s sake, Barry!

658
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,918
(Rap music)

659
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,277
Oi! Oi!

660
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,517
Turn that off.
There’s common areas out there.

661
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,155
We got to play it, Barry.
This is our cover, man. We’re a band.

662
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,714
- We’re a what?
- We’re a band.

663
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,512
Bollocks! Turn it off.

664
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,799
Bro, turn it off.

665
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,549
(Music stops)

666
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,719
What’s with the chicken?

667
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,439
It’s beard protection from the bleach.

668
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,154
Yeah, he’s the drummer, man.

669
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,236
- Chicken drummer.
- Yeah, Barry.

670
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,318
You broke the chicken’s beak, didn’t you?
Remember?

671
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,192
Yeah, Barry, you broke his beak.

672
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,073
Yeah, well, I’m sorry,
but beaks get broken in war, don’t they?

673
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,474
- Do they?
- Yeah, they do.

674
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,149
We’re not about protecting beaks,
we’re about blowing them off.

675
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,872
Yeah?

676
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,514
Well, go and unload the van.
I’m not doing all the work.

677
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,953
Waj! Waj!

678
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,635
Anti-surveillance.

679
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,153
Not you, mate, you’re still here.
Get in there.

680
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,230
- What are you doing?
- Just in case they’re taking pictures.

681
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,999
- What?
- Barry says you come out blurry.

682
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,629
Right, stop it!

683
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,794
Stop it!

684
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,554
CCTV’s a video.

685
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,638
You’re just gonna look
like a bunch of Sufis on speed.

686
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,718
Next time Barry tells you
to do something, don’t.

687
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,357
- You all right, Alice? How’s it going.
- All right, Wasim? Yeah.

688
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,072
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

689
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,270
- All right, Jason?
- All right.

690
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,753
Who’s this one?

691
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,199
This is... Claude.

692
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,515
Claude, this is Alice.
She’s got the flat next door.

693
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,870
- Hello, Claude.
- Hi.

694
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,719
- What’s this?
- Claude’s the new member of our band.

695
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,274
- Band?
- He’s the new member.

696
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,709
- I used to be in a band.
- Did you?

697
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,118
Yeah.
Until all the birds fell off the roof...

698
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,076
I don’t know if you remember.

699
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,791
All right, then, Alice,
we’ll see you later. Come on, lads.

700
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,911
Come through.

701
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,555
- Which one are you?
- Er, Claude.

702
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,671
- Claude?
- Yeah.

703
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,358
Are you French?

704
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,594
Yeah.

705
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,839
See you.

706
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,397
(Barry) Right, Mister Newsman
in the newsroom, after three.

707
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,511
Three, two, one...

708
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,555
Yes, it was us.

709
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,592
We have struck you
where you least expected it.

710
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,154
We have bombed the mosque.

711
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,033
Only in the days of the final jihad...

712
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,639
(Door opens)

713
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,671
What are you doing here?

714
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,075
(Hassan) Well, you told us to come round.

715
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,476
We’ve just come through the back.
Anti-surveillance, like you said.

716
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,397
Right, well, I’m doing my tape.

717
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,272
(Hassan) But we’re not bombing the mosque.

718
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,153
- What?
- We’re not bombing the mosque.

719
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,716
Look, I’m just doing this tape in case
the plans change to bomb the mosque.

720
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,230
If they did change, isn’t the whole
point of it to blame it on the kuffar

721
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,759
and not take responsibility for it?

722
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,997
What do you know about it?
It was my idea in the first place, not yours!

723
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,634
Now, fuck off!
I’m doing my tape. Go on.

724
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,749
(Omar) All right, Barry?

725
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,236
- What, you’re here as well?
- Yeah. Why? What’s going on?

726
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,999
(Waj) He said he was going to bomb
the mosque.

727
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,553
- (Omar) Did you say that, Barry?
- No.

728
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,272
- (Waj) Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

729
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,153
- (Omar) What did you say, then?
- I said I was gonna bomb something else.

730
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,953
What did you say you were gonna bomb?

731
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,991
Hm?

732
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,712
Fuck off!

733
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,239
Fuck off out of my house!

734
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,354
Oh, Barry, you moron.

735
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,469
(Doorbell)

736
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,037
- Salaam, Ahmed.
- Alaykum salaam.

737
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,438
- Omar, it’s your brother. Come in.
- No, I’m OK.

738
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,358
- Just come in and sit down.
- (Speaks Urdu)

739
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,833
- Salaam Alaykum.
- Alaykum salaam.

740
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,915
(Speaks Urdu)

741
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,389
- Just come in and sit down.
- (Speaks Urdu)

742
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,640
I’m not in the same room.
You can come in.

743
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,318
You are.

744
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,839
(Sofia) I’m not.

745
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,632
The wall has been taken out, so you are.

746
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,159
(Omar snorts)

747
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,477
Have you come to drop some fatwas,
cos we’ve just had the carpet cleaned?

748
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,232
Not in this house, bro.

749
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,590
- Freeze or I’ll blow your guts out.
- All right, go easy.

750
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,950
OK. Right, come on!

751
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,638
You’ve got 30 seconds!

752
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,917
- What are you teaching him, Omar?
- It’s a water pistol. Have you lost it?

753
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,589
Have you got 150 quotes from scholars
saying we can’t squirt a water pistol?

754
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,995
There is no justification
for what you are planning.

755
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,076
- What am I planning, bro?
- You tell me.

756
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,156
- Want to know what I am planning?
- Yeah.

757
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,510
Sure you can handle it, bro?
Yeah? You ready?

758
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,074
It’s not a proper plan yet, yeah?

759
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,872
But I’m thinking, inshallah,

760
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,639
I’m going to go upstairs
and run a hot bath, right?

761
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,990
Then come back down
and make beans on toast. I’m proper hungry.

762
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,633
- Very funny.
- What?

763
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,069
Is it, bro? Have you got opinions
to back that up?

764
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,236
I have got 18 opinions, all very good ones.

765
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,750
You know what? It’s not Top Trumps.
Muslims are getting pasted and you go,

766
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,394
'I’ve got 60,000 opinions
saying we can’t fight back.

767
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,354
'We must measure our beard with a ruler
and lock our wives in cupboard! '

768
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,278
That’s not a joke, is it, bro?

769
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,119
It is not a cupboard, it is a small room.

770
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,357
Oh, come on. It was a flipping toilet
till you took the china out.

771
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,038
I don’t argue with women.

772
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,754
No, you don’t.
You lock ‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘em in a cupboard.

773
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,233
Omar, your wife is out of control.

774
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,271
I don’t know how to control her.
Help me out.

775
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,472
Am I... Am I out of control? Ooh.

776
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,955
- (She laughs)
- Do it again. He won’t fight back.

777
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,957
- (Sofia) What am I like? I’m out of control.
- Obey me, wife. Obey me.

778
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,195
Go and do it.

779
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,788
- Fight back, brother!
- (Sofia shrieks)

780
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,399
What’s all the violence, brother?

781
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,274
- (Sofia) Are you fighting back?
- This is not fighting.

782
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,949
- By the law of Sharia, I am not fighting.
- (Omar) You’re a proper Mujahid!

783
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,354
By the law...

784
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,789
- I am not fighting.
- You’re so violent, bro!

785
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,070
(Both laugh)

786
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,428
Hey, Omar.

787
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,120
- You’re terrible, you are.
- I’m out of control.

788
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,639
Aren’t you, eh?

789
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,758
- That’s twice as much, bro.
- This one’s gonna leave a mark.

790
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,359
Just drop it.

791
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,198
- Ooh!
- (Waj laughs)

792
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,275
(Hassan) Shit, man!

793
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,352
- Come on, bro. Give me that.
- Jew.

794
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,799
Gay.

795
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,592
Fed.

796
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,836
Sodomite.

797
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,589
Gynaecologist.

798
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,348
Innocent bloke. Doesn’t exist.

799
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,275
Leonard Cohen.
Here, you give me that.

800
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,436
You do some work.

801
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,676
(Hassan) This one’s gonna be
like a grenade, man.

802
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,473
- (Waj) Oh, bro.
- Here, watch this.

803
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,158
Watch this, bro!

804
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,353
(Waj laughs)

805
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,832
Come on, lads. Why don’t we just
pick up the phone and call the cops?

806
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,837
Right? Come on.

807
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,315
- (Hassan) Sorry, man.
- Sorry, bro.

808
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,271
(Faisal) We don’t have to use that
on ourselves, do we, Barry?

809
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,470
- Course we do, bro.
- But it’s our choice, right?

810
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,670
- Fess? Fess?
- What?

811
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,758
<i>It is your choice.
Right? It can only be your choice.</i>

812
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,235
Right, yeah.

813
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,351
- Fess. Fess.
- What?

814
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,832
<i>It is your choice, right,</i>

815
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,269
but you’ve chosen
to blow yourself up, haven’t you?

816
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,272
Haven’t you?

817
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,556
(Faisal) Mashallah, brother Crow.

818
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,193
Mashallah.

819
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,313
You’re doing this, right,
to save brother Faisal.

820
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,113
And I know it’s come
as a bit of a shock to you,

821
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,595
but everything will be all right.

822
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,679
Yeah? OK.
You see that over there?

823
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,789
That...

824
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,111
That’s a sex shop. Right?

825
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,391
A US embassy,
or some other such slag utility.

826
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,150
Right, now wait there.

827
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,590
When I say, you fly to the target.

828
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,757
When I dial this,
you go to heaven, brother Crow.

829
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,119
Inshallah.

830
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,556
(Hassan makes bomb noises)

831
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,749
Yeah.

832
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,917
What’s that?
What’s that, Mrs. Thistle?

833
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,871
No, I don’t want to resit
my media studies.

834
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,117
Stupid Mrs. Thistle,
I don’t want to retake it.

835
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,277
You know why?
Cos I’ve found a new purpose in life.

836
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,631
And here it is. Eat that shit!

837
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,874
Eat that. Eat that. You fuck...

838
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,274
Come on, lads. Let’s go.
Salaam alaykum.

839
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,710
- Alaykum salaam.
- You all right? Where are they?

840
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,718
They’ve all gone, man.
They’re using the fireworks for cover.

841
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,832
Yeah, I know that. That was my idea.
Why didn’t they wait for me?

842
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,520
- Barry said that you said, 'Go ahead. '
- Did he?

843
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,835
- I’m just on night shift.
- Yeah, you are, bro.

844
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,236
If anybody comes knocking for Barry,
tell them you used to know him...

845
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,318
Can I come?

846
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,555
(Barry) Don’t drop it, you prick!

847
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,116
(Waj) Brother Faisal, if you drop this,
we’re baked beans from here to Derby.

848
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,954
- Slowly, slowly.
- (Faisal) Oh!

849
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,069
- It’s good.
- All right.

850
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,272
- (Waj) Good, good.
- (Faisal) Let’s get out of here.

851
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,071
- (Waj) OK.
- (Barry) Come on. I’m gonna blow it.

852
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,872
- Ready?
- (Faisal) All right.

853
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,799
(Waj) Is it gonna be loud?

854
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,551
(Waj) Did you see that?

855
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,956
Fucking good, Barry. Fucking good.
That were proper good!

856
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,916
- (Omar) Well done, Barry.
- (Barry) What’s up?

857
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,156
Did you miss it, bro?
Did you miss it, bro?

858
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,710
I told you before, Barry, didn’t I?
What were you lads playing at?

859
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,879
- Why didn’t you call me, Waj? Eh?
- I didn’t have no credit.

860
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,671
This breaks anti-surveillance protocol.
We shouldn’t be back here till tomorrow.

861
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,394
The protocol is that you were supposed
to stay here and guard the flat, Barry,

862
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,431
cos there’s a good chance
that you are being monitored.

863
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,950
Is that an Islamic argument, brother?
I only listen to Islamic arguments.

864
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,991
That was my microwave, Barry.
I had it ten years, that Matsui.

865
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,473
I should’ve been there.

866
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,670
Your microwave
has been well sacrificed.

867
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,155
Don’t screw with my jihad.
I’m telling you for the last time.

868
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,794
- Your jihad? You said 'my jihad '.
- Our jihad. Don’t screw with it.

869
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,672
- Our jihad.
- What did he say, Fess?

870
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,030
- Did he say 'my jihad '?
- What difference does it make?

871
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,789
- You said 'my jihad '.
- So what? This is such a small thing.

872
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,114
(Waj) Hey!

873
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,753
Come and have a look at this.

874
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,713
(# 'Dancing In The Moonlight '
plays on the stereo)

875
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,635
# Dancing in the moonlight

876
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,276
# Everybody’s feeling warm and bright...

877
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,550
(Both sing along)

878
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,669
Hass!

879
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,909
Claude!

880
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,276
Shit!

881
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,352
(Music stops)

882
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,758
Right, it’s time to go now, Alice.

883
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,916
Why? What’s going on?

884
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,598
Nothing. We just need you to go.

885
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,759
Oh.

886
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,678
Oh, I get it.
I know what’s going on here.

887
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,679
I know what you lot are.

888
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,872
You lot...

889
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,911
are a bunch of Paki-bashers.

890
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,831
- What?
- Mountie boys. Gays.

891
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,713
- (Omar) Yes, we are so gay.
- (Waj) I’m not.

892
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,319
Yes, you are. We all are.

893
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,113
But mainly it’s these two.
Isn’t it, Norman?

894
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,550
- Yes.
- Yeah, you love it, don’t you?

895
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,353
We’ve got to get down
to some gay business now, all of us.

896
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,391
You lot aren’t my friends any more.

897
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,038
Safe, is he?

898
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,153
She didn’t see anything, man.
I swear to God, she didn’t see the...

899
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,874
The bolts and the...
I’ll sort this out.

900
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,639
I’ll sort it out, man.
Just give me a minute.

901
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,318
I’ll go down and sort this shit out.

902
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,510
You are going to sort it out
cos you’re going to kill her.

903
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,629
Kill her?

904
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,470
We’re gonna kill her?

905
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,431
Not us, Waj. Hass.

906
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,797
You want me to kill her?

907
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,674
You can fuck her, but you can’t kill her?
What’s wrong with you?

908
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,958
Give him your pocket knife, Barry.

909
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,992
There we go. There. Knife and fork.
Make a fucking meal of it.

910
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,752
I’m not joking, bro.
Do I look like I’m joking?

911
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,438
No. Now go on your way.

912
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,309
How do I do it?

913
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,079
Cut her head off
and bring it back in a bucket.

914
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,749
Chop her head off?

915
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,758
We’re not really gonna kill her, are we?
You fucking idiot!

916
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,757
Why don’t we just call up the pigs
and dob ourselves in.

917
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,474
That d be clever.
A body on our hands to trail back to us.

918
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,874
Shut up!

919
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,718
What are we gonna do with all this?

920
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,796
She’s seen it now.
We’ve got to move it now.

921
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,195
- We’re gonna put it in Barry’s allotment.
- We’ll put it...

922
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,117
Shut up, Barry. Solved.
Problem solved.

923
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,071
Daddy’s come home
and wiped everyone’s arse, hasn’t he?

924
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,829
That’s what jihad’s about.
It’s me wiping your arses.

925
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,871
Oh, sorry. One minute. Hello, Gaza?

926
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,549
Yeah, Omar would love to come
and help but he can t, he’s really busy

927
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,989
wiping up the fountains of shit
spraying out the arses of these...

928
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,077
OK, thank you.

929
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,437
Who were on the phone?

930
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,079
(Engine judders)

931
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,549
Slow down, please.

932
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,989
(Omar) Get us there in one piece, Barry.
Go easy.

933
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,032
Go easy!

934
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,559
(Omar curses)

935
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,029
(All) Oh! Oh!

936
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,355
Don’t rattle the stuff, Barry.
Slow down, man.

937
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,072
Use your eyes, boys.
We’ve got a predator.

938
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,475
What, the milk float?

939
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,558
- That’s a milk float!
- The Feds work undercover, you mug!

940
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,715
(Car rumbles)

941
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,829
(Barry) No, no.

942
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,951
No, no!

943
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,757
No, don’t do this to me!

944
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,233
Come on!

945
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,918
(Engine cuts out)

946
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,393
(Bang)

947
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,991
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck!

948
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,674
Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

949
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,552
- Did you fix this, then, Barry?
- Yes, I fixed it!

950
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,240
- Did you?
- It’s the parts. They’re Jewish.

951
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,316
What parts in a car are Jewish?

952
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,712
- (Faisal) Spark plugs?
- (Barry) Spark plugs.

953
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,957
Jews invented spark plugs
to control global traffic.

954
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,797
Right, everybody calm down.
We’re gonna grab the gear and walk.

955
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,276
All right, but check the roofs, boys.
There could still be an ambush.

956
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,994
Careful, careful with that. Watch out.

957
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,914
Easy does it. Just act natural. OK?

958
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,515
(Barry) One jolt
and this stuff could go, right?

959
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,995
You got to run smooth, right?

960
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,634
You got to run fast,
but you got to run smooth, right?

961
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,113
Like this, right?

962
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,710
This is fast but slow,
smooth but fast.

963
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,150
Barry, we’re fine! Lads, we’re fine!
There’s no need for any of this.

964
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,874
We’re fine, are we?
We’re fucking surrounded. Look.

965
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,797
- (Omar) Everybody get off the road.
- Omar!

966
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,878
Anybody talks, I’m gonna make them
jump up and down till they go bang.

967
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,515
Just keep your mouths shut
and let me deal with this, all right?

968
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,279
Hey, man. How’s it going?

969
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,630
Nice little one-pack
you got going on there, bro.

970
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,034
You’re a pint of sauce, Omar.

971
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,232
Have you managed to run a mile yet
without stopping for a milkshake?

972
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,193
- Make that 12 miles. All right, lads?
- All right.

973
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,359
What’s with the bags?

974
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,549
- Shopping.
- Marzipan.

975
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,874
- Toys.
- Chicken.

976
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,239
- We’re about to go and play football.
- Yeah?

977
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,476
We should grab all this kit
and head down there to the pitch.

978
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,272
- (Matt) Yeah.
- (Omar) All right, bro.

979
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,879
Right. See you in a bit, man.

980
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,078
Hey, lads. Wait, look.
You forgot this.

981
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,758
- Hey! Hey!
- Aahh!

982
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,669
(Nervous laughter)

983
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,358
What’s that?

984
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,392
That bag’s full of really fragile...

985
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,431
boots.

986
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,030
- Are they all right?
- Yeah. That’s just thigh exercises.

987
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,273
- What?
- Quad squats. You know, squat jogs.

988
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,631
It’s just... It’s for the marathon.
I thought you d know.

989
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,672
- Yeah? Squat jogs?
- Yeah.

990
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,793
All right, man. See you in a bit.

991
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,035
Like that.

992
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,798
- Squat jogs, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

993
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,071
- Down?
- Bit lower.

994
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,918
- Safe-age, mate!
- All right, man.

995
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,072
- Take care, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

996
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,231
- (Waj) All right, brothers?
- Oh, Alhamdulillah, bro.

997
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,554
- Yeah.
- We skilled it.

998
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,669
Where’s Faisal?

999
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,273
Hey, boys.
Boys, come and have a look at this.

1000
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,833
Can you see him?

1001
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,518
(Hassan laughs)

1002
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,358
(Barry) Hey, bro!

1003
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,799
Run!

1004
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,632
(Waj) Hey, brother Faisal!

1005
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,079
Over the wall, Faisal!

1006
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,351
- (Waj) Yeah, run faster, bro!
- (Barry) Yeah, but not too fast!

1007
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,439
Where is he?

1008
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,437
- It was a martyr’s death.
- Gone to paradise, innit, brother Omar?

1009
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,469
- (Barry) He disrupted the infrastructure.
- How did he do that?

1010
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,317
He took out a sheep.

1011
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,037
Magnificently took it right out.

1012
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,429
Did he?

1013
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,953
- Attacked the food supply.
- Some of it’s in there... with him.

1014
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,799
- What?
- I couldn’t separate it.

1015
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,239
So what is he, lads?
Is he a martyr or is he a fucking jalfrezi?

1016
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,079
- He’s a martyr.
- Right, this is bullshit!

1017
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,668
- He is not a martyr.
- Yes, he is. He’s part of the war.

1018
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,314
What war?
The war on kuffar sheep?

1019
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,750
- He’s the first hero of the final jihad.
- He’s not a hero, he’s a dickhead.

1020
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,996
And so are you, you’re all dickheads.

1021
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,792
Whoa, brother. That is out of order.

1022
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,435
I’ve made a decision, Barry.
The mission’s off.

1023
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,472
It’s finished, I’m done with this.

1024
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,558
(Barry) You can’t handle the war, brother.
You’re having a wobble.

1025
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,114
I’ve got nothing to have a wobble about.
My conscience is clear.

1026
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,958
- You’re the one who killed Faisal!
- I didn’t kill him!

1027
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,036
Yes, you did, you brought TV Paki in

1028
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,957
after you saw him
making an arse out of himself

1029
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,435
at a public meeting
you shouldn’t even have been at.

1030
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,993
And he blew our cover.

1031
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,156
Ever since then,
you’ve had everybody so paranoid,

1032
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,874
poor little Faisal s
panicked himself to death.

1033
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,719
- So really Hassan killed him.
- No, you killed him.

1034
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,070
No, you killed him.
You heard what he said.

1035
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,351
- You killed him more.
- I thought it was a good thing he died.

1036
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,471
Isn’t he a martyr?
It’s a good thing, right?

1037
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,838
All right, I did kill him, then.

1038
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,872
I martyred him. He’s up there now,
keeping my seat warm.

1039
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,277
- Come on, our kid, let’s go.
- I think I martyred him a bit, too.

1040
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,038
What?

1041
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,152
- We got to keep on.
- You got a plan, Waj?

1042
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,757
- Blow something up.
- What are we going to blow up, Waj?

1043
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,036
Internet.

1044
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,993
We’ll blow up the internet
for brother Faisal.

1045
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,758
We’re mujahid, brother, yeah?

1046
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,279
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, yeah?

1047
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,470
You’re not a mujahid.
You’re a fucking idiot.

1048
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,797
Do you think a real mujahid gives a fuck
about Rubber Dinghy Rapids

1049
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,070
<i>and gets his deen from
The Cat That Went To Mecca,</i>

1050
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,919
a book he can’t finish
cos it’s far too fucking advanced for him?

1051
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,793
I tell you what, I’ve got a plan for you.
Why don’t you go with...

1052
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,678
...and lose yourself in the forest?

1053
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,199
(Male voices)

1054
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,759
Omar!

1055
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,119
Salaam, Omar.

1056
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,878
Salaam alaykum, bro.

1057
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,229
You and your boys look like...
something rubbish.

1058
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,279
You all right, Omar?

1059
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,558
Yeah, yeah. I am, as it goes.

1060
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,591
- Listen, can I ask you something?
- Why not, brother?

1061
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,957
Screw it, doesn’t matter.
You’ve already started doing the face.

1062
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,991
Why not come to our study group, Omar?

1063
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,680
What, and get a four-hour dose of that face?

1064
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,395
The floaty face of the wise bird,
hovering on a million quotes,

1065
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,557
about to do a massive wisdom shit
on my head.

1066
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,079
Forget it.

1067
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,790
Omar, what are you doing?
It’s the middle of the night.

1068
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,314
What is that?

1069
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,477
- It’s a puffin party.
- A what?

1070
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,477
- It’s a puffin party.
- A puffin party?

1071
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,309
- I’m talking to Waj’s puffin.
- Omar, what are you talking about?

1072
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,000
It’s the boys. I’ve left them.

1073
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,318
Now Hassan’s puffin won’t talk to me,
Waj’s puffin’s just told me to piss off,

1074
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,316
Barry’s puffin’s turned all red
and is hiding under the pirate hat.

1075
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,470
Faisal’s dead.

1076
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,597
He’s dead. They...

1077
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,111
He was carrying explosives
and he tripped up over a sheep.

1078
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,716
They’re total idiots, Sof.

1079
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,317
Well, it must have been God’s plan
for him to be blown up on a sheep.

1080
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,792
Come on, Sof.
How can that be God’s plan?

1081
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,993
Well, it can’t be God’s plan
to leave the lads with Barry, can it?

1082
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,512
Come here.

1083
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,196
You were much more fun when
you were gonna blow yourself up, love.

1084
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,234
<i>I am gonna blow myself up, right?</i>

1085
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,433
Just not in a mosque
or in a chemist’s or on top of a duck.

1086
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,473
Right, well, if they’re gonna blow
themselves up in the wrong place,

1087
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,036
you’ve got to make sure
you all blow up in the right place.

1088
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,469
Sof, I can’t even get them to stir their tea
without smashing a window.

1089
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,229
What does your heart say, hmm?

1090
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,078
God’s in your heart, Dad.

1091
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,395
Oi, you, come here.

1092
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,711
Sorry, I heard talking.

1093
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,514
Can we finish off
the story about Simba’s jihad?

1094
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,108
Yeah, we can do that tomorrow.
Come on, off to bed.

1095
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,071
Does he become a martyr, eh, Dad?

1096
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,112
Don’t you worry,
cos even if he gets blown to bits,

1097
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,639
he’s gonna die smiling.

1098
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,957
- He’ll go straight to heaven.
- Yeah.

1099
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,640
He’ll be in heaven
before his head hits the ceiling.

1100
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,912
<i>An Asian man’s head was found less
than 2 miles from the city centre today.</i>

1101
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,032
<i>Steven Fap discovered
the Asian man’s head</i>

1102
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,879
<i>when it nearly fell onto his dog out of a tree.</i>

1103
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,514
<i>A head fell out of the tree
and nearly hit my dog.</i>

1104
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,596
<i>The man has not been identified,</i>

1105
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,157
<i>but it seems that he may have died
while trying to cause an explosion.</i>

1106
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,430
- Yo, Matt... Is Matt here?
- He’s in the back.

1107
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,551
- Terry, step outside, bro.
- Say that again.

1108
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,352
I need you to go outside.
Get a doughnut.

1109
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,711
- I’ve got one.
- Get another one.

1110
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,159
- Matt?
- Oh, thanks!

1111
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,395
- Omar?
- Yeah, mate.

1112
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,159
- Can you can help me with this?
- I got to ask you something first.

1113
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,157
I booked a clown and they gave me this.

1114
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,748
It’s the wrong way up.
I can’t run in a wrong-way-up clown!

1115
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,199
They said, 'You ordered it. '

1116
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,311
- Why would I order a wrong-way-up clown?
- It’s fine.

1117
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,749
- I can sort you out.
- I didn’t even know what one was.

1118
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,519
I can sort you out with another costume
so you can do the marathon.

1119
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,791
I said, 'You’re gonna cause
a pile -up at the marathon with me

1120
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,832
'flat to my arse in a costume
I can’t even bloody believe exists. '

1121
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,270
I’ve got you a rabbit costume at home.
You can run the marathon in that.

1122
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,038
- Can I run in a rabbit?
- Course you can.

1123
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,674
It’s amazing. It’s a rabbit, right?
Panic over. Done?

1124
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,756
- Yes, I’m sorry.
- I’ve got to ask you something.

1125
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,711
Have you?
Have you seen the news?

1126
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,876
- Yeah, the head.
- What do you know about that?

1127
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,355
Well, they’re just saying it’s jihadi.

1128
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,914
They’ve got him.
Filmed him blowing up a crow.

1129
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,719
It’s not jihadi, though, is it, Omar,
blowing up a crow?

1130
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,509
Omar?

1131
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,229
No, it’s a cultural thing. We bazooka-ed
an ostrich at that wedding I was at.

1132
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,716
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I... I’ve got to go, Matt.

1133
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,989
(Knock at door)

1134
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,109
(Waj) Shit!

1135
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,479
God help us.

1136
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,594
(Knocking)

1137
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,269
- (Hassan) That’s the police, man.
- (Barry) All right. Arm yourselves.

1138
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,038
All right?

1139
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,119
- Oi.
- (Omar) Get out of my way, Barry.

1140
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,309
Oi! Fuck off out the back door!
You’re not part of this now.

1141
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,113
Lads, this is an emergency.
They found Faisal’s head.

1142
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,913
The head that you buried 5 feet
underneath your shed

1143
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,758
fell out of a tree onto a dog.

1144
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,677
Good. Dogs contradict Islam.

1145
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,358
Dibble is onto us, lads.

1146
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,992
- Dibble is on to us.
- I told you, it was a knee.

1147
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,917
(Barry) That was a head.
It was obviously a head.

1148
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,155
It had a hinge!

1149
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,196
Right. So, I’ve just seen Matt.

1150
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,629
Matt is running
the London marathon tomorrow.

1151
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,239
He’s doing it in costume.

1152
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,191
You know they run in costume?
Well, so can we.

1153
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,039
We can disguise the gear in there
and it’s perfect.

1154
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,879
We’ve got live TV,
prime targets all along the road.

1155
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,911
We’ve got a target, Omar.
It’s the mosque.

1156
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,029
(Omar) When you meet God,

1157
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,674
do you want to tell him,
'I struck a blow for the brothers '?

1158
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,395
- Or 'I blew a load of them up '?
- Blew a load of ‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘em up. He’ll love that.

1159
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,750
Come on, lads. Waj?

1160
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,030
I’m not on your side any more, brother Omar.

1161
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,389
- You ripped me up, bro.
- Mashallah.

1162
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,919
Waj, bro...

1163
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,078
I’m really sorry.

1164
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,430
My head was in a mess cos of Faisal.

1165
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,711
I should’ve stayed.

1166
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,713
Why didn’t you, then?

1167
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,319
Cos I made a mistake.

1168
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,557
But you didn't. You listened to your heart
and you did the right thing.

1169
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,996
No, ignore him, Waj. He’s being nice.

1170
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,429
You cannot win an argument
just by being nice.

1171
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,154
Not just by being nice, Baz.
I’m right as well, aren’t I?

1172
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,350
You cannot win an argument
just by being right.

1173
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,198
- No?
- No. No way.

1174
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,357
- I think maybe you can, Barry?
- Who asked you, fuck -brain?

1175
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,354
Barry’s not a good emir, brother Omar.

1176
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,119
He made me do bad stuff in the woods.

1177
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,639
Like what?

1178
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,711
He said, if I was a proper mujahid,

1179
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,637
I d wiz in my own mouth.

1180
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,872
You made him wee in his own gob?

1181
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,671
What is wrong with you, bro?

1182
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,313
It’s submission.
It’s the rules of submission.

1183
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,670
(Waj) It felt really bad, brother.

1184
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,916
It’s not too tricky
once you get the aim right,

1185
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,918
but it just feels like really proper wrong.

1186
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,388
All wee splashing off your teeth.

1187
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:23,798
Bro, I swear, bro,
I may ask you to blow yourself up

1188
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,388
but I will never ask you
to piss in your own mouth.

1189
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,672
- Yeah?
- Yeah, bro. Promise.

1190
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,518
- No more widdle in my gob.
- Promise, bro.

1191
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,318
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1192
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,239
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, brother.

1193
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,952
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1194
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,954
See this, brother Hass?

1195
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,594
It’s gays at work.
It’s not Muslims, it’s gays.

1196
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,598
OK, brother Hass,
marathon or mosque?

1197
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,550
- Either way, we’re gonna blow, right?
- Yeah, to pieces, brother.

1198
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,956
Yeah, but... we die smiling, bro.

1199
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,950
Yeah, wicked.

1200
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,593
Wicked. Yeah, man.

1201
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,029
Let’s blow up a load of fit slags
at the marathon, yeah?

1202
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,115
(Hassan) Oh, yes!

1203
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,753
(Omar) Yes, bro.

1204
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,313
(Hassan) Wicked. Yes!

1205
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,953
Come on, Barry. We’re lions, bro.

1206
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,638
- Four lions.
- (Hassan) Yes!

1207
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,591
Good lad.

1208
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,108
(Shouting)

1209
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,553
Down on the floor!

1210
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,632
(Shouting)

1211
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,718
I’ll be two minutes.

1212
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,116
(Sofia) What’s it concerning?

1213
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,435
We trying to ascertain the whereabouts
of your brother-in-law.

1214
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,549
Why, what’s up?

1215
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,830
Tell us when you saw him last.

1216
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,871
Well...

1217
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,592
I can’t remember
the last time I saw him.

1218
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,795
Right, nurse, still on shift? Sorry.

1219
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,037
So, I’ve got the stats back
from cubicle seven.

1220
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,879
They need some more blood supplies
for the knee.

1221
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,989
The what?

1222
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,759
Yes, the knee string.
The knee string’s come off.

1223
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,871
Hm.

1224
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,911
I’ve finished my shift now.

1225
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,873
So I’m going to take my team
up to the top floor.

1226
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,149
- Right?
- OK.

1227
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,759
So I’ll see you up there.

1228
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,834
Yeah?

1229
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,833
- OK.
- Yeah?

1230
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,554
You all right, lads.
You going to arrest me?

1231
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,954
- No, no.
- Carry on.

1232
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,832
OK.

1233
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,039
Right, so your brother-in-law,
when was the last time you saw him?

1234
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,628
(Sofia) Er, like I said, about two months ago.

1235
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,157
<i>(Car stereo plays)</i>

1236
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,629
<i>#Dancing in the moonlight</i>

1237
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,197
<i>#Everybody's feeling warm and bright</i>

1238
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,790
<i>#Such a fine and natural sight</i>

1239
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,311
<i>#Everybody's dancing in the moonlight...</i>

1240
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,477
(Omar) Come on lads, we’re late.

1241
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,871
- Is it all right?
- It’s all right there now.

1242
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,070
- Yeah.
- Right, we’re nearly done, our kid.

1243
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,679
(Waj) Yeah, nearly done.

1244
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,279
- (Omar) OK?
- (Waj) Yeah.

1245
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,393
Mujahid, brothers!

1246
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,432
- (Barry) Mujahid.
- Mujahid, brother Hassan.

1247
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,754
(Hassan) Mujahid!

1248
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,838
Defo right thing, yeah, bro?

1249
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,279
What?

1250
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,595
Blowing up kuffar and that?

1251
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,950
- Totally legit, yeah?
- Yeah.

1252
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,479
Good. Wicked.

1253
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,675
I was just... just checking and that.

1254
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,909
Waj, don’t listen to your brain, bro.

1255
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,430
OK? The shaitan,
he gets in there with his wasa-wasa.

1256
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,235
What you’ve got to do, you’ve got to
listen to your heart. Remember?

1257
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,955
- My heart. Yeah, brother Omar.
- So, what does your heart say?

1258
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,752
It says, er...

1259
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,871
'It’s wrong, Waj, don’t do it. '

1260
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,119
And what does your brain say?

1261
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,596
'We’re here...

1262
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,355
'... together, strapped up,

1263
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,313
'and it would be, like,
well pathetic to cop out now. '

1264
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,510
Right, um...

1265
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,235
- So he should listen to his brain.
- No, he’s got to listen to his heart, Barry.

1266
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,875
Anyway, this is Waj’s brain.
Since when do we listen to Waj’s brain?

1267
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,230
- Sorry, bro.
- No, I agree. I’m thick as fudge.

1268
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,033
His brain says do it,
so his brain’s got to be right!

1269
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,314
That can’t be his brain, right?
That’s his heart, Barry.

1270
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,035
- Feels like my brain, brother.
- OK, this is what’s happened.

1271
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,349
What’s happened is,
the shaitan has confused you.

1272
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,751
He’s swapped round
your brain and your heart.

1273
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,317
<i>So, don’t listen
to what you think is your heart,</i>

1274
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,237
cos that’s actually your brain -

1275
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,113
<i>in disguise as your heart.</i>

1276
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,038
Right? And what you thought
was your brain,

1277
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,151
that s... that’s your heart.

1278
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,871
That’s actually your heart.

1279
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,672
My brain is my heart.

1280
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,234
You got it, our kid. So just...

1281
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,749
What’s up there?

1282
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,949
Heart.

1283
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,911
OK? Yeah? Follow your heart.

1284
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,359
Nice one, brother.

1285
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,074
- Right?
- Nice one. Alhamdulillah.

1286
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,112
- Hey, hey!
- (Omar) What?

1287
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,035
Oh, behn choad!

1288
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,957
We’re doing a fun run for a kid’s charity.

1289
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,116
Stretches, stretches, stretches.

1290
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,435
- We’re running for charity.
- What kind of charity?

1291
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,039
- For kids.
- What kind of kids?

1292
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,275
Policemen’s kids.

1293
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,716
You all right, officer?

1294
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,274
- Late for the fun run, lads?
- What’s it to you?

1295
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,439
Yeah, we are, actually. Do you know
how we can get to the red zone?

1296
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,631
You can’t run in that, can you?

1297
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,031
He just drew the short straw.

1298
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,117
Four short straws were there?

1299
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,839
(Nervous laughter)

1300
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,875
Red zone? It’s back down there, left.

1301
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,754
Second left again, then there’s marshals.
They’ll tell you where to park.

1302
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,279
Thank you.

1303
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,118
You’re gonna die in that gear, lads.

1304
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,830
- That’s more than likely.
- (Waj) Proper likely.

1305
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,951
(Barry) We’re all going to die, yeah.

1306
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,230
It’s all for a good cause, though.

1307
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,797
Well, good luck.

1308
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,193
Have a good day.

1309
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,276
(Omar) Everybody OK?
Everybody strapped up?

1310
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,756
Got your detonator on?
Hass, you got your number?

1311
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,552
Hass, have you got your number?

1312
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,390
Hey!

1313
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,192
- Where the fuck has he gone?
- Shit!

1314
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,719
What the fuck’s he doing?

1315
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,478
Help! Help!

1316
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,716
- I’m accidentally a suicide bomber!
- Stop!

1317
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,995
- I’ve got a bomb!
- He’s bottled it.

1318
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,190
It’s the costume.
The legs make the hands go up.

1319
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,232
- I’ve got a bomb but it’s a mistake!
- No, he said he’s got a bomb.

1320
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,272
- (Policeman) You’ve got a bomb?
- Yeah, but I’m not a bomber!

1321
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,595
Don’t worry.

1322
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,711
- This is a fucking bad prank, mate!
- No, no!

1323
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,593
No, I’m real, but not anymore.

1324
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,878
You’re real but not anymore?

1325
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,991
I don’t understand.
Have you got a bomb?

1326
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,758
Yes, but it’s not going to go off.

1327
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,348
- How do I know that?
- Look.

1328
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,396
We’ve got to go, now.

1329
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,829
We need to go, now.

1330
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,757
Now!

1331
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,674
(Omar) Go! Come on, go!

1332
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,436
Waj, try and find some targets.
I’ll see you on the top floor, our kid.

1333
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,959
Radisson-style penthouse suite!

1334
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,274
Smooth running, Waj.

1335
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,755
'Smooth running, Waj.
Smooth running. '

1336
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,155
- You killed Hassan!
- He bottled.

1337
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,510
You took away his choice.
You de-martyred him.

1338
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,471
Did Waj have a choice
when you told him

1339
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,831
his heart was his brain
and his gob was his ring piece?

1340
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,518
You tomatoed your friend.

1341
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,154
- Barry...
- You’ve killed the special-needs donkey.

1342
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,679
(Police siren)

1343
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,509
No, I haven t.

1344
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,753
Let him blow!

1345
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,871
Let the retard blow!

1346
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,033
Fuck!

1347
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,119
(Helicopter overhead)

1348
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,833
(Police siren)

1349
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,799
(Applause and cheering)

1350
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,388
Oi, you, stop!

1351
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,477
(Horn)

1352
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,629
All right, bro?

1353
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,829
Hey!

1354
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,593
Stay there!

1355
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,359
I’m fucking loaded! Yeah?

1356
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,074
No messing now, yeah?

1357
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,953
That’s it. Stay there.

1358
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,516
Shut it. Shut the metal. Shut it.

1359
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,868
Shut it!

1360
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,275
Right, lads. See this, yeah?

1361
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,674
Any of you do anything,

1362
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,595
we’re all turning baked beans, all right?

1363
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,711
No fucking messing now. Yeah?

1364
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,790
<i>(Radio) Target confirmations are
ostrich and grizzly bear.</i>

1365
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,911
<i>Ostrich and grizzly bear are the targets.</i>

1366
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,754
The bear is down. Repeat,
the bear is down. I got the bear.

1367
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,075
I think that’s a wookie.
That’s a wookie.

1368
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,519
No, it’s not, it’s a bear.

1369
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,199
Is a wookie a bear, control?

1370
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,915
<i>The bear target has changed.
Target bear is now target Honey Monster.</i>

1371
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,190
Is a honey monster a bear?

1372
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,675
<i>A honey monster is not a bear.</i>

1373
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,112
A honey monster is a bear.

1374
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,754
The honey monster is down.
He was a target. He was a bear.

1375
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,074
<i>The honey monster is down?</i>

1376
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,351
The honey monster is not down, control.
We have a wookie down.

1377
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,153
<i>- What's a wookie?
- A bear. It’s a bear!</i>

1378
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,078
No, it is a wookie.
You’ve just shot it as a bear.

1379
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,634
<i>- Is a wookie a bear?
- It’s a bear. Repeat, it’s a bear.</i>

1380
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,751
The wookie is down.
The wookie is not the target.

1381
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,678
Well, it must be the target.
I just shot it.

1382
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,158
I’ll just finish this,
then we’re all off to heaven, all right?

1383
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,111
Martyrs suite, VIP lounge.

1384
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,515
Are you going to kill us?

1385
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,030
Well, I might have some seconds,
but I kind of am, yeah.

1386
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,955
Why?

1387
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,799
For jihad, man. Kuffar and that.

1388
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,353
But we support jihad, bro.

1389
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,068
I can’t explain it, lads, but...

1390
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,236
If brother Omar were here,

1391
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,828
I swear he d tell you knowledge
proper good.

1392
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,679
(Mobile rings)

1393
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,871
<i>- Omar?
- Waj?</i>

1394
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,558
<i>- Are you in paradise, bro?
- No, bro.</i>

1395
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,353
- I’m in a cafe. Where are you?
- I’m in a kebab shop.

1396
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,631
I’ve got hostages and everything,
like Xbox Counter-Strike.

1397
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,196
<i>- Right, listen, Waj. You’ve got to...
- Thing is, they're all brothers.</i>

1398
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,313
I still get points for taking them with me,
though, yeah? Like Nectar card?

1399
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,958
<i>Omar?</i>

1400
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,197
- Let them all go. Just keep one of them.
- Eh?

1401
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,835
Just grab one of them.
Let the rest of them go, Waj.

1402
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,075
OK.

1403
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,711
Right, you stay.

1404
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,239
You three can go.

1405
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,393
Go!

1406
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,589
<i>OK. Now listen, Waj.</i>

1407
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,029
What you were saying before
about this being wrong,

1408
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,718
<i>you were right, it is wrong.</i>

1409
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,637
<i>- I don’t... What do you mean?
- For you.</i>

1410
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,876
For you, Waj,
doing what you’re doing is wrong.

1411
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,356
Yeah, I know. It feels really wrong, bro.
But that’s why it’s right, yeah?

1412
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,316
No, you’re confused, bro.

1413
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,839
I’m not confused, brother.

1414
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,633
Yes, you are confused.
I confused you.

1415
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,751
But when I’m confused,
I got my confused face.

1416
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,154
Wait.

1417
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,589
Bro, I just took a picture of my face.
It’s defo not my confused face.

1418
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,597
<i>- Waj, I don’t need...
- I'll send it you.</i>

1419
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,517
Waj. Waj, wait.

1420
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,232
Listen to me, Waj. Wait.

1421
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,432
'Listen to me. ' It’s too late
to stick your hand up his arse now.

1422
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,909
Aargh!

1423
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,155
Oh!

1424
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,430
Ah, look at the Paki Bono.

1425
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,913
You want to call him?

1426
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,917
You want to call
the special-needs donkey?

1427
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,519
Here you go.

1428
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,232
You forgot the SIM card.

1429
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,479
Mind out. Mind out the way.

1430
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,632
Easy, chap. OK.

1431
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,433
It’s all right, I can Heimlich.
That’s it, don’t fight me.

1432
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,710
- Wait.
- I’ve done this before, sonny.

1433
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,114
That’s it. Don’t fight it.

1434
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,673
That’s it, that’s it.

1435
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,432
And catch the peanut!

1436
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,192
(Mobile rings)

1437
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,600
Number withheld.
I don’t do 'number withheld '.

1438
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,199
Answer it, bro.
It could be important!

1439
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,515
Hey, yeah. Maybe I won an iPhone.

1440
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,597
<i>- Waj?
- Have I won?</i>

1441
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,269
Waj, this is Ed.
I’m with Special Branch. I’m just outside.

1442
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,278
- How did you get this number?
- Waj, can we talk?

1443
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,198
<i>- Have you got agents at Orange?
- I'm sorry?</i>

1444
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,949
You’ve got proper double agents
working at Orange, haven’t you?

1445
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,913
I knew I should have gone to O 2.
I’ve got loads of friends on O 2.

1446
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,759
Waj, what are your demands?

1447
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,149
I don’t have any.

1448
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,754
Excuse me, mate. Have you got
a SIM card for this phone, please?

1449
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,270
Not for that model, but we can sort one out
for you if you want to come with me.

1450
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,675
Can you make this work.
I need it. Is it on?

1451
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,153
It’s only a display model.
Do you want that one?

1452
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,349
Yeah, I want it. I need it.

1453
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,835
Gordon? Can you get that phone
for me, please, mate?

1454
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,476
Waj, why are you doing this?

1455
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,318
Rubber Dinghy Rapids.

1456
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,989
Sorry?

1457
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,669
Rubber Dinghy Rapids, bro.
Fast track.

1458
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,950
Straight on the rides, like Alton Towers.

1459
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,675
<i>- No queue.
- You like funfairs then, Waj?</i>

1460
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,234
It’s not a funfair, bro,
it’s a theme park.

1461
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,191
Funfair? How old are you?

1462
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,231
Alton Towers got a spa, bro.

1463
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,072
- Just now.
- All right, mate.

1464
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,270
I’m doing it for you.
Would you like 12 months?

1465
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,436
- Contract?
- Any.

1466
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,312
- Do the call plan.
- All right, mate.

1467
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,637
Easy, bro, easy.
I’m doing it for you.

1468
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,514
<i>- I think I’m going to go now, bro.
- Wait, Waj. What about girls?</i>

1469
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,234
I bet you like the ladies.

1470
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,396
Is this your first time, bro?

1471
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,476
Are you a virgin at this?

1472
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,991
Please, Waj,
can we talk about girls?

1473
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,429
You fill that out. Fill it out.

1474
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,710
- What sort of call plan would you like?
- What?

1475
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,910
We’ve got the Labrador?
The Dragon?

1476
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,270
- Just any?
- How about the Hermit Crab?

1477
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,755
- Huh?
- It’s 1800 free texts.

1478
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,949
Forget it.

1479
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,635
I’ve still got your card.

1480
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,592
OK, we can talk about girls.

1481
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,871
Right so what sort of girls
are you into, then, Waj?

1482
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,514
I don’t know.
Ones with big jubblies and that.

1483
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,437
<i>- Yeah? You like them big, Waj?
- Yeah.</i>

1484
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,915
And nice fit arses, too, man.

1485
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,315
You’re an arse man, aren’t you, Waj?

1486
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,795
<i>I knew you were, bro.
You 're an arse man.</i>

1487
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,831
<i>You 're a massive arse man.</i>

1488
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,952
- What are you saying?
- I’m saying you’re an arse man, Waj.

1489
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,311
You giving me batty chirps, bro?
You calling me a whammer?

1490
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,954
- No.
- Fuck off!

1491
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,475
Fucking Boy George!

1492
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,159
Don’t worry, brother Nabil.

1493
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,393
Hold on to these.

1494
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,873
When I press the clicker,

1495
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,309
just think about taking out the kuffar.

1496
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,237
You’ll be in paradise before me, bro!

1497
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,794
But there’s no kuffar here, bro.

1498
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,157
Yeah, but...

1499
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,918
Brother Faisal, he’s a martyr
and he only blew up a sheep.

1500
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,600
I think you might be confused, brother.

1501
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,519
I’m not.

1502
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,557
You look confused.

1503
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,711
Sorry. Matt!

1504
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,638
- Omar!
- Matt!

1505
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,033
Yeah, man, listen.
Have you got a signal on your phone?

1506
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,631
Yeah. What are you doing here?

1507
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,876
I’ll level with you Matt. I’m Ml5.

1508
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,514
Special undercover job. I’m a spook.

1509
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,039
What?

1510
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,878
So what’s going on?

1511
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,479
Fathers 4 Justice.

1512
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,959
They’ve teamed up with the Real IRA.
It’s the nightmare scenario.

1513
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,711
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Just give me five.

1514
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,597
(Mobile rings)

1515
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,312
Fucking 'number unknown ' again.

1516
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,749
Is that whammer cop
going straight to hell or what?

1517
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,038
- What are you doing?
- Hello?

1518
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,913
- Hello, Waj, bro. It’s Omar.
- Omar?

1519
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,950
Omar?

1520
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,798
- Waj.
- Tell me what to do, bro.

1521
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,718
I think I might be confused
but I’m not sure.

1522
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,512
Listen, bro.
You do what I do, right?

1523
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,993
You do the same as me, OK?

1524
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,997
Yes, brother, I’ll do the same as you.

1525
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,237
Right, OK.
I’m going give myself up, bro.

1526
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,396
- Eh?
- I’m going to give myself up, bro.

1527
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,109
(Crash)

1528
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,990
Waj? Waj!

1529
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,789
Waj? Waj?

1530
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,312
Brother, what am I?
What am I doing, brother?

1531
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,113
- Waj! Waj!
- What am I doing, brother?

1532
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,912
- Pick up the phone!
- Bro, what am I doing?

1533
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,598
All right, mate?

1534
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,598
I’m sorry, lads.
I don’t really know what I’m doing.

1535
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,873
What was that?

1536
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,312
What was that?

1537
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,510
Are you all right?

1538
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,915
(Police sirens in the distance)

1539
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,151
Omar, are you all right?

1540
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,431
Now, you stay here.
And you tell them I were smiling.

1541
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,993
What?

1542
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,190
Smile on my face.
Could be important.

1543
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,914
Right... Smile.

1544
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,112
- Is there?
- Yeah.

1545
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,317
Where are you going?

1546
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,791
Omar?

1547
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,871
This is RAF Mildenhall,

1548
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,150
but it’s actually Egypt.

1549
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,478
When you entered the base,
you left Britain,

1550
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,435
and you passed through US jurisdiction
and into this container,

1551
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,156
which is internationally recognised
as the sovereign territory of Egypt.

1552
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,559
You are now in Egypt.

1553
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,157
There are some pretty hellish Egyptians
behind that door there.

1554
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,829
They use electrodes. They use drills.

1555
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,758
Biro refills.
Do you know what I mean?

1556
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,519
I don’t know anything about my brother.

1557
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,557
We know a lot more
than you think we do.

1558
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:06,113
(Matt) All right, let’s get one thing straight.
Omar Khan had nothing to do with this.

1559
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,995
Cos I knew him and I worked with him.

1560
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,711
Did you know
he was actually working for Ml5?

1561
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,558
Cos he told me that himself.

1562
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,435
<i>The report makes crystal clear
that the police shot the right man,</i>

1563
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,870
<i>but, as far as I'm aware,
the wrong man exploded.</i>

1564
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,073
<i>Is that clear?</i>

1565
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,075
(Hassan)
Today you felt our exploding sword

1566
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,668
in your fat oppressor stomachs, man.

1567
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,031
<i>(Raps) We 're the muslimeen
and we 're making terrible scenes</i>

1568
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,754
<i>Now you wanna know
what the boom -boom means?</i>

1569
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,395
<i>It's like Tupac said:
"When I die, I ain’t dead</i>

1570
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,149
<i>"Fight and be slain,
die with no pain</i>

1571
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:56,592
<i>Got shaheed in my heed,
for my creed I daheed</i>

1572
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,076
<i>We are the martyrs,
you's just smashed tomatoes</i>

1573
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,237
<i>- Now we've got...
- (Waj) Bro? What were that?</i>

1574
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,476
<i>For my creed, I daheed</i>

1575
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,999
What’s 'daheed ', though?

1576
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,348
Died.

1577
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,630
- Daheed, died. Daheed.
- That’s bollocks, man.

1578
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,194
- You’re rhyming doolally.
- That’s clear, man.

1579
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,639
No, no, look. In my opinion...

1580
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,036
Look, no, man. In your opinion?
Your opinion’s shit, man.

1581
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,390
With all due respect, bro,
you like Maroon 5.

1582
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,953
What the fuck’s that about?

1583
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,354
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

1584
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,311
- Come here, man.
- I’m joking!

1585
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:47,709
When we talk about a so-called
terrorist attack on the London marathon,

1586
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,831
we should remember one thing:

1587
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,077
most loud bangs are not bombs,

1588
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,191
they’re scooters backfiring.

1589
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,832
<i>This footage,
taken from an American spy plane.</i>

1590
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,511
<i>appears to show two trainee Mujahideens
struggling with a rocket launcher.</i>

1591
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,313
<i>firing it at an Arab training camp</i>

1592
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,069
<i>and accidentally blowing up
Osama bin Laden.</i>

1593
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,751
The western imperialist culture
has left you like materialist junkies,

1594
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:34,078
mainlining iPods and Humvees
and TK Maxx into a spiritual void.

1595
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,430
Is Mad Qadeer watching this?

1596
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:41,076
- What?
- Mad Qadeer, cos he owes me £200.

1597
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,474
Mad Qadeer, if you’re watching, right,

1598
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,670
you owe me £200.

1599
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,518
And you’re gonna pay up.

1600
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,392
Cos I’m not here right now.

1601
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,159
I’m somewhere else,
but you’re still gonna pay.

1602
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,989
You’re going to pay Saf.
Saf, if you’re watching, bro,

1603
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,350
you go round Mad Qadeer’s house, right,

1604
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,268
and you get him to pay me my £200,
cos he’s owed it me a long time.

1605
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,919
He owes me money.
