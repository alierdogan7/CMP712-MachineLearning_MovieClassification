1
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey!
Hey bitch!

2
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey!
I'm gonna fuck you!

3
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Touch it, slut.
- Jesus.

4
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
See my dick!

5
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Guess what happened today, guys.

6
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Can any of you guess?

7
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Yuens fucked up big time.
Instead of watching the mall ...

8
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
like they're supposed to, they let a god damned
pervert come and show his fuckingcock ...

9
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to around 15 people.
So good job, guys.

10
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You fucked up big.
- Yeah, you've hurt Ronnie, and nobody hurts Ronnie.

11
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now apologize to him.
- Sorry.

12
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now you say that like you mean it.
- Ok. So sorry.

13
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That sounded like they're laughing on it.
- Guys, I need you to step it up!

14
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey guys, you want this?
You want to experience what this is?

15
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to see a lot more and I want to see it now.
- You will.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Get the fuck out of my face.

17
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you, man. That was great.
- My pleasure, man.

18
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm standing here at the Forest Ridge Mall ...

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
where earlier today a man exposed himself to
several women, before fleeing the scene.

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am here with Ronnie Barnhardt,
one of the security guards at the mall ...

21
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No. Cut! You fucked up.
Madam, I'm the head of the mall security, you should say it right.

22
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, Officer Barnhardt ...
- Action.

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right, is there any information
you can shed on the situation?

24
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So we just keep going, even
when you fucked up my title?

25
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay ,...
Well, I am standing here with this doctor ...

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, how do I ah steer you,
towards the oil-free foundation?

27
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She was like, 'Oh, yeah, I don't want a moisturizer...aaaa'

28
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,001
Oh shit...Oh shit...

29
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What were you guys talking about?
What were you saying to each other?

30
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So Ronnie, what is it you stopped by for?
- I'm sure you heard about this, but ...

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we had a pervert sexually assaults
several women in mall the parking lot.

32
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh really? A pervert?

33
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Yeah. So you know I just thought, to tell you,
you know, just to be careful...

34
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,000
...watching your comings and your goings.

35
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you think we are gonna be safe?
- Yes Bruce, I think you'll be just fine.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bruce wants to know if we will be safe.

37
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I actually gotta warn the pervert,
that Bruce is out there.

38
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Look at me, I'm Bruce.

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Look, is the pervert gonna get me?

40
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm just fucking with you Bruce.
- I think Ronnie that I'm, ah, I'm gonna be just fine.

41
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah well everyone thinks they're fine, until someone
puts something in there where they don't wanna 'ave 'em.

42
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well okay, I guess it's probably time to ...ck...ck...ck

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, okay I see you guys. You just...
...do your thing.

44
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What? Okay. I thought I heard you.

45
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So Ronnie, you talked with Mark
about lifting that firearm restriction?

46
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, yeah, we should be good soon.
But technically it's still ...

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The S50 just came out.
- No way?

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Semi Auto
5 rounds, removable magazine ...

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
33 inches long. It would be perfect
for you know, like the back of the golf cart.

50
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The new model, 1216,
carries 20 rounds of twelve inch gauged shotgun shells.

51
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Wait, wait, wait it holds 20 rounds?
I thought it was only 18.

52
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, 20.
- You're confirming for sure it was 20?

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, I'm confirming it was 20. That's confirming. Yes.
- Yes, indeed.

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well guys, we got tazers,
we got mace ...

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not bad, I guess it will have to do for a while.
- Yeah. Well..

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, still, it would be so much cooler
if we were able to carry guns.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Guns work best.

58
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I uh, I'd like to deliver a personal message
to this perverted individual.

59
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You show up again
and you see what happens, okay?

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will murder you.
I will fucking murder you!

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, no comment ...
- You're fucking dead!

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No comment was made as to identity of the assailant...

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I use mace and tazers and...
- ...as the story develops.

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ronnie, I'm so proud of you.

65
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You really think I did good?
- Hell yes.

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Your system ...

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're just screwed up, you're great.

68
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're just screwing with me.
- No, no.

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You did good.
You scared me. You're scary.

70
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know, Mom ...

71
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I got a confession to make.

72
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It sounds bad,
but ah...

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A part of me thinks this disgusting pervert
is the best thing that ever happened to me.

74
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And this is a real case, this is my chance
just to be great.

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I swear on my soul,
I'm gonna get to this guy.

76
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm gonna get him.

77
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm tired.

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Goodnight, Mom.
I love you.

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ronnie Barnhardt, head of
security here at the mall ...

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I saw your sign,
and I'd like to claim a free cup of coffee, please.

81
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let me just get that for you.

82
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you very much.

83
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So...you do your work here?
I remember someone with ah ...

84
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
...legwork in here.
- Yes, I just started last week.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I had to get an ankle surgery.

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have a protein defficiency.
- Oh, well.

87
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Keep your traffic area clear.
- Sorry. - Always.

88
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I disagree with his methods,
but that is a fire hazard.

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is there really a pervert here?
- Yes, yes madam, there is.

90
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's scary.
- Not for me, so much.

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's actually kinda my job to put myself
in harm's way to protect weaker people ...

92
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
such as yourself, who are you know crippled and the leg and whatnot ...
- Oh, my cast is going off in like a month.

93
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I do it so other people can
sleep well at night...

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
meanwhile I'm up all night fighting demons.

95
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ha ha, just screaming bloody murder.
Waking up with nosebleeds ...

96
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
night terrors, finding myself miles away
from home, blood on my feet and with a gun in my hand ...

97
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and no idea how I got there.

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But pound for pound, I'd say there not one human being at this mall,
that deserves this coffee as much as myself.

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll be seeing you around, getting more of this.
Maybe a cinnamon roll or something like that.

100
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I will be here.

101
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stay safe then.

102
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Touch daddy's dick.

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It was horrible.

104
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It just keeps playing
over and over in my head.

105
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I can't press stop.

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It is on repeat.
- Are you okay, Brandi?

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Physically yes.

108
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Psychologically no!

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Brandi!

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Perimeter!
Are you okay?

111
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Jesus Christ, I came as soon as I heard.
I am so sorry.

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Everybody should've been protecting you.
This is not your fault.

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ronnie, can you do me a favor and
bring her down to my office?

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So that the police can talk to her privately.
- Roger, no problem.

115
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I obviously can't walk.
I'm in shock.

116
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay. Of course you are.

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You don't have to walk.

118
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, my back!

119
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Detective. Detective, can you give us a statement
as to the identity of the pervert?

120
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No comment.

121
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Just stay with me, Brandi,
just stay with me.

122
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I know it was horrible,
but don't think about his penis.

123
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I uh, the secretary told me to come in.
I'm detective Harrison, Conway police.

124
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Mark Peoples, I'm the manager of this mall.

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is Brandi, she's the one who saw his penis.
- Hey, Brandi, are you doing okay?

126
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm pretty shaken up.
- Brandi ...

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I am here to tell you that we're gonna work together
and make sure catch the guy who did this

128
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.
- Ronnie Barnhardt.

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Head of mall security.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Chief inspector this is my lieutenant Dennis.
- All right, gentlemen.

131
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did you get a look of the guy?
- Yes.

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you remember anything specific?
Was he tall, short, black, white ...

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
color of the hair?
- He was white...

134
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tall.

135
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
chubby and blonde.
- Pretty blonde or ...

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and ugly. Ugly blonde.
- And ugly blonde.

137
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know what, I think this is good enough for now.
Alright I think the best thing to do at this point...

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm gonna go talk to the other ladies,
who saw the guy ...

139
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ha!
- What? Now what?

140
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Forgive me for saying, but you just sound so much like a cop,
it's paperwork, it's procedures, ...

141
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What I want to know
who's gonna protect Brandi?

142
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's clear to me she's being targetted here.

143
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why are you saying that? What gives you that impression?
- A: She's the prettiest girl in this entire mall, maybe the world.

144
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
B: It is clear that this pervert
is some kind of a sociopathic genius...

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Who plans to come back here and finish
what he started. By murdering Brandi.

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh my god! Is that gonna happen?
- Yes, it's gonna happen.

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, that's not gonna happen.
- He will murder you, Brandi.

148
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, no it's not...
- Oh my god! Am I gonna die?

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You will die.
- I have to get going, okay?

150
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will give you my card here,
call me when you're off work here.

151
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then we're coming to the station,
and we'll do some mugshots.

152
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't worry, okay?
- Yes.

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Your hair is all messy.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Talk to you soon.

155
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thanks, Detective.
I feel a lot better.

156
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, we all feel a lot better. Thanks a lot.

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Alright. Have a nice day.

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
One question, what the fuck was that, Mark?
- What are you talking about, Ronnie?

159
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're gonna let some fucking hot shot, punk
come in here and take my fucking case?

160
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I just want this all thing to be over as soon as possible, okay?

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I feel a little bit goddamn under-appreciated around here, you sellout!

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay.
- This is my gig, not yours.

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Not his!
Mine.

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay folks, everybody listen okay. Ronnie has
a very important announcement ...

165
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
it's been a tough day for him, it's been tough for
his spirit, so everybody just be very respectful.

166
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you, Dennis.

167
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Listen, you are all under strict orders,
to do everything in your power ...

168
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
to bring down this pervert.
You report to me and only me ...

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but most importantly,
do not say a word about this to the police!

170
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, forget the police.
I'm in charge of this.

171
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Okay. You know I have to go back to work soon cause I'm,
I'm still technically employed by ...

172
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's not even officially on the team yet,
and he thinks he's got it all figured out.

173
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Here, this is how it's gonna break down.
Dennis, you're my second in command.

174
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're my right hand man.
- Thank you very much, I've always wanted that position.

175
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But I didn't wanted extra pressure
on our friendship, so thank you very much.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're welcome.

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yuens, you are my infantry,
you're expendable.

178
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If one of you dies,
God gave me another one.

179
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Awesome.
- Charles, your position is that of a student.

180
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Are we gonna get paid extra for this,
because it seems like...

181
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
...that we get nothing extra.
- Let me ask you something.

182
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
How much were they paid
to storm the Normandy?

183
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How much was King Arthur getting paid
to kill Merlin?

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How much were they getting paid
to invent the television?

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Nothing.

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They did it because they knew it
was right. Now put our hands together for the final cheer.

187
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, you Charles.
- This is a lot for me to take in.

188
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I just, I'm not sure if I can ...
- Don't be scared.

189
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm not scared, it's just that ...

190
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ssshhh! Use my strength.
- What?

191
00:16:55,000 --> 00:18:07,000
On three. One, two, three.
Special Unit Task Force.

192
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Fuck!

193
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Guys, hold this in evidence.
Bag and tag it, get it to my office.

194
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm Detective Harrison of the Conway police,
I'm gonna need to ask you some questions, okay?

195
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Have you noticed anything suspicious going on around here?

196
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Someone who might have been hanging around the place,
that you've never seen before...

197
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
or what we call casing the place?
- Not really. - Suspicious, no?

198
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What about co-workers? Any disgruntled employees?
Someone who might have been excessivelly complaining about the job? Anything like that.

199
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Not more than usual.
- Yes, that's that.

200
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Alright, well. Good. Thank you.

201
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Ronnie Barnhardt, head of mall security.
Who robbed this shoe store?

202
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, no, I need you to wait down in the hallway.
- I really don't know who did it.

203
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Detective Harrison here seems to be to blinded by
your beauty to ask the right questions.

204
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Who robbed this shoe store?
Who the fuck robbed this shoe store?

205
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's okay. Sarah, thank you
for your help. I appreciate it. Okay?

206
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Que pasa, Ramon?

207
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,001
***

208
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
Como?

209
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:09,001
***

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I see.

211
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This guy fucking did it.

212
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What did he say?

213
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but
you know, look at his face ...

214
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's reflection, it's the tone of his voice, it's...
Look at his eyes.

215
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,901
***

216
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I know who did it.
- You do, huh? - Mhm.

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Big time.
- Alright, who did it?

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Check it out.

219
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You know what those are?
- No.

220
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You know you take a bubble bath, and cover
your little breasts with some bubbles.

221
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Excuse me, I'm Detective
Harrison of the Conway police.

222
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh shit! Yeah, I wasn't
touching her in bad way or anything ...

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Someone has robbed the shoe store last night,
I'm just asking around to see if anybody noticed anything.

224
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Alright you need to get the fuck out of here. Scoot, scoot.
- Have you noticed any suspicious characters hanging around the mall?

225
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Maybe someone who looked like they were casing the place?
- No, I haven't seen shit.

226
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What's up, Saddam?
- What the fuck do you want, Ronnie?

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I want you to face the fucking music is what I want!
- I have an restraining order against you ...

228
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So why don't you take this opportunity to back the fuck up.
- Ronnie, come on, let's go.

229
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You're taking my case, Harrison.
- Well you said you have proof!

230
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You've got a restraining order?
Okay, shit, let's go.

231
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Just look, just fucking look at him,
that's all the proof I need.

232
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's racist, man.
- Racism has got nothing to do with it, you fit the profile.

233
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh just like I fit the profile of the pervert?
- How do we know you are not the pervert?

234
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
My dick is brown, you dumb motherfucker!

235
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's go...
- What you should do is arrest this fucking clown. He comes here and harrases me every day.

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Last week, he comes here and tells me he discovered my plot
to blow up the Chicken fillet.

237
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why the fuck would I blow up the Chicken fillet?
It's fucking delicious.

238
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Come on, come on, let's go.
- I'll go.

239
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But before I will tell you,
I've got your number ...

240
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
so you should know that I know
that you did that shit.

241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Fuck you, Ronnie.
- Fuck you.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Fuck you, Sadam Hussein of Iraq.
- Fuck you.

243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

244
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So? You find anything?

245
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I found out quite a bit, actually.

246
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like what?
- A few clues ...

247
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
put up a list of suspects, and I think the answer
to the whole damn case.

248
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We didn't find anything.

249
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have also found out that ...

250
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Detective Harrison over here,
not quite a detective...

251
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
...he makes himself out to be.
Also interesting is ...

252
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
...not really enough room for
two coooks in the kitchen.

253
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're not a cook.
- I'm a cook.

254
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I'm a servant of justice.
- You are a security guard.

255
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hot plates of justice.
- That's it, you motherfucker!

256
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
All the day I'm listening to your bullshit!
We didn't find anything today because of you!

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You'e fucking my investigation
and you're wasting my time!

258
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Now I gotta come back to this shithole ...

259
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to interview the people
who might have actually done the crime!

260
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I hate you! I hate you so much!
You fucking faggot!

261
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're useless,
you're a fucking rent-a-cop!

262
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You might think you're a real cop,
but you're not!

263
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You know why? Because
you're a fucking retard!

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Use your inside voice, you know?

265
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He can't hear.

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Is there a recruitment office?
- Yes, there is. Come on in, take a seat.

267
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
How can I help you?

268
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I was actually looking into requirements of what exactly does it take
to be a police officer, like yourself.

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you interested in joining
the force?

270
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I was kinda curious mostly, why?
Do you see something in me?

271
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
There are several tests to complete in order to be eligible for police academy.
- Lay it on me.

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Physical evaluation.
- Done.

273
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Psychological tests.
- Easy.

274
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And a background check.
- Boom.

275
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Now when someone is interested in a police work 
they're usually recommended a 'Ride-along" first.

276
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
A "Ride-along"?
- Yes.

277
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's where you actually ride along a real
police officer on a routine patrol.

278
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ask a question, get an answer.
You have a helluva system down here.

279
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you for your time, sir.
- Well, if you are interested ...

280
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I can give you the forms to take home,
so you can get that background checks done.

281
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay.
- Cool, alright, let's do it.

282
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, I don't know, mmmm, errr....
- There you go.

283
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Perfect.

284
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Good morning, Nell.
- Hey, Ronnie.

285
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Cream and sugar, right?
- That's right.

286
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't mean to insult you in any way, did
you do something different with the coffee?

287
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Um, no, the same as always.
- Different roast?

288
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Do you want me to make you a new one?
- No, no, it's okay.

289
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Just a little different, I guess.

290
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Funny, it feels weird, I filled out all those police application 
forms last night.

291
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They probably just stood me up a bit, you know.
- Are you applying to be a police officer?

292
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Did I say that out loud?

293
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Totally slipped out, don't tell anyone, 
I just don't really want it getting out there you know.

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I won't.
- Okay.

295
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But I think you should know that
there is no shame in going after your dreams.

296
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So many people do that.

297
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And I think you should keep doing it,
no matter how many people laugh at you.

298
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Who's laughing at me?
Noone laughs at me!

299
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If anyone is getting fun out of other idiots,
who're trying to do what they want...

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
noone laughs at me.

301
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm trying to fulfill my destiny,
that's not how this works.

302
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Sorry about that, alright.
- Save your 'sorries' for someone sad.

303
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Put your 'sorries' in a sack, and give it
to someone who needs 'em.

304
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Not me.

305
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I see you later, Nell.
Thanks, this ...

306
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I see you guys later.
You guys are really cool.

307
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hello, Detective Harrison.
- What the fuck!

308
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You scared me the shit out of me, Ronnie.

309
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What the fuck are you doing here?

310
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You're my 'Ride-Along", you know
I figured...

311
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
your coming to the mall,
you're trying to steal my shine ...

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
it's only fair if I do the same to you.
- Alright, I need you to get the fuck out of the car, now.

313
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, can't do. Every citizen
is allowed a "Ride-Along" ...

314
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and I am well within my rights plus I'm taking the liberty
of clearing this with captain, so ...

315
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Here's the part where I tell you
that payback is a bitch...

316
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And the only thing you're left to say 
after that, is...boom.

317
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You wanna see what I do?
- I would love nothing more than to see what you think you do.

318
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll show you.

319
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
See that corner there, Ronnie?
- Yeah, I see that, yes.

320
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That corner used to be the worst corner in the city.

321
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Nicknamed the 'Cross Roads'.
- No shit, I've actually heard of that.

322
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah, for sure you have.

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Myself and the other officers we've worked 
for years on cleaning it up.

324
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That hasn't been easy.
We still patrol the area to keep the presence up.

325
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Totally understand.
I use the same technique in the mall.

326
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm sure you do.
I usually do the foot patrols myself.

327
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
How about you do it tonight.

328
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You know what, I think we've got on 
on a wrong foot.

329
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This is my way of making it up to you.
What do you say?

330
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Um, this...I'm touched.

331
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That's, that's really, really nice of you.
That's, I'd love to, it'd be an honor.

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Sir, I won't let you down.
- You ready?

333
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm ready, I'll get to it.
- Go get 'em. - Okay.

334
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hey, where are you going?

335
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Hey, Harrison!
Harrison, where are you...Harrison! Harrisooooon!

336
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay, okay.

337
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What the fuck am I doing...

338
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Alright, kids. No harsh play.
Get on home. It's late.

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hey playa, are you looking for that crack?

340
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Am I looking for that crack?

341
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
As in crack cocaine?

342
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You just offered to sell me a schedule one narcotic.
That's felony. That's five to ten years.

343
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Boom! You're under citizen's arrest.
- Let go of me, asshole.

344
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I will not let you go, motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

345
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're gonna learn things in jail,
you didn't even know existed...

346
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I just have to wait
for my partner to get back ...

347
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That should be any second.
- Get your hands off him.

348
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What?
- You heard me, that's my son, motherfucker.

349
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This little guy over here?
- This is my motherfucking seed right here.

350
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You see I got 'im on my motherfucking chest? - I see that.
I don't just tatoo any motherfucker on my chest.

351
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
This is my lifeline,
my legacy.

352
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, I really don't wanna break this to you,
cause you seem to love him ...

353
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but it seems like your son just tried to sell me some little drugs.
- Rico just tried to sell you some drugs?

354
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's some crazy shit.
Ain't that some crazy shit? - That's some fucking...

355
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's not too crazy though.
Because he works for me, you stupid motherfucker.

356
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
More bad news, you're gonna
need to find yourself a new employee ...

357
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Cause I'm taking him downtown.
- Oh, for real?

358
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Well you're gonna need to find a new motherfucking head.
- You're right, you're free to go, kid.

359
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Good luck with the crack.

360
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Have a good life.
- Yeah, get home Rico.

361
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Do your motherfucking homework.
Rico, get home!

362
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I'll catch you guys later. Thank you very much.
- You're sending him home?

363
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Motherfucker, don't tell me what to do,
how may motherfuckers have you killed?

364
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
None. I've killed two,
so shut the fuck up.

365
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, oh god...

366
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Is that a crime?
Oh, look at little bitch.

367
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It was a mistake, okay? Just don't do it.
- You know what I should do?

368
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I should make you suck this gun
like a dick.

369
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And when it comes, it's gonna blow
your brains all over street.

370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Look in your heart.
- Alright, pop a cap in his ass, right now.

371
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't motherfucking believe this, you're gonna
seriously sit here and fucking talk to me?

372
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm just saying...
- Yeah, you just say it once.

373
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I can not believe you fucking
took him to the 'Cross Roads'.

374
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's ridiculous.
- Fuck me, you would have done the same thing.

375
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I mean it's bad enough I had to spend 
the whole day with him at the mall.

376
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And now he's gonna show up at my fucking job.
- Yeah but he will probably gonna get killed.

377
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Good, I hope he does get killed,
fuck him I don't care.

378
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm telling ya, I hate this guy.
I hate him more than ...

379
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You sit the fuck down, you hear me! You sit the fuck down!
Don't fucking talk back to me!

380
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The fuck I thought, asshole.
- You.

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I know what you did.

382
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You set me up, you left me out there and 
that's all there is to it. Admit it!

383
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah, I set you up.

384
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What you gonna do about it, Ronald, huh?

385
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna thank you.

386
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What are you talking about you're gonna thank me?

387
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I knew you wanted to see
if I have the chops to be a police officer ...

388
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and I did it man! I did it!

389
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And there are six dead crackheads
that can confirm that.

390
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Thank you detective Harrison, from the bottom of my heart,
thank you...

391
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
...for believing in me.
- I don't know what to say.

392
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Shhh, don't say anything.

393
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Your actions say more than
words ever could.

394
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I always wanted a cop,
I didn't want to admit it, but ...

395
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you knew.

396
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You knew.

397
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I need more.

398
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Get used to seeing
Ronnie Barnhardt around here.

399
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Boo! Fuck you!

400
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Cadets, ready!

401
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Move aside.

402
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Fuck!
- Where you running, girl?

403
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You scared the shit out of me!

404
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Forgot where you car was, huh?

405
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Well move over.

406
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Brandi. 
Brandi, Brandi, Brandi.

407
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Okay Brandi, I'm gonna lay out a scenario for you.

408
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You, me, free dinner.

409
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You fill in the rest,
with the answer 'yes'.

410
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There is my car.
- Huh, what?

411
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Where are you going?
- What, sorry, the brakes, did someone cut the brakes?

412
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh my God!
- I can't stop!

413
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm just joking. I can stop,
but I'm not going to, unless ...

414
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You agree to go to dinner with me.
So you better say yes ...

415
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and tell me what you want to eat for dinner.
- Fine, motherfucker.

416
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Alright, pick me up next Friday night.
- It's a date.

417
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
No, it's not a fucking date.
Just don't tell to anybody.

418
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Don't.
- No, you don't.

419
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Listen, okay I've told you,
if you're gonna sit up here ...

420
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you gotta keep this counter clean.
- Now, I can't reach that far.

421
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
"I can't reach that far coz of my thing ..."
"If only I had a stick ..."

422
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
"or something that would extend my reach ..."

423
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
like the eight stick objects that are behind this counter!
Think outside the box!

424
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm so sorry Roger, I'm gonna do better.
I'm sorry.

425
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, two sorries. Oh, I thought
those would clean the counter.

426
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
but they don't, because, guess
I'm fucking dumb.

427
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Cup of coffee, please.
- Hey, Ronnie.

428
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Is there something wrong?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

429
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I did see you wearing ring on your finger,
are you married by any chance?

430
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This ring? No, I'm not married, it's...
I'm married to God.

431
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It just means I'm waiting for
a marriage before I'm with a man.

432
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So you're a virgin?

433
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Technically I'm a born-again virgin.

434
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I mean, we've all been
to "Beach Week", right?

435
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean so yeah, I'm a virgin again.
Why do you ask?

436
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, no reason, um...

437
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Well, actually uh...

438
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I kinda have a hot date set with Brandi, 
from the make-up counter.

439
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So I thought if you were married, you might have some insides into 
relationships, maybe tell me what I should wear on a date, but...

440
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
No, you know what, nevermind, uh..

441
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What you just said is kinda weird...

442
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't think you're the best
person to be giving the advice on this so...

443
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah...
- You're right, yeah, it's been awhile, sorry.

444
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But, the coffee is delicious.
You should get married to this.

445
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Okay, well thank you.
- No problem.

446
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Hey Ronnie.
- Yes?

447
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I think you should dress like yourself.

448
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes, like I said, not the
best person to be taking advice from, on....

449
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Come on, Ronnie, just get out here.
- It's too tight on the butt.

450
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Let me see.

451
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Ronnie, you look so handsome.

452
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't I look like a phoney?
- Heavens no.

453
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This girl's gonna be knocked on her socks.

454
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's kinda of a cool outfit, I...
- Way cool.

455
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That girl must be really special.

456
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh god she is, Mom.
She's the most beautiful girl in the whole world.

457
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You know, I remember when your father
picked me up for our first date.

458
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I swear he was the most
handsome man I ever laid eyes on.

459
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I knew right there and then that,
I would fuck him that night and that I...

460
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
will end up marrying him.

461
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I sure hope that
happens to me tonight.

462
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh, well, Ronnie, I just know that.

463
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Mom.

464
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why did dad leave?

465
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, he kinda freaked out 
when you were born.

466
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You've had so many special needs ...

467
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He just, couldn't handle the pressure.

468
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I guess he couldn't take it anymore.

469
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You think it was my fault,
that dad left?

470
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Definitely.

471
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I love you, Ronnie.
- I love you too.

472
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Let me out.

473
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
See you later, sweetie.
- Fuck you, Taylor!

474
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
My God!

475
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Hi.
- Well, hello.

476
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
What are you doing here?

477
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
W were supposed to have dinner tonight.

478
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I forgot.
- It's okay, I didn't.

479
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, well, it's pretty late.

480
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I made several dinner reservations
so will get table no matter what.

481
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Well I gotta pee first.

482
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Good.

483
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Do you want me to come, should I...
Yeah, I'll just wait out here.

484
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That was impressive,
you drive like you drink, fast too.

485
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Wait, watch this.

486
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Nurse!

487
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Nurse, can I get another?

488
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Wait, this is on you, right?
- Oh yeah, I got it all, I got it all.

489
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Nurse, four shots of tequila, okay?

490
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think it's very funny to
call a waitress a nurse.

491
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Nurse.

492
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Brandi, I'm just dying to know how
much you like working in this mall?

493
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh god, I hate that shop.
- Me too, I fucking hate it.

494
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean it's just the bitching all day long ...

495
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I put make-up on these fat-ass women ...

496
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and you know what, like my mama always said, 
"you can polish a turd but it's still a piece of shit"

497
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Exactly.
- Anyway ...

498
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that's a fucking mall.
- That is such an incredible....

499
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Hold up. What the fuck is that?

500
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What is that? What is that?
- Let me see. Don't be stingy.

501
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Come here.

502
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It is a pill that I should take.
- Oh my god where did you get these?

503
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
From my doctor.
- Colozapam, that 's the good stuff.

504
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I am impressed.
I did not know you party like that.

505
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I do, I do a lot of party, 
I party like this every 4-6 hours.

506
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Can I have one?

507
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Really?
- Come on, please.

508
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Come on, Ronnie. Come on.

509
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,501
You know what. You can take the whole thing.
Take all of 'em.

510
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I don't think I need them anymore.
Everything is going great in my life now right now.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Just like it is with you and this cop thing ...

512
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
These pills just kinda keep me here,
but right now ...

513
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I just ... I just need to...

514
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know, that's what I need right now.
I'm on this..

515
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And noone is stopping me from doing this so,
consider this my gift to you.

516
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh yes.
- Yes.

517
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Can I ask something?
- Yes, anything.

518
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I thought this dinner's gonna suck.
- Me too, why?

519
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I was like, weird guy at the mall,
asking me out.

520
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh my God.

521
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But now I got all this crap. Thank you.

522
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
All right.
- Shots!

523
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yes! Shots!

524
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Down the hatch...

525
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
To eternal life ...

526
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
together.
- Fuck you.

527
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay.
- Come on bitch.

528
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh my God, that burns so good.

529
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh yes.

530
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh yes, again.

531
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You're so fucking gorgeous.

532
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Brandi, this has just been a magical evening,
an amazing...

533
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I think I gotta say congratulations,
we, we hit to the next level, you know.

534
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
We did it together.
- I'm gonna be...

535
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Are you okay?

536
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I kinda need a mint or something
My breath tastes like shit.

537
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Brandi.

538
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I accept you.

539
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:52,001
Oh. Brandi. Oh god, Brandi.
Brandi! Brandi?

540
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Why are you stopping, motherfucker?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, god, I'm sorry.

541
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay, Ronnie. Today, I'll be giving you
a psychiatric evaluation ...

542
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to determine if you're competent
to enter to the police academy.

543
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So let's start with your background.
Where're you from?

544
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Born and raised right here, actually.
- A local boy, okay.

545
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And Ronnie, do you have a history of depression,
or psychosis, or anything like that?

546
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Uh, yeah, but nothing really worth mentioning. 
Just a little bi-polar disorder, no big deal.

547
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh, uh, are you taking any prescription medications?
- I am pleased to announce that I am currently off of prescription medications.

548
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Congratulations. Why did
the doctors take you off?

549
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
They didn't.

550
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
How are you feeling?
- Great, actually.

551
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I met a girl,
we're in love, so that...

552
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that is very good. 
This close to catching this pervert.

553
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Catching a robber.
Just generally becoming a man.

554
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So at this point in my life,
I just feel I can destroy some motherfuckers.

555
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Okay, I'm just gonna write that down.
- Yes, write it all down.

556
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay, why do you want to become a police officer?

557
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's the big question now, is it?

558
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I have a dream.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Most nights.

560
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It starts on a playground,
there's kids, they're swinging ...

561
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
laughing, dogs barking,
there's butterflies flapping their little wings...

562
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And then you hear a rumbling.

563
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And over the horizon comes a
black cloud.

564
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And it's made of cancer ...

565
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
puss, starts seeping on the playground ...

566
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They start screaming and clawing their eyes,
and pulling at their hair, and say ...

567
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
"Help, what do we do?"

568
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know whats happens next?

569
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Out steps me, wielding the biggest fucking
shotgun that you've ever seen in your life...

570
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and you know what I do?
I blow every fucking thing away.

571
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And I am getting God's work done.

572
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
When it's all over, the dust is settled
the whole world gathers below me ...

573
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and say "Thank you, Ronnie, thank you for helping".

574
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Being a great man,
and doing it for us.

575
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And you know what I say, "You don't need to thank me.
Yeah, I am just a guy with a gun."

576
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
"I'm just a cop."
- Okay.

577
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That should do it.

578
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Thank you for your time, Mr. Barnhardt.
- Eh! I think you mean officer Barnhardt.

579
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
To Ronnie! Yeeeeaaa...Ronnie.
- Thanks.

580
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Ronnie Barnhardt got called up
to the big league.

581
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You're finally gonna get to carry a gun
and everyting.

582
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's awesome Ronnie.
- Ronnie, I'm so proud of you.

583
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Thanks, mommy, thanks for this cake.
It's incredible.

584
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It is, it's a gun.
- Oh yes.

585
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
My little baby.

586
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm so happy for you.
I think the White House will be the next stop.

587
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I mean I think you could be that big, Ronnie.
- That's ok.

588
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm so happy for you...What is this?
- For your tears.

589
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well thank you, brown-eyes.

590
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You know, when Ronnie was in um ah high-school ...

591
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I used to fuck all his friends.
- Okay, Mom.

592
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
O damn.
- It's that awesome thing right there.

593
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yes, that's the thing here.
Yes, I think, right there.

594
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This'll tingle just a little bit,
but you'll get used to it.

595
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Do you feel that?

596
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Wait for me.

597
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Ronnie, wait.

598
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Just don't say anything. I'm gonna give it away.
- It's gonna be okay, buddy. - I know, I know, I know...

599
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, come in.

600
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Hello brother!
- Ronnie ...

601
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
How is it going, amico?
- Have a sit.

602
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
How you doing.
- I'm great, just..nice, yeah.

603
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't usually do this kind of thing, but I um ...

604
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I wanna be the one to give you the news.

605
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And then see your face
when you found out.

606
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Very good sir, I appreciate that.
Thank you, sir.

607
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Um, we're not gonna be able to let you join
the academy.

608
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That's not possible, so, yeah,
that's not true.

609
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Seems you've had little trouble passing
the minimum requirements.

610
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Did I fail one of the tests?
- Oh yeah, actually you did, you failed the psychological exam.

611
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I remember she put a big A plus sign on it,
and I passed and that was me.

612
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So you know, I have passed that test. - Really?
Yeah, I've passed the shit out of it.

613
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It says right here. Mr. Barnhardt
shows warning signs of delusion.

614
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Allowing him to join the force at
this time, puts his life ...

615
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and the lives of others in jeopardy.

616
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I don't um, I don't see how this is possible.

617
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You have problems.
- You know, we can handle this, we can figure this out.

618
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I know this is hard
to hear ...

619
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So uh, I thought this is
gonna be kinda funny, but ...

620
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's actually kinda sad.
So I'll catch you later, Harrison.

621
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So, I tried talking to them,
but there's just no way they're gonna let you in.

622
00:50:35,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So you wanting to become a police officer,
is just not gonna happen.

623
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I am Nell.
- Do you want some of my buns?

624
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yeah, getting toaster off, my leg broke. Beep.
Damn, why did I left on the frigging fire?

625
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Hey, I thought you're
gonna go work for the police?

626
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You know I made it and I tried it out for a few days
and it's just not it, it wasn't for me.

627
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So. So I just come back here.
I don't wanna talk about it.

628
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
No problem, Ronnie.

629
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Hey, you want a cup of coffee?
- No.

630
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No, I don't think I do.

631
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
No offense to you, but I'm
gonna have to refuse your coffee.

632
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You know, coffee seems disgusting to me.

633
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:16,000
In fact right now, I don't think I want anything less
in a whole wide world than a cup of your coffee, so, no thank you!

634
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Okay, on a second thought, okay, yeah, sure, I'll have a cup of coffee ...
- Roger is so mean to me.

635
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Who is Roger? - The manager,
he hates me, because I can't walk.

636
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
He jokes about me with that girl, 
about how lazy I am.

637
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Well you know, I'm not lazy. The only reason
that I am sitting in this chair is, is my leg.

638
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I wanna quit and I can't,
cause I don't have any money.

639
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
There's doctors and there's insurance and stuff.

640
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Okay, you can't come back here!

642
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Go get in there! Get in there now! You
like making fun of people?

643
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No, I don't.
- You like making fun of people?

644
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
If you're gonna say one more thing to Nell
I'm gonna fucking murder you!

645
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And you too!

646
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I was never here, okay?
- Okay.

647
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I just wanted to let know it's really
good to have you back.

648
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Hey! What the hell are you
doing?

649
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Okay, you put a foot on my car, 
what are you doing?

650
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Just try to calm down... - Louder!
- I won't calm down!

651
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Just...Calm the fuck down!
- Fuck you!

652
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
If you don't take this foot off my car,
I'm gonna start whooping some ass in here ...

653
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Okay, get your tazer.
- You have no right to put a tazer on me!

654
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Can you get your fucking tazer!
Charles.. - Alright, alright...

655
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Fuck! - How hard is that?
That's the easiest thing on earth.

656
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I got another one right here, motherfucker.

657
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Hey Ronnie, how's it going?

658
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Think we found something that might cheer you up. Yeah.
- What's that?

659
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
To clear the pervert case.

660
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We found it next to the dumpsters.

661
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Okay Ronnie, I expected a little more of a reaction.

662
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm not okay Charles...

663
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
and ...um, unfortunately no, 
this picture of a penis does not cheer me up.

664
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay, guys, we should probably be getting back to work.

665
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Well, Ronnie, just, take it easy.

666
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I don't know what's happening to me Dennis,
I feel like I'm losing it.

667
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:54,000
A change is coming. I used to think
I was the only thing between the light and the darkness.

668
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But you know what I realize now?
This is who I am.

669
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Take me in, Dennis,
don't look away.

670
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Ronnie, can you please take that dick
off your face?

671
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
See, I'm real glad that you opened up to me

672
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Cause it makes me like, open up my heart.

673
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You know what I'm saying, I like to share and that stuff, that's definitely 
happening to me because I use to be like you.

674
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I fell into that, world of pretend.

675
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And that's when you gotta smarten up...

676
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
...and cut somebody sometimes.

677
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You may think that I float,
maybe even walk on water and stuff.

678
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But I mean to tell you that sometimes I
drink outta volcano...

679
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I know how to...to deal with the system.

680
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I know how to fuck with it,
I just gotta ask you, Ronnie.

681
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Are you willing to accept
what I have to teach?

682
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I am ready.
- Do you want me to show you the way?

683
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Show me the path.
- Can I lead you, please?

684
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Lead me.
- I'm gonna put you in my pocket.

685
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Guide me.
- You're in my hands.

686
00:56:02,000 --> 00:57:26,000
When do we start?
- Right now.

687
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ronnie.
There's nothing good about this at all.

688
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You okay, Dennis?

689
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I need to get back to work.

690
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Dennis.
- Yes, Ronnie?

691
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I've got to thank you man, you know, like 
I felt like shit this morning and now ...

692
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You showed I don't need to take things so seriously.

693
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So negative.
- We gotta a fucking meaningless existence.

694
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Sometimes it don't make shit.
- Who cares though, right? -Who cares, that's what I'm saying.

695
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It doesn't matter, and you know what I'm just glad I
finally have a partner in crime man.

696
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, wow, man. 
You dropped the p-ball on me man.


697
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Feels so good to hear you say that.
You know, I've never had a partner.

698
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I love you!
- I love you too.

699
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh, but you haven't seen the best part yet, man.
Cause when everybody leaves this place...

700
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I rob the shit out of them motherfuckers.

701
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
What are you talking about?
- What do you mean, what I steal shit!

702
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Are you the one who's been robbing the vault?

703
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I got the code ...

704
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
...from the security cam.

705
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Right in front of my face?
- Right in front of your fucking face!

706
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You guys didn't even realize it.

707
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Ronnie, this is beautiful.

708
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Dennis, I can't, I can't be a part of this.
- I thought you said you wanted a partner?

709
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
No.

710
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I can't do that.

711
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
What has this place ever done for you, man
don't you see

712
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
they treat people here as jokes,
doesn't that hurt your feeling?

713
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

714
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah, it really does, but I can't ...
- Well suit yourself, Ronnie.

715
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You can be a slave,
I've already told you.

716
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I am a motherfucking outlaw.
- Please stop Dennis, we're best friends, man.

717
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's just stop this, we'll go grab a beer.

718
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
This all, let's just pretend this never happened.
I won't say a fucking word about this, man, let's just go.

719
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Ronnie, you're right.
Ronnie, you're as right as hell.

720
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What was I thinking? Robbing the mall
and taking the jewelry.

721
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
What was all that about?
- I don't know, man.

722
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You're right man, let's go get a beer.
- Yes!

723
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Thank you, man.
And honestly?

724
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I will never say a word about this thing,
people make mistakes.

725
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,000
No, it's no problem, man.- You're a real good friend.
Like I said, we're friends, you know so let's just...

726
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Fuck, Dennis.
How could you, man?

727
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
How could you not know it was Dennis?
And how could you be so stupid to let him get away ...

728
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and in a fucking carnival car, of all things?

729
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Well, may I speak now?
- Go ahead.

730
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I found this.
That's the pervert's penis.

731
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
He's still in this mall. He's just
laying low and waiting for a new opportunity to pounce.

732
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Alright, well I'll turn this over to the police.
- You will not give that to the police!

733
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I don't think you understand, Mark.

734
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Look, I let Dennis get away,
that's something I'll have to live with.

735
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But when I finally find out whose that penis is ...

736
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
that's my last shot at redemption.
- Let's just hope he doesn't show up again, alright?

737
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Oh he's coming back. He's coming
back quick and he's coming back hard.

738
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What are you talking about, Ronnie?
- I'm talking about deep cover op...

739
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
...I'm talking about black op shit,
I'm talking about going off the grid completely.

740
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I am the spectre,
the invisible man.

741
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Just a reguar guy in the mall,
I got no rules to follow.

742
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Just got myself and my instincts.

743
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Are you fucking retarded, Ronnie?
- Ronnie doesn't even exist.

744
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
My name is Bill Jacobsen.

745
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Just an average mall customer ...

746
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
came to the Forest Ridge Mall,
do some personal shopping.

747
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Hey, you know where's sales are?

748
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
This is my mall.

749
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's a place of beauty.
A place of purity.

750
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's s place where lost souls
get find a home.

751
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Fuck you, Ronnie! Nice hat,
you stupid motherfucker.

752
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I believe every man has a path
laid out before him.

753
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And my path is a righteous one.

754
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
For I have been chosen to be a protector.

755
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And the destroyer.

756
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I live by a code ...

757
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
a code of my own invention,
but a code nonetheless.

758
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And I follow it to the fucking T.

759
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Danger lurks in the darkness, waiting
to pounce.

760
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And it is my duty to
face that danger and stare into its godless eyes.

761
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Brandi!
- Ah, ah, fuck me!

762
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Brandi! 
- Get the shit out of me!

763
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, Yeah!
- Tell me again. Tell me again!

764
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Nothing can hurt me.

765
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
My body has become a weapon...

766
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I am an instrument
of protection ...

767
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and justice. I am the hammer
in the right hand.

768
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
of all that's good.
- How could you do this to me!

769
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I loved you, you fucking bitch!

770
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
You've just made me go off my cover.

771
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Hey Ronnie.

772
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Mark is looking for you, he's really pissed
about the altercation in cosmetics.

773
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
He's talking about calling the cops.

774
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You should probably just get going, man,
This is gonna, this is gonna get really weird.

775
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Ronnie Barnhardt is not here.

776
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But if he was here,
and say Mark wants him to leave this fucking mall...

777
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It will be over Ronnie's
dead, fucking body!

778
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
In these dark times, people
need something to believe in.

779
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I believe the good
will win through in the end.

780
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It's only a matter of time,
till the clouds part and the sun shines ...

781
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
There, I start again....

782
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's only a matter of time,
till the clouds part and the sun shines down ...

783
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
They'll be here soon,
and my mission will be complete.

784
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I leave leave a mark so big,
that it will be felt for years to come.

785
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And history will remember my name.

786
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
There's no turning back, I must be
steadfast in my resolve.

787
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The world has no use for 
another scared man.

788
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Right now, the world needs
a fucking hero.

789
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Ronnie!

790
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Ronnie.

791
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Come out, come out
where ever you are.

792
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Harrison.

793
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Ronnie, what are you doing?

794
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I thought we were allies, Harrison
I thought we were brothers of the badge.

795
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
How the fuck do you night at night?
- Come on, let's do this the easy way, alright?

796
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You just come outside and we'll
talk all about it, alright?

797
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Can't do that.
- Let's go, we'll talk about it outside but you gotta get out of here.

798
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You can go outside,
this is my world.

799
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We don't wanna hurt you, Ronnie.

800
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You want to get hurt?

801
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You didn't bring enough pigs to hurt me.

802
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You sure about that?

803
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Why don't we find out, huh?

804
01:06:12,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Alright, go get him.

805
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Open up, little birdie.

806
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
What's on the agenda for today?

807
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I dunno, look for a job, I think.

808
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I know it's hard.

809
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Try look on the bright side.

810
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You might not be
the smartest person in the world, but ...

811
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You're handsome.

812
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
From uh, certain angles.

813
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But importantly, you've got a...

814
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
dreams inside of you.
And uh, you and dreams make you special.

815
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And what the world throws at you ...

816
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You...uh...They can never take your dreams away.

817
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
What are you talking about, Mom?
- I don't know. I'm drunk.

818
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I just think a mother's supposed to say stuff like that.

819
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
To the children, when they're sad.

820
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's all just right.
- You're right.

821
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
That's exactly what you're supposed to say.

822
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You know Ronnie...

823
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that other night, when I soiled my pants...

824
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I was always expecting for you to come home, 
to find me and clean me up.

825
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I thought you'd be there to 
take care of me, so I'm a...

826
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I passed out on the floor,
and didn't worry you.

827
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Most people would throw me
away by now.

828
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But not you, Ronnie.

829
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Because I love you, Mom.

830
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I want you to know I'm ready
to make a change.

831
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You're gonna stop drinking?

832
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm switching to beer.

833
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I can pound those all day and
still keep my shit together.

834
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And I'm doing it for you.
- I'm so proud of you, mom.

835
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I am so proud of you.
And you know why?

836
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:04,000
This is a new day, and
we're gonna get through no matter what.

837
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Oh, I just remembered.

838
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:19,000
There was a postcard for you the other day.

839
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What's up.

840
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
How are you hanging in there?

841
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Low I hope.
I just wanted to right you to say that...

842
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You know I'm really sorry for 
the way that shit went down and...

843
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
stuff...My bad. My blunder.

844
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I just want you know that you really are
my best man.

845
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Problem is, I am
a criminal man, that doesn't care.

846
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And your crime is,
you care too much.

847
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Regardless of our businesses...

848
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I hope you know that I always
respected you.

849
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's not every day you meet somebody that
stands for something in this world.

850
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Anyway, no hard
feelings, okay?

851
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
If you ever want to party, just get
your ass to Mexico.

852
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The beer is cool, the girls
are wet.

853
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Sincerely, your right hand man.
Love, Dennis Chivante.

854
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Hey there, stranger.

855
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You have your cast off?
- Yeah.

856
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I have my hair done too.

857
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Hey, uh, I heard what happened.

858
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Are you okay?
- Yeah, that was...

859
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You know, I'm uh, I'm like a cat um, I always
land on my feet.

860
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Um, I'm uh, I'm really ok.

861
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I got you a coffee.

862
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Thanks but...uh,  how much do I owe you?
Is that uh, a dollar ...uh, sixty...

863
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
No, you don't need to pay for it, just take it.

864
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That's really nice of you, I appreciate it,
but ...

865
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
The kinda whole reason I came today,
was to ...

866
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
come by for a cup of coffee
pay for it...

867
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,000
from my own pocket,
I've just been kinda waiting here.

868
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I need to accept that there is
no more free coffee.

869
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Not now, not ever,
it's just uh, when I come into this mall, I...

870
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I pay for my coffee just...

871
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Just like a regular customer.

872
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh, motherfucker!

873
01:14:27,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Get out of the way!

874
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Oh, no, no, no!

875
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Jesus Ronnie, you fucking killed him.

876
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Alright, he's okay.
- Shit, really?

877
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

878
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Stay down, motherfucker.
- I've got your back, Ronnie.

879
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Alright uh, we need to call an ambulance.
- No, this sack of shit is mine.

880
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Get my piece. I'll take him
to the station myself.

881
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Get up, motherfucker.

882
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:30,001
Hey Ronnie?

883
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Come on.

884
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:42,701
Ronnie?

885
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Good job.
- Fuck you.

886
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And if any of you here wants a girl to have sex with you, 
and then to fuck your enemy, go to Brandi.

887
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Cause she's the girl that does that.

888
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Come here.

889
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I caught the pervert.
- Can we get a paramedic? Hurry up.

890
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I want everyone to know
Ronnie Barnhardt has caught the pervert.

891
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Not the fucking police.

892
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Good job, Ronnie.
You caught a pervert.

893
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You can take your fucking badge,
and your gun ...

894
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and you can shove them up your fucking bum.

895
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Cause I don't need that shit
to know who the fuck I am.

896
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck everyone of you...

897
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I win.

898
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Way to go, Ronnie.

899
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I'm here with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of mall security
here at Forest Ridge Mall.

900
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Ronnie is the man, who brought the Forest Ridge
mall flasher to justice.

901
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
We caught the flasher.

902
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yes!
- All is back to normal?

903
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I would say, better than normal, actually
personally I'd go with fantastic...

904
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I met a girl.
Over there.

905
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
She asked me to promise to God
that she won't have sex before marriage, but ...

906
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
that's a promise I intend on making her break.

907
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Here are the guys.
