What's so special about that map?

389
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,740
This map used to belong
to the Supreme Being.

390

- You stole it?
- No. Well, sort of.

He made all the big stuff,

like good and evil,

full of credit for it?

396
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,592
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.

of the universe is far from perfect.

403
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,817
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.

00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,044
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.

515
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:40,818
[Laughing, Cheering]

516
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,190
Is that... Is that
absolutely necessary?

517
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,628
- [Gibberish]
- What did he say?

518
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,098
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.

519
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,328
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.

520
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,428
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.

521
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,236
[Laughing Continues]

522
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,075
Incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work?

523
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,376
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.

524
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,143
Oh, I'd like to stay.

525
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,947
Jolly good.
What's your name?

526
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,013
- Uh, Ke...
- Ke... What a jolly nice name.

527
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,615
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.

528
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,356
- Cheerio. Thank you very much.
- [Kevin Struggling]

529
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,331
Thank you very much.

530
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,597
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.

531
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,403
Awful people.

532
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,510
- This can't wait!
- I'll never get a chance
to meet Robin Hood again.

533
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,241
- Any chance of a rescue?
- Stop moaning!

534
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,285
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.

535
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,946
Giving away
what isn't even his!

536
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,581
That's what Robin Hood
always did. Even I know that.

537
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,286
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.

538
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,127
Heroes! Heroes!
What do they know about a day's work?

539
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:57,133
- Leave him alone, Randall!
- Well, it makes me sick.

540
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,726
Anyone who's always right
makes me sick.

541
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,001
- That's why you get on with yourself!
- Watch it!

542
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,510
- Big mouth!
- Horseflesh wouldn't
have got us into this.

543
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,978
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map.
I'm taking over!

544
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,141
Get off me! Get...
[Arguing Continues]

545
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,152
[Thunderclap]

546
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,699
So... these are
the sort of people...

547
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,462
the Supreme Being
allows to steal His map?

548
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,400
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.

549
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,443
I wouldn't entrust them
to wipe their own noses.

550
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,675
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.

551
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,877
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff?

552
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,353
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent?

553
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,619
But He created you,
Evil One.

554
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,861
What did you say?

555
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,928
Well, He created you,
so He can't be totally...

556
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,473
Never talk to me
like that again!

557
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:18,142
No one created me!
I am Evil!

558
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,651
Evil existed
long before good.

559
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,849
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.

560
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,381
I am all-powerful!

561
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,758
Yeah.

562
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:38,893
But why,
if that's the case,

563
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,370
are you unable to escape
from this fortress?

564
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,181
That's a good question.

565
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,185
Why have I let the Supreme Being
keep me here...

566
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,188
in the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?

567
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,248
- Because you...
- Oh, shut up.
I'm speaking rhetorically.

568
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,817
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here...

569
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,523
in order to lull Him
into a false sense of security.

570
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,158
Ah, clever, clever.

571
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,863
When I have the map,
I will be free...

572
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,396
and the world will be different
because I have understanding.

573
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,502
- Uh, understanding of what, master?
- Of digital watches.

574
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,640
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.

575
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,152
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.

576
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,816
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.

577
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,655
God isn't interested
in technology.

578
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:41,096
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.

579
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,726
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots!

580
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,669
- Nipples for men!
- Slugs.

581
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,230
Slugs! He created slugs.

582
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,074
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.

583
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,308
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic?

584
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,612
Sir... look!

585
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,780
If I were creating a world,
I wouldn't mess about
with butterflies and daffodils.

586
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,450
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.

587
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,926
- [Assistant Gasps]
- Sorry.

588
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:16,126
I just can't wait for a new tech...
techno... technological dawn.

589
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,828
Sir... look!

590
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,336
What is it, Benson?

591
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:24,306
The map, sir. The map!
They've brought it with them!

592
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,312
- What?
- I saw the map, master, just now.

593
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,180
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, master.

594
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,051
Down there!
The little one has it.

595
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,056
The little one?

596
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,652
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for!

597
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,993
- It will set us free.
- Shut up!

598
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,866
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.

599
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:57,340
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.

600
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,900
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.

601
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:05,108
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...

602
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,616
and pull them in.

603
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,715
Stand by for mind control.

604
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,893
What about Babylon?

605
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,226
- Who?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.

606
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,992
Ahh.

607
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,001
[Voice Echoing]
I've got a better idea.

608
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,730
Who said that?

609
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,797
I've got an idea
forming in my head.

610
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,707
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.

611
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:39,443
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,

612
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:44,351
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.

613
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,913
What the hell
are you talking about?

614
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:52,429
The most fabulous
object in the world.

615
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,226
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.

616
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,097
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.

617
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,194
- [Kevin] Why do you always
have to go after money?
- Who's this?

618
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,365
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.

619
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,932
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he?

620
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,741
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.

621
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,044
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them!

622
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,142
Randall, look, over there!

623
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,052
- We'd better move!
- [Randall] Don't rush me.

624
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,056
The forest!
It's on fire!

625
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,059
It's raining,
pudding head!

626
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,652
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

627
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,424
- It's Him!
- It's Him!

628
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,296
Return the map.

629
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,597
- Make for the hole!
- Where is it?

630
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,070
It's over there.
Quick! Come on!

631
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,165
- Stop! Return!
- Hurry up!

632
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:42,679
Return what you
have stolen from me.

633
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,237
Return the map!

634
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,807
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one? Which one?

635
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,480
Go, Kevin!
Just get away!

636
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:56,254
Go! Not that one!

come from? Huh?

I'm not quite sure.

652

Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you?

657
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,561
I don't believe it!

658

You don't believe what?

659
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,507
I don't believe
the way you killed him.

660
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:30,980
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.

661
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,949
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.

662
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,713
I bet you've killed
lots of people.

663
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,923
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.

Oh, yeah. Kevin.

Well, Kevin,
here, it's yours.

667

- What?
- You don't want it?

668
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,167
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it?

Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.

Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.

I'm with friends.

I may never be able to get back.
