I'll see you later.

Move in, and take your positions.

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine

843

Sooner or later you're gonna be fine

844
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,621
Baby, it's time that you face it

845
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:49,086
I always get my man

846
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,175
I have to hand it to you, Big Boy,
you got the best broads in town!

- This is Tracy, Sam.

851
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,814
We made it.

852
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,276
(CONTINUES SINGING)
... why waste it in chatter?

853
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,654
SAM: Careful, Tracy.
The waiters carry guns.

854
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,912

Hello, Big Boy. The gang's all here.

- What is it, a class reunion?
- This is a private party, mister.

00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,162
- No gambling, no nothing, Tracy.
- What?

875
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,705
You mean,
you thought we had gambling?

876
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,374
I wouldn't be caught dead
in a place that permitted gambling!

877
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,584
I'll be back, Big Boy.

878
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,462
Listen, tell me when you're coming.
I'll have a big party waitin' for ya.

879
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,006
- Let's go, boys.
- Right, Tracy.

880
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,927
Then, baby, amen

881
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,514
I thought you was gonna
take care of Tracy.

882
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,392
- He didn't look around. Did you notice?
- Yeah.

883
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,476
I don't get it.

FLATTOP: He's just trying
to louse up the party.

885
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,731
- How'd it go?
- Clockwork.

886
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:18,694
Let's hope Big Boy thinks I'm too stupid
to look under the top of a table.

887
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,197
Pat, I am gonna get him.

888
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,699
It's just a question of when.

889
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:32,458
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine

890
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,295
Baby, it's time that you faced it

891
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:41,634
I always get my man

892
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,429
Get over to 132 Broad Street.

(OVER HEADSET) 132 Broad Street.

894
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,934
- Okay, 132 Broad Street.
- Right, Bug.

895
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,395
BREATHLESS:
The challenge delights me

896
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,065
The more you resist, babe

897
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,275
The more it excites me

898
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,444
Dick Tracy has struck tonight,
and he has struck hard,

899
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,946
right at the heart
of the gang lord's empire.

No one I've kissed, babe
ever fights me again

901
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,751
If you're on my list

902
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:22,841
It's just a question of when

903
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:30,516
When I get a yen

904
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:38,065
Then, baby, Amen

905
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:45,114
I'm counting to ten

906
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,788
I'm gonna love you
like nothing you've known

907
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,088
I'm gonna love you
and you all alone

Sooner is better than later
But lover

00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:15,394
I'll plan

911
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,147
This time I'm not only getting

912
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,482

Texie Garcia,

919
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,095
Ribs Mocca, Johnny Ramm
and now DeSanto. I don't get it.

920
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,431
How could he catch them so fast?

921
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,475
I don't understand.
He knows what we're doing,

922
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,851
before we do it.

923
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,519
You said you had a way
of taking care of Tracy,

924
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,857
"Leave it to me," you said.
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

925
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,944
I'm taking this bum out of the headlines.
I'm rubbin' him out!

926
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:11,116
You kill Tracy, they point
the finger at me. This bum...

this chili, melted rubber?

Sometimes I wonder why I slave over
a hot stove for you, Tracy.

935
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:07,214
Okay, Freddy. Get down
to the Southside Warehouse.

00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,298
Big payoff!

Tracy, I'm leaving.

938
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,698
I used to be afraid that maybe you'd
never take some time and settle down,

939
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,200
and now I know it.

940
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,246
I knew you'd never
want a desk job, Tracy.

There's something going on
at the Southside Warehouse.

I want this no-face dead
and I want Tracy dead.

964
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,941
What's the matter?
You bums forgot how to kill people?

965
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,152
Doesn't your work mean
anything to you anymore?

966
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:18,238
Have you no sense
of pride in what you do?

967

If you say there was a man with no face,

- Yeah, who's he workin' for?

01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,093
I don't know, boys,
but I didn't dream him up.

975
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,805
Would you get my suit cleaned?
We need a witness who'll testify.

I don't know, Big Boy. It seems they
want to get rid of Tracy as much as you.

979
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,692
It'll only cost you 10%.

- Hi, Tracy.
- MIKE: Which one?

985
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,792
- Where's Tess?
- Out of town.

986
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,294
She asked me and the boys
to take care of the Kid

- Tess went out of town, huh?

Sorry, Tracy, I thought you knew.

990
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,304
Want me to take the Kid
back to the precinct?

991
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:28,892
- No, Chief. Thanks a lot for fillin' in.
- Okay. Good night.

01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,696
Yeah, thanks.

Tracy's in reaI bad shape about Tess.

She's still missing,
and we haven't a clue.

01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,397
It looks like a kidnapping,
but nobody's asked for ransom.

and not even ask for a ransom?

It's a long trip to county jaiI.

01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,142
Shut up, Kid.

1508
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,144
And... (CLEARS THROAT)

1509
01:38:32,656 --> 01:38:35,074
Don't...

1510
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Yes?

1511
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:45,001
Don't you think we'd
be happier if we just...

1512
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,462
What?

1513
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,427
What do you think?

1514
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,096
Dick Tracy, are you asking me to...

1515
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,806
PAT: Calling Dick Tracy.
Pat Patton to Dick Tracy.

1516
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,726
Robbery in progress, Tracy.
Metropolitan Bank.

1517
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,811
Hot diggity dog!

1518
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,522
Come on! Let's go!

1519
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:09,359
Come on, Tracy! Let's go! Come on!

1520
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:10,526
Come on, Tracy!

1521
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,905
Well, what are you waitin' for?
A nice, safe desk?

1522
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,956
Tess,

1523
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,545
you're one in a million.

1524
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:42,642
KID: This is amazing, Tracy!
What are you waitin' for?

1525
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:44,686
Come on. Let's go!

1526
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:49,565
Come on. Metropolitan Bank.
Come on. Step on it!

1527
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:54,696
You know somethin', Tracy?
I kinda like that dame.

1528
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,232
(MORE PLAYING)

1529
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:35,028
Once upon a time
I had plenty of nothin'

1530
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:36,320
Which was fine with me

1531
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:38,823
Because I had rhythm, music, love

1532
01:40:38,907 --> 01:40:41,034
The sun, the stars
and the moon above

1533
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:46,289
Had the clear blue sky
and the deep blue sea

1534
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:50,752
That was when the best things
in life were free

1535
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:54,255
Then time went by
and now I get plenty of plenty

1536
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:55,339
Which is fine with me

1537
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,134
'Cause I still got love
I still got rhythm

1538
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:01,929
But look at what
I got to go with 'em

1539
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:07,560
"Who could ask for anything more?"
I hear you query

1540
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:12,565
Who could ask for anything more?
Well, let me tell you

1541
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:15,651
Dearie

1542
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,990
Got my diamonds

1543
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,284
Got my yacht

1544
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:27,914
Got a guy I adore

1545
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:32,460
I'm so happy with what I got

1546
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:37,006
I want more

1547
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,342
Count your blessings

1548
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,677
One, two, three

1549
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:46,140
I just hate keeping score

1550
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:50,269
Any number is fine with me

1551
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:54,148
As long as it's more

1552
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:57,735
As long as it's more!

1553
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:02,240
I'm no mathematician

1554
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:06,953
AII I know is addition

1555
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:10,873
I find counting a bore

1556
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,751
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting

1557
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,753
More!

1558
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:22,927
I got rhythm

1559
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:25,221
Music, too

1560
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:29,809
Just as much as before

1561
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:34,313
Got my guy and my sky of blue

1562
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:39,026
Now, however, I own the view

1563
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:42,905
More is better than nothing, true

1564
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:47,785
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1565
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:53,082
Nothing's better than more

1566
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,003
One is fun, why not two?

1567
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:59,172
And if you like two
might as well have four

1568
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,465
And if you like four why not a few

1569
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,844
Why not a slew more?

1570
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:07,054
If you've got a little, why not a lot?

1571
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,265
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle

1572
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,517
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot

1573
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,853
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle

1574
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:16,022
More!

1575
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:18,316
More!

1576
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,568
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

1577
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:22,862
If it's gonna rain, let it pour

1578
01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:25,072
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

1579
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:29,994
If you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many much more?

1580
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:34,540
Or does that sound too greedy?

1581
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:39,045
That's not greed, no indeedy

1582
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:43,174
That's just stocking the store

1583
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:45,885
Gotta fill your cupboard
Remember Mother Hubbard

1584
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:48,137
More!

1585
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,223
More!

1586
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:54,936
Each possession you possess

1587
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:59,440
Helps your spirits to soar

1588
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:04,028
That's what's soothing about excess

1589
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:07,782
Something's better than nothing, yes!

1590
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:12,745
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1591
01:44:12,829 --> 01:44:15,248
Except all, all, all

1592
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:21,796
Except once you have it all

1593
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,881
Have it all

1594
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:29,136
You may find all else above

1595
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:32,014
Else above

1596
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:36,352
That though things

1597
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,562
Are bliss

1598
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:45,319
There's one thing you miss

1599
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:48,656
And

1600
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,993
That's

1601
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:55,454
More!

1602
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,665
More!

1603
01:44:57,749 --> 01:44:59,959
More! More! More! More!

1604
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:01,752
More! More! More!
