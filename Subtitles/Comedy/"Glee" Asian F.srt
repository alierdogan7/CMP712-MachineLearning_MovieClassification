00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:02,704
<i>So here's what you missed on
Glee: Emma's living with Will,</i>

2
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:04,673
<i>which has really been helping
her OCD, which is good, because</i>

3
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:06,925
<i>she's helping Artie and
Beiste direct West Side Story.</i>

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,894
<i>Rachel seems like a shoo-in for Maria,
and Kurt's running for class president</i>

5
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:11,263
<i>so he can get into NYADA. Thank
you in advance for your votes.</i>

6
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,899
<i>But Brittany quit as his campaign
manager so she can run, too.</i>

7
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:17,469
<i>I'm also a unicorn. And
th's what you missed on Glee!</i>

8
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,557
Five, six... ...seven, eight.

9
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,829
You're late.

10
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,698
I know. I overslept.

11
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,450
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

12
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:35,337
My alarm clock went off 30
minutes late this morning.

13
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:37,205
Kind of shifted my whole schedule.

14
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,874
Anyway, what's Santana doing here?

15
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:40,926
I've resworn my
allegiance to the Glee Club

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,011
without telling Coach Sue.

17
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,013
Mercedes, I'll catch you up.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,015
Five, six, seven.

19
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,802
Five, six...

20
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,806
Mercedes, you okay? My stomach hurts.

21
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,309
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Why are you babying her?

22
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:59,311
I mean, she can't do
three steps without puking

23
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,362
'cause she ate at Quizno's

24
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,980
before she showed up in this joint.

25
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,149
Mr. Shue, you have us scheduled
to the second right now.

26
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,483
With school, Glee Club and Booty Camp,

27
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:06,935
when else am I supposed to eat?

28
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,954
When the rest of us
do. Oh, like you eat!

29
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,906
It's not about eating.
It's about attitude.

30
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:13,825
Sectionals are coming up, and
if we don't give it our all...

31
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,327
I am doing my best.

32
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,162
No, you're not.

33
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:18,547
It's not about doing your best anymore.

34
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,115
It's about doing better.

35
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:26,118
<i>Synced By YesCool

36
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:30,759
Morning, sunshine. Hey.

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,627
Do you want me to iron
some bacon for you?

38
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,764
Um, I was looking for a
fresh box of cornflakes,

39
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:37,816
and I found this

40
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,485
hidden way back in the pantry.

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,187
It's a stash of wedding magazines.

42
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,438
<i>Wedding, Inc.,</i>

43
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,274
<i>Modern Bridal, Marry Me Monthly...</i>

44
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,826
Oh, wow.

45
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,744
Terri must have had a massive
bridal magazine addiction.

46
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:52,414
And an autographed
headshot of Vera Wang.

47
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,916
"To Emma. Always Marry Up!"

48
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:57,085
Right, that's slightly
harder to explain away.

49
00:01:57,152 --> 00:02:01,039
Look, Emma, I'm not scared
of your inner bridezilla.

50
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,258
I mean, that's clearly
the road we're headed down,

51
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,628
and marriage is just one of...

52
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,879
several milestones I look

53
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,130
forward to sharing with you.

54
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,932
But because I don't like secrets,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,719
I thought I'd share my
secret stash with you.

56
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,471
I was a bachelor for over a year.

57
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:17,806
Kept me off of Craig's List.

58
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:20,275
Okay, we'll just put that over here.

59
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,360
But Emma, I have to ask you a question:

60
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:24,946
if you're serious about you and me...

61
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,314
why haven't I met your parents?

62
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:29,117
Be-because, um, they're dead.

63
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,652
You spoke to them on
the phone last night.

64
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,020
I spoke to their ghosts last night.

65
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,121
I have ghost parents.

66
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:35,573
Okay, can't lie to you. Um...

67
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,493
I-I-I just want to
take it really slowly.

68
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,029
You know, I don't want to rush things.

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,464
And-And I feel like meeting

70
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:46,200
my parents right now
would be a bad idea.

71
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:54,309
I must say Mr. Mike Chang
Sr., this is highly unusual.

72
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:58,179
I have no grounds to drug
test your son every day.

73
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,381
My grandmother in China
knew three English phrases:

74
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:04,235
"Coca-Cola," "Kiss My Grits"
and "Harvard University."

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,488
Deep in Hubei Province
this old woman knew

76
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,590
the best school in the United States.

77
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,891
That's where my son belongs.

78
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,861
But what makes you think he's on drugs?

79
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,195
He's one of our best students,

80
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,865
a football star, and he
can bust a serious move.

81
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,118
My son got an A-minus
on his chemistry test.

82
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,454
An A-minus is an Asian F.

83
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:25,840
Mr. Chang Sr., I don't want
to get in your business,

84
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,626
as they say, but don't you
think perhaps you're putting

85
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,628
too much pressure on Mike Chang Jr?

86
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,048
An A-minus won't do.

87
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:33,882
It's the girlfriend.

88
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,784
She's a distraction.

89
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:40,105
Here's where we agree, sir.

90
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,108
Tina Cohen-Chang and her
vampire ways have no place

91
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,359
in this school.

92
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,400
Excuse me from gym all year

93
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,703
or I'll drain your spicy
curry blood.

94
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,407
It's clear to me that
either Michael is on drugs

95
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,776
or that he's bitten off
more than he can chew.

96
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,079
He needs to quit Glee Club.

97
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,714
Performing is a waste of his time. What?

98
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,248
: The consultant
we hired said that

99
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,250
it was meaningless on your transcript.

100
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,086
In fact, he said it was a detriment.

101
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,555
I'll do better, Dad. I promise.

102
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:16,007
Get me a chemistry tutor.
I'll pay for it myself.

103
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,526
Just give me one more chance.

104
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,230
All
right, listen up, ladies!

105
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:24,733
I kicked a fire hydrant

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,235
<i>when I found out Ace
of Cakes was canceled,</i>

107
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,737
hence the crutches.

108
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,823
the entire
wrestling team has come down

109
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,742
with a flesh-eating staph infection

110
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,910
so, fellas, wash yourselves,

111
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,646
and that includes your bat
caves and your bramble patches.

112
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,314
Tinsley,

113
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,500
Puckerman, Azimio, show me your moves.

114
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,120
What moves? Oh, don't play stupid.

115
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,155
<i>You're all dancing in West Side Story</i>

116
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,157
unless I specifically excuse you.

117
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
Tire shop every afternoon.

118
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,877
Coach, no disrespect, but
my dad, he didn't raise me

119
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,179
to be no damn ballerina.

120
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,997
In fact, my dad, he
didn't even raise me.

121
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,683
Ballet improves your
coordination, it boosts

122
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,352
your IQ, and it gets half of the NFL

123
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,972
<i>on Dancing With the Stars! Boo-yah!</i>

124
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:07,842
By Wednesday, everyone is to
show up at audition and dance.

125
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,861
How are we supposed to
learn to dance by Wednesday?

126
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,696
Figure it out.

127
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,216
Baby, what was that? What?

128
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,035
You just hugged your arch-nemesis
right before the audition.

129
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,537
You think before I cleat
some dude I hug him?

130
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,973
You think Wonder Woman hugs the
Cheeta before the Amazonian smackdown?

131
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,209
It's not like that.
Rachel and I are friends.

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,394
Not right now you're not.
This is winner-takes-all.

133
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,680
Maria's the lead and you
need to be playing that part.

134
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,765
Don't be going crazy now on me, Shane.

135
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,934
People are saying that Rachel
Berry's the one to beat.

136
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,070
Why don't you know that
you're the one to beat?

You're fabulous, baby.

138

00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,908
You don't.

<i>You always make me watch Dreamgirls.</i>

Whoo!

185
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,407
Mercedes, I've never
seen you like this before.

186
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,741
Really. You're so...

187
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,276
Glamorous. Glamorous.

188
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,545
Well, I just wanted you guys to see me

189
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:50,164
the way that I see myself
- as a leading lady.

190
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,666
Well, it was wonderful. Beautiful.

191
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,566
So good.

192
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,601
You killed it!

193
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,589
I'm so proud of you.

194
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,639
Ready for song practice?
Your audition is tomorrow.

195
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:18,092
I'm not auditioning. What
are you talking about?

196
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,644
We've been practicing
your singing every day!

197
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:22,230
This is your chance to
break out and show everybody

198
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,731
that you're more than just
a fleet-footed dance ninja.

199
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:26,034
Riff is perfect for you.

200
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,120
He sings, he dances, he dies.
It's the second male lead, Mike.

201
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:30,771
I'm overwhelmed and losing focus.

202
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:35,076
Football, Glee Club, Booty Camp
so we're ready for Sectionals.

203
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,610
I got an A-minus, Tina.

204
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,912
You got an Asian F?

205
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,247
My dad is all over me.

206
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,498
You shouldn't have to hide your dreams.

207
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,632
Just be honest with him.

208
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,584
Oh, like how you were so honest

209
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:44,986
about pretending to
stutter all that time?

210
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,337
Point taken.

211
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,677
With only two days left

212
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:53,895
for people to announce their candidacy,

213
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,096
that leaves me and Brittany

214
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,681
running in this race.

215
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,516
Which is more like me
running, and you know,

216
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,234
Brittany just whimsically
hopping and skipping nearby.

217
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,352
No one takes her seriously.

218
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:02,854
That's so amazing, Kurt.

219
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,022
I mean, you can
practically add the moniker

220
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:08,142
of "President" to your curriculum
vitae now. NYADA is gonna eat that up.

221
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,144
According to the new Jacob
Ben Israel straw poll--

222
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,613
here, take one take one, take... Okay.

223
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:14,815
Um, according to the soft numbers,

224
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,817
I'm ahead by Brit by 11 %. Really?

225
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,454
This could be a cakewalk.
- Nice blouse, Hummel.

226
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:21,372
Really brings out the
color of your pink eye.

227
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:24,509
So, I assume I can rely on your
vote, Rachel. I'm sorry, Brittany,

228
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,043
but I've already pledged
my fidelity to Kurt.

229
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,880
Oh, so you're cool with flushing
McKinley High's future down

230
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,382
the magical poop-stealing water
chair? Did you know that in six years

231
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:34,051
at this school, we've only exclusively
had male student council presidents?

232
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:36,437
And yeah, Kurt looks like
Jimmy Fallon's butch daughter,

233
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,306
but a vote for him would only empower

234
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,141
yet another frank and beans.

235
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,893
Yes. Where has that
patriarchy gotten us?

236
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,011
Double-digit inflation,
economic freefall,

237
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,030
oil spills, war in Afghanistan.

238
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,866
I tweeted about Brit's flash
mob pep rally in the gym,

239
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,152
and we're all showing up to
support her with girl power.

240
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,371
Yes, boys have made one
helluva mess in this school,

241
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,407
and there's only one way to clean it up.

Bush/Gore 2000. And now... I know.

298
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:18,032
It's too close to call. What is?

299
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,067
Marias.

300
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,485
We have two very strong,

301
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,954
but very different
candidates tied for the role.

302
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,122
Rachel Berry and...?

303
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,206
Mercedes.

304
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,791
I thought Berry had it in the bag,

305
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,743
and then Stealth-Attack Jones came in

306
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,628
and just pancaked me emotionally.

307
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:33,298
Yeah. I mean, right before our
eyes, Mercedes just transformed.

308
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:35,533
She had a new maturity, there was

309
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,168
a confidence I've never seen before.

310
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,337
Her performance was so truthful.

311
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,638
I think our little girl's

312
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,090
all grown up.

313
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,426
Wow. I'm so happy to hear that.

314
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,644
I don't know what you're doing,
Schuester, but it's working.

315
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,898
Well, I have been pushing
her pretty hard in Booty Camp.

316
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:51,266
Good. Good for Mercedes.

317
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,268
Yes, but very hard for us.

318
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:56,354
I mean, Rachel is Maria.

319
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,388
Isn't she? Yes.

320
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,523
On the other hand,

321
00:13:58,574 --> 00:13:59,524
Mercedes is...

322
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,409
Is the riskier choice, no doubt.

323
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,828
And she might even be
the more exciting one.

324
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,947
It's just too close to call.

325
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:09,334
Well, you know what
you need to do, then.

326
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:11,753
Let me get this straight.
You can't make up your minds,

327
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,204
so we have to try out again?

328
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,539
In the biz, it's called a callback.

329
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,040
With such an iconic role as Maria,

330
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,592
it can't appear as if they're
just giving me the part.

331
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,294
We'd like you both to come back

332
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,295
on Thursday for

333
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,679
the ultimate Maria-off.

334
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,247
Done. I can't speak for Mercedes,

335
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:26,250
but I'll be singing the timeless
Maria classic "I Feel Pretty."

336
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:27,719
Actually, that's too easy, Rachel.

337
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,888
We've picked a song that
we think has the potential

338
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,306
to show off both of your talents,

339
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,090
in unexpected ways.

340
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,926
"Out Here On My Own" from the seminal

341
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:35,927
<i>behind-the-scenes
musical Fame.</i>

342
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,629
I know it. I lived it.

343
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,098
Mercedes!

344
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,319
Look, in the spirit of Broadway
camaraderie, I'd like to

345
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,271
offer you a hug to congratulate
you on your callback.

346
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,107
You know what, Rachel?

347
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,210
Hug me after I get the part.

348
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:02,337
I'm leaving right now to go meet
the Chem tutor at The Lima Bean.

349
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,973
I promise I'll bring my grade up.

350
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:08,176
And, Dad, I'm so sorry
for disappointing you.

351
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,116
Michael.

352
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,235
We've worked so hard
to get to where we are.

353
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,672
And this, this is how
you waste your time?

354
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,774
Dancing is something
you do at a wedding.

355
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,459
It's a hobby, not a career.

356
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,377
: There's no future in it.

357
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,299
What happens if you hurt yourself?

358
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,469
You're one injury away
from having nothing.

359
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,337
You will not waste your life.

360
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,348
So beautiful.

361
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:44,022
You don't talk that much,
you hardly ever sing,

362
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:49,393
but when I see you do
that, it's who you are.

363
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:53,114
It's what makes me feel you.

364
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,751
Mike, you got to know by
now, when I see you dance...

365
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:00,638
...it's why I fell in love with you.

366
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:24,646
Mike Chang?

367
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,484
The kid's never late.

368
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:30,952
He runs like an expensive Swiss watch

369
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,053
reproduced cheaply in China.

370
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,159
Okay, next.

371
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,496
Uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

372
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,414
I'm here to audition for Riff.

373
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:46,384
Uh, Mike, you know that's not
just a dancing part, right?

374
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,087
I do, yes.

375
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,621
I've been working on my singing.

376
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,507

Wow, Chang, you must have worked

404
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,688
really closely with my boys there.

405
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,523
That was some really fancy footwork.

406
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,091
I just hope you didn't waste

407
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:08,425
too much of your time.

408
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,594
It's what I love to do.

409
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,830
It's never going to
be a waste of my time.

410
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,366
Good job.

411
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:19,536
+

412
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,985
So no girls have tried out

413
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,486
for your fancy new rogue singing club?

414
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:24,537
Why do you think that is?

415
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,406
Mmm.

416
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,575
Singing's just musical talking.

417
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,326
Well, I guess if I was
a girl in this school,

418
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,412
and I wanted to be in a singing
group, I'd be in New Directions.

419
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,830
Mm-hmm.

420
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,219
Enjoy your enormous bowl
of disgusting creamy pasta.

421
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:40,420
Mm-hmm.

422
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:41,671
Hey, Will.

423
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:44,707
Hey.

424
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,842
What, no chicken?

425
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:49,062
Mm, I'm carbo
- loading, Will.

426
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,181
I got to keep my strength up.

427
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:53,183
I got football, I'm running
the student council elections,

428
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,318
and you got me doing that musical.

429
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,653
Thank God for Emma.

430
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,404
She's a hard worker.

431
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,939
You should be really proud of her.

432
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,108
Yeah, well, I just wish
she was more proud of me.

433
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,276
Mm, come on.

434
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,862
I mean, I know I'm not
a dentist like Carl.

435
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,731
I don't make $80,000 a year.

436
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,784
Punkin, what the hell
are you talking about?

437
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,535
That girl is crazy about you.

438
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,671
She hasn't introduced me to her parents.

439
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,339
Well, introduce yourself!

440
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:18,174
You're a catch, Will.

441
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,543
You got nothing to be nervous about.

442
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,679
You're everything a future
in-law could ask for.

443
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,547
You think so?

444
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,716
You bet your sweet bippy.

445
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,768
Did you know Breadstix delivers?

446
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,586
That's awesome.

447
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,110
The cast list goes up on Friday.

448
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,361
Are you nervous?

449
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,596
A little. I'm trying
not to think about it.

450
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:42,315
I wouldn't be. My mole
in the casting office

451
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,783
says that there's only one actor

452
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,201
they're seriously considering
for the role of Tony,

453
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,620
and his initials are B.A.

454
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:54,127
Kurt, they're beautiful.

455
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:55,945
But what are they for?

456
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,130
You killed your audition, Blaine.

457
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:58,548
If anyone else got Tony,

458
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,416
including me, the Wrath of Sondheim

459
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,718
would fall upon William McKinley

460
00:22:01,785 --> 00:22:04,504
like a plague of Shubert Alley locusts.

461
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:08,007
These are to celebrate... you.

462
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:12,095
You always zig when I
think you're about to zag,

463
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:15,648
and I... I just...
I love that about you.

464
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:19,819
Thank you.

465
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,021
: Right.

466
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:29,445
Okay, so, before we dive
into today's Booty Camp,

467
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:31,614
I just want to say how
impressed Mike and I have been

468
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:34,534
with everyone's progress. Uh...

469
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:36,169
Brittany, why are you here?

470
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,453
'Cause I intend on, you know,

471
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:39,172
dancing my way into the voters' hearts.

472
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,341
Okay.

473
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,793
All right... everyone up!

474
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:46,262
Now, your homework assignment
was "The Widow Maker,"

475
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,882
perhaps the hardest show
choir dance move ever.

476
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:52,268
Now, when you get it right,
one of us is gonna tap you out,

477
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,269
then you can have a seat.

478
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,971
Uh, five, six, seven, eight!

479
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:01,728
www.celebritysex.tk

480
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,617
You have it. Yeah.

481
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:10,453
Come on,
Mercedes-- down, open.

482
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,989
Come on, Finn, you can
do it! No, he can't.

483
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

484
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,875
Come on, Mercedes.

485
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:18,795
Good job, buddy.

486
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:19,629
Down... open...

487
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,547
Come on, Mercedes, down...

488
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,384
open... up...

489
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,752
My ankle hurts. Push through it.

490
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,220
I don't feel good. You're fine.

491
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:29,422
No, I'm not!

492
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,842
Look, Mercedes, I want you to
be the best you can be, okay?

493
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:34,260
Did you even practice this?

494
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:35,979
Stop picking on me!

495
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,314
You're always singling me
out, making me look bad!

496
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:39,882
That's crazy. No, you're crazy

497
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,317
for not letting me shine!

498
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,735
Where's Rachel, huh?

499
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,071
I don't see her here,
being a part of the "team."

500
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,105
Rachel practices every night.

501
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,991
No one asked you, Finn.

502
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,075
Everyone knows that
Rachel is your favorite.

503
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,493
That's not true.

504
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,744
No, it's true-- you
give that skinny,

505
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,196
Garanimal-wearing
ass-kisser everything!

506
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:54,664
And, you know, for two
years, you know, I took it.

507
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,232
But not anymore!

508
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm done!

509
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,672
You know, I've outgrown you.

510
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,957
I've outgrown all of you.

511
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:07,760
Mercedes!

512
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:10,313

you're out of Glee Club.

00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,521

586
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:25,574
I got a call from your chemistry
tutor when you didn't show up.

587
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,126
I covered for you with your father.

588
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:28,794
So now I'm a liar, too.

589
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,463
The least you could do

590
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,530
is tell me the truth.

591
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:34,333
I auditioned for the school musical.

592
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:36,201
I don't want to be a
surgeon or a lawyer, Mom.

593
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,137
I want to be an artist.

594
00:27:38,204 --> 00:27:40,706
Special.

595
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:43,409
And the only time I really
feel special is when I do...

596
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:49,231
That.

597
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:54,520
Mom, please don't cry.

598
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,105
Michael,

599
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:58,741
my job is to encourage
you to live your dreams,

600
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:02,061
not mine, not your dad's.

601
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:03,395
I was raised a certain way,

602
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,081
and my parents had expectations of me

603
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:08,584
and I simply was not
as courageous as my son.

604
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:11,037
I let go of my dreams but

605
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,873
I never want you to do that.

606
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,508
Do you hear me?

607
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:16,675
So...

608
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,344
do you know if we earned that part

609
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,295
in the school musical yet?

610
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,133
Well, when you do, we're going
to tell your father about it.

611
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:26,619
Together.

612
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,018
So what dream did you let go of?

613
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,990
Like you, I loved dancing.

614
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:51,460
<i>But your waigong never
let me take lessons.</i>

615
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,965
Some people think I'm
a pretty good teacher.

616
00:28:59,086 --> 00:28:59,969
Okay...

617
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,452
Rachel, focus.

618
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,453
You want this more than she does.

619
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,487
I do.

620
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,956
You've earned this.

621
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,374
The part's already yours.

622
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,259
It's been waiting for you,
Mercedes; just take it.

623
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:41,193
I will.

624
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:45,865
Rachel Berry? Mercedes Jones?

625
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:48,167
Go get it, baby.

626
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,691

for the rest of our lives.

676
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:11,828
What is this? Are we having
a romantic dinner? Sort of.

677
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,329
I invited your parents over.

678
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,666
Is that my little freaky-deaky?

679
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,802
Okay. I'm gonna say hi in one minute.

680
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,222
One minute, one minute.
Oh, God, oh my God.

681
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,557
Why would you do this? I
wanted to meet your parents,

682
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,626
so I thought I'd take
the bull by the horns.

683
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:29,729
Right, it's okay, because maybe,
maybe we can get them to leave.

684
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,732
I will pretend like, um,
an ovarian cyst burst.

685
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,267
Works every time. Emma,
what is going on here?

686
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,186
Are you ashamed of me?

687
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,188
No.

688
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,306
I'm ashamed of them.

689
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,808
What? Why?

690
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,694
My parents are ginger supremacists.

691
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:47,280
We're not ginger supremacists.

692
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,882
We're more ginger preservationists.

693
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:50,450
We don't hate anybody.

694
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:53,820
We just prefer the company of
other redheads, which is why we

695
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:55,988
enjoy the Red Oaks so
much. What's the Red Oaks?

696
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,874
It's a gingers-only country club.

697
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,926
It's really the only place
I feel I can be myself

698
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,294
and let my auburn hair down.

699
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:03,596
Did you know that if we're not careful,

700
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,049
redheads will be extinct
in 30 years? Extinct?

701
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:09,269
It's a recessive gene. If
we keep heading down the road

702
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:12,722
we're on, with everybody
just mixing with everybody,

703
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:15,642
we gingers will cease
to exist as a species.

704
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:18,895
Not really a separate species. Which is why
I'd really love to hear about your heritage.

705
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:21,397
I have to say, your
hair's a little wooly

706
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,567
for my taste, but those
beautiful blue eyes

707
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:26,519
are a very good sign. Now
Schuester is German, right?

708
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,154
I-I think so.

709
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,455
You're practically a Viking.

710
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,207
Hey. Well, that's a relief.

711
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,209
There's got to be some red
hair in that family tree.

712
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:35,662
Yeah, not like that Carl.

713
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:38,414
Oops. Looks like freaky-deaky's

714
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,200
coming down with a mean
case of the cleanies.

715
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:44,003
Don't bother trying to stop
her once she starts, Will.

716
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:46,472
We used to tie her thumbs
together, and she'd chew

717
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,508
right through the twine. Adorable.

718
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,394
I think it's weird. I
don't know where she got it.

719
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:54,981
Oh, I'm sorry, Amigo.

720
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,250
You're not our regular waitress.

721
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:58,935
Cindy! ROSE: You
can't be too careful.

722
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:07,660
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be rude, but has anyone

723
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:08,945
ever told you that you're
both a little racist?

724
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,730
I'm sorry?

725
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:12,832
Excuse me, it's not racist
to be proud of the heritage

726
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,901
that you're trying to preserve, Will.

727
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:17,236
Well, maybe it isn't. But all
I know is that if Emma and I

728
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,955
were blessed enough to have a child,

729
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,574
I wouldn't care what he or she
looked like. And you know what?

730
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,527
If my child had OCD, I'd maybe
try to show a little compassion

731
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:26,913
instead of calling her a
name that makes her feel

732
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:28,665
like a freak.

733
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,020
These beans are a disaster.

734
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,589
These beans are what
happens when you sit out

735
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,692
an election, Rose. There
wasn't a ginger candidate.

736
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:44,113
I think we should talk, don't you?

737
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:46,933
About the, um, upcoming deadline
for the NYADA applications?

738
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:50,036
About you telling Coach Beiste that
you're running for senior class president.

739
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:53,039
Against me. Kurt, you
saw Mercedes, okay?

740
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,275
I'm not gonna get the part.
So I figured, if I win,

741
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,779
I'll make you vice president, and then
maybe you could just do vice-versa.

742
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,050
Rachel, if you win, yes, it'll better
your chances of getting into NYADA, yes.

743
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:07,420
But if I win, it could make a
huge difference at this school.

744
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,256
Not just for me, but kids like me.

745
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:12,308
Things could actually change for them.

746
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:16,095
So, whatever it takes, I'm winning.

747
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:18,314
Look, I just... I need
something for my senior year

748
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,100
that's gonna make me special,
that's gonna make me stand out.

749
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,152
I thought Maria was gonna
be that. You understand.

750
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,488
You're just as ambitious as I
am; that's why we're friends.

751
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:28,307
Rachel, in ten years, when
you look back on this time,

752
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,743
you're not gonna be thinking
about the clubs you belonged to

753
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,328
or the parts you had.

754
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,864
You'll be thinking about
the friends you had and...

755
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:37,300
and the ones you just tossed aside.

756
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:41,541
+

757
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,768
Please don't tell us that
we have to try out again.

758
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,654
No, we've come to a decision.

759
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,722
It was one of the hardest
decisions of my life,

760
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,358
and that includes when I had to sell

761
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,793
one of my two prize
donkeys to pay my gas bill.

762
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,495
I sold Kim, but I kept Khloe.

763
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:59,532
So, um, in the grand tradition
of the Special Olympics...

764
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,502
everybody wins. We're
double-casting Maria.

765
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,587
What the hell is "double-casting?"

766
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,589
It means that we'll
both get to play Maria.

767
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:09,175
You'll get your well-deserved
standing ovations

768
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,960
on Saturday matinees and
Sunday mornings for the Retired

769
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,430
Lima War Veterans, and I'll do
all the evening performances.

770
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,748
Actually, Rachel, we're adding a week.

771
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,084
You'll both get four
nights and two matinees.

772
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,186
Fair enough.

773
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:23,306
Mercedes, it'll be a pleasure
sharing the spotlight with you.

774
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,309
Are you double-casting any other roles?

775
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,310
No. Just... No. No.

776
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,529
Thank you for your time.

777
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,114
Where are you going?

778
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:33,533
Tell me you were better than me.

779
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,236
Tell me.

780
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,155
Why is it that no one
ever wants to hurt her feelings?

781
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,774
You know, it's always been "The
Rachel Berry Show" around here.

782
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,110
But it's not gonna be for
me. No, not my senior year.

783
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,745
Mercedes, don't make
this a stupid pride thing.

784
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,448
Oh, it's a pride thing.
But it's not stupid.

785
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:52,051
Congratulations. You got the part.

786
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,186
I don't want it.

787
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,644
I got it.

788
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,397
I got it, like, by default.

789
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,699
They double-cast us, and
then Mercedes turned it down.

790
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:10,236
So... cool. You're gonna... you're
gonna be withdrawing from the race, then.

791
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:12,906
Look, Finn, when Brittany sang
that song about girls changing

792
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:14,941
the world, it got me
thinking, you know maybe...

793
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,994
maybe I can change the world.
By being Student Class President?

794
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,946
Look, make fun of it all
you want, but you need

795
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,981
to start thinking
about your future, too.

796
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:26,319
Oh, did you talk to
Kurt about the election?

797
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,954
Yeah.

798
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,924
He asked me who I was voting for.

799
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:32,876
What did you say?

800
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,295
I said I didn't know.

801
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,354
Emma.

802
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,706
Son of a biscuit. I've lost count again.

803
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,995
: One.

804
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,030
Two...

805
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,550
Three... I'm so sorry.

806
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,503
I should've believed you when you told me
you didn't want me to meet your parents.

807
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,171
I didn't get it.

808
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,422
Emma, stop.

809
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,407
Please.

810
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:24,978
Come on, let's go to bed.

811
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,714
Wh-What are you doing?

812
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm praying.

813
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,138
I do it all the time in my head,

814
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,906
but right now, it's just not enough.

815
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:41,661
And when I need help, I know
God hears me better on my knees.

816
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,731
Something about the acoustics
of the linoleum or something.

817
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,236
I wish I could make
things better for you, I...

818
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,171
I just don't know how.

819
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,551
I don't have any clue what
I'm doing down here...

820
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,554

00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:06,566
Ms. Corcoran, I hear
you're starting a new group.

843
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:12,078
You're going to need some
star power, so here I am.
