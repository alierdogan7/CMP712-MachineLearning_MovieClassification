1
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,471
Hey, slow down!

2
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,768
Whoa! That is not cool!

3
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:01,191
Thank you for coming tonight, Darwin.

4
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,389
This room is secure,
so we can speak freely.

5
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:06,954
Why the secrecy?

6
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:10,524
Because the Feds are coming
tomorrow... to shut us down.

7
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:17,205
Shut us down?
Without even giving us a chance?

8
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,266
Yes.

9
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,437
And there's only one way
we can save this department,

10
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,243
and that's prove ourselves,
in the field.

11
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,162
Our target is Leonard Saber.

12
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:44,224
As you know, he is a former arms dealer
and current CEO of Saberling Industries.

13
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:48,899
The Bureau's intel shows Saber
has developed a new microchip

14
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,907
with possible military applications.

15
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:56,071
They suspect he has sold his technology
to the Far East under the code name...

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,511
...Clusterstorm.

17
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:02,382
Now, Darwin, we need to find out
how Saber plans to use this technology.

18
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,851
Your mission is to download
the Clusterstorm files

19
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:08,847
from Saber's personal computer
located in his library, right here.

20
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:18,396
Ben, we're gonna get you that evidence.

21
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,867
We'll prove, once and for all,
what we can do.

22
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:22,598
We'll give 'em no choice.

23
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:25,629
They'll have to keep the program
and make us special agents.

24
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:29,303
Look, I believe in you,
but if we fail...

25
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:32,107
...we blow a case they've been
trying to crack for two years.

26
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,981
Hey, I'm nine inches tall.
I only see the upside.

27
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,495
Right this way, sir.

28
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:58,495
Thank you.

29
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:16,616
Ticktock, we're on the clock.
Speckles, do you copy?

30
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:22,058
Ten-four.
I read you, Darwin. Five-by-five.

31
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,619
All communication systems are online.

32
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,760
Status report.

33
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,566
I have a visual on Saber.

34
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:38,043
He's wearing a $6,000 suit,
$50,000 watch,

35
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:42,036
and, according to my infrared scope,
Hanes size 36 tighty whiteys.

36
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:46,210
Saber's about to start his speech.
Remember, the clock is ticking, dude.

37
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,579
Blaster, Juarez, what's your twenty?

38
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:52,351
Juarez here.
Approaching first objective.

39
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,951
We're ten seconds ahead of schedule
because Blaster is a little hyped-up.

40
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:59,225
Of course I am. This is what I live for.

41
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:01,595
Time to get this party started.

42
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,501
- Have any activity?
- Southbound is secure.

43
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:09,466
OK, we're clear.

44
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,205
Darwin,
you're behind schedule. You all right?

45
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:16,770
- First mission jitters, I guess.
- Do you want to abort?

46
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,680
No, no, it's OK.
I've been trained to do this.

47
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:23,344
I'd follow you
into a snarling pack of Dobermans!

48
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,651
Oh, wait. I already have.

49
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,816
Now, get your fuzzy hind end moving.

50
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,520
Hold on. There's a civilian
passing through the perimeter.

51
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,988
What are you looking at?
Move along, pal.

52
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,827
Oh!

53
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:37,663
Don't worry. I just spotted my way in.

54
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,003
Whoa!

55
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,286
Juarez...

56
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:06,289
- Blaster, don't drop a pellet.
- Too late.

57
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:10,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,568
Whoa! Whoo!

59
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:15,933
I'm cool.

60
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,267
Speckles to Mooch. Getting no visual.

61
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,329
Over.

62
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:31,948
The fly is in the ointment.
Darwin, do you copy?

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,350
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:35,979
Ah!

65
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,490
Holy foxes.

66
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:40,288
- What's your twenty?
- I'm in the morgue.

67
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,798
# Don't you wish your blowtorch
was hot like mine #

68
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,237
Good thing I took shop.

69
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,050
Welcome to my home.

70
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:12,454
I want you to know how grateful I am
to all of you for, once again, making us

71
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:16,223
the number one consumer
electronics brand in the world!

72
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,627
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,899
These things are so popular,
I can't get one.

74
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:27,534
Mooch, focus.
Come on, honey.

75
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:30,564
You're not here for the sweets.
Get back on mission.

76
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:33,873
For years,
we've been putting a secret...

77
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:38,412
...into the heart of every member
of the Saberling family,

78
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,887
be it the cryogenic refrigerator or
the new microwave-heated coffeemaker.

79
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:49,723
A secret which is at the core of
any successful family: Communication.

80
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:01,494
- Hey, Juarez. Race you to the top!
- OK. On your mark, get set, go!

81
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,005
That's cold.

82
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,870
Darwin, the table's set. You are clear
to infiltrate Saber's study.

83
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,508
OK, I'm in.

84
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,480
Clearing exfil route.

85
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,387
- Hey, it worked!
- Of course it worked.

86
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:23,414
Nothing happens in this house
that I don't know about. Trust me.

87
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,526
In 48 hours, when I press this button,

88
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:33,297
it will activate a wireless system
we call "Sabersense,"

89
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:36,305
which will awaken the chips
already in the logic boards

90
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,431
of all Saberling appliances,

91
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:42,136
allowing this coffee machine
to know how much coffee's been used,

92
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:47,478
communicate with your home computer,
and add coffee to your shopping list.

93
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:53,015
Now, in addition, Sabersense will link

94
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:57,081
every old and new Saberling
appliance in existence,

95
00:07:57,124 --> 00:08:02,756
and create one big family!
And nothing will be the same.

96
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,691
Why did they put the Q
so far away from the O?

97
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,299
- OK, I'm in.
- Roger. I'm tracking it.

98
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,576
So what about it, Juarez?
You and me, I mean, you know...

99
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:22,048
Sorry, Blaster. You know
I've got my eye on someone else.

100
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:26,109
- No. In fact, I didn't know. Who?
- Darwin.

101
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,176
Why Darwin?

102
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,916
Because he's so...
so not interested in me.

103
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,322
Copy that, Juarez.

104
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,454
- Oh, shoot!
- Keep the comm line clear.

105
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:43,100
- OK, Speckles, I think I found it.
- Thank you, and good night.

106
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,968
Saber wrapped his speech.
Mooch, give me an eyeball.

107
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,336
Christa,
I'm going upstairs for a drink.

108
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,106
Darwin, Saber's heading up.

109
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,778
About 50 seconds.

110
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,510
Copy that.
I'm into the Clusterstorm file.

111
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:05,446
- Speckles, are you seeing this?
- I see it.

112
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:10,556
This isn't about selling weapons.
It's about global extermination.

113
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,789
I'm downloading now.

114
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:14,621
Whoa! What just happened?

115
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,930
Encryption. Hands off the keys.

116
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:19,300
- I'm setting up a worm to decipher.
- Mooch.

117
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,932
You have to stop Saber.
Execute delay strategy B.

118
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,498
Yee-haw!

119
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,085
Ah!

120
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,518
I'm back in. Commencing download.

121
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:48,455
- Speckles, you're a genius!
- I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

122
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,460
Switching to wireless download.

123
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,404
Come on. Come on!

124
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,211
Ah!

125
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:14,484
Darwin. Get out of there, now!

126
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,547
I can't.
The chimney will block the signal.

127
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,617
Come on, baby, come on.

128
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,094
If he doesn't make it,
are you free Thursday night?

129
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,494
He'll make it.

130
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,337
- OK, drop the line.
- Here we go.

131
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:44,715
Whoa! Now, Blaster!

132
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:54,851
Ooh! Ouch!

133
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,528
Darwin! Your butt's on fire!

134
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,693
Stop, drop and roll!

135
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:09,237
- We got it. Speckles, exfil.
- Way ahead of you.

136
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:13,310
I'll be waiting at the entrance
of the... Whoa! Oh, no!

137
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,338
Oh, my God!

138
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:18,681
Speckles reports
a large canine at exfil.

139
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,482
No escape. Repeat: No escape.

140
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,387
Hang on, Speckles.
We leave no rodent behind.

141
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,649
Yippee!

142
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,829
- I'm going after the dog!
- Wait, Blaster! Think it through!

143
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:36,459
There's no time for thinking.

144
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,231
Juarez, Blaster's gonna need backup.

145
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,238
- Got it.
- I'll rescue Speckles.

146
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:45,802
Hey, meathead!

147
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,471
Oh, did you see that? Whoa!

148
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:49,673
Whoa! Whoa!

149
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,449
Let's go, old buddy.

150
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,352
Whoa!

151
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:01,354
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Heads up, boys!

152
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,585
Hi-ya!

153
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,458
Yeah, Juarez! You get him, girl!

154
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:09,328
We're out of here. Let's go.

155
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,334
Something spooked the dog.
Let's check it out.

156
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,063
Blaster, Juarez, exfil.

157
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:18,439
By the way, in case you missed it,
I just saved your fuzzy behind.

158
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,500
We should celebrate over dinner.

159
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,172
Hang on, Speckles. We're going off-road.

160
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:25,113
Ow!

161
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,681
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

162
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:34,387
Gas!

163
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,628
Whew! OK. We're clear.

164
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:48,568
That was a little heavy
on the smoke, Ben.

165
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:54,465
Yo, Juarez, did you catch the little
leg twitch at the end of my "death"?

166
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,947
Ah! That was acting, baby.
I was feeling it!

167
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:01,245
Yes, amazing.
Tell me you are not part possum.

168
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:05,151
OK, you can laugh now, but some of
those people back there were crying.

169
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,018
It was like the end of Old Yeller.

170
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:11,690
Mooch! You made it. Good.
How'd it go in there, guys?

171
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:15,526
The game's over for Saber. It's all
there. Clusterstorm, everything.

172
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,498
Our training finally paid off.

173
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,293
I knew you could do this.
This is great.

174
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,633
- G-Force!
- G-Force?

175
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:26,504
I figured we need a name. Like,
you know, Green Berets or Navy SEALs.

176
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,565
Come on. G-Force!

177
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,476
- Um, no.
- The pose is cute.

178
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,676
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah, it's getting there.

179
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,185
Good. Feds won't be able to
shut us down with this evidence.

180
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,316
Does this make me look fatter?

181
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,956
- No. I think you look nice.
- How much longer, Speckles?

182
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,021
Just a few more touches to decode
Saber's crypto-system.

183
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,431
To access the information
on Darwin's PDA,

184
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,630
I have to factor a univariate
polynomial over a finite field.

185
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,301
OK. Hey, do I look fat in this?
I haven't worn a jacket since the prom.

186
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,673
You look very... sharp.

187
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,907
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

188
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,317
Huh! Huh!

189
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,321
"Because he's so not interested. "

190
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,781
What does that mean?

191
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,089
Men are like government bonds.

192
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,789
They take way too long to mature.

193
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,094
But if you're a woman
trying to make it in a man's world,

194
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:32,592
you have to learn to think
like they do and keep them guessing.

195
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,696
Candygram.

196
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,901
Juarez?

197
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,108
I heard over the wire
that you're interested.

198
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,137
I'm not interested.

199
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,945
That's not what you told Blaster.

200
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,112
Don't you get it?
I want him interested in me.

201
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,951
And he'll only be interested
if he thinks I'm not.

202
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,216
But you are interested?

203
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,489
- Of course.
- But not in me.

204
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,222
No, no, no. Because you know
you could have me,

205
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,128
which makes you not interested,

206
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:05,328
and that means I wouldn't be
interested in you even if I were.

207
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,941
OK, everybody, they're here.

208
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:17,171
G- Force, in your positions.
It's showtime.

209
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:19,638
Hello.

210
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,676
Director Killian?

211
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,746
I'm Ben.

212
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:28,245
Congratulations on becoming the
new task force director. That's neat.

213
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,758
Let's save the chitchat.

214
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,087
Time is money.

215
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,186
OK.

216
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,720
Many people don't know
that since the Civil War

217
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,062
animals have been used
to gather strategic intelligence.

218
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:40,625
Now, our work focuses on
developing communication

219
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,605
between humans and animals. Now, these
cockroaches right here have been trained

220
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,301
to carry microcameras
into surveillance zones,

221
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:50,834
which is, I think, really kind of neat.

222
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,043
Congratulations. Dr. Kendall, do you
mean to tell me that Homeland Security

223
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,018
is financing a roach motel?

224
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,912
This is a rodent.

225
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,988
Guinea pig, sir. Don't say that.
They get highly offended.

226
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:10,020
You know their DNA is 98.7 percent
identical to humans, right?

227
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,822
No. How would I know that?

228
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,697
So you'll notice the extremely
developed sense of motor skills.

229
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:19,706
That's because their brains
have close to a billion neurons,

230
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,968
and a trillion synapses.

231
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,806
That's a thousand times stronger
than any supercomputer.

232
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:26,471
It gives them exceptional, like,
eye-hand reflexes.

233
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:27,672
It's a video game.

234
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:31,548
Yeah. And there's something over here...
OK, we'll go over here.

235
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,882
You're really
gonna be amazed by this.

236
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,820
It's a language decoder.

237
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:40,986
It enables animals to talk to humans.

238
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:44,758
Without it, they sound like
normal animals. Go ahead, take a look.

239
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:50,368
You're Doctor Dolittle.
You talk to animals.

240
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:51,869
Talking to animals is the easy part.

241
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,031
Getting them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

242
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:59,136
- Darwin! Juarez! Blaster!
- So these guys are special agents?

243
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:01,645
Yeah, just like we're gonna be.

244
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:06,544
- Hey, how you doing?
- Whoa. That's impossible.

245
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:11,112
No, no, no. Finding something that
fits me off the rack, that's impossible.

246
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,455
Think that's something? Check out
Speckles. He's been decrypting the file.

247
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,052
- Who's Speckles?
- Our mole.

248
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,086
Star-nosed breed. Blind as a bat.

249
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,530
IQ off the charts.
He's lucky I found him.

250
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,364
- His family was exterminated.
- We're ready.

251
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:26,029
Last night, G-Force was able to get

252
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,368
some intelligence regarding
Project Clusterstorm.

253
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:30,432
You ran a mission
without my authorization?

254
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:33,102
Yes. We went to Saber's mansion and...

255
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:35,611
Wait a second, you broke into
Leonard Saber's house?

256
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:38,911
We accomplished in one night what
you guys couldn't do in two years.

257
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,246
And without a warrant. Holla.

258
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,414
Blaster, cool it.

259
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,892
I knew we were up for review, and I
wanted to show you what we could do.

260
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,087
All right, then show me. What'd you get?

261
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:53,652
Speckles, you're on.

262
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:56,824
- Darwin's PDA contains classified...
- Just open it.

263
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:01,600
What is it?

264
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,637
- A cappuccino machine?
- What? That's not right.

265
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:11,635
I downloaded the Clusterstorm file,
not plans for a coffee machine.

266
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,942
Oh.

267
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:16,678
- Right computer, wrong file.
- Darwin, what happened?

268
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,913
Specks, show them the Clusterstorm file.

269
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,616
Well, this is all we have. I'm sorry.

270
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:25,957
No, that's not it! It's about
global extermination. I saw it.

271
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:30,327
That's it, Kendall. Outside... now.

272
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:39,832
What a surprise.
The guinea pig mission didn't work out.

273
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,364
I'm shutting you down.

274
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,037
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, I can.

275
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,342
You performed an unauthorized infil,

276
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,974
compromised a two-year
undercover FBI operation,

277
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,348
and came out with the crucial intel
that Leonard Saber,

278
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:55,377
and stand by for this,
makes coffee machines.

279
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,388
This means we're in big trouble now.

280
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,290
- Shh! Callate ya!
... a bit drastic?

281
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,261
You have to admit,
I've done some amazing things

282
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:04,196
as far as animal intelligence in there.

283
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:08,497
Thanks to you, those rodents can speak.
But sadly that means they're now capable

284
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,470
of exposing the derelict activities
committed on my watch.

285
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:12,529
- Yeah, but I...
- No!

286
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,369
I'm not gonna take the heat
for this, Kendall.

287
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:17,035
I'm not going down in Washington
as the crazy gopher guy.

288
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,709
Dr. Kendall's coming with me.
Cage anything that moves.

289
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,683
- Cage? Oh, no!
- What about my team here?

290
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:27,846
Here's an idea.

291
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:30,481
Since they're guinea pigs,
why don't we use them as guinea pigs?

292
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:32,115
- What?
- Oh, no.

293
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:33,385
Uh-uh.

294
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,292
Guys, we've got company.

295
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,557
We've got to get out of here.
The document capsules. Let's move.

296
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:41,395
- Vamos.
- Leave the gear behind.

297
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,731
All right, we're going native.
Lock and load.

298
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,201
I always wanted to say that.

299
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,397
Let's go.

300
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,767
Sorry, Speckles.
Talking animal, dead giveaway.

301
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:54,437
- No! No, not my glasses.
- In you go. Let's go.

302
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,379
No. No.

303
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,281
It's OK. I'll be right behind you.
Now, Marcie.

304
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,944
Good luck, team.

305
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,780
Yeow! I love my job!

306
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,825
No! No!

307
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:18,096
Marcie, you tell Ben
the Clusterstorm file is on that PDA.

308
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:20,433
- And you tell him this isn't over.
- OK.

309
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,461
What we have here
is your classic case...

310
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:25,270
- Be quiet. I'll distract them.
... and overspending.

311
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,642
- Bye, guys. Have fun in the lab.
- Hey, hey!

312
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,546
- Would you put that down, please?
- Put it down.

313
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,942
It's not working. Come on. Come on.

314
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,086
- It's empty.
- Stealth hamsters.

315
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,716
A special coating on the fur.

316
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,318
Light bends around them.
Renders them invisible.

317
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,953
That is ridiculous.

318
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:49,696
We did see hamsters talk.

319
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,659
- Now, let me see now.
- Step aside.

320
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:56,431
What are you doing?
Why are you letting them out?

321
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,406
- What?
- Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

322
00:20:58,441 --> 00:20:59,464
I don't see anything.

323
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,703
On the floor...
Be careful not to step on them.

324
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:03,906
Whoa!

325
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,648
- What was that?
- What was what?

326
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,211
There's no such thing
as a stealth hamster.

327
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,579
Be cool if there were, though.

328
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:25,427
Juarez, what's the situation?

329
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,325
FBI.

330
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,662
They got the whole lab surrounded.

331
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,931
I'll need to inspect your goods.

332
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,599
Let's go.

333
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,840
Yeah, 20 bags of Falfa Cravins.
Yes, I know.

334
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:44,539
- We can hide in here. Go, go, go!
- No, not the cage!

335
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:47,713
This facility's closed.
Get this delivery truck out of here.

336
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:50,952
- I don't do cages!
- Speckles, let go!

337
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:55,588
Great. Now we are locked in.

338
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:03,498
Whoa!

339
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,931
What do you think?
Is this the frying pan or the fire?

340
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:12,138
Let's all agree right now.
None of this goes on our resume.

341
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:14,736
This is Killian.

342
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:19,080
We're locking the building down, sir,
but the animals have all bolted.

343
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:21,643
If those animals bolted,
then I got a problem.

344
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:25,555
I want them all back,
dead or alive, zero exposure.

345
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,457
- Three guinea pigs and a mole. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:42,533
I've never seen
such fat animals in my life.

347
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:47,011
Don't they have a gym around here?
A Jamba Juice or something?

348
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,636
Lay off the nuggets, man.

349
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:53,172
All right, my furry little friends.
Welcome to your new home.

350
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,719
Good luck getting out.

351
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:02,186
- G-Force!
- Why did you just do that?

352
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:04,285
I thought it might cheer us up.

353
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:07,592
You can't just blurt it out anytime.
It ruins the effect.

354
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,224
Guys, guys. Cool it.
The world's at stake.

355
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,734
We got to get out of here.

356
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,965
Then what? The Feds want to
turn us into guinea pigs.

357
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,973
They'll never take us seriously.

358
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:19,304
Well, we did get the wrong file.

359
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:22,401
No, I downloaded the right file,
and we're gonna prove it

360
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,106
as soon as we find a way out of here.

361
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:27,445
Well let's ask that guy.
He looks cute and friendly.

362
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:30,044
Excuse me,
my incarcerated little friend.

363
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:32,020
- May I ask you a question?
- Don't move!

364
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:37,248
All I'm saying is, know your place,
behind this line. That's all I'm saying.

365
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,657
Is he talking to us?

366
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:42,255
Did someone order a knuckle sandwich?
Because I'm about to make a delivery.

367
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,425
Wow. You talk a lot of smack
for a little guy, buddy.

368
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,493
"Buddy?" No.
For your information, it's "Bucky. "

369
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:52,438
And if you want to stay alive,
do not cross that line!

370
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,940
Take cover!

371
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,535
Ew! The horror! The horror!

372
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:04,379
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning!

373
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:06,977
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a quarter ferret.

374
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:10,422
I have no ferret in me, Hurley.
That has never been proven.

375
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,720
Then why are you marked down?

376
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:15,092
I'm on sale!
Everyone goes on sale eventually.

377
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:18,997
This should come as no surprise, but
he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.

378
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:22,627
- Mice are on sale. Everybody's on sale.
- Enough with the line already.

379
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,195
We agreed this was my zone.
We all agreed that, right?

380
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:28,230
- Right.
- The mice will agree to anything.

381
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,607
- You guys are all idiots, right?
- Right!

382
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,737
Oh, yeah? Fine!

383
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:37,708
- Yeah, he's very sensitive.
- Not a ferret!

384
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,652
- Welcome, my friends, to the family.
- Um, where is the bathroom?

385
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:44,657
Well, for me, this morning,

386
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,352
the sports page, which is
pretty much where you're standing.

387
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:49,726
- Nasty!
- Look, don't worry.

388
00:24:49,763 --> 00:24:52,526
They put down newspaper every day,
there's plenty to read.

389
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,726
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't have time for this.

390
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:59,067
- Locate escape options.
- OK, here we go. Stand back!

391
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:03,131
- I'm gonna break the glass.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

392
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,972
Ah! Oof!

393
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:08,039
This might be a good time for a nap.

394
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:12,172
OK. The truth is my grandmother met
a ferret at the San Diego petting zoo,

395
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:14,379
but nothing happened. They simply dated.

396
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,751
My papers say hamster, end of story.

397
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,722
Now stop looking at the line!

398
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,918
Darwin, please let me
pull his tongue out.

399
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,257
Negative. Nobody touches the ferret.

400
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:24,352
I am not a ferret!

401
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,626
You try to pull my tongue out,
you'll see what happens...

402
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,098
Let's check that lock.

403
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:30,997
G- Force, Delta formation.

404
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:43,780
You guys from the circus or something?

405
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:46,544
- Yippee! The circus!
- I hate the circus.

406
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,210
No, we're not from the circus.

407
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:49,947
We're specially bred,
genetically altered,

408
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:53,582
- and highly trained secret agents.
- Known as G-Force!

409
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:57,081
I get it. You guys are transfers
from the Hollywood store.

410
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,389
Darwin, it's locked.

411
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:02,254
We need another way out.

412
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:07,564
Mooch!
Go find Ben and report our location.

413
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,731
Clusterstorm launch is in... 29 hours.

414
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:12,263
Wait. Who's Mooch?

415
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:15,368
- The fly.
- Oh, man. Talking to the flies.

416
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:17,572
And I thought the ferret was crazy.

417
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,185
Yahoo!

418
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,263
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,826
What happened in there?

420
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,304
Well, I told them
we shouldn't be shut down.

421
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,772
And then I got to the bit
where I talk to guinea pigs,

422
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,934
- and then that's where I lost 'em.
- Darwin told me, before he left,

423
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:52,172
that he was positive
he downloaded the right file.

424
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,680
Where is the PDA?

425
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,706
- It's still back at the warehouse.
- Well, we gotta go get it.

426
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,218
Security's probably
crawling all over the place.

427
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:02,745
- That's all right. I've got an idea.
- OK, what do we do about the G-Force?

428
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,055
They're highly professional. They're
probably halfway back to my house.

429
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:07,918
Now, Hurley.

430
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,032
Blaster, why don't you
leave the tactics to me?

431
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:20,301
- OK. No problem.
- So, Farty, how do you get adopted?

432
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,277
It's pretty simple. Act cute,
kid picks you out, takes you home,

433
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,471
and bingo, you're part of the family.

434
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,037
Except that, well, they never pick me.

435
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,582
Incoming.

436
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,182
Huddle up. OK, bring it in.

437
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,088
First, we get adopted. Then we escape.

438
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,789
Ben's house is the rendezvous point.
Now, go act cute.

439
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,196
Who's acting?

440
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:51,496
Check it out. I'm chasing my butt.
How cute is that?

441
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:56,166
- Come on, Specks. You, too. Act cute.
- I don't have that kind of range.

442
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,070
Ew. Grandpa, what is that?

443
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,603
That's a hideous crime
against nature, I'd say.

444
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,113
I'm outta here.

445
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:09,017
- What can I help you with, young lady?
- I want a hamster.

446
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:14,919
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

447
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,986
- Her. With the big cheeks.
- Huh? What?

448
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,999
- I could put bows in her hair.
- What?

449
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,762
I'm the hamster. They're guinea pigs!

450
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:29,732
- Whoa, whoa! Watch the hands, buddy.
- One oversized hamster. There you go.

451
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:33,605
You try to put a bow on me,
you're gonna lose a finger.

452
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,441
That little girl
has no idea what she's in for!

453
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:41,610
I'm gonna put nail polish
and lipstick on her and a dress.

454
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:44,414
A dress?
You're going to lose your whole hand.

455
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,944
Juarez, remember.

456
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:49,515
I know. Maintain my cover
until I have a chance to escape.

457
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:52,960
What about that little fur ball there?
He looks like he's full of life.

458
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:57,160
- No, no. Give me the fat one.
- I'm not fat. I'm fluffy.

459
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,134
Even if you forget to feed this guy
every now and then,

460
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,397
it wouldn't bother him.

461
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:05,032
- He's a little plump as it is.
- That's probably a good thing.

462
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:09,237
Oh, mama! This is it. This is it!

463
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:11,746
- What do these fellas eat?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

464
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,475
- Come on, Penny.
- See you on the outside!

465
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:19,145
Hey, guys, I can see my future!
It's all cakes and cuddles!

466
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:24,725
I think he's gonna
throw him in with the snake.

467
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,526
Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh!

468
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:35,993
Whee!

469
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,409
Make way. Hamster coming through.

470
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,773
Oh! Ah!

471
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,545
You're lucky I'm not in there,
snake boy,

472
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:56,749
because it would've been
lights out for you!

473
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,816
I would've hit you so hard
you would have shed yourself.

474
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,590
Then I would have turned you
into a nice pair of snakeskin boots.

475
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:07,088
That kid's a monster.
He just lifted him up and... whoa!

476
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,860
- Come on, kid.
- Blaster, do something.

477
00:30:10,903 --> 00:30:14,361
- What do you suggest I do?
- Poop in his hand. Poop in his hand.

478
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:16,601
Hey, Grandpa, changed my mind.

479
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:20,476
Oh, no, no, not upside down,
not upside down. Hold him like this.

480
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,041
Where did...
Where did the chubby one go?

481
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,174
I don't know.

482
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:28,682
All right, Specks. We have to think
of a way out of here.

483
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,212
There you are.

484
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:36,888
I knew you were trouble.
I can see it in your eyes.

485
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,729
At 0920 local time,

486
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:43,222
Saber initiated a call to the usual
recipient, Mr. Yanshu, in Beijing.

487
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:46,669
He left a message saying the launch
was on track for Project Clusterstorm.

488
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:47,864
Since then, nothing.

489
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,897
Kip, our FISA tap just isn't cutting it.

490
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:52,966
Sir, with respect, if you were
to authorize a search warrant...

491
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,170
On what grounds?

492
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:57,579
I can't authorize a search warrant
without probable cause, and he knows it.

493
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,377
Saber comes from
the defense supply industry.

494
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,442
- He knows how to cover his tracks.
- Sir...

495
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:05,751
Just give me cause,
and I can authorize. Keep listening.

496
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,623
- We are listening, sir.
- Son, listen harder.

497
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:16,625
Careful. Ow!

498
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:19,792
- Come here.
- No, por favor.

499
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,327
No, not pink. And it stinks!

500
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:26,239
This has to be against
the Geneva Convention.

501
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,743
Where is Blaster?
We have to get out of here.

502
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,714
I think you need lipstick, too.

503
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,613
- Yech!
- The tiara.

504
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,318
Enough already.
This is the tenth outfit.

505
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,290
Don't you look pretty?

506
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:47,686
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

507
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,559
Let me do this, Specks.
I'll come back and get you.

508
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:56,230
Relax. They told me
one of the mice died last week,

509
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,966
and was buried in the backyard.

510
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:01,407
Once I'm in the ground,
I can tunnel to freedom and rescue you.

511
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:07,872
Terrell! Oh, man.

512
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,146
- Terrell!
- Mamacita, relax.

513
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:17,591
Esta muerto.

514
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,122
It's dead.

515
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,926
- Yeah, you're right. It is.
- Do something.

516
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:26,330
Wow. This woman's really abrasive.

517
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:30,633
You get it out of here before
it starts to smell up my shop. Hurry up.

518
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:34,600
- Just run take it out back right now.
- I am. It's squishy.

519
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,874
Trash truck.
Let's just get it on out of here pronto.

520
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:44,246
That's not the plan.
No, no, no. Speckles, no!

521
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:47,515
Hold it.
Good luck, rest in peace and all that.

522
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:50,446
Oh, no!

523
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,624
Oh, my God!

524
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,493
No, no, no.

525
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:04,996
- Is this OK?
- Yeah, this is good.

526
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:07,564
OK, Harry.

527
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:12,503
You know what to do.

528
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,817
- She was way cuter than the other one.
- Definitely.

529
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:48,742
Ah!

530
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,554
OK, he's got it. He's got the PDA.

531
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,455
What the hell was that?!

532
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:08,696
OK, I got him. I got him.

533
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:11,461
- Let's go. Just stay calm, OK?
- Whoa, whoa. I got him. Here he is.

534
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:16,001
Look on the bright side: At
least you haven't been marked down yet.

535
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,437
What's that on your butt?

536
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,037
It's a birthmark.
Never seen a birthmark?

537
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:24,944
I have seen that birthmark.
Look at this. I got the same one.

538
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,107
Don't point that thing at me.
It might go off.

539
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,416
Seriously, just look at my butt.
You see? You see? We must be related.

540
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:36,412
No. I am a genetically
engineered super spy.

541
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:40,326
Ben spent years training us. We do
things that people only dream of doing.

542
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:43,854
Yeah. That's what they want you
to think. So you'll do tricks for them.

543
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,264
But you, my friend,
are a common, everyday

544
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,431
pet shop guinea pig just like me.
We must have been separated at birth.

545
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:54,303
But fate has brought us back together,
my brother.

546
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,036
- Don't say that.
- I have a brother.

547
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:59,046
- Don't say that word.
- I have a brother! Come here, brother.

548
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,410
Come here, brother.

549
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:04,745
All right. My brother doesn't like hugs.
I'm good with that.

550
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,844
I am not your brother.

551
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,823
Listen. Darwin,
I'm not gonna dress it up, OK?

552
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,883
I sit here every day
hoping to get adopted, to find family.

553
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:18,762
And now, because of you,
family has found me.

554
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:22,199
Hurley, there is no way
that we are related,

555
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,703
so just get that
through your head, OK?

556
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:33,237
OK. Here we go.

557
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,841
Darwin was right.
The file was marked "Clusterstorm. "

558
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:41,449
- Can you open this?
- I don't know.

559
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,585
OK, well, we've already seen that.

560
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,127
OK, just unplug the computer.
Unplug. Go, go, go.

561
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:55,029
- Was that a worm?
- Nope.

562
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,230
This PDA is infected
with an extermination virus.

563
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,529
Yes!

564
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,605
What is going on in there?

565
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:09,837
No, no, no! Not the line, not the line.
Don't cross the line.

566
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,779
Mm!

567
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:16,443
Busted.

568
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:21,514
Can I offer you something?
A macadamia nut perhaps?

569
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:27,089
So, this is why I never saw you eat.
Not once in all these years.

570
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,292
All these treats and you never shared?

571
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,798
You think I wanted to spend my nights
sneaking out to feed myself?

572
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:34,894
Starving by day and
praying for night to come

573
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:37,964
so I could take a bite without the
threat of you eating everything I have?

574
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:39,702
You drove me to this!

575
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,575
Uh-oh.

576
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:49,618
My friend Speckles
got crushed in a garbage truck,

577
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:51,745
and you said nothing about this.

578
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:53,045
Uh-oh.

579
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:58,985
I'm outta here.

580
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,690
- Darwin? I want you to go.
- I am going.

581
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:05,860
You can't worry about me. You got a job
to do. You can't jeopardize it for me.

582
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:07,995
- I wasn't going to.
- You're only saying that

583
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:10,596
so I won't have to feel the pain so bad
when you leave.

584
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,403
Keep believing that.
Whatever works for you.

585
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,237
Oh, what a guy. What a guy!

586
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:17,009
- OK, OK. Listen, Hurley.
- You got to go, man.

587
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:19,172
- I got to go. You got to let go.
- You got to go.

588
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,045
- I've got to let go.
- Let go of me.

589
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:22,481
- OK.
- OK.

590
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,243
Don't give up the dream.

591
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:27,517
You're gonna find the family
you're looking for someday.

592
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:28,818
So long.

593
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:35,085
So long, brother!

594
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,295
I miss him already.

595
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,062
Whoa! Ah!

596
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:47,639
Good luck with the climb back up,
Hurley! The cage is mine!

597
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:50,701
And it's all true.
My grandfather was a ferret!

598
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:54,338
Now who's been marked down?

599
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:02,279
So, there's the North Star,
which means Ben's is east.

600
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,155
OK, I need to head that way.

601
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,193
Go back, Hurley.

602
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:13,288
Fine!
You think I can't make it out here?

603
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,268
You think you're the only one
who can survive in the big bad world?

604
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:20,830
Well, the truth is, Hurley is out of
his cage, and it's time to hit the town!

605
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:24,672
Guinea pigs gone wild! Woo-hoo! Yeah!

606
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,234
Ah!

607
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:29,510
Darwin!

608
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:33,351
Darwin? I saw a cat.

609
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:36,821
OK, you can come with me
until we find another pet shop.

610
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,847
Oh, thanks bro. Did I mention
I'm also afraid of the dark?

611
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:59,432
Greetings,
Mr. Saber. I have a status report.

612
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,878
You are a brilliant
business partner, Mr. Yanshu.

613
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:07,111
But remind me why we call these things
"video" conferences.

614
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:12,680
As we've discussed, it's in everyone's
best interest my identity remain hidden.

615
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:16,682
Project Clusterstorm
is perfectly on course, sir.

616
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:20,162
Sabersense will activate
in about 19 hours.

617
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:24,462
Why are we spending a large amount
of money tracking space junk?

618
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,935
Old satellites. Booster rockets.

619
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,462
Four million pounds of debris.
And why do we care?

620
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:33,873
The satellites, sir.
Communication systems.

621
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:38,505
We have to protect them. Integral aspect
of the Sabersense network.

622
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:41,346
We've got a lot riding on this, Yanshu.

623
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:45,547
I've put my trust
in your engineering skills.

624
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:07,100
- Mooch, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah!

625
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,936
Are the others OK?

626
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:12,139
- You know where they are?
- Yeah!

627
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:17,109
You want help with that?

628
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:23,853
E... I... I...

629
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,917
...a... oh, yeah.

630
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:34,625
Oh, Mooch... You're a genius.

631
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:38,229
I was so worried about you.
I don't like when my fly is down.

632
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,337
Hey, Marcie?
Yeah, it's Ben. I found them.

633
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,905
I'll be by in ten minutes
to pick you up.

634
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,513
There's the delivery truck from the lab.

635
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,914
Como estas, gentlemen?

636
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,419
We're looking for some rodents.

637
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:01,757
Si, for you or for your children?

638
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:03,785
For the government.

639
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,723
- We're special agents.
- What? Yeah, right.

640
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:09,200
Are they fugitives
or terrorists or something?

641
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,862
Just answer the question.

642
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:20,742
OK, sorry. I'm just saying, you look
like a regular guinea pig to me.

643
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,770
Listen, I told you, I'm a commando
who just happens to be a guinea pig.

644
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,144
Oh, yeah?
So where's all your fancy spy gear?

645
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:29,681
Back at the lab.

646
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,884
Oh. Same lab where I keep
my hot Canadian guinea pig girlfriend?

647
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,858
That's where my stuff is, too.

648
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,520
I have a unicorn back there
and a dragon that I ride around.

649
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:41,123
Look, if you want to stick with me,
stop with the yapping and keep up.

650
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,759
No can do, bro.
I'm calling a hunger strike.

651
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:48,230
And I am not moving an inch. Whoa!

652
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,469
Uh-oh. Whoa!

653
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:58,973
Eh, civilians. Come on, soggy.

654
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,025
I'm hungry, I'm wet, I'm hungry...

655
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:14,757
Shh!

656
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:16,726
Dogs!

657
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:24,797
Dogs. Why does it always
have to be dogs?

658
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:28,201
All right, MacGyver,
you got any brilliant ideas?

659
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:32,903
Yeah, I got an idea.

660
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:45,049
- I think we made it.
- Great. How do we stop it?

661
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:46,218
Just keep running.

662
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,094
That's not how you stop it!
That's how you make it go!

663
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,398
- Hurley, get your butt outta my face.
- Get your face outta my butt!

664
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:04,072
Ow!

665
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,347
So this is what spies do.

666
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:18,020
Como estas, chica?

667
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:20,185
We're looking for
three guinea pigs and a mole.

668
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:24,027
Same one as the Feds,
or are yours from a rival militia?

669
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:25,463
Wait, what Feds?

670
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,932
Men in Black were here
looking for the same thing.

671
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,798
Wanted to know who had bought them.

672
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:32,068
And did you tell them?

673
00:43:32,105 --> 00:43:35,199
No, I refused and we shot it out.
What do you think? It's the Feds!

674
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,370
Thank you.

675
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,216
Mine! The cage is mine!

676
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,854
This is gonna be awesome.

677
00:43:57,896 --> 00:44:01,525
I'm pretty sure this is
animal cruelty, but I love it!

678
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,226
Yeah!

679
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:06,527
Yeah!

680
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:10,402
This wheel doesn't work!

681
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:13,577
Strike!

682
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,973
- Ah!
- Ooh!

683
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:21,041
- Is that all you got?
- Ready to go for the record?

684
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:26,955
Maybe this would be a good time
for you to take your medication!

685
00:44:27,892 --> 00:44:31,622
I feel the need... the need for speed!

686
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:36,460
Whoo-hoo!

687
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,059
Say cheese!

688
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,569
Whoa!

689
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:47,466
Excuse me! Coming through!

690
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,071
- Yeah!
- Yes!

691
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:57,509
- That was off the hizz-ook!
- Connor! Take out the trash.

692
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:59,249
OK.

693
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:01,683
- Now!
- I'm coming!

694
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,652
What do we have here?

695
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:09,621
You, my friend, suck.

696
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,767
I'm coming for you, Juarez. Whoa!

697
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:18,570
Whoa!

698
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:25,205
That's what I'm talking about!

699
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:27,913
Time for a joyride.

700
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:29,749
Yeah!

701
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:32,008
Get out the road, fool!

702
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:34,248
- Hey!
- Don't become roadkill!

703
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:35,778
I ain't used to driving stick!

704
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:42,494
- Oops! Not this time!
- Stop it. Stop it! Come back!

705
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,327
I'll come back when you're older
and put you in prison!

706
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:47,266
- Get over here!
- Don't go anywhere.

707
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:49,393
- I'll be right back.
- Finally!

708
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,060
Hi-ya!

709
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:55,864
- Juarez! Where are you?
- Connor, get him!

710
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:57,809
I have to save his fur again?

711
00:46:03,216 --> 00:46:04,512
Juarez?

712
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,119
Juarez!

713
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:12,282
Yeah!

714
00:46:13,326 --> 00:46:14,553
Woo-hoo!

715
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:20,396
I got you!

716
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,799
Why are you dressed like
"Guinea Pig Barbie?"

717
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:25,429
One more word and I'll turn you
into a small side of bacon.

718
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:27,098
Well, you are sizzling hot!

719
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:29,365
Connor!

720
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:31,467
Get this off of me!

721
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:40,849
Don't need that, or that, or that!

722
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,418
- Although, maybe this can stay.
- Juarez, you are fine china!

723
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:54,828
What exactly are we doing, anyway?

724
00:46:54,866 --> 00:46:59,893
Two days ago, my team embarked on a
mission. Today, I'm gonna finish it.

725
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:03,973
My brother's a loon!
I love him, but he's...

726
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:08,444
Cake! Did I tell you I love cake?
Oh! Oh, I've heard of places like this!

727
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:10,913
They sell something called "layer cake!"

728
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:13,815
It's not just one cake,
it's many, in layers!

729
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:18,446
Often up to six!
Oh, it is the Holy Grail of human food!

730
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:22,448
I can't believe you're getting
so excited about cake. Coffeemaker!

731
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:31,360
That's the same coffeemaker
that was on the Clusterstorm file.

732
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:34,694
Hurley, I got to check out
that coffeemaker. Stay close.

733
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:40,003
Fifty billion rodents in the world,
and I get stuck with this guy.

734
00:47:42,078 --> 00:47:43,101
Whoa.

735
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:50,884
I hope you're keeping track
of all these parts.

736
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,478
Don't watch me. Watch my back.

737
00:47:52,522 --> 00:47:56,481
Right now, you're my eyes and ears.
Just act natural.

738
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:59,153
- OK. Sure.
- Look, Daddy!

739
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:05,565
Hi there. Hi.

740
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,468
- That wasn't very convincing.
- Hurley, do you know what this is?

741
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:11,563
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's called vandalism.

742
00:48:11,606 --> 00:48:14,165
This is a military grade,
multiple array transceiver

743
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,837
developed for the military's
Unmanned Weapons Program.

744
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:19,175
Sorry, I tuned out there.
What were you saying?

745
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:21,239
I gotta get this chip back to Ben's.

746
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:26,852
OK, that's weird.

747
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,684
Hurley, duck!

748
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:35,585
Stay down!

749
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,661
Whoa!

750
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:46,439
I've heard coffee's bad for you,
but this is ridiculous!

751
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:47,769
Come on, move it!

752
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:54,176
- Why are we stopping?
- We're gonna fight it.

753
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:55,738
We're gonna do what?

754
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:58,717
We have to get that chip.

755
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:02,283
Whoa!

756
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:03,345
Good luck with that!

757
00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:12,320
Uh-oh.

758
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:15,730
- Suck in your gut!
- I am!

759
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:19,533
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

760
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:20,595
Darwin!

761
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:21,930
Hang on, Hurley!

762
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,407
Yippee-ki-yay, coffeemaker!

763
00:49:30,148 --> 00:49:31,809
Watch out, bro!

764
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,791
You want some of this,
you overgrown can opener?

765
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:50,664
Don't think the warranty
is gonna cover that.

766
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:53,932
Oh, brother. I thought I lost you there.

767
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:56,132
OK, thanks Hurley! Boundaries!

768
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:59,802
Talk about a killer cappuccino.
What is this thing?

769
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:02,004
This is Clusterstorm.

770
00:50:02,812 --> 00:50:06,146
Saber must be weaponizing
his entire line of appliances.

771
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:07,843
We have to get this back to Ben's.

772
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:10,049
How are we gonna do that?

773
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:21,885
Hey, bro? You have to admit,
we make a pretty sweet team.

774
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:24,865
I could get used to all this
"secret agent" stuff

775
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:26,959
if you're ever looking
for a new recruit.

776
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:30,333
Hurley, just be quiet and lean right.

777
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:33,272
Look who I found out back.

778
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:37,175
- Blaster! Juarez!
- Darwin! You made it.

779
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,238
- Hurley, what are you doing here?
- Hey, guys!

780
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:44,309
Hurley, up high. Down low. Too slow.

781
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:46,479
Wait a minute. Where's Speckles?

782
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:51,483
Speckles didn't make it.

783
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:54,461
- What do you mean, he didn't make it?
- He was gonna break out

784
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:57,430
and engineer our escape,
but then the mission went bad.

785
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:01,629
He got crushed in a garbage truck.

786
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:06,669
- Oh, Speckles. Jeez.
- He sacrificed himself for us.

787
00:51:07,507 --> 00:51:08,907
This is all my fault.

788
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,773
Ben, there's nothing you could've done.

789
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,279
No, I could've told you the truth
of who you really are.

790
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,512
Darwin, I misled you.

791
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:25,715
The truth is,
you're not genetically engineered.

792
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,692
Any of you.

793
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:31,424
I should've never... should've never
sent you out into the field. It's...

794
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:36,725
So we are not special at all?

795
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:40,206
No engineering? No enhancements?

796
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,335
We're just common, ordinary rodents?

797
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:47,437
I wanted you guys to think of yourselves
as more than just balls of fur

798
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,947
waiting for your next pellet.

799
00:51:49,548 --> 00:51:52,312
Well, maybe you can
explain that to Speckles.

800
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,851
Ben, we need to know.
Tell us who we are.

801
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,090
OK, you guys want to know?

802
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:05,189
Juarez, we rescued you at a
roadside tapas stand in the Pyrenees.

803
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:08,222
I guess there
you're some kind of, you know, delicacy.

804
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,262
Ai-yai-yai.

805
00:52:10,302 --> 00:52:11,996
Blaster, we found you
at a cosmetics company.

806
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:16,268
They were testing, you know, some kind
of hair gel for allergic reactions.

807
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:18,904
And Speckles we found...

808
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:22,977
...you know, right before his
home was dug out to build a golf course.

809
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:25,705
And, Darwin, I...

810
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:29,946
I purchased you at a pet store.

811
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:34,891
Your parents abandoned you
because you were the runt of the litter.

812
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:38,656
I was a runt? What do you mean?

813
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:43,898
I never even had a chance.

814
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,531
This is Carter.

815
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:53,774
OK, we're on it.

816
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:58,213
Dispatch just got a report of two giant
hamsters riding a skateboard on Pacific.

817
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,248
Let's finish this.

818
00:53:04,253 --> 00:53:09,020
You were right all along. I am just an
average, everyday pet store guinea pig.

819
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:12,824
Since when did you
start listening to me?

820
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:15,493
My parents didn't even want me.

821
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:20,533
Look, Darwin, you saved us from
the dogs, you defeated the Terminator,

822
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:23,037
read the stars like a map
and got us here.

823
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,971
I couldn't have done any of that.

824
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:28,942
Do you have any idea how many guinea
pigs could've done all those things?

825
00:53:28,977 --> 00:53:32,845
I mean, literally, like three.
And they're all in this room.

826
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:39,675
Yeah, you're right.

827
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,680
I may not be genetically engineered,
but I'm no house pet, either.

828
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:48,352
Hey team, come over here. Listen up.
What Ben did was right.

829
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:52,491
He wanted us to believe in ourselves.
And we did believe.

830
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,260
We still have our training,
our abilities.

831
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:59,101
Blaster, you're a graduate
of West Point.

832
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:02,207
Yeah, correspondence course.

833
00:54:02,243 --> 00:54:06,008
Yeah, whatever. And Juarez, how many
hours have you put in on that simulator?

834
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:08,707
Two hundred... thousand.

835
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:09,772
Uh!

836
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:11,511
I helped with the tire!

837
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:17,420
We may be guinea pigs,
but we're not ordinary. We're special.

838
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:21,553
I still believe in us,
even if nobody else does.

839
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:24,627
I believe.

840
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,523
I believe.

841
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,071
I've always believed.

842
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,642
Ben, we don't have much time.
That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.

843
00:54:42,147 --> 00:54:46,243
When I tried to disconnect this chip,
it came alive and it attacked us.

844
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,378
It was so gnarly!

845
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,720
If I hadn't been there to take
cover fire for Darwin, who knows...

846
00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:53,951
Oh!

847
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,687
The Sabersense microchip
caused it to transform.

848
00:54:56,727 --> 00:55:00,219
Ben, Sabersense and Clusterstorm
are the same thing.

849
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:03,166
And if every Saber product
in the world has that chip,

850
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:06,761
that means that every appliance on Earth
is gonna be a killing machine.

851
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:08,431
Guys...

852
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,775
Sabersense launches in... 30 minutes.

853
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,371
I tried to access the
Clusterstorm file on your PDA,

854
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:18,813
but Saber, he protected it
with some nasty virus.

855
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,043
I mean, I'm a little bit at a loss.

856
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,821
Sorry to interrupt. Quick question.

857
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,790
If that little thingamabob
is all that like you say it is,

858
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,419
why don't you just use that
to destroy Saber's mainframe?

859
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,290
I'll go back in the box. Oh, pepperoni!

860
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,861
- That could work. That could work!
- OK, let's do this!

861
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,770
Wait a second.
We don't have our equipment.

862
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:46,366
Well, that's not entirely true.

863
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,249
This is a little prototype
I've been working on

864
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:57,946
called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle.

865
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,615
She'll do 65
with the throttle wide open.

866
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:06,191
And, Blaster, it has a rocking stereo.

867
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:11,128
That's what's up! Pimp my ride!

868
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,191
All right, we got gear.
And we know our mission.

869
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:17,797
Infiltrate Saber's mansion,
locate the main network core

870
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,864
and dock this infected PDA.

871
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:23,273
Bring down big mama with baby disease.

872
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,212
I don't know what that means.
But, yeah, that's good.

873
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:28,912
Here are the keys.

874
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:35,715
- Don't scratch it.
- All right. This is for Speckles.

875
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:42,221
Dr. Kendall, we know you're in there!
Open the door!

876
00:56:42,263 --> 00:56:45,322
Everybody, into the RDV!
You, too, Hurley. Move it!

877
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,389
Shotgun!

878
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:51,500
Open the door, or we'll open it for you!

879
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,305
Hold on.

880
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:02,712
Don't these fools
know we're on the same team?

881
00:57:02,748 --> 00:57:05,581
- Juarez, plot us a course to Saber's.
- I'm on it.

882
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:12,252
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

883
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,350
Mooch, we need eyes in the sky.

884
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,562
Call for backup.

885
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:23,965
Tell them we're in pursuit of three
guinea pigs driving mobile spheres.

886
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:25,026
OK!

887
00:57:26,205 --> 00:57:28,764
Actually, could you make that call?

888
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:33,069
My stomach doesn't do well
with action-adventure.

889
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:34,908
Hurley, don't you dare.

890
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:38,376
Yuck, Hurley. That's disgusting.

891
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,509
- I can't breathe.
- Roll down the window.

892
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:44,716
- These things don't have windows!
- That's real professional, guys.

893
00:57:48,092 --> 00:57:49,889
Mooch, where's that recon?

894
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:57,262
- OK, here come the bad guys.
- Better have their "A" game.

895
00:58:00,804 --> 00:58:03,637
- Yeah!
- Mommy!

896
00:58:03,674 --> 00:58:05,608
Where's that backup?

897
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:12,779
- May I ask why we're chasing rodents?
- No, you may not.

898
00:58:15,686 --> 00:58:18,051
OK, you can just
let me out at the next corner.

899
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,857
We got three party crashers on our tail.

900
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:28,325
- Hurry up! You're losing them!
- They're boxing us in!

901
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:31,595
- Yeah, I got 'em, I got 'em.
- Maybe they want to adopt us!

902
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,467
Not likely, Hurley. Hold on, guys!

903
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:37,301
- Let's just crush 'em!
- Unlock it and rock it. Now!

904
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:42,138
- Time to divide and conquer.
- See ya!

905
00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:51,614
- Oh, yeah! Come and get me!
- Where'd he go?

906
00:58:51,652 --> 00:58:54,554
- How low can you go?
- There he goes! Under the trailer!

907
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:55,886
Little is the new big!

908
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:02,627
Bye-bye, bipeds! Smell you later!

909
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:05,690
- I want to go back to the pet store!
- You might want to buckle up.

910
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,601
He paid for undercoating. What a sucker!

911
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,235
Let's see if it protects him from this.

912
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:21,539
- Hey, what's that?
- This is my little friend.

913
00:59:23,384 --> 00:59:25,875
- Say hello.
- Hello!

914
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:27,886
And goodbye!

915
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:31,283
Better hang on to your lunch!

916
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:48,671
Did we win?

917
00:59:49,943 --> 00:59:53,241
This is Unit Two. We lost them.

918
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:57,180
How? You're driving a V-8. They're
rolling around in little plastic balls.

919
00:59:57,216 --> 00:59:59,309
This one's not getting away from me!

920
01:00:01,453 --> 01:00:03,421
Darwin, I need some help here.

921
01:00:04,022 --> 01:00:05,955
Mooch, I need a visual on Juarez.

922
01:00:08,694 --> 01:00:12,596
- I can't get these guys off my tail.
- We don't have tails.

923
01:00:12,631 --> 01:00:17,533
Hang on, Juarez. Hurley, we're
going to the fair. Blaster, hard right.

924
01:00:17,568 --> 01:00:20,299
All right, Juarez.
Let's take it to the house!

925
01:00:25,977 --> 01:00:27,501
OK, I'm taking the lead.

926
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:34,611
- You're scaring me!
- Shut it, Carter!

927
01:00:34,652 --> 01:00:38,088
Here's that box of M-80s.
Careful with these.

928
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:40,988
- You're driving angry!
- Yes, I am!

929
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:46,895
Come here, you little rodent.

930
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,761
Carl, look out! Look out!

931
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:51,460
Let's let 'em go,
let's let 'em go! Look out!

932
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:02,769
- This is so festive!
- This is crazy. This is crazy!

933
01:01:02,812 --> 01:01:04,439
These are good seats!

934
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:06,641
I'm gonna flatten this little varmint!

935
01:01:06,682 --> 01:01:09,447
Mess with the bull, you get the horns.

936
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,514
Look out! Look out!

937
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:30,464
How you doing?

938
01:01:32,473 --> 01:01:34,704
Don't try this at home, kids!

939
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:40,705
That was great!
Let's do it again.

940
01:01:43,651 --> 01:01:48,714
Face it, Trigstad.
You just got out-driven by gophers.

941
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:01,534
- Guys, I'm going in.
- Hurley, suck in your gut.

942
01:02:01,568 --> 01:02:04,003
Blaster, I need to
tell you something about Juarez.

943
01:02:04,038 --> 01:02:06,665
You have nothing to worry about.
She's not interested in me.

944
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:09,471
- She told you that?
- Yeah. She really wants you...

945
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:12,842
She's trying to make you more interested
in her by acting disinterested.

946
01:02:12,879 --> 01:02:15,210
Yeah, well maybe
she told you she wants me

947
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:19,547
in order to look not interested in you,
which makes you more interested in her.

948
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:20,882
Interesting.

949
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:26,315
Members
of the Saberling inner sanctum,

950
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,954
my co-conspirators in this endeavor,

951
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,828
are we ready to dominate?

952
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:36,268
Are we ready to change the world?

953
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:40,832
- Go, go, go, go!
- Geronimo!

954
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:42,704
- Yippee!
- Whoa!

955
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:48,380
Hurley, this is our exfil. It's very
important that you stand guard.

956
01:02:48,414 --> 01:02:51,576
Whatever you do, don't leave this spot.
We're counting on you.

957
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:53,446
OK, OK. Got it.

958
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:55,680
Hey, does this mean
I'm part of the team?

959
01:02:57,088 --> 01:02:59,989
There's the network core.
Behind the glass.

960
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:03,517
Look! We can gain access
through that panel.

961
01:03:03,728 --> 01:03:05,627
OK, follow me.

962
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,288
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

963
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,732
It's a tripwire.

964
01:03:11,502 --> 01:03:14,630
It's a booby trap.
Don't touch it, or this place'll blow.

965
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,767
Tick, tick, boom.

966
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,811
Ooh!

967
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:33,550
I don't think anybody'll mind
if I check the perimeter.

968
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:37,617
As I press this button,

969
01:03:37,661 --> 01:03:41,187
we move forward
to a brave new world order

970
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,757
owned and operated by Saberling.

971
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:03,814
We're too late.

972
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:07,583
We can still stop it if we download the
virus into Saber's computer. Let's go.

973
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:11,185
Cherries.

974
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:24,037
Cake! Oh, you're so beautiful!

975
01:04:25,906 --> 01:04:28,137
Oh, come to Papa!

976
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:31,574
Uh-oh. Oh!

977
01:04:51,966 --> 01:04:56,231
It's all Saber, sir.
Is this enough probable cause?

978
01:04:58,671 --> 01:05:01,231
Eyewitnesses report
common household appliances

979
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:05,005
- coming to life and chasing people...
- Those are Saberling appliances!

980
01:05:05,044 --> 01:05:08,012
But they're just supposed to
communicate with each other.

981
01:05:17,457 --> 01:05:20,323
- Bravo, Echo! Go! Go!
- Spread out!

982
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:23,818
What is that thing?

983
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:27,391
It's heading for the tripwire.

984
01:05:30,202 --> 01:05:32,829
- It's got Hurley!
- Oh, hey guys!

985
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:36,466
- What's it doing?
- Peppers. Casserole.

986
01:05:36,508 --> 01:05:38,600
It's trying to figure out
how long to cook him.

987
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,078
Cook me? Get me out of here!

988
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:45,849
- Move it, Blaster!
- I don't want to be an appetizer!

989
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:47,976
- We got to save him!
- Get me out!

990
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,510
Let's go to Plan B!

991
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:52,852
- Blaster, immobilize that thing!
- I'm on it!

992
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:55,950
- Don't let it hit the tripwire!
- I want to go home!

993
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,025
Soup. Eggs. Beef.

994
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:05,866
- Oh, man! It's packing a toaster!
- Broccoli.

995
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:09,263
All teams, go, go!

996
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:14,509
Why is this happening?

997
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:17,442
This wasn't the plan!

998
01:06:17,479 --> 01:06:20,108
- Saber, what's going on?
- Get us out of here!

999
01:06:21,017 --> 01:06:23,246
Take Saber down to the command truck!

1000
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:27,085
Bacon. Carrot. Soup.

1001
01:06:27,122 --> 01:06:30,091
- Hurley, don't be scared.
- I'm not a chicken.

1002
01:06:30,126 --> 01:06:31,923
Chicken. Match.

1003
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:33,287
Uh-oh.

1004
01:06:34,964 --> 01:06:36,330
Not even close!

1005
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:43,303
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a little piece of cake!

1006
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:49,069
- Didn't drop the cake.
- Hurley, let's go!

1007
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,571
Hunk of junk!

1008
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:55,508
It's gonna hit the tripwire!

1009
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,185
- Run for cover!
- Darwin, jump!

1010
01:07:05,093 --> 01:07:06,424
No!

1011
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:09,894
Ah!

1012
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:34,113
Are you OK? We can't get through.

1013
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:36,179
I'm all right. I'm gonna keep going.

1014
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,282
Not without us. No way.

1015
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:41,350
There's no time.
I've got to take down the network core.

1016
01:07:43,996 --> 01:07:46,624
Hurley, I told you
stay put and guard the exfil.

1017
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,726
Didn't I tell you that?
I thought I could depend on you.

1018
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,706
All right. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

1019
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,739
Good luck, Darwin.
We'll find another way through.

1020
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:12,751
OK, this is good. Over there.

1021
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:17,159
Marcie, let's go.

1022
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:21,697
I find it hard to believe
you've got nothing to do with this.

1023
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:24,293
You have to believe me.
I don't know what's going on.

1024
01:08:24,336 --> 01:08:27,828
I only wanted to be the biggest
appliance manufacturer in the world.

1025
01:08:30,308 --> 01:08:32,138
What do you want?
I got major problems here.

1026
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:35,374
There's your problem. The transmission's
coming off the core of his computer.

1027
01:08:35,413 --> 01:08:37,642
- G-Force went in to shut it down.
- G-Force?

1028
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:40,310
You sent those gophers in
without my authorization?

1029
01:08:40,352 --> 01:08:43,548
Sir, I'm picking up a video feed.
It's one of ours.

1030
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:44,884
Let's see it.

1031
01:08:44,922 --> 01:08:47,288
- What in the heck is that?
- That's Darwin.

1032
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,757
You say that like it's a good thing.

1033
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,487
What's he gonna do?
Gnaw his way out of there?

1034
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:53,621
He's gonna insert a virus into
the core and take down the network.

1035
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:06,670
- Hello, Darwin.
- Speckles, you're alive.

1036
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:11,069
You infiltrated the bad guy's lair.
Where is he?

1037
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:13,742
I am the bad guy.

1038
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,884
What? You really think I let myself
get killed in a garbage truck?

1039
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,253
Ha! Well I hid in a soup can.
Rode it all the way to the city dump.

1040
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,918
And it was stinky.

1041
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,725
- Speckles?
- I can't believe the mole was the mole.

1042
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,291
Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.

1043
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:35,293
- No.
- Business associate of Leonard Saber.

1044
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:38,773
You tricked Saber
into helping you build Clusterstorm?

1045
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,740
How could you do this to us?

1046
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:44,075
I thought we were friends.
I put my life on the line for you.

1047
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:47,911
Yanshu was in my basement
this whole time?

1048
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:49,712
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

1049
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:52,480
"Yanshu" is the Chinese word for mole.

1050
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,078
Sabersense was just a cover.

1051
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,750
I created an army of robotic appliances,

1052
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:02,661
and they created an array of
giant electromagnetic nodes...

1053
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:05,789
Nodes capable of pulling down all

1054
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:11,395
the space junk orbiting the planet,
and driving every human underground.

1055
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:17,138
- So, what do you think?
- You've betrayed us. You!

1056
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:22,615
- You sabotaged our presentation.
- Extermination virus. Nasty stuff.

1057
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:24,446
Speckles, why?

1058
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:30,483
You ever Google the word "mole" Darwin?
Three million entries.

1059
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:34,618
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

1060
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,595
Three million entries
on how to exterminate them!

1061
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:42,566
The humans came and destroyed
our home... destroyed our home.

1062
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:45,069
Son, if you ever get the chance

1063
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:48,698
to bring mankind to its knees... do it.

1064
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:54,971
They showed us no mercy, Darwin.

1065
01:10:55,012 --> 01:10:58,107
Well, now it's my turn
to do a little pest control.

1066
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:01,550
If you'll excuse me... it's showtime.

1067
01:11:02,855 --> 01:11:05,755
Going up!

1068
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:17,030
He's created some kind of monster.

1069
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:19,661
I think I'll stay here
and guard the exfil...

1070
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:24,170
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

1071
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,801
That's more
of a goal than a plan.

1072
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:39,149
It's working! Look out!
I'm feeling ten feet tall.

1073
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,156
Oh! Ah!

1074
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:51,362
No place like home.
There's no place like home.

1075
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,091
That'll leave a mark.

1076
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:56,767
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

1077
01:11:56,805 --> 01:11:59,035
How big is this thing going to get?

1078
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:05,172
You humans stole my home!
Now I will steal yours.

1079
01:12:05,214 --> 01:12:06,545
Oh-ho-ho!

1080
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,076
Look out!

1081
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:13,153
Something is missing. Oh, I know!

1082
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,361
Incoming!

1083
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:31,329
Just like humans.
Bringing guns to a space junk fight.

1084
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:36,037
- Darwin!
- Speckles, shut this down, now!

1085
01:12:36,077 --> 01:12:39,102
- No.
- Then I'll shut you down.

1086
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:43,208
I have no quarrel with you, Darwin,
but mankind must pay.

1087
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,580
You know I can't let you do that.

1088
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:47,918
Then you leave me no choice, my friend.

1089
01:12:55,195 --> 01:12:56,423
My parachute.

1090
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:04,433
The PDA!

1091
01:13:06,373 --> 01:13:07,431
Go get it, girl.

1092
01:13:12,613 --> 01:13:13,943
No!

1093
01:13:21,687 --> 01:13:25,646
Oh! Ah!

1094
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:28,117
Oh!

1095
01:13:33,131 --> 01:13:34,792
Ah!

1096
01:13:40,572 --> 01:13:42,199
Hurley, what are you doing?

1097
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:44,868
I gotta get you back up there.

1098
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:49,778
- No, Hurley! Don't do it.
- Go get him, bro! It's the only way!

1099
01:13:58,722 --> 01:14:00,656
Coming, Hurley!

1100
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:08,930
Take that! And that!
It's no fun being the little guy, is it?

1101
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,731
Everybody, hold on!

1102
01:14:13,236 --> 01:14:14,761
Fall back!

1103
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:24,309
Speckles, if you keep doing this

1104
01:14:24,347 --> 01:14:28,750
then you're no better than the humans
who destroyed your home and your family.

1105
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:32,743
Well, that's kind of the point here.
I lost my family.

1106
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:35,485
No, you're wrong. We're your family.

1107
01:14:35,525 --> 01:14:39,085
Me and Blaster
and Juarez and Ben and Marcie.

1108
01:14:40,596 --> 01:14:44,759
Speckles, Ben took us in
when nobody else wanted us.

1109
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,928
And he made us a family.

1110
01:14:50,672 --> 01:14:52,799
We're a family.

1111
01:14:56,778 --> 01:15:00,145
Oh, no! No! What have I done?
What have I done?

1112
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:05,414
It's too late, Darwin! I can't stop it!

1113
01:15:06,054 --> 01:15:07,987
But we can.

1114
01:15:11,326 --> 01:15:12,519
Whoa!

1115
01:15:14,095 --> 01:15:15,756
Ooh!

1116
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:22,934
It's working! Darwin, it's working!

1117
01:15:24,772 --> 01:15:26,467
Speckles, come with me.

1118
01:15:28,074 --> 01:15:29,406
Whoa!

1119
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,740
I got you!

1120
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:56,799
We've gotta find Hurley.

1121
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:05,273
- Hold it right there.
- We'll take him from here.

1122
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,039
Relax, guys. He's code four.

1123
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:10,747
- What a mess.
- There you go. Easy.

1124
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,313
- Darwin, over here!
- Hang on!

1125
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:20,290
- I got him. I got him.
- I can't hold it much longer.

1126
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,848
Ow!

1127
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:25,456
No, Hurley.

1128
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,224
No, not you, Hurley.

1129
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:31,065
Look,
he landed next to his cake.

1130
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:33,127
No.

1131
01:16:35,006 --> 01:16:36,165
Oh, man, Hurley.

1132
01:16:37,308 --> 01:16:39,606
- Hurley.
- Oh, no.

1133
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:44,238
No. No. This is all my fault.

1134
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:46,873
He was my man.

1135
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,443
Hurley, wake up, pal.

1136
01:16:50,987 --> 01:16:52,477
Listen, I just...

1137
01:16:52,522 --> 01:16:56,856
I just wanted you to know you
were as good as anyone out there today.

1138
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:00,195
I don't know what they call it
back in the pet shop,

1139
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:03,859
but out here we...
well we call it being a hero.

1140
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:07,533
All you ever wanted was a family.

1141
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:09,436
I never got to tell you this, but...

1142
01:17:10,106 --> 01:17:14,042
I'd be proud...
proud to call you my brother.

1143
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,383
Hurley.

1144
01:17:24,753 --> 01:17:27,415
Hey, I think I saw his nose twitch.

1145
01:17:33,128 --> 01:17:34,152
Hurley?

1146
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:38,529
Did you mean it
when you called me "brother?"

1147
01:17:38,566 --> 01:17:41,296
Not exactly. I was just...
That was like a figurative...

1148
01:17:43,438 --> 01:17:48,671
- You bet I did.
- Brother. I have a brother!

1149
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,404
This is great!

1150
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:52,310
We can spend every
Thanksgiving together,

1151
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:55,248
take road trips to Vegas,
have tickle fights!

1152
01:17:55,283 --> 01:17:58,252
Oh, come here. Give me a hug, bro.

1153
01:18:00,587 --> 01:18:02,885
Well...

1154
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,619
Oh, this is great!

1155
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:10,621
Oh! Mm-mm-mm!

1156
01:18:10,664 --> 01:18:14,031
So, Hurley.
You still want to be a part of the team?

1157
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:19,837
Two...

1158
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:21,801
Three...

1159
01:18:22,442 --> 01:18:23,739
Twenty-seven!

1160
01:18:24,077 --> 01:18:27,045
- Hurley. I'm right here watching you.
- Thirty-two.

1161
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:29,947
OK, that's it.
I don't want to get too buff.

1162
01:18:29,982 --> 01:18:31,506
Not to worry.

1163
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:37,280
Alrighty, guys.
Welcome to your new home.

1164
01:18:37,657 --> 01:18:40,956
OK, but I'm telling you now,
I don't do well with roommates.

1165
01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:44,451
- Easy there, tiger.
- Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

1166
01:18:44,497 --> 01:18:46,293
Jail break! Jail break!

1167
01:18:48,401 --> 01:18:52,963
Look, Juarez, I gotta know.
Which one of us are you interested in?

1168
01:18:53,005 --> 01:18:56,667
No no, Blaster! You've gotta ask her
who she's not interested in.

1169
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,471
Thirty, 42, 83.

1170
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:01,843
As far as I can tell,
you're not interested in either of us,

1171
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,338
which means either
you want both of us or neither of us,

1172
01:19:05,383 --> 01:19:09,114
which leaves us desperate
even though we don't have a clue!

1173
01:19:09,154 --> 01:19:11,417
And that's just how I like it.

1174
01:19:12,857 --> 01:19:15,882
Hey, guys?
It's the Director of the FBI.

1175
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:20,462
G- Force. I want you to know
that Leonard Saber

1176
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:24,991
has been forced to undertake the largest
recall of consumer products in history.

1177
01:19:25,035 --> 01:19:28,698
And he's getting help from somebody
quite knowledgeable about the defects.

1178
01:19:30,407 --> 01:19:33,706
Three down, 178,000 to go.

1179
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,772
I think I'm gonna be here a while.

1180
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:40,977
But I'm gonna rejoin the team
when I'm done. If they'll have me.

1181
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:45,283
Your, friend Agent Killian, has been
reassigned. He has a few words for you.

1182
01:19:46,689 --> 01:19:48,156
Hello, G-Force.

1183
01:19:49,026 --> 01:19:51,550
Look! A frozen FBl-cicle.

1184
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:55,997
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1185
01:19:57,166 --> 01:20:00,328
How long do I have to stay down here?
It's really cold!

1186
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:03,531
Team. As the full details
of your valor come to light,

1187
01:20:03,573 --> 01:20:08,977
it is an honor and a privilege to say
"thank you" on behalf of this country.

1188
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:13,175
You guinea pigs pack more courage and
heart into those teensy little frames

1189
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:15,240
than any agents I've ever seen.

1190
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:20,849
G- Force, your funding has been restored.
Welcome to the FBI.

1191
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:24,385
Guys... we got our badges.

1192
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:29,523
- Yeah, boy! We're official-tishal now!
- Finally!

1193
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:36,632
Not bad for a runt.

1194
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:39,632
Thanks for believing in me, Ben.

1195
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:46,207
Hurley, I've been thinking...

1196
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:49,613
If you're gonna be out there
helping us save the world,

1197
01:20:49,649 --> 01:20:52,847
you're gonna need this.
You're one of us now.

1198
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:57,017
My very own badge
and a new name! Rookie!

1199
01:20:57,058 --> 01:21:02,188
- So we're finally agents.
- No, special agents.

1200
01:21:04,397 --> 01:21:07,230
Let's get
this party started right!

1201
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:14,696
Whoo!

1202
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:18,699
Get him on the good foot!
All right, Hurley!

1203
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,107
G- Force in the house!

1204
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:29,552
Whoa!

1205
01:21:36,862 --> 01:21:39,227
Whoo!

1206
01:21:39,263 --> 01:21:41,095
Ay-yi-yi!

1207
01:21:43,701 --> 01:21:45,134
My turn! My turn!

1208
01:21:46,137 --> 01:21:48,332
Whee!

1209
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:02,679
Hey, boys!
This ferret can dance, right? Right?

1210
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,879
Wrong!

1211
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:05,946
Oh, Bucky!

1212
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:08,150
Oh, yeah!

1213
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:47,395
I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

1214
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,829
It's a good thing I took shop.

1215
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:56,565
Cherries.

1216
01:22:58,339 --> 01:23:02,208
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

1217
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:07,545
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

1218
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,982
I'm Jeff Gordon! With fur! Whoa!
