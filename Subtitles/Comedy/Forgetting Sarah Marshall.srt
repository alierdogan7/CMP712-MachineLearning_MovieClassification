brainy sexpot character,

to her successful
composer boyfriend,
Peter Bretter:

13
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,432
He's no household name,

14
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,873
yet Bretter's
dark and ominous score

15
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:58,912
has set the tone
for this gruesome juggernaut:

(RUSH SCOFFS)

19
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:10,354

for her
to re-enter the pageant

put on some clothes,

and we can sit down

for a long time
that we've been
growing apart.

No, that's not
what this is about.
There's no one else.

here. I really do.

working so much lately,

got to spend
much time together,

79

and you're forgetting
what it's like
to be with me.

But maybe, if we just held
each other or something,

81

you would remember
what it's like
to be with me.

your P in a V
right now.

I need to B my L
on somebody's T's.

That's disgusting.
You don't need
to be doing that.

111

you should
leave your P in the V

112

and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

the same thing, I'm gonna
feel like I wanna die.

for anything serious.

come home?

I had sex with this woman
who I barely even know.

156

I used a condom, but

that I have an STD, Doc.

on a fire truck?

Right. Little kids running?

Yeah, this is new.
I like it.

162
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,272
I'm kind of
backed up...

163
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,709
Could you take a look
at my penis?

164
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,214
Go ahead.
Let me see it.

Take it out.

167

Good.

168
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:33,175

looked at it.

dick, Peter.

170

Do you think Beautiful dick.
maybe while I'm here,

171
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:38,719
I could get some blood work?
Peter!

dumped you, right?

00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,456
Are you hurting?
Are you hurt?

174
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,999
Stop it. Stop crying.

175
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,465
Use your dick.
Keep fucking.
Fuck everything that moves.

176
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,627
Just wear a condom.

177
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,502
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids.
I gotta go, okay?

178
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:55,136
You want something?
You want a balloon?
You want a lolly?

179

(MOANING)

180
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,688
I just came.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

182
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:25,495
Hi.

183
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:27,919
Hi.

184
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,467
Hi. Hi.

185
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:31,958
Hi.

186
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:36,938
Hi.

187
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,135
Hi.

188
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:43,736
Okay, do you mind
not saying that
over and over again?

189
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,178
You can gag me.

190
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:52,183
You brought a gag?

191
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:53,316
And handcuffs.

192
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,715
Do you wanna gag me?

193
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,319
Kind of, now.

194
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,002
What've we got today?

195
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,963
Just a walk
and talk at the lab.

196
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,136
That's what
20 years on Vice
will do to you:

197
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,272
What've we got here?

198
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:19,376
The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit:

199
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,481
Ouch!

200
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,954
Can you say "dicksicle"?

201
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:27,887
Let's do this:

202
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,185
Okay, I'm ready.

203
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,030
The victim's penis
was found
behind the AC unit:

(PLAYING UPBEAT MELODY)

205
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,201
Just go with
the usual
stuff, maybe.

206
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,637
Something dark
and ominous.

207
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:44,575
Like losing
your penis
is a bad thing.

208
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,074
Oh, you want
dark and ominous.

209
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:53,581
Come on, I got
Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

That's what

What've we got here?

Peter! Peter,

aren't you?

Aren't you?
Pete, Pete, Pete.

215
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:10,869
Stop staring at me.

216
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,235
Pete!

217
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,038
You know you're
not getting paid for
today's session, right?

218
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,976
I'm aware of that.
Fucking asshole.

219
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,745
Peter, it's Brian.

220
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:25,178
PETER: Go away.

221
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:28,217
Listen, your landlord
called me.

222
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:30,187
Said there's smoke
coming out
of your place.

223
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,988
Who, Mr. Lopez?
'Cause he's a liar!

224

He doesn't...

225
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,856
We worry
about you, Petey.

226
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,399
Yeah, come on, Peter.
Open up the door.

227
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,631
The fire marshal's
gonna come in
and bust it down.

228
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,737
You haven't been
out of the house
in two weeks.

PETER: Why are you
so damn strong?

PETER: I feel
so strong!

00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:58,415
Hey, don't walk
away from me.
You come close.

is disgusting, Peter.

Hey, don't walk
away from me.

What are
you burning, man?
Come on.

236

It's everything.

237
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:11,853
It's everything
that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

238
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,449
Okay, I thought
I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not.

239
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,189
I'm not fine at all.

240
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:19,165
Okay, let's just
put the picture down.

241
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,200
Put that down.
Let's discuss this.

242
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,166
I know. I love her, man.

243
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:30,372
Look, Liz and I,
we think the world
of Sarah.

244
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,608
We think she's great.

245
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,781
Okay, but everything...

246
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,010
I'm just
being honest here.

247
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:40,350
Every time
she would come over
to our house,

248
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:43,253
she always acted,

249
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,724
you know,
like a little bitch!

250
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,763
Okay, okay,
pump the brakes.

251
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:54,131
Dating Sarah is not
like dating Liz. Okay?

252
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,205
Sarah is better
than Liz.

253
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:59,035
You really wanna
have this conversation?

254
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,674
Do you really
wanna have
this conversation?

255
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,047
Yes.

256
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:06,980
She is the mother
of my unborn child. Sorry.

257
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:09,018
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

258
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,380
I have no qualms
with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

259
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:14,550
You dick! Sorry.

260
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,181
I'm just worked up.

261
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,622
You gotta get your shit
together, man.

262
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,918
I'm trying to.
It's so hard here.

263
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,192
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

264
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:28,134
Like, she got me this,

265
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,901
okay, because
I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

266
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,342
and the cereal
would get stale,

267
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,210
and so one day I came home,
and she had
this waiting for me,

268
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,783
because it keeps
my cereal fresh.

269
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,476
And now I have
the freshest cereal.

270
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,616
Why don't you,
you know what,
go on a vacation?

271
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,383
Go to the Alps.

272
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:48,654
Alps?

273
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,354
Go to Gstaad.
It's the best.

274
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:51,826
I could go to Hawaii.

275
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:54,955
Sarah was always talking
about this place in Hawaii
that was supposed to be nice.

276
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,463
No, don't.
I wouldn't go there.

277
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:58,162
What, I can't go
to Hawaii now,

278
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,170
because Sarah Marshall
has heard of Hawaii?

279
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,637
Then go to Hawaii.
Go to Hawaii.

280
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,300
Do it.

281
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,476
(MUMBLING)

282
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,049
No, no, no,
don't destroy
the computer.

283
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,482
I'm just deleting
these pictures.

284
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:16,076
Okay, I need them
off my computer.

285
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:20,855
You know what?
You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

286
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,189
Well...

287
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:23,625
If we end up
getting back together,

288
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,994
I wanna have
a few of them left.

289
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,066
You're crazy.

290
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,155
No, no, please
don't delete them.

291
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,255
They have to go.
Done, done.

292
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:29,354

Hi, can I have another
bloody mary, please?

299
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,059
You're still working
on that one.

300
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,636
It's just
an anticipatory order.

301
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,871
Okay, I'll be right back!

302
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,082
SARAH: What do you think
caused
such excessive bleeding?

303
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:23,247
HUNTER: He was either
stabbed in the aorta or
it was his time of the month:

304
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,092
Aloha!

305
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,139
Check in this way.

306
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,113
Just married?

307
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,691
Yes, how did
you guess?

308
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:56,518
Oh, you've got that
magic newlywed dust
all over you.

309
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,585
Oh, my wife.

310
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,094
Oh, my husband.

311
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:01,926
Oh, my wife. My husband.

312
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,966
My old ball and chain.

313
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,673
You quit squirming
and come here.

314
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,602
What is into you?

315
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,905
Not me, yet.

316
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:20,040
Here is your room key.
So you're all set.
Room 222.

317
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:23,315
Room key's inside,
and the elevators
are to the right.

318
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:25,181
Congratulations.

319
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:29,885
Here you go, sir.
Have some POG juice.

320
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:31,964
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

321
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,328
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter,
Peter Bretter,

322
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:36,594
but actually,
I don't have
a reservation.

323
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:39,194
I just thought
I'd take my chances.

324
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,235
Bold!

325
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:46,899
We are all booked up,
but we do have
the Kapua suite available.

326
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,343
Okay.
How much is that?

327
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,812
$6,000 a night.

328
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:52,444
Beautiful views. Wow.

329
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:53,949
I can imagine.
That's a little bit
out of my price range.

330
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,316
Sorry.

331
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,358
That's a shame.
This is a beautiful

332
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:02,420
hotel.

333
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,264
Oh, yeah,
it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:

334
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:08,801
People are excited
that she's here.

335
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,534
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up
three weeks ago.

336
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,629
I'm sorry, sir.

337
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:15,833
Right.
This is fine, right?

338
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:16,911
Sir?

339
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:18,876
It's totally fine.
Okay, there she is.

340
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,079
Did she see me?
Is she
coming over here?

341
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,173
Yup.

342
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,981
I wish I wasn't wearing
this fucking shirt.

343
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:29,058
Fair enough.
Why don't you try
to unbutton it?

344
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,351
Button it back up.

345
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:35,189
Peter! Hey.

346
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:36,954
Hi.

347
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,500
What are
you doing here?

348
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,533
Came here
to murder you.

349
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,503
Really, what are
you doing here?

350
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:47,608
I have been having
a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

351
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,706
But then I came here,
and here you are.

352
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,475
I just think
that's too crazy
to be...

353
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,107
Hello there,
you little sex object.

354
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,880
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen
it anywhere?

355
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,684
It's like this one,
but, you know,

356
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,257
obviously it's
the opposite one.

357
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,963
Excuse me, missus,
I've lost a shoe.

358
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:09,758
Like this one.
It's like
this one's fellow.

359
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,958
Sort of the
exact opposite,
in fact, of that.

360
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,436
Not an evil version,
but just, you know,

361
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,599
a shoe like this,
but for
the other foot.

362
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:19,764
Otherwise,
I'd have two right...

363
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,342
Aldous, this is Peter.

364
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:25,277
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you,
mate. Aldous.

365
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:27,574
Good to
meet you, man.

366
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,709
My ex-boyfriend.

367
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,911
Right. Hey,
I'm Aldous Snow.

368
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:33,420
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very,
very famous.

369
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,515
Yeah, I am.
I am for my sins.

370
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,061
So are you
staying here,
as well?

371
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:39,526
I'm not,
as a matter of fact...
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,156
Excuse me,
Mr. Bretter,
Ms. Marshall,

373
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:46,602
but we were able to book
the Kapua suite for you,
sir, for four nights.

374
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:51,004
Yes, sir. You were?

375
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,214
Perfect. Marvelous.
Perfect amount of time.

376
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,782
Listen, if you wanna
have dinner with us
one of those nights...

377
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,315
Aldous... feel very...

378
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:00,408
PETER: No.

379
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,815
That's very gentlemanly
of you, but you two
enjoy your trip.

380
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,889
I'll be just fine
on my own.

381
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:04,613
ALDOUS: All right, Peter.

382
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:05,690
The Kapua suite...

383
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:06,758
Have a good trip, Pete.

384
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:11,465
I like your shirt.
It's colorful.

385
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,157
ALDOUS: Bye.
Bye now.

386
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:16,497
Ta-ta. I was wearing
two shoes
this morning, right?

387
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:22,842
Thank you.
Thank you
for bailing me out.

388
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,069
I still can't afford
that room.

389
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:28,154
Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or,
like, Céline Dion.

390
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:29,525
Really, it's not
a big deal.

391
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:32,158
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're
not technically a guest,

392
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,430
you have to clean up
after yourself.

393
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:37,096
Otherwise, here is
your room key

394
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,937
and enjoy your stay.

395
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,237
Why are you doing
this for me?

396
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:48,312
She's here with
some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

397
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,116
Yeah. Right?

398
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,352
Thank you.
Really, it's not a big deal.

399
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,823
Go enjoy yourself.

400
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,827
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times,
thank you,

401
00:21:57,928 --> 00:21:58,895
you know
what I mean...

402
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:00,258
Go enjoy yourself.

403
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:00,530
This is a disaster!

404
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,555
This is a disaster!

405
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,497
BRIAN:
Calm down, man:

406
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:04,862
Are there other hotels
on the island?

407
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:06,298
Of course
there are
other hotels,

408
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,393
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like
I'm running away.

409
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:11,804
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not
following them, are you?

410
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:13,070
I had
a girlfriend, right?

411
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:17,275
And Liam and Noel Gallagher
both had it off with her
right in front of me,

412
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,748
so that's similar.

413
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,340
And that was
a bit awkward,
actually.

414
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:23,388
So if you do wanna
change hotels,
I quite understand.

415
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,978
No, no, I'm not
changing hotels.

416
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,320
Stop following
and just go back
to your room, Peter.

417
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,484
They're gone!
Why are you looking for them?

418
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,462
I don't know.
You're acting like an idiot:

419
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:34,532
Run! Get out of there!
Go to your room!

420
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,599
What do you think
they're doing?

421
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,690
Peter, go:

422
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,667
Oh, God! Okay,
there they are.

423
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,464
There they are, I see them.
Go back to your room, Peter:

424
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,301
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

425
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:43,376
I'm going in.

426
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,138
Go back to you room, Peter:
Are you listening to me?

427
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:47,646
Peter, go back to your room:
Peter, Peter, Peter: : :

428
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:48,772
Hey!

429
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:49,849
(CLEARS THROAT)

430
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,985
PETER: Hey, nice room.

431
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,709
BRIAN: Go!

432
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:56,254
I am in the Kapua suite.

433
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:59,256
BRIAN:
What are you doing?
Sucker!

434
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:00,587
Have fun.

435
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:04,120
BRIAN: Listen,
you piece of shit!

436
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,427
You're an idiot!
Back to
your room, Peter:

437
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,128
Peter, back to
your room:

438
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,966
Did you enjoy that?

439
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:13,532
Did you like what you saw?

440
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:14,936
That hurt a lot:

441
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,099
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure
I just ruined her day.

442
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,812
(SCREAMING)

443
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,694
You know
how we thought
the killer masturbated

444
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:37,956
before he committed
each homicide?

445
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,794
That's the theory:

446
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,098
Take a look
at the microscope:

447
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,308
Oh, yeah, looks like
where he's going,

448
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,139
he'll need to know
how to masturbate:

449
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:55,944
(CRYING)

450
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:57,349
(PHONE RINGING)

451
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,453
(SNIFFLING)

452
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,390
Oh, God!

453
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,101
Hello.
RACHEL: Hey, Peter?

454
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:14,328
No. Sarah?

455
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,772
It's Rachel Jansen,
from the front desk.

456
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:20,935
Hey!

457
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,670
Hey, what's going on
up there?

458
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,011
I'm getting complaints
about a woman
crying hysterically.

459
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,052
Yeah, you know what,
I hear her, too,

460
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,450
and it sounds like
she's having
such a hard time.

461
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,286
I think it's coming from
the floor above me.

462
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,362
You're on the top floor.

463
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,264
I'll try to keep it down.

464
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:42,988
Are you okay?

465
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,329
Yeah, you have
a nice night.

466
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:45,526
Okay:

467
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,233
(CRYING)

468
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:01,721
I would love to
sell you some weed, Jeremy,

469
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:04,448
but I'm at my
fucking job right now.

470
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,582
Obviously, because
you called me at work,

471
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,784
you know that
I'm at my place of work.

472
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,863
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

473
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:13,295
I can sell you some weed
when I'm done.

474
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:16,995
Hold on, I gotta
call you back.
Mahalo, all right.

475
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:18,125
Hey, how's it going?

476
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:19,363
Hey.

477
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:21,133
I'd just like to
grab some dinner,
please.

478
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,798
Okay, great.
Is your wife
gonna meet you?

479
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:24,239
No.

480
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:26,736
Your girlfriend?

481
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,279
No, I don't have
a girlfriend.

482
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,049
You're just by yourself?

483
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:35,279
Yeah.

484
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:36,684
Sucks.

485
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:40,191
Okay, so just one.
Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

486
00:25:40,294 --> 00:25:41,727
Do you want,
like, a magazine
or something?

487
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:43,989
It's gonna be boring
if you're just
sitting by yourself.

488
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:45,290
I'll be all right.
Thank you.

489
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,697
I just would be
so depressed.

490
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,131
Yeah. Here you go.

491
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,202
Thank you.

492
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,800
The best thing is,
you have the greatest
table in the house.

493
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:55,934
Oh, yeah?

494
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:57,069
That's Aldous Snow
right there.

495
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:59,271
I know. I know, dude.
I know.

496
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:01,136
I'm gonna ask him.
I'll ask him politely.

497
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,738
No, please don't,
please.

498
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:03,906
Mate!

499
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:07,386
Why don't you come over
and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

500
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,718
No, thank you.
I need a drink.

501
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:14,055
Would you guys
like a drink?

502
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:16,460
Well, no, actually,
because...

503
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:20,325
Seven years clean.
That's what
this tattoo denotes.

504
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,803
Seven years free
from drugs and alcohol.

505
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:25,136
If I have just
one sip of wine,

506
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:29,143
by the end of the evening,
I'll be, like, rimming
waiters for their tips

507
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:30,437
just to get me hands
on a rock.

508
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,675
You know
what I mean? Nasty.

509
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:34,907
I heard that.

510
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,483
Hey, what's up, man?

511
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,681
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

512
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,219
It's mundane.

513
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,323
It is mundane.
It's great, I know.

514
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,053
Will you
marry me?

515
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:47,418
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Yes!

516
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:49,157
Beautiful. She said yes!

517
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,591
Congratulations!

518
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:57,494
I'm so excited!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

519
00:26:58,376 --> 00:26:59,534
Peter!

520
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,510
What's up?

521
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:05,235
Are you doing okay?

522
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,407
Yeah.

523
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,109
Yeah, I'm good.

524
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:12,985
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant
tell you I was coming?

525
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,491
Did you talk to her? No.

526
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,620
No, I didn't talk
to your assistant.

527
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:18,785
It's not all about you,
you know.

528
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:23,524
Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here,
usually not to follow you.

529
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:26,599
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

530
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:30,541
Yeah, I think so.
I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

531
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,333
I just love it.

532
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,070
Yeah, you should stay.

533
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,514
I appreciate
your consideration.

534
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,445
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

535
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:42,985
so thank you for
dating him after me.

536
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:44,678
I appreciate that.

537
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,851
Hope you have
a really good time here.

538
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,985
Have a great dinner.

539
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:51,390
Thank you.

540
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,063
Groupie whore.

541
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,091
Psycho stalker.

542
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:56,767
You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just
take a piña colada, please.

543
00:27:56,767 --> 00:28:01,229
You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just
take a piña colada, please.

544
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,941
Look at this guy.

545
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,812
Look at this guy.

546
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,622
Not us, buddy.
Right? Not us.

547
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:22,592
I'm on Sex and the City:
What's up, Miranda?

548
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:27,621
I'm Samantha.
I have sex with everyone.

549
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,726
Maybe it's a good thing
that they're here.

550
00:28:29,837 --> 00:28:32,737
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is
a challenge from God

551
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,900
for me to forget her.
You know?

552
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:39,276
Or maybe it's a sign
from God that
you should be with her.

553
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,808
I love her show.

554
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:45,683
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

555
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,088
What the hell
is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

556
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,385
I hear you say that,
but it's not that easy.

557
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,651
It's that easy.
Promise you it is.

558
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,487
I lived
in South Central.

559
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:57,395
South Central.
And I hated it.

560
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,761
That's why
I moved to Oahu.

561
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,096
Now I can name you
over 200
different kinds of fish.

562
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:02,830
PETER: No, you can't.
Oh, yes, I can.

563
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,372
Yeah, you cannot. Do it.

564
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:09,536
G. Ghost pipefish,
grill fish, goaler fish,
grouper fish, greenback...

565
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,373
What's the state fish
of Hawaii?

566
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,072
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

567
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:14,843
Yeah, bitch.
Hey.

568
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:16,812
You ready?

569
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,819
Yeah, just
gonna close up.

570
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:25,026
Hello, Mr. Bretter,
Mr. Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

571
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,830
She is in bed.

572
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,900
How are things going
with the lady?

573
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,166
Not awesome.
She's complicated,
like The Da Vinci Code,

574
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,872
you know,
but harder to crack.

575
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:43,044
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something
new every day.

576
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,445
Wonder what I'm going
to learn tomorrow.

577
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,013
Well.

578
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,215
Good night, sir.
Good night.

579
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,292
Good night, sir.

580
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,053
BRAYDEN: Off to find
the mythical clitoris.

581
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,627
So, Peter, were you able
to get that crying lady
out of your room?

582
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,338
'Cause I could
send someone up,
if you want.

583
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,268
Oh, you could? Yeah.

584
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,802
That's very funny.
It is.

585
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:16,074
Well, listen,
Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

586
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,842
I do the music
for that program.

587
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,543
Did I mention
that the music rocks?

588
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:27,752
That's very sweet of you.
That's very
sweet of you to say.

589
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,918
You don't have to say that,
though. It's not music.

590
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,691
There's no melody,
it's just tones.

591
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,926
Just dark,
ominous tones.

592
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,764
"The masturbating
dog killer
is on the loose again.

593
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,399
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least
the dogs are happy."

(IMITATING KEYBOARD)

595
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:52,177
I'm no Aldous Snow,
I guess, you know.

596
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:59,857
(SINGING)
Time to start the music

597
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,150
All gonna light the light

598
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:06,859
Yeah, yeah, gonna get things
started on
The Muppet Show tonight

599
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:09,726
(CRYING)

600
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,036
Whipped cream
or berry?

601
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:17,544
Whipped cream.

602
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,046
Here we are, sir.
Have a wonderful
breakfast.

603
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,783
What a lovely table,
so close to the buffet.

604
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:27,378
I'm glad
you like it.
Mahalo:

605
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,091
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you
with anything?

606
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:34,353
Orange juice, coffee?

607
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:37,988
What about, like, some
pineapple juice with a
little bit of rum on the side.

608
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,004
Of course.
I like your style.
Cocktail guy.

609
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:44,072
You are welcome. Thank you.

610
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:46,142
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

611
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:49,143
Honey, I know that,
but you know
that I wanted to see...

612
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:51,613
Hey. Hello there,
friend.

613
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:52,774
Hey.

614
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:55,318
How are you guys?
How was your evening?

615
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,784
Awesome. Great.

616
00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:58,283
I can't feel anything.

617
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:59,411
All right.

618
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:01,283
Does that
feel good?

619
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:02,484
I still can't
feel anything.

620
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,754
Okay, 'cause
it hurts me.

621
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,383
Would you do that
for me?

622
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:07,758
Yeah.

623
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,587
Yeah.

624
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,398
No, no, no. No.

625
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:15,870
God put our mouths
on our head
for a reason. No!

626
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:19,639
I'm going to
the bathroom.

627
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:20,904
Okay.

628
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:23,976
Is everything okay with...

629
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:27,347
Waffles.

630
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:32,346
Here you go, sir.
Breakfast of champions.

631
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:33,546
Oh, thank you.

632
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:38,323
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

633
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:41,155
Thank you.

634
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,232
Take it easy.

635
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,631
You, too.

636
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,146
Hi. Hi.

637
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,548
This is the yoga
place, yeah?

638
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,780
Yes. But there's
no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

639
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:07,522
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

640
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,527
Well, there's
no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

641
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:14,992
Can I set it down? Sure.

642
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,398
Cool, thank you. I like your hat.

643
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:18,597
Thank you.

644
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,867
Please remove it
before class.

645
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,369
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all
grab your mats?

646
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:32,743
Sorry, I recognize you from
the cover of Namaste Magazine:
I'm a huge fan.

647
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:35,321
Thank you.
That's so sweet
of you to say.

648
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:38,950
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do
yoga for recognition.

649
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,821
Right, of course
you wouldn't.

650
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:43,089
Then stop being
so good at it.

651
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:47,428
That's very flexible.
That's nice.

652
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:51,767
And, you,
I recognize you
from your show.

653
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,965
Thank you.

654
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,475
You seem much taller
on your show.

655
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,875
No, I know. I'm not.

656
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:04,014
Okay, if you just wanna
start by bringing
your palms into your chest.

657
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,022
Today we're gonna start
with the Surya Namaskar,
or Sun Salutation.

658
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,181
Let's take
a deep inhale in.

659
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:12,918
Exhale and
release the hands.

660
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:15,692
Inhale, arms up
to the sky.
Continue.

661
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:19,723
Good, exhale
and folding forward.

662
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:24,502
Strong, strong backs.
Good, excellent.

663
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,766
Remember this is
not a competition,

664
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,935
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

665
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,808
Excellent. Perfect form,
you two, perfect.

666
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:34,315
Coming up into
downward-facing dog.

667
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,417
Good. It's really important
in this pose,

668
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:40,580
that you arch your back
and keep it flat
at the same time.

669
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:43,386
I feel like
those are opposing ideas.

670
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:47,589
No, they're not,
'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

671
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:48,955
Okay.

672
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,297
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins
from this morning.

673
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,901
Come on, lady.
My name is Prana,

674
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,408
and I know
that wasn't just juice.

675
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:01,844
You don't really
need any adjusting,

676
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:04,779
so I'm just gonna
do this for myself.

677
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:07,743
Just to learn
from your body,

678
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,580
memorize your body.

679
00:35:10,654 --> 00:35:12,817
Good.
Strong legs.

680
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:14,118
Come on.

681
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,189
Perfect skin and form.

682
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:20,290
Okay, class, I'd like
to now move into
a tripod headstand.

683
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,026
This is more of
an advanced pose,

684
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:24,830
so if you don't
feel comfortable
or strong enough,

685
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:29,134
please feel free
to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

686
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,231
I got it.

687
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:33,245
All right,
so let's all come down
to our mats.

688
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,638
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

689
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:37,976
If you don't
feel comfortable,

690
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,176
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat
in child's pose.

691
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,913
PETER: Lady, I got it.
Okay.

692
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:45,719
Good, so let's prep
to come up. Good.

693
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:48,924
Sir, if you just want
to lay down
in child's pose.

694
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:50,395
(GRUNTS)

695
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,466
Now, you all heard me say,

696
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,432
"If you want to
be in child's pose,
that's okay."

697
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:55,591
Just in case
he gets hurt.

698
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,328
Bring it, bring it.

699
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,096
I don't want you to
break your neck.

700
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,935
PETER: What's up?
Just relax.

701
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,531
My legs,
that's what.

702
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,804
We're doing
quiet headstands today.

703
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,109
I'm doing a handstand,
motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

704
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:09,477
Okay, you know,
why don't we just release.

705
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,881
Thank God.

706
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,487
Good, everybody.
Good.

707
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:19,652
Hey.

708
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,420
Are you Chuck?

709
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:24,931
Oh, man, you know,
they won't
change that flyer.

710
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,531
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian
name is Koonu.

711
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:30,236
Cool, sorry.

712
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,567
No, it's all good.

713
00:36:31,674 --> 00:36:34,698
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

714
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:36,676
It means Chuck.

715
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,304
I plugged it
into a database.

716
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,440
There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet,
you just type in your name,

717
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,949
and it just says it.

718
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:45,875
What's your name?

719
00:36:45,977 --> 00:36:47,275
I'm Peter. Peter.

720
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:48,904
Yeah. I'm gonna give you
a Hawaiian name.

721
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,346
Oh, great.

722
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:55,151
Pepiopi.

723
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:58,325
Great.

724
00:36:58,426 --> 00:36:59,792
Pepiopi, looks like
you've got
a little pain

725
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,721
behind those eyes.

726
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,058
Yeah, maybe a little.

727
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:07,959
There's really only
one cure for that.

728
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,093
What's that?

729
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:10,899
Weed. You got any?

730
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,063
No.

731
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,234
Well, then
let's go surfing.

732
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:21,875
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to
ignore your instincts.

733
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:25,075
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

734
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:26,652
Don't do anything.

735
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:29,086
Don't try to surf,
don't do it.

736
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,288
The less you do,
the more you do.

737
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,759
Let's see you pop up.
Pop it up!

738
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,357
That's not it
at all.

739
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:43,337
Do less. Get down.
Try less. Do it again.

740
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,000
Pop up.

741
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,335
No, too slow.
Do less.

742
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:48,670
Pop up.

743
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,268
Pop up.

744
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,642
You're doing too much.
Do less. Pop down.

745
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:53,976
Pop up now.

746
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,447
Stop! Get down.
Get down there.

747
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:57,680
Remember,
don't do anything.

748
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:00,015
Nothing. Pop up.

749
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,250
Well, you...
No, you gotta do
more than that,

750
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,520
'cause you're just
laying right out.

751
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,596
It looks like
you're boogie-boarding.

752
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:08,857
Just do it.
Feel it.
Pop up.

753
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:13,401
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna
figure it out, out there.

754
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,562
Let's go surfing,
come on.

755
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,641
Everybody's learning
how, come on and...

756
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,037
(SINGING)
The weather outside
is weather

757
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:22,736
PETER: How long
you lived out here?

758
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,748
Man, I don't know.
I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

759
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,047
Wow, that's so cool.

760
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:28,243
Yeah.

761
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:32,449
No, like my cell phone
has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

762
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:35,287
Right, so it's basically
the same thing.

763
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,988
How old are you?

764
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,085
I don't really believe
in age or numbers,

765
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:42,029
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had
to put a number on it,

766
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:45,330
I guess
I'd be 44.

767
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:47,631
Fuck!

768
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,104
Thanks for
taking me out here.

769
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:55,247
This is the first time
I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

770
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,975
You need to get back
on that board
is what you need to do.

771
00:38:58,084 --> 00:38:59,243
Hey, here's the deal. Yeah?

772
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:00,409
When life gives you lemons,

773
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:01,540
just say,
"Fuck the lemons,"
and bail.

774
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,513
Yeah. No.
You said it, totally.

775
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,785
You gotta just
pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

776
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:09,919
get back on that board...

777
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,587
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked
by a shark,

778
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,165
are you gonna
give up surfing?

779
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,962
Probably, yeah.

780
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,795
Let's go in, all right.
Tacos are on me.

781
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,935
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying
to you, Brian?

782
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:23,567
I'm confused
and I don't know
what to do.

783
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:24,973
What's up with that hat?

784
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:27,740
What are you
in the Buena Vista
Social Club?

785
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:29,008
This is a nice hat.

786
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,846
What member of
the Brat Pack are you?

787
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,944
You look like one
of those guys
suspected of killing JFK:

788
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:37,319
That's very funny.
That's great.

LIZ: Tell him
to make friends:

790
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:42,092
You need to get out there
and make some friends, man:

791
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:43,754
Is Liz there right now?

792
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:45,991
No, no, she's not
in here, buddy:

793
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:47,192
I just heard her.

794
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,701
She's gone:

795
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,203
Who are you looking at?

796
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:52,406
What?

797
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,234
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

798
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:58,176
No: I swear on
my mother's grave, it: : :
Okay, it was Liz:

799
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,505
She wasn't here
the entire time:

800
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:02,743
Go out and meet people:
We meet people
all the time: : :

802
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:07,421
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple
of dudes here,

803
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,682
but they're kind of weird.

804
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:11,855
Just be friendly:

805
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,087
Iron your shirt:

806
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:14,627
Iron your shirt,
look sharp:

807
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:16,392
Even your T-shirts:

808
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:19,495
There is this girl
at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

809
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:23,038
Oh, yeah: You know what?
Go have another
dirty one night stand:

810
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,900
That worked out
so well before:

811
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,908
What do you want from me?
You just told me
I need to meet people.

812
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,537
Ask her out:
Maybe that's what
he needs, is a rebound:

813
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:32,547
BRIAN: He's had
plenty of chances
for rebounds: This isn't: : :

814
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:33,810
LIZ: Can we get on
the same team here?

815
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,977
Okay, I'm sorry:
We're on the same team:
Sorry:

816
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:39,951
LIZ: You should go
on a date with this girl:

817
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:41,421
Well, maybe
I'll ask her out then.

818
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,424
LIZ: Yes: My wife says so.

819
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:45,886
Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!

820
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:46,986
LIZ: Oh, that's neat:

Is that right?

Oh, yeah:

828
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:04,438
It's called the hula:

829
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,310
Luau? No, hula.

830
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,612

You look beautiful.
I mean, that's
a beautiful dress.

Thank you. Yeah.

This'll be fun.

May I help you
with something else, Peter?

No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:29,536
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

854
00:42:29,638 --> 00:42:33,904
He is the lead singer
of the band,
Infant Sorrow,

855
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:38,274
one of my favorite musicians
of all time.
He's so awesome.

856
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:41,406
Please, please,
let's take...

857
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:46,183
Let's see if we can get him
up here, Mr. Aldous Snow.
Please, come on.

858
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:48,214
Share your gift.

859
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:49,620
Duty calls
and all that.

860
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:51,214
I'm trying to be
incognito, it's weird.

861
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:53,488
It's like work to me,
this is no fun.

862
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:55,292
Hey! Thank you!

863
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:06,409
ALDOUS: Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

864
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,978
What an eccentric
and confident young man.

865
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,344
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman
that's here today.

866
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:13,882
It's Miss Sarah Marshall,
there she is.

867
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:18,192
Look at her, blimey!

I've had these wandering eyes

870
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:34,475
but you took me by surprise

871
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,947
when you let me inside you

872
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,412
Inside you

Inside you

874
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,123
This went from
6:00 to midnight.

875
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:49,682
Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving
inside of you

is it wrong to be

879

inside of you

880
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,975
Inside of you the restless

Inside of you

Hey.

883
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,491
You're from
the breakfast
buffet, right?

884
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:25,223
Yeah. Whipped cream
or berries?

885
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,130
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm Peter.

00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,136
Yes.

893
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:41,546
How do you know
I was dating
Sarah Marshall?

894
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,024
Dwayne told me.
Chuck told me.

895
00:44:45,134 --> 00:44:46,363
Even Rachel told me.

896
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,663
I heard about it
from everybody.

897
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,502
You gotta stop
talking about it.

898
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,037
It's like The Sopranos:

899
00:44:53,145 --> 00:44:54,475
It's over.

You need a hug.

902
00:45:00,152 --> 00:45:01,641
Come here.

903
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:04,875
Oh, thank you.

904
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:06,786
You're awfully nice.

905
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:10,690
I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig
for tomorrow's luau:

906
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:13,595
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind
off of things.

907
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,563
No. Yeah? You don't mind?

908
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:18,933
I mean, I must say
I'm a pretty good cook.

909
00:45:19,305 --> 00:45:20,499
All right!

I can't! Please don't
make me do this!

912
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:27,705
Do it!

crying now.

I'm not crying.

918
00:45:40,526 --> 00:45:41,859
You should stop crying.

919

I don't cry.
I'm not a baby.

00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,564
Really?
'Cause you look like
a gigantic baby.

921
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,496
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
that at all.

922

Hey.

923
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,109
Listen, would you like to
hang out tonight, like, not
in an official hotel function?

924
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:06,549
Yeah. Totally.

925
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:09,214
A bunch of us are going to
go to this, like,
little beach thing afterwards.

926
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:11,654
You're totally welcome
to come.

927
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,854
Maybe we could
go together?

928
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:15,519
Yeah, whatever.

929
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,159
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

930
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:18,255
I just thought
that maybe...

931
00:46:18,366 --> 00:46:19,833
No, listen,
you don't have
to make this weird.

932
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:21,731
You either want to go
or you don't.

933
00:46:23,304 --> 00:46:24,931
I would love to. Okay.

934
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:28,236
Awesome.
Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

935
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:31,140
and I'll meet you
out front in,
like, five?

We were together
for two years.

944

Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

945
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:20,489
Three weeks later,
I caught him
cheating on me,

946
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:22,930
so I moved out,
and that's that.

947
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:25,595
What an asshole.

No, he's just a boy.

going back home,
finishing school, or...

No.

No. I work
at the hotel,

be a future in there.

00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:47,683
Okay.

00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:52,727
So, how do you like
writing music
for a TV show?

956
00:47:55,368 --> 00:47:57,993
It's great, you know.
People are great.

00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:01,228
It's great to have
a steady paycheck.
It's... I'm very lucky.

Oh, my God, you hate it.

959
00:48:02,406 --> 00:48:04,638
I fucking hate it
so much.

960
00:48:04,944 --> 00:48:07,241
So then, do something
about it.

961
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:12,017
Excuse me.

962
00:48:12,118 --> 00:48:15,314
I'm just saying,
if you hate something,
change it.

963
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:17,045
Don't dwell. Well, I'm trying.

964
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:21,788
I'm actually working
on a rock opera.

965
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:24,263
Yeah? Yeah.

966
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,792
What's your
rock opera about?

967
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:31,602
Dracula.

968
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,804
Yeah, and eternal love,
you know.
That's the theme.

969
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:39,366
But I think
the two sort of go
hand in hand, you know?

970
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:41,143
And I...

971
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:46,210
I have this vision
of doing it with puppets.

972
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:50,855
I mean, humans also,
you know.

973
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:54,659
Why Dracula?

974
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:58,596
Because he's a man
like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

975
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,462
And every time
he gets close
to a human woman,

976
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:02,197
he ends up
smothering
and killing her,

977
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:04,897
which is a feeling
I am familiar with.

978
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:06,940
What?
That's just a joke.

979
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,906
Oh, shit. What?

If I run, you run.

00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:16,114
Do you understand?
No, I don't understand at all.

982
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,016
Fucking motherfucker!
Dipshit!

983
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,087

what are you doing?

984
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,055

to stay back
on your island.

just take it easy.

was over April 9.

987

Well, the deal's back on,

in this village.

me from breakfast?

that's right.

Yeah.

was a fucking man.

I ever dated him.

are dysfunctional.

those girls
from Flavor of Love:

From what? You were.

I'll kill you."

1009
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,660
Okay, I'm gonna go
get us another round.

1010
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,730
I'll grab it.
It's no big deal.

1011

dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

the shot, come on.

that there's a picture
of you flashing,

Yeah. I hate it so much.

1019
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:36,825
My jackass boyfriend
made me do it.

1020

Keoki took it,
right there.

1021

to take it down,

it would ruin the balance
of the collage.

to get it down for you?

1024
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,507
No. No, no, no,
he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

1025
00:51:53,484 --> 00:51:55,852
But I have
a surprise for you.

1026
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:57,616
Really, what?

1027
00:51:57,721 --> 00:51:58,982
MAN: We're gonna
take a quick break.

1028
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:01,112
Tonight we have
a special guest
from the mainland,

1029
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:04,058
singing a song
from his Dracula musical,

1030
00:52:04,395 --> 00:52:07,364
please welcome
to the stage,
Mr. Peter Bretter.

1031
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,153
(WHOOPS)

1032
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:10,392
Peter!

1033
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,163
Yeah!
Go get them,
tiger!

1034
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,292
Please don't.

1035
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:14,393
(EXCLAIMING)

1036
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,837
Peter!

1037
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:18,573
Dracula! Peter! Rachel...

1038
00:52:23,982 --> 00:52:25,241
Get them!

1039
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:26,645
What's up?

1040
00:52:33,058 --> 00:52:34,455
Thank you.

1041
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:38,694
You know, I could play
something else.

1042
00:52:38,797 --> 00:52:40,263
I just think out of
context this might be...

1043
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:42,060
RACHEL: Dracula musical!

1044
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:45,366
Thank you.

1045
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:09,984
(SINGING) It's getting
kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better

1046
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:18,101
I've been drowning
too long to believe
that the tide's going to turn

1047
00:53:19,772 --> 00:53:25,609
And I've been living too hard
to believe things
are going to get easier now

1048
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:31,711
I'm still trying to
shake off the pain from
the lessons I've learned

1049
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:39,054
And if I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the lord
I will slay him

1050
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:40,991
(LAUGHING MENACINGLY)

1051
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:45,660
Take it from me, but I swear
I won't let it be so

1052
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:53,063
Blood will run down his face
when he is decapitated

1053
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:58,375
His head on my mantle
is how I will
let this one know

1054
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,612
How much I love you

1055
00:54:09,325 --> 00:54:10,452
Die

1056
00:54:11,429 --> 00:54:12,486
Die

1057
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:14,618
Die

1058
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:20,363
I can't

1059
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:33,346
RACHEL: Awesome!

1060
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,315
PETER: Thank you.

1061
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,314
Thank you.

1062
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:43,647
So, I had a really,
really great time tonight.

1063
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,953
Yeah. I mean, Yeah?
it got a little wild.

1064
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,929
"A little"?
Yeah. You can say that.

1065
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:50,763
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool,
and it was...

1066
00:54:50,868 --> 00:54:52,562
Thank you
for taking me out.

1067
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:54,535
No, I had a great time.
Thank you.

1068
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,667
You did? Yeah.

1069
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:03,904
I'm sorry.

1070
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:05,345
I'm sorry,
I just... I don't...

1071
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:08,180
I just don't wanna
complicate things.

1072
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,685
No, of course! Yeah?

1073
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:12,915
No, no, no. Totally.
I totally get that.

1074
00:55:13,022 --> 00:55:14,047
I had a great time.

1075
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:15,182
A handshake?

1076
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,091
Well, I don't know.
Okay.

1077
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:18,493
All right, all right.

1078
00:55:18,596 --> 00:55:19,894
All right.
Get home safe.

1079
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:21,226
You, too.

1080
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,337
Thanks again. Bye.

1081
00:55:33,613 --> 00:55:37,241
ALDOUS: (SINGING)
I'm on a hammock
with me lady

1082
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:40,717
Watching the sea roll by

1083
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,616
Things have been great now

1084
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:49,025
'Cause we're in Hawaii

1085
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:52,330
Hey, guys.

1086
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:55,697
Hey, man.
I'm Koonu.

1087
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:57,903
Yeah. No, I remember.
I'm Peter.

1088
00:55:58,007 --> 00:55:59,665
We took a surf lesson
together.

1089
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:03,266
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with
Kaiser Permanente.

1090
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:06,906
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk
out on the water.

1091
00:56:07,016 --> 00:56:08,482
That's cool.

1092
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:12,616
Okay, can I just
say something?

1093
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,950
I went on a date
tonight with
Rachel, right?

1094
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:16,217
That wasn't a date.

1095
00:56:16,324 --> 00:56:18,258
She's in
customer service, dude.

1096
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:20,417
She took you out
for charity.

1097
00:56:20,528 --> 00:56:24,796
It was a date, okay?
Trust me. I know a date,
and that was a date.

1098
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:27,267
I bet you think
strippers like you, too.

1099
00:56:29,002 --> 00:56:30,127
That's really not necessary.
It's true.

1100
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:32,205
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me,
it is a nowhere road. I know.

1101
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:35,278
Did you see
her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

1102
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:37,607
Who, Greg?
I love Greg, man.

1103
00:56:37,712 --> 00:56:40,442
I saw him beat up a guy
with a starfish.

1104
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:42,211
Okay, that's
just ridiculous.

1105
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,546
That guy was me.

1106
00:56:43,653 --> 00:56:46,553
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

1107
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,214
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can
ever have.

1108
00:56:49,324 --> 00:56:51,087
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

1109
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:52,685
Come on.

1110
00:56:54,031 --> 00:56:59,933
The wife wants me to
do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

1111
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:02,868
Let me just say
that if God
was a city planner,

1112
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,806
he would not put
a playground
next to a sewage system.

1113
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:13,073
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not
having fun fucking.

1114
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:17,174
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing
her private parts,

1115
00:57:17,286 --> 00:57:21,223
and it's not fun,
and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

1116
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:24,895
And then when
you're not fucking...

1117
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:26,020
PETER: Hey, someone's
gotta stop him.

1118
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:27,118
You're the butt
of a joke.

1119
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:30,362
Fucking this ring is...

1120
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:32,062
Fuck!

1121
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,296
It's gonna
be all right.

1122
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:37,265
Hi.

1123
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:41,243
Hi, do you wanna
come back to bed?

1124
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:42,573
Sure.

1125
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:46,848
Have fun.

1126
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:52,721
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet
matches her pubes.

1127
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:02,330
Julian, what's up?

1128
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:07,964
God.

1129
00:58:18,183 --> 00:58:20,017
The show's been canceled.

1130
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,950
That's good,
'cause that's what
you wanted.

1131
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:24,547
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1132
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:30,990
It's just... I guess
I thought we had
another year left.

1133
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:33,258
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,

1134
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:36,493
'cause it's been
a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

1135
00:58:36,603 --> 00:58:39,904
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just...
It's a surprise.

1136
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:41,636
Come on tour with me.

1137
00:58:41,745 --> 00:58:46,544
I'll serenade you
every night in front of
thousands of women.

1138
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:48,344
I didn't know
you were going on tour.

1139
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:49,679
Yeah, I'm going
in two weeks.

1140
00:58:49,784 --> 00:58:53,810
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1141
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,015
and it's gonna be
a massive tour.

1142
00:58:56,124 --> 00:59:01,256
Yeah. I can't come
'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

1143
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:03,092
Not anymore.

1144
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:05,690
You're an unemployed
actress, perfect.

1145
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:09,667
You could be the queen
of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1146
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,259
The Sorrow Suckers.

1147
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,500
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know
why they call them that.

1148
00:59:16,612 --> 00:59:19,877
Mr. and Mrs. Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

1149
00:59:21,549 --> 00:59:23,245
The hotel wanted to
offer you some
complimentary coconut cake.

1150
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:27,379
It's from the hotel.
It's definitely not
from me personally, so...

1151
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:29,624
Yeah, thanks.

1152
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:30,749
Okay, great.

1153
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:34,192
When were you planning
on telling me this?

1154
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:36,288
I just
told you, then.

1155
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:37,891
Yeah. No, I know.

1156
00:59:38,002 --> 00:59:42,767
But telling me now
isn't really the same
as telling me.

1157
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:45,638
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you
I've got genital herpes,

1158
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:48,075
because it's not inflamed
at the moment.

1159
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,170
Do you guys
want some champagne
with your cake,

1160
00:59:50,279 --> 00:59:51,609
or do you want it
without your cake?

1161
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:53,307
ALDOUS: I don't drink.

1162
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:05,163
All right, so I came here
to give you
my demo. I just...

1163
01:00:05,263 --> 01:00:07,595
I worship you,
and I just wanted to
give you my demo.

1164
01:00:07,698 --> 01:00:09,790
Just take a listen and...

1165
01:00:11,034 --> 01:00:12,433
Okay.

1166
01:00:13,203 --> 01:00:15,696
'Cause you know what?
You don't wanna be
the guy sitting there,

1167
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:18,504
watching BBC,
and saying,

1168
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:22,203
"Oh, I saw that guy!
He was my waiter,

1169
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:26,249
"and I totally dismissed him
like everyone else
does in his life.

1170
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,183
"And I totally was wrong,

1171
01:00:28,288 --> 01:00:31,746
"because he's a major,
major, major
influence on me now,

1172
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:33,850
"and I feel terrible!"

1173
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:34,928
(CLEARS THROAT)

1174
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:39,935
That stupid English voice,
was that me?

1175
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,239
Unfortunately, yes.

1176
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,607
You're really
gonna like it.

1177
01:00:47,284 --> 01:00:50,481
I'll listen to it
when you've gone.

1178
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:59,089
Hey, look,
just don't tell
anyone at the hotel.

1179
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,397
What's up, dude?

1180
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:10,495
What's up?

1181
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:15,170
Peter, I got some
really interesting news
this morning.

1182
01:01:15,312 --> 01:01:17,303
Aldous gave you
gonorrhea?

1183
01:01:17,415 --> 01:01:19,576
No. Why would
I tell you that?

1184
01:01:20,352 --> 01:01:22,343
Crime Scene was cancelled.

1185
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:24,145
Whoa!

1186
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:26,281
Wow.

1187
01:01:29,261 --> 01:01:30,386
You all right?

1188
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,053
Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:35,796
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

1190
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:38,698
you know, into features
for a long time,
so it's a really good thing.

1191
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:43,707
This isn't The View:
I mean, we can have an honest
talk about this if we want.

1192
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:48,343
I don't wanna step out
of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.

1193
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,008
I don't wanna disappear.
I'm freaked out.

1194
01:01:51,118 --> 01:01:53,678
I wanna be honest.
I'm really freaked out
right now, okay?

1195
01:01:53,787 --> 01:01:57,778
Because, seemingly,
the only actresses that
actually can survive

1196
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,917
are the ones that show
their cooter, and, excuse me,
but I refuse to do that.

1197
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:02,188
I have a little dignity.

1198
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:05,321
And I don't have the frame
to support plastic surgery.
I would tip over.

1199
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:07,728
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna
exploit myself.

1200
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:12,236
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
You have a long career
ahead of you.

1201
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:15,899
You've got, like,
four years
until you're 30.

1202
01:02:16,008 --> 01:02:17,805
It's gonna be fine.

1203
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:22,942
How are you?

1204
01:02:23,051 --> 01:02:24,178
I'm screwed.

1205
01:02:24,285 --> 01:02:28,779
Frankly, I don't
stand a chance.
No, I'll be fine.

1206
01:02:29,824 --> 01:02:33,417
I've been quietly
stealing money from you
for a long time.

1207
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:38,356
You're always good
at cheering me up,
Pete, thank you.

1208
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:43,330
(SINGING) Die

1209
01:02:44,073 --> 01:02:45,538
Die

1210
01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:47,606
Die

1211
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:51,875
I can't

1212
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:58,848
It's really good, Peter.
I just don't
understand it. I don't.

1213
01:02:58,953 --> 01:03:00,386
I mean, just
chalk it up to that.

1214
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:02,185
Please don't
play it again,
'cause I don't...

1215
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:04,417
Just listen to it
one more time and see...

1216
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,825
Where's Aldous?

1217
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,964
BRAYDEN: Mr. Snow,
may I ask you
a question?

1218
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:12,057
ALDOUS: Okay.

1219
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:14,067
I want to
please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,

1220
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,194
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

1221
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:16,462
You having difficulty
sex-wise?

1222
01:03:18,663 --> 01:03:19,459
Do you not know
how to use this?

1223
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:20,531
I know how.

1224
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,100
Have you had
sex before?

1225
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:23,189
We can't.

1226
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:24,734
Why? Our religion.

1227
01:03:24,836 --> 01:03:26,327
Right, 'cause of God
and everything?

1228
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:27,565
Hey, that's not
gonna be a problem,

1229
01:03:27,674 --> 01:03:29,903
because God
should be present
in the bedroom.

1230
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,499
Just tell me
specifically
what I need to do.

1231
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:35,479
You need to penetrate
deeply and stimulate
the clitoris simultaneously.

1232
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,343
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

1233
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,748
If you can involve the anus
in that, then that's
absolute perfection.

1234
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:40,819
Got it.

1235
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,218
Explore her ears.

1236
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:46,689
Find it in you to be
a little more circly.

1237
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:47,848
You are a man.

1238
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:49,118
God's within you.

1239
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:50,594
I actually feel okay
about it.

1240
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:53,598
You know, I'm a little scared,
but I'll be all right.
I'll get another job.

1241
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:56,226
That's interesting, man:
You know what else
is interesting?

1242
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:59,134
What?
Me on the moon:

1243
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,468
I just wanna talk to you
about something.
Can you stop?

1244
01:04:01,573 --> 01:04:02,562
All right, I'm just gonna
talk, and then...

1245
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:03,663
Air!

1246
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:06,210
There was this
interesting moment
with Sarah.

1247
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:09,647
Whoa, what? I don't wanna hear
about your interesting
moment with Sarah, Pete:

1248
01:04:09,752 --> 01:04:11,377
Then who am I
supposed to talk to
about this?

1249
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:15,116
Well, not me, because have
I ever had an interesting
moment with an ex-girlfriend?

1250
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:16,714
Do you have
an ex-girlfriend? No!

1251
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:17,814
No:

1252
01:04:17,926 --> 01:04:19,187
LIZ: No:

1253
01:04:20,192 --> 01:04:23,354
I would really love to get
the woman's perspective
on the matter.

1254
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:24,955
No. Really?

1255
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:26,761
But come on in
and just sit down.

1256
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:28,165
Stay:
You have to: : :

1257
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,464
Honey, no, no,
the camera's
right there:

1258
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:30,663
No, I know,
but I just wanna
tell him, though:

1259
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:31,864
No, the camera: : :

1260
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:33,496
Think about how much
she's hurt you:

1261
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:34,633
Hey, Liz?
Yeah?

1262
01:04:34,743 --> 01:04:37,234
I think you need to move just
a tiny bit further away
from the microphone.

1263
01:04:37,346 --> 01:04:38,335
No, closer. Just: : :

1264
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:39,413
Now a little further.
Okay:

1265
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:40,504
Closer. And then...

1266
01:04:40,616 --> 01:04:42,344
And then a little further,
and then closer.
I don't know:

1267
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:43,747
Keep your head down, though.
I'm bad at this thing:

1268
01:04:43,853 --> 01:04:44,978
Can you hear me?
Yeah, closer.

1269
01:04:46,587 --> 01:04:48,078
Further away.

1270
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,417
I know what you're doing:
That's not funny at all:

1271
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:51,254
What? You stop that:

1272
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,348
What's he doing?

1273
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,223
Come on:
Yeah, yeah, real funny:

1274
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:55,295
Hey, that's
a great necklace, Liz.

1275
01:04:56,732 --> 01:04:58,497
Did you have that
a second ago?
Thank you!

1276
01:04:58,602 --> 01:04:59,659
That's gross!

1277
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:00,792
LIZ: I don't get it: Stop it.

1278
01:05:02,305 --> 01:05:05,241
He's saying
if I were to sperm on you: : :

1279
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:06,401
What?

1280
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,205
: : : it would be
a pearl necklace:

1281
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:09,276
Why?

1282
01:05:09,377 --> 01:05:11,141
Real funny:
Sorry.

1283
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:14,506
Hey, Dracula!

1284
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:19,077
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord,
I'll slay him."

1285
01:05:21,076 --> 01:05:23,342
That shit is funny, dude!

1286
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:24,937
Hey, Pete.

1287
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:27,314
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

1288
01:05:27,419 --> 01:05:29,078
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to
come and join.

1289
01:05:31,491 --> 01:05:34,153
I think I'm confused,
because I thought
last night...

1290
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:38,027
Oh, my God. Dude,
get out of your head.
It's really nice out here.

1291
01:05:38,132 --> 01:05:40,828
Yeah, I bet it is.

1292
01:05:40,935 --> 01:05:41,995
All right, yeah.
You know what?

1293
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,505
I could totally use
a friendly hangout, so...

1294
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,629
All right.

1295
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,173
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,

1296
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:48,241
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

1297
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:49,536
Really? Yeah.

1298
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:52,045
I heard that place
was a pain in the ass.

1299
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:54,339
RACHEL: Okay.

1300
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,810
RACHEL: Hey!
DWAYNE: Yo, what's up, guys?

1301
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,009
We're just going
for a hike.

1302
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,784
No, you're not,
you're going
snorkeling.

1303
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,254
PETER: I think
we're gonna go on a hike.

1304
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:05,486
DWAYNE: It is sea turtle
fucking season,
dude. Let's go.

1305
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:08,893
They fuck for
three hours, dude.
I mean, that's magical.

1306
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:10,828
No, we're going on a hike.
I think we'll go on
a hike, yeah.

1307
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:12,729
What? Your loss.

1308
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:15,937
Why won't anybody
go snorkeling with me?

1309
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,272
How you doing
back there?

1310
01:06:25,346 --> 01:06:26,678
Awesome.

1311
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:30,049
I don't think
I've ever been this covered
in sweat before.

1312
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,181
It's like I have
some sort of fever.

1313
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,484
I told you this was
a pain in the ass.

1314
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,524
Could've been
at Lazy Joe's.

1315
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,183
Oh, yeah.

1316
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,955
Oh, shit.

1317
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:41,759
You good? No.

1318
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:47,495
PETER: Wow, we're really
going up to
the edge of this, huh?

1319
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:48,902
Look!

1320
01:06:53,078 --> 01:06:56,069
Wow, this is
really beautiful.

1321
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,676
All right, so now that
your show's done,

1322
01:07:00,786 --> 01:07:03,152
are you gonna finish
the Dracula musical?

1323
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,413
It's not that easy,
you know.

1324
01:07:06,557 --> 01:07:09,118
Sarah always thought
it was crazy, and...

1325
01:07:09,228 --> 01:07:13,960
Well, you're definitely crazy.
But so is everyone, right?
So who cares?

1326
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:15,828
I just don't feel
like doing anything.

1327
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:17,459
Why?

1328
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:18,765
'Cause my heart
is broken,

1329
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:21,634
and I can't imagine
doing anything
right now.

1330
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:25,674
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back
to school, you know?

1331
01:07:29,214 --> 01:07:31,980
Maybe it's good
we got hurt like that,
you know?

1332
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:37,319
I don't know about you,
but it makes me
feel impervious to pain.

1333
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:40,987
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left
to be afraid of.

1334
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:42,391
Yeah. No, exactly.

1335
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:43,688
Right.

1336
01:07:43,796 --> 01:07:48,029
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us
as bad as they did.

1337
01:07:50,138 --> 01:07:51,970
So jump, then.

1338
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:54,504
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor,
you know?

1339
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:56,634
No. Just do it.

1340
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:02,377
You'll be fine. Jump.

1341
01:08:08,256 --> 01:08:10,156
What the hell?

1342
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:15,185
Oh, God! Oh, God.
I made her kill herself!

1343
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,229
(EXCLAIMING)

1344
01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:22,363
You must be crazy!

1345
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,198
So are you gonna
jump or what?

1346
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:25,363
No!

1347
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:28,930
Come on, Peter!
I can see your vagina
from here!

1348
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:31,705
I can see your hoo-ha.

1349
01:08:31,812 --> 01:08:34,144
I mean, I'll jump!

1350
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:36,274
Chicken! Come on!

1351
01:08:41,657 --> 01:08:42,622
(GROANING)

1352
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,089
(SHOUTING)

1353
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:56,068
Please, God,
don't let me die today.

1354
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,571
I'm okay! Okay!

1355
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:00,973
I'll just let go,
right?

1356
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:02,544
No, no, no!

1357
01:09:02,645 --> 01:09:06,946
If you fall straight down,
you'd probably hit a rock
and kill yourself!

1358
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:09,948
Totally. Yeah.

1359
01:09:10,053 --> 01:09:11,212
So what do I do?

1360
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:14,051
Why don't you
press your feet
up against the rock,

1361
01:09:14,156 --> 01:09:16,125
and, like,
shoot yourself off!

1362
01:09:16,227 --> 01:09:17,888
What, like a frog?
I don't know, Peter!

1363
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:20,587
Just get off
the fucking rock!

1364
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:21,755
Here I go!

1365
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,026
Okay!

1366
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:24,395
PETER: One!

1367
01:09:26,237 --> 01:09:27,398
Two!

1368
01:09:28,073 --> 01:09:29,267
Two!

1369
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,100
Two and a half!

1370
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,202
Jump!

1371
01:09:34,314 --> 01:09:35,710
Three!

1372
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,791
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1373
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,699
You saw that, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!

1374
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:57,169
I was there.
I witnessed it.

1375
01:09:57,271 --> 01:09:58,669
Thanks.

1376
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:06,812
Come on.

1377
01:10:14,555 --> 01:10:17,546
You've got Christ
between your thighs,

1378
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:20,849
but with
a shorter beard.

1379
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:22,988
Mahalo!

1380
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:24,358
Aloha!

1381
01:10:24,465 --> 01:10:25,590
Sex!

1382
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:26,824
I'm cramping,
I'm cramping.

1383
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:28,630
Okay.
Okay, okay.

1384
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:33,204
Petey? Petey?

1385
01:10:37,044 --> 01:10:39,775
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

1386
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:41,543
You were really out.

1387
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,776
Ken sent me.

1388
01:10:42,884 --> 01:10:44,144
Dakota Fanning
and her people,
they need this room.

1389
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,506
She loves it here.

1390
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,044
So does that mean
I have to leave the hotel?

1391
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,583
Ken found you a room.

1392
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,744
I'll take it, yeah.
I wanna hang out
with Rachel a little more.

1393
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:03,116
Are those sad tissues
or happy tissues?

1394
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,256
Maybe you should
just give me a minute.

1395
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:15,788
It was the only
room available!

1396
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:17,628
I'm sure it was!

1397
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:22,532
Hey, how's it going?

1398
01:11:22,639 --> 01:11:23,800
It's all right.

1399
01:11:23,907 --> 01:11:25,272
Really?

1400
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,834
I think you got some pain
behind those eyes.
A kind of pain that only...

1401
01:11:28,946 --> 01:11:30,572
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.

1402
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:32,809
I wanna stand up
on a wave
before I leave.

1403
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,713
I don't think
you're ready yet, man.

1404
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:36,876
I'm ready to
ride giants, Koonu.

1405
01:11:36,987 --> 01:11:38,385
I think you're ready.

1406
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,278
Petey!

1407
01:12:07,419 --> 01:12:08,410
Hi. Hi.

1408
01:12:08,522 --> 01:12:11,150
Miss Marshall,
what can I do for you?

1409
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:13,815
Is there a place
to get good sushi
around here?

1410
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:15,918
Yeah. Yeah, there's
a really great place

1411
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,361
about five minutes
from here called Asuki.

1412
01:12:18,465 --> 01:12:19,898
Perfect.

1413
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,523
Do you want me
to get you a map? Please.

1414
01:12:21,634 --> 01:12:22,827
Okay.

1415
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:26,904
So, this is
where we are.

1416
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:31,034
Head down Kamehameha,
and then pass
Funaho Loko Marsh.

1417
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:33,043
And it should be
right to the left.

1418
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:35,273
It might take, like,
five minutes.

1419
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:37,040
Great. Thank you.

1420
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:38,413
Any time.

1421
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:45,559
I saw you
with Peter Bretter...

1422
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,625
Yeah.

1423
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:49,251
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

1424
01:12:49,362 --> 01:12:52,593
Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry.

1425
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,098
It's not like that at all. No.

1426
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,669
It's not what you're... No, it's fine.

1427
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,705
I'm just really glad
you're keeping
him company, 'cause...

1428
01:12:57,804 --> 01:12:58,897
Gosh, no.

1429
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:00,803
...you seem like
a really nice person...

1430
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:02,169
Thank you.

1431
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:03,334
...and you're
very pretty.

1432
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:05,844
Gosh, you're,
like, way prettier.

1433
01:13:05,947 --> 01:13:08,278
No, you're, like,
so pretty.

1434
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:11,682
Really?

1435
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:13,576
Yeah.

1436
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:16,090
Wow, thank you.
Thank you.

1437
01:13:16,193 --> 01:13:18,217
And one more thing
about Peter.

1438
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:24,231
He's a really good guy.
Really good.
Like, great, actually.

1439
01:13:24,698 --> 01:13:26,030
Yeah.

1440
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,942
Please don't cry,
Miss Marshall.

1441
01:13:34,044 --> 01:13:36,775
God. Do you need me
to get you a tissue?

1442
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,779
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1443
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:41,911
Okay.

1444
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,545
Thank you, Rachel.

1445
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,817
Any time, Miss Marshall.

1446
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:59,760
Hey, ahoy, there!

1447
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,498
You surf, too?

1448
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,474
Good Lord, no.
I'm just drifting
around, you know?

1449
01:14:04,577 --> 01:14:08,910
Getting in touch
with the ocean and stuff.
It's really pleasant.

1450
01:14:09,013 --> 01:14:10,571
It was, yeah.

1451
01:14:12,249 --> 01:14:13,410
I'm gonna head in.

1452
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,781
Before you go,
actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,

1453
01:14:15,887 --> 01:14:18,218
I was listening
to Sarah's iPod
the other day,

1454
01:14:18,323 --> 01:14:22,157
and amidst the interminable
dross that's on that thing,

1455
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,390
I found one track
that I quite liked.

1456
01:14:24,498 --> 01:14:27,523
So I checked what it was,
and it was
actually one of yours.

1457
01:14:27,633 --> 01:14:32,730
And it kind of reminded me
of a dark, gothic
Neil Diamond. It's great.

1458
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:35,968
That's, like, exactly
what I'm going for.

1459
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:37,598
Right, yeah.

1460
01:14:41,414 --> 01:14:42,779
Fuck.

1461
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,211
Fuck, you're cool.

1462
01:14:47,686 --> 01:14:52,452
It's so hard to say,
because, like,
I hate you in so many ways,

1463
01:14:54,492 --> 01:14:56,428
but whatever.
I can see why
Sarah likes you.

1464
01:14:56,528 --> 01:14:59,989
No accounting for taste,
I suppose.
In her case, anyway.

1465
01:15:00,099 --> 01:15:03,126
She was with me
for five years,
so there you go.

1466
01:15:03,236 --> 01:15:06,171
Yeah, you got
four on me there, mate.

1467
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:11,371
You slept with Sarah
a year ago?

1468
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,379
I thought you knew!
Peter, please,
don't take it seriously.

1469
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:17,340
What the fuck, man!
You've...

1470
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:18,883
Don't get offended
by that.

1471
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:21,387
You can't be so casual
about this!

1472
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:24,083
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.

1473
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:28,059
I'm really sorry.
I apologize
for offending you, Peter.

1474
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,257
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.

1475
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:32,890
Well, what's
that about?

1476
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,628
What do you think
it's about?
This is a big deal!

1477
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,992
What about a code
of the ocean?
That's not on.

1478
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:38,126
What about
codes among men?

1479
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,570
You don't sleep
with another
man's girlfriend!

1480
01:15:39,675 --> 01:15:40,834
Think of... Get out of here!

1481
01:15:40,943 --> 01:15:42,274
All right, okay!
All right!

1482
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,039
Get out of here!

1483
01:16:08,472 --> 01:16:09,802
Oh, God!

1484
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:34,195
PETER: Koonu!
This guy needs help!
Koonu!

1485
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:36,163
(SCREAMING)

1486
01:16:37,335 --> 01:16:38,633
Should I call
the front desk?

1487
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:40,365
It hurts.
It hurts.

1488
01:16:40,473 --> 01:16:42,733
Wow, you got coral
right there in your leg!

1489
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,330
Can you get it out
of my leg, please,
hotel man?

1490
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:45,499
Can you do something
about that?

1491
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:48,409
I'd love to, you know,
but hotel policy...

1492
01:16:48,514 --> 01:16:49,742
They don't let me
do that kind of thing.

1493
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:51,748
They get all weirded out.
Insurance...

1494
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:53,648
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me,
please?

1495
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:55,381
Yeah.
ALDOUS: It really hurts.

1496
01:16:55,489 --> 01:16:58,423
Koonu, call
the front desk now!

1497
01:16:58,525 --> 01:17:00,515
Okay, monster man.

1498
01:17:00,626 --> 01:17:02,354
Pete, he's not
gonna do nothing.

1499
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,324
I kind of have this thing
about blood, okay?

1500
01:17:04,429 --> 01:17:05,657
Look at it.
It's raping my leg.

1501
01:17:05,765 --> 01:17:08,164
Peter, get it out of
my fucking leg, please!

1502
01:17:08,266 --> 01:17:10,428
One, two.

1503
01:17:10,536 --> 01:17:11,503
You can't get it out.

1504
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:12,628
It's really in there.

1505
01:17:12,738 --> 01:17:14,102
Get it out of me!

1506
01:17:14,206 --> 01:17:15,173
Three!

1507
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:17,434
Fuck my arse!

1508
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:20,409
Okay, I got it.
It's all done.
It's all over.

1509
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:22,036
Everything looks fine.

1510
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:28,052
It's all good!
They're coming wiki wiki:

1511
01:17:28,155 --> 01:17:30,019
Can you get some
towels for me, please?

1512
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:32,387
I'm really losing
a lot of blood.

1513
01:17:32,491 --> 01:17:34,459
You sound like
you're from London.

1514
01:17:34,561 --> 01:17:36,687
Yeah, I'm from London.

1515
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,867
What's going on?

1516
01:17:43,971 --> 01:17:48,068
You fainted.
I didn't want you to
wake up by yourself.

1517
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:49,871
How's your friend?
Is he all right?

1518
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:51,601
Yeah.

1519
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:54,077
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

1520
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:55,272
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

1521
01:17:55,382 --> 01:17:56,371
What?

1522
01:17:56,483 --> 01:17:58,543
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

1523
01:17:58,652 --> 01:17:59,880
Okay.

1524
01:17:59,988 --> 01:18:03,390
Edward Scissorhands over there
told me that you two
were fucking each other

1525
01:18:03,492 --> 01:18:06,189
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

1526
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:07,282
Shit.

1527
01:18:07,394 --> 01:18:09,057
How about that, Sarah?

1528
01:18:09,163 --> 01:18:10,925
I'm sorry, Peter.

1529
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,968
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around.
Can you please...

1530
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:17,630
Please don't touch me.
Just don't
touch me, okay?

1531
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:19,367
I'm not touching you.

1532
01:18:19,474 --> 01:18:21,875
Will you just please sit?
Please?

1533
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:25,608
All right, I'll sit down,
but I'm sitting down
'cause I want to,

1534
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:29,809
not because
you've asked me
to sit, okay?

1535
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,215
Great.

1536
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,387
A year?

1537
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:41,788
Listen, I get it,
okay? I just...

1538
01:18:41,998 --> 01:18:44,865
I need to understand
what I did to
make you cheat. I just...

1539
01:18:44,968 --> 01:18:51,374
Pete, it's not
anything you did.

1540
01:18:51,474 --> 01:18:55,242
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.

1541
01:18:55,348 --> 01:18:58,041
Will you please
cut the bullshit and
have a talk with me?

1542
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:01,017
Fine. Cutting
the bullshit.

1543
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,013
It got really hard
to keep
taking care of you

1544
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:05,214
when you stopped
taking care of yourself.

1545
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:06,449
I tried to get you
out of the house.

1546
01:19:06,558 --> 01:19:11,358
I tried to get you off
your little island
you loved so much, the couch.

1547
01:19:11,463 --> 01:19:13,090
You didn't wanna see
the light of day!

1548
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:17,498
God, there was one week
when you wore
sweatpants! Every day.

1549
01:19:22,406 --> 01:19:26,001
You shall not pass!

1550
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:28,235
You know what?

1551
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:30,338
If they were Sean John
sweatpants,
it would have been fine.

1552
01:19:30,448 --> 01:19:33,509
But because they're
Costco brand, it's like
the worst thing I could do.

1553
01:19:33,617 --> 01:19:37,110
That has nothing
to do with it.
That's what you don't get.

1554
01:19:37,222 --> 01:19:38,745
I'm sorry that
I didn't end up

1555
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,916
being who we thought
I was gonna be,
you know?

1556
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:45,826
I tried really hard.
I promise you that.
I just didn't have it in me.

1557
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:48,366
I think if you had just,
maybe tried harder.

1558
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:50,765
I tried!

1559
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:53,339
You have no idea
how hard I tried, Peter.

1560
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:55,032
I talked to a therapist.

1561
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:57,405
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.

1562
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,604
I took love seminars.
I took sex seminars.

1563
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,204
None of it worked.
None of it
made a difference to you.

1564
01:20:02,316 --> 01:20:05,681
And I couldn't drown
with you anymore.

1565
01:20:05,784 --> 01:20:10,348
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me
that I didn't try.

1566
01:20:10,524 --> 01:20:12,492
I did.

1567
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:15,117
You were just
too stupid to notice.

1568
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:47,889
(CLEARS THROAT)

1569
01:20:47,998 --> 01:20:51,058
Whoa. I thought
you were gonna wear
the shirt I got you.

1570
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,862
What? No.

1571
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,664
I mean, I do love
that shirt you got me.

1572
01:20:55,771 --> 01:20:58,365
I admire Sir Tommy Bahama
an awful lot.

1573
01:20:58,473 --> 01:21:02,468
He's a talented man,
but tonight, I feel
that this is appropriate.

1574
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:11,021
Wow, thank you.
Yeah, Sarah
got it for me.

1575
01:21:12,422 --> 01:21:15,687
This is, like,
way more convenient
than my backpack.

1576
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:19,300
Awesome hat!

1577
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:22,104
Thank you.
Yeah, my girlfriend
got it for me!

1578
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:24,075
I'm fucking with you!

1579
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,204
Cool!

1580
01:21:29,286 --> 01:21:31,911
Sarah, can I use
this lipstick, please?

1581
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:39,994
Sure. I don't care.

1582
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:44,222
I think it looks great.
But if you're not,
let's go change.

1583
01:21:44,324 --> 01:21:46,054
No, I like it.
I didn't like it
at first.

1584
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,715
Now I really
think it's...

1585
01:21:47,827 --> 01:21:49,454
Oh, bloody hell.
This is a small resort.

1586
01:21:49,564 --> 01:21:51,029
SARAH: Hi, Peter.

1587
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,958
Hey. Wow.

1588
01:21:56,204 --> 01:21:58,467
Aldous, Sarah,
this is Rachel.

1589
01:21:58,573 --> 01:22:01,006
Sarah bought me
this shirt.

1590
01:22:01,107 --> 01:22:02,439
I could've
guessed that. Yeah.

1591
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,668
Looks great. You look great.

1592
01:22:03,778 --> 01:22:05,610
Looks awesome.

1593
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:07,476
Thanks. See.

1594
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:12,112
Mr. Snow, I'm so sorry.
I did not know
you guys were coming.

1595
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,244
You're gonna have to
wait five minutes.

1596
01:22:13,355 --> 01:22:14,414
I did not know
you guys were coming.

1597
01:22:14,523 --> 01:22:16,184
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

1598
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:17,986
I didn't see you guys, so...

1599
01:22:18,094 --> 01:22:20,652
ALDOUS: There's really
no need to weep.

1600
01:22:21,429 --> 01:22:22,954
I'm not crying.

1601
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:27,163
It's no problem,
honestly.
It's not a problem.

1602
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:29,204
So, your table
is ready, guys.

1603
01:22:29,304 --> 01:22:30,327
Oh, great.

1604
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:31,964
Hey, have
a lovely evening,
you two.

1605
01:22:32,075 --> 01:22:33,839
Thank you. Have a great
dinner, you guys. Thank you.

1606
01:22:33,943 --> 01:22:35,309
You're welcome
to join us, obviously,
if you want.

1607
01:22:35,412 --> 01:22:37,210
Wouldn't dream Okay.
of it. What?

1608
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:38,508
What?

1609
01:22:39,514 --> 01:22:41,277
Oh, okay. Okay.

1610
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:43,010
RACHEL: That's great. Awesome.
Sure.

1611
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:44,347
Great.
I'll just set
two more places.

1612
01:22:44,454 --> 01:22:45,477
Not a big deal. Okay.

1613
01:22:45,588 --> 01:22:46,986
Awesome.

1614
01:22:47,089 --> 01:22:51,288
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.

1615
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:52,851
I am so sorry.

1616
01:22:52,964 --> 01:22:55,899
I never thought
in a million years
she would say yes.

1617
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:56,989
I did.

1618
01:22:57,101 --> 01:23:00,070
What? I just accepted
an invitation.
I didn't wanna be rude.

1619
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:01,832
It's got us
in a terrible situation.

1620
01:23:01,939 --> 01:23:03,907
Now I'm gonna have to
sit with him wearing
this shirt all night.

1621
01:23:04,009 --> 01:23:05,702
You're wearing
the shirt regardless.

1622
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:07,538
Australia is amazing.

1623
01:23:07,644 --> 01:23:09,340
I'm telling you.
It is a great place
to shoot.

1624
01:23:09,447 --> 01:23:11,073
Yeah?

1625
01:23:12,751 --> 01:23:14,446
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.

1626
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,247
I wanna go.
I really, really
wanna go there.

1627
01:23:17,354 --> 01:23:19,845
Wait, so when's
the movie coming out?

1628
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,423
It came out.

1629
01:23:22,528 --> 01:23:24,393
It was already released.
Oh.

1630
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:29,064
Well, you know,
it's an island.

1631
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,157
It's isolated.

1632
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:31,702
Movies don't really Yeah.
come out here.

1633
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:32,827
Obviously.

1634
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:34,302
Did you like it?

1635
01:23:34,407 --> 01:23:36,068
Yeah. The movie?

1636
01:23:37,074 --> 01:23:39,202
It was...
Awful bloody film.

1637
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,473
I say, it's just
a ridiculous premise.

1638
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:45,209
What would happen
if your mobile phone
killed you?

1639
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:47,581
Why would a mobile phone
kill anyone?
Doesn't make sense.

1640
01:23:47,686 --> 01:23:50,416
How can a mobile phone
have an agenda
and kill people...

1641
01:23:50,523 --> 01:23:52,081
I told her that
when she
read the script.

1642
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,782
Yeah. You were
the voice of
reason, mate.

1643
01:23:53,892 --> 01:23:55,486
I tried to be,
but she didn't listen.

1644
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:58,289
Going around killing people.
A mobile phone,
like, doing murders.

1645
01:23:58,396 --> 01:24:00,332
Why couldn't
you just take the battery
out of the phone?

1646
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:01,764
ALDOUS: Right. That's it.
The battle's over.

1647
01:24:01,867 --> 01:24:04,098
Yeah, we've won. I hated it.

1648
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:06,296
Well, it's not for
everyone, but it...

1649
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:08,373
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favorite scene.

1650
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:10,103
Ring-ring. Hello?

1651
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,705
ALDOUS: Right.
It would never happen.
Yeah.

1652
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:14,110
No, it could never happen.

1653
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:18,308
It's a metaphor
for addiction to technology.

1654
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:22,446
For society,
for how we're reliant
on technology.

1655
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,648
I get it. I'm with you.

1656
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,191
It's a metaphor
for a crap movie.

1657
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:27,518
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

1658
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:29,256
RACHEL: Sure. You know?

1659
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,470
Well, this is awkward.

1660
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,440
Yeah?

1661
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:50,278
It's a bit
more awkward now.

1662
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,546
RACHEL: A little.

1663
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:54,518
Hey, excuse me.
Can we get another
bottle of wine, please?

1664
01:24:54,621 --> 01:24:55,782
Sure.
Thank you.

1665
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:56,881
Mr. Snow?

1666
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:59,291
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of
lime in it, please.

1667
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:00,987
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

1668
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,565
Because I can probably
rustle up either one.
Throw some OJ...

1669
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,724
I don't care.

1670
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,233
Okay, great.

1671
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:19,057
Hey, can we get
another bottle of wine?

1672
01:25:28,535 --> 01:25:30,526
If I've learned anything
from addiction,
it's that,

1673
01:25:30,637 --> 01:25:34,573
you know, life is as brief
as the twinkling
of a star over all too soon.

1674
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,139
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

1675
01:25:37,246 --> 01:25:40,647
why not do the most
interesting thing that
you can do in that situation?

1676
01:25:40,749 --> 01:25:43,213
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

1677
01:25:43,315 --> 01:25:44,714
have a chin-wag,
a bit of a chat.

1678
01:25:44,818 --> 01:25:48,152
Lose yourself in something
that's both
ancient and perennial.

1679
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:52,657
Find something eternal,
perpetual.
Lose yourself in fuck.

1680
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:56,689
I'm going to disagree.

1681
01:25:56,798 --> 01:25:58,231
Respectfully,
of course, sir.

1682
01:25:58,332 --> 01:26:00,358
Maybe for you,
that works.

1683
01:26:00,469 --> 01:26:03,630
For me, it's much more
enjoyable to get
to know somebody.

1684
01:26:03,737 --> 01:26:05,205
If you end up
sleeping with them,
that's great.

1685
01:26:05,306 --> 01:26:07,467
But I like getting
to know somebody.

1686
01:26:07,575 --> 01:26:08,541
But he...

1687
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:13,035
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it
wherever he wants,

1688
01:26:13,147 --> 01:26:15,742
but he's joking.

1689
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:17,443
I ain't.
No, I'm not joking.

1690
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:20,019
It's just what
I believe, really.

1691
01:26:21,355 --> 01:26:22,754
So...

1692
01:26:22,956 --> 01:26:28,521
Just so we're clear and so
I can hone in on your
central thesis of the night,

1693
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:30,120
wade through
all the bullshit,

1694
01:26:30,233 --> 01:26:32,860
you're telling me
that you think
you have the right

1695
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:35,631
to just fuck anyone,
anywhere, anytime?

1696
01:26:35,738 --> 01:26:37,637
Yes. There it is.
That's right.
That's what you're saying?

1697
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:40,731
Not so eloquently
as you just put it,
sweetheart.

1698
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,173
But ultimately,
yes, that is...

1699
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:44,246
Oh, no! Not the shirt!

1700
01:26:44,346 --> 01:26:46,942
Take my eyes,
but not the shirt.

1701
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:50,817
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

1702
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:53,387
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

1703
01:26:53,488 --> 01:26:54,456
Do you know what?

1704
01:26:54,556 --> 01:26:55,956
I think I've improved it,
actually,
against all odds.

1705
01:26:56,059 --> 01:26:57,251
I think I deserve
a design award.

1706
01:26:57,358 --> 01:26:58,623
Please get
some seltzer water.

1707
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:01,999
Garçon, could we
get some...

1708
01:27:02,099 --> 01:27:03,692
I saw it from
farther away.

1709
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:05,702
Okay.
Just lean back for a second.

1710
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,499
No, it's all right.
It's not there.
Let me...

1711
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:09,004
You're very diligent.
I appreciate it.

1712
01:27:09,107 --> 01:27:10,903
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna
have to walk away.

1713
01:27:11,007 --> 01:27:12,736
Bless you.
There you are.

1714
01:27:13,077 --> 01:27:14,840
Oh, me, oh, my.

1715
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:17,906
Oh, good. Call the doctor.

1716
01:27:27,026 --> 01:27:28,050
I love Hawaii.

1717
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,147
RACHEL: Is it good?

1718
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:33,323
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for
like a week tops.

1719
01:27:33,433 --> 01:27:35,093
Any more than that,
I know I'd go crazy,

1720
01:27:35,201 --> 01:27:38,965
because I think that
Hawaii is a place
to escape

1721
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:42,063
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

1722
01:27:44,309 --> 01:27:49,372
Yeah, you know, there's
so few personal shoppers
and pet therapists.

1723
01:27:49,482 --> 01:27:51,608
Gosh, it's such
a hard life.

1724
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:03,657
I like living here.

1725
01:28:06,066 --> 01:28:07,827
Anyone need
any more vino?

1726
01:28:07,934 --> 01:28:09,561
I think we're good.

1727
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:12,934
I've a question
for you
real quick, Mr. S.

1728
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:16,271
I was actually meaning
to ask you, what did
you exactly think of my demo?

1729
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:18,674
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

1730
01:28:18,778 --> 01:28:21,543
Oh, no. I was gonna
listen to that,

1731
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:24,811
but then I just carried on
living my life.

1732
01:28:27,621 --> 01:28:28,918
Not at all?

1733
01:28:29,023 --> 01:28:32,980
No, I didn't,
because, you know,
I go on my instincts,

1734
01:28:33,093 --> 01:28:34,925
and they weren't good.

1735
01:28:36,697 --> 01:28:39,861
You know what, dude?
Fuck you, okay?
You can go fuck yourself.

1736
01:28:40,001 --> 01:28:42,094
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.

1737
01:28:42,202 --> 01:28:43,363
My boss will hear me,

1738
01:28:43,471 --> 01:28:45,439
and then I won't
be able to pay off
my student loans.

1739
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:48,202
But you know what?
You're an asshole.
I fucking hate you.

1740
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:49,297
I bought all your records.

1741
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:52,073
This whole fucking time,
I've been trying to get you
to come hang out with me.

1742
01:28:52,182 --> 01:28:53,205
I'm gonna have people
fuck with your food

1743
01:28:53,316 --> 01:28:55,977
the rest of your trip,
you fucking dick!

1744
01:28:56,617 --> 01:28:59,018
I like him.
That was quite moving.

1745
01:29:14,504 --> 01:29:15,766
Wait, wait, wait.

1746
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:17,702
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1747
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:20,903
Are you sure
that you're not,
like, too drunk?

1748
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:23,706
Jesus, would you stop
being so sensitive.

1749

1753
01:29:52,537 --> 01:29:53,833
Wake up.

Aldous. Wake up.

1755
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,299
Make love to me.

1756
01:30:00,744 --> 01:30:02,644
All right.
You go on top, though,
'cause I'm knackered.

01:30:22,434 --> 01:30:24,200
Yes! Yes!

1760
01:30:27,075 --> 01:30:29,043
Yeah. SARAH: Yes!

1761
01:30:29,143 --> 01:30:30,632
Oh, yes! Yeah!

1762
01:30:33,613 --> 01:30:35,705

Right there!
Yes!

Yes! She's having Yes!
an orgasm!

1766
01:30:43,992 --> 01:30:45,857
This is the best sex ever!

1767
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,824
Yeah, all right,
that'll do.

1768
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:49,687
What?

1769
01:30:50,897 --> 01:30:52,760
I made a mistake
coming here with you.

1770
01:30:52,933 --> 01:30:54,593
(MOANING CONTINUES)

1771
01:30:56,503 --> 01:30:58,629
And I'm not done either!

1772
01:30:59,706 --> 01:31:01,765
Please shut up! Okay.
Okay!

1773
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:04,036
You're still involved
with him next door,
ain't you?

1774
01:31:04,144 --> 01:31:05,134
Excuse me?

1775
01:31:05,246 --> 01:31:07,043
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

1776
01:31:07,148 --> 01:31:11,517
Then we come back here,
and you put on
that ghastly performance.

1777
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:14,555
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,

1778
01:31:14,657 --> 01:31:16,147
but I've never seen one.

1779
01:31:16,257 --> 01:31:18,385
It really deeply upset me.

1780
01:31:18,492 --> 01:31:19,688
You should have seen
yourself at dinner.

"Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit."

1784
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:31,809
That's a really
reductive impression.

1785
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,286
If I wanted to
see you act badly,
I'd just watch your TV show,

1786
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:36,517
which, obviously,
I can't now, because
it's been cancelled.

1787
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:38,717
Oh, my God,
you're such a prick.

1788
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:39,814
And you know what?

1789
01:31:39,925 --> 01:31:42,952
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

1790
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:47,193
That is Buddhist.
That is Nordic. That is Hindu.
That's just gibberish.

1791
01:31:47,302 --> 01:31:49,394
They are completely
conflicting ideologies.

1792
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:51,733
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.

1793
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,832
It makes you full of shit.

1794
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:59,973
Was that genuine
or did you fake that?

1795
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:06,080
Right. I'm gonna
probably clear off now.

1796
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,689
I'll have a little sleep
for a few hours,

1797
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:11,691
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?

1798
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:18,525
I hate your music.

1799
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,227
Yeah, well,
I fucked the housekeeper
the other day.

1800
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:29,925
Are you sleeping?

1801
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,233
Not anymore.

1802
01:32:37,842 --> 01:32:41,973
I know that I'm leaving
in a couple of days,
so I don't even know

1803
01:32:43,948 --> 01:32:45,974
what the hell this means,

1804
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:52,354
but I really like
spending time
with you a lot.

1805
01:32:55,827 --> 01:32:57,454
I know. Me too.

1806
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,339
Hey.

1807
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:14,979
Good morning.

1808
01:33:17,885 --> 01:33:19,112

01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,726
I want you to know
that I meant
what I said last night.

1814
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,524
I know you did.

1815
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,358
I did, too.

1816
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:41,774
Can I see you
again tonight?

1817
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:42,934
Yeah.

1818
01:33:43,178 --> 01:33:44,269
I get off at 7:00. Yay.

01:33:46,652 --> 01:33:47,643

be having an alcoholic
beverage this morning.

I'm good.
You okay?

I'm better than okay,

You seem sprightly.

1830
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:00,853
I had a great time
last night.

1831

Well done. Well done.

What's with the bag?

1834
01:35:06,235 --> 01:35:09,635
Right, yeah.
I'm off back
to England, mate.

1835
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:11,035
Oh, you and Sarah
are going to England.

1836
01:35:11,141 --> 01:35:13,575

I'm just going alone.

1837

have a fight or something?

1838
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:19,873
Yeah, it was really...
How you served five years
under her, I don't know.

1839
01:35:19,983 --> 01:35:24,614
You deserve a medal
or a holiday or at least
a cuddle from somebody.

1840
01:35:24,722 --> 01:35:26,347
You were only here
for a week.

1841
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:28,548
Well, I don't know.
For me,
that one week of it

1842
01:35:28,657 --> 01:35:33,222
was like going on holiday
with, I don't know,
I wouldn't say Hitler,

1843
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,732
but certainly Goebbels.
It was like
a little holiday with Hitler.

1845
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:41,933
Hey, listen, at least
it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.

01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:46,503
No, no. No.

1847
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:48,909

I have a good thing
going on with Rachel,

1848
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:50,708
and I want to
see that through.

1849
01:35:50,815 --> 01:35:54,217
Well, maybe you could
have both of them.
Rachel and Sarah.

1850
01:35:54,318 --> 01:35:57,187
They got on all right,
didn't they, at dinner?
So maybe...

1851
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:59,586
You know what?
First of all,
I'm not that kind of guy.

1852
01:35:59,691 --> 01:36:00,679
And even if I was,

1853
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:04,388
I don't think that
I have the sexual competency
to really pull that off.

1854
01:36:04,497 --> 01:36:06,055
Yeah. It's a gift.

1855
01:36:06,165 --> 01:36:09,032
I will say,
if you do get back
with Miss Marshall,

1856
01:36:09,135 --> 01:36:11,763
handle with care,
because, you know...

1857
01:36:11,871 --> 01:36:13,202
(EXCLAIMS)

1858
01:36:14,006 --> 01:36:15,633
Okay. Well, I think
my ride's here.

1859
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:18,403
So I'm gonna skedaddle
then before anything
else happens to me.

1860
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:20,138
Before life gets
any more daft.

1861
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:21,769
Is someone
gonna take that?

1862
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:24,544
Listen, don't let them
grind you down.

1863
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,981
Take it easy.

1864
01:36:27,088 --> 01:36:29,681
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna
have sex with her.

1865
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:36,949
He said it was clear
I wasn't over you.

1866
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:41,256
And then he left.

1867
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:42,849
Fucking prick.

1868
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:48,096
And then I started
thinking,
what if he's right?

1869
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:51,103
What if
I'm not over you?

1870
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:54,099
Sarah...

1871
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:55,870
Please just let me
finish, Pete.

1872
01:37:02,951 --> 01:37:06,114
What if I made
a really, really
horrible mistake?

1873
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:10,959
Sarah. Yeah?

1874
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:12,390
Sarah. Yeah?

1875
01:37:13,295 --> 01:37:15,763
Stop pulling my face
towards your face.

1876
01:37:15,864 --> 01:37:17,557
Why?

1877
01:37:17,664 --> 01:37:19,222
You don't like it?

1878
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,267
Listen, pulling my shirt
towards you

1879
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,894
is the same concept
as pulling my face.

1880
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,599
Let's spend one more
night here together,

1881
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,233
and then let's
go home and then...

1882
01:37:28,344 --> 01:37:30,209
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

1883
01:37:30,313 --> 01:37:32,338
...face reality. No.
That's the big plan?

1884
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:34,175
No. I love you.

1885
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:37,447
That's not fair.
That's not fair of you
to say that to me.

1886
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:40,878
Please, Peter.

1887
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:44,920
Tell me you're sorry.

1888
01:37:45,028 --> 01:37:46,255
I'm so sorry.

1889
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:51,189
I missed you.

1890
01:37:56,439 --> 01:37:57,566
I'm sorry.

1891
01:38:00,577 --> 01:38:02,568
God, I missed you, Peter.

1892
01:38:09,786 --> 01:38:10,753
All right.

1893
01:38:11,454 --> 01:38:14,788
Get hard for me, Pete.
Get hard for me.

1894
01:38:14,925 --> 01:38:16,416
I know what
I'm supposed to do.

1895
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:17,587
Okay.

1896
01:38:17,696 --> 01:38:19,631
Just do it.
Come on. Get hard.

1897
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:21,392
I'm trying. Okay.

1898
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:22,660
Here. Just let me
do it for a second.

1899
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:23,927
Okay.

1900
01:38:25,568 --> 01:38:28,733
I really
want you, Peter.
I missed you.

1901
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,204
You don't want help?

1902
01:38:30,307 --> 01:38:31,332
You don't want help?

1903
01:38:31,443 --> 01:38:33,605
Can you be quiet
just for a minute?

1904
01:38:33,712 --> 01:38:34,769
Do you want my hands?

1905
01:38:34,878 --> 01:38:38,111
Maybe just don't
talk for a second
is what I mean.

1906
01:38:39,251 --> 01:38:40,683
Do you want
my mouth?

1907
01:38:40,785 --> 01:38:41,878
Yeah, maybe your mouth.

1908
01:38:41,986 --> 01:38:43,284
Yeah. Okay.

1909
01:38:51,831 --> 01:38:54,392
What's the problem, Peter?

1910
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,933
I don't know... More?

1911
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:59,001
You can keep trying
if you want.

1912
01:39:02,308 --> 01:39:03,332
(SIGHS)

1913
01:39:03,441 --> 01:39:05,376
What's wrong with you?

1914
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:07,604
Nothing is wrong
with me, okay? Okay.

1915
01:39:07,715 --> 01:39:09,707
No, I didn't...
Just, something doesn't
feel right anymore.

1916
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:11,613
Okay. Well, did you...
You know what?

1917
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:13,844
Did you drink today?
Because sometimes
when you drink...

1918
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:15,388
Excuse me.

1919
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:18,390
No, I haven't had
anything to drink today.

1920
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,323
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart
into a million pieces,

1921
01:39:25,433 --> 01:39:29,063
and so my cock doesn't
want to be around you
anymore, okay?

1922
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:30,230
Ever!

1923
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,831
Because you know
what I just realized? Huh?

1924
01:39:34,942 --> 01:39:37,706
You're the God damn
devil. Okay?

1925
01:39:42,483 --> 01:39:45,317
Wedding in Hawaii!
Real original!

1926
01:39:56,330 --> 01:39:57,388
Hey.

1927
01:39:57,765 --> 01:39:59,163
Hey, Rachel.

1928
01:39:59,902 --> 01:40:01,492
Sarah and Aldous
broke up this morning.

1929
01:40:01,604 --> 01:40:02,901
What a surprise.

1930
01:40:03,007 --> 01:40:05,735
So I went to check
on Sarah, and...

1931
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:10,974
Listen, I'm here
because I don't want to
lie to you, okay?

1932
01:40:11,077 --> 01:40:12,945
Some stuff happened.

1933
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:14,949
I'm really, really
sorry that it did,

1934
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:17,952
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because

1935
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:22,684
I'm able to see so
clearly now that Sarah and I
are not right for each other.

1936
01:40:23,992 --> 01:40:25,357
What stuff?

1937
01:40:27,565 --> 01:40:33,162
I went up to make sure
that she was okay,
and it got weird.

1938
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,068
But now
everything is fine.

1939
01:40:35,173 --> 01:40:36,697
And I need you to
understand

1940
01:40:36,808 --> 01:40:39,001
that I meant everything
that I said to you
this morning.

1941
01:40:39,108 --> 01:40:40,337
What exactly
happened, Peter?

1942
01:40:40,443 --> 01:40:41,968
We fooled around
a little bit.

1943
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,276
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly
what you did.

1944
01:40:46,983 --> 01:40:52,821
All right. I went to her room,
and she was crying
and crying and crying.

1945
01:40:52,991 --> 01:40:55,117
And I felt like
I should comfort her.

1946
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,524
And then she started
kissing me because
I was comforting her.

1947
01:40:58,662 --> 01:41:00,689
And then the next thing
I knew,
I was kissing her

1948
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,892
because she had been
kissing me
because of the comforting.

1949
01:41:03,001 --> 01:41:06,870
Then she started taking
my clothes off, and
then her clothes were off.

1950
01:41:10,076 --> 01:41:13,772
Then she performed
10 to 15 seconds
of oral sex on me.

1951
01:41:13,879 --> 01:41:15,278
Okay. Peter,
you can leave now.

1952
01:41:15,381 --> 01:41:16,574
At the most. Maximum.

1953
01:41:16,681 --> 01:41:18,148
Thank you for staying
at Turtle Bay.

1954
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,239
Rachel, please
don't do this.

1955
01:41:19,351 --> 01:41:20,548
The only reason
I'm telling you this

1956
01:41:20,655 --> 01:41:21,747
is because
I really care about...

1957
01:41:21,856 --> 01:41:23,881
Listen to me, Peter.

1958
01:41:23,991 --> 01:41:26,983
I was a mess, too.
I understand. Okay?

1959
01:41:27,093 --> 01:41:30,358
But it does not excuse
you acting like
a complete asshole.

1960
01:41:30,462 --> 01:41:33,159
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up
for a minute,

1961
01:41:33,266 --> 01:41:34,858
but I'm not like
every other asshole.

1962
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:38,530
You should not be
with anybody right now.

1963
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,901
Anybody.

1964
01:41:41,776 --> 01:41:43,606
I know...

1965
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:45,268
I know that there is
something here.

1966
01:41:45,379 --> 01:41:47,208
I know that I was
not wrong about that.

1967
01:41:47,313 --> 01:41:51,217
And, yes, it's only been
four days, but I know
you feel it, too.

1968
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:57,687
I need you to leave.

1969
01:41:59,727 --> 01:42:03,662
Do not write me.
Do not call me.
Do not e-mail me.

1970
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,495
Peter, I need you to go.

1971
01:42:16,009 --> 01:42:18,070
I won't
bother you anymore.

1972
01:42:19,148 --> 01:42:20,443
I'm sorry.

1973
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:29,825
I don't know what to do.

1974
01:42:37,732 --> 01:42:39,723
Hey, brother,
what you doing, huh?
You stealing my art?

1975
01:42:39,835 --> 01:42:42,304
I want you to
put it back right now.
Put it back, bro!

1976
01:42:42,404 --> 01:42:44,838
Listen, give me
the picture.

1977
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:47,274
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing
doo-doo paper?

1978
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:49,105
Give me the picture.

1979
01:42:51,849 --> 01:42:55,113
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.

1980
01:42:55,218 --> 01:42:58,345
You can hit me as many times
as you want. I'm not
giving you the photo back.

1981
01:42:58,455 --> 01:42:59,546
Oh, yeah.

1982
01:43:05,997 --> 01:43:09,526
No, no, no.
Peter, I told you I
did not want to see you.

1983
01:43:28,887 --> 01:43:32,652
Aloha, I'm Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:
Scene of the Crime.

1984
01:43:32,757 --> 01:43:34,281
And when I'm not
scrubbing for evidence,

1985
01:43:34,392 --> 01:43:37,885
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines
to my favorite destinations:

1986
01:43:37,996 --> 01:43:40,465
Now sit back
and enjoy your
in-flight entertainment:

1987
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:42,431
I know I will: Mahalo.

1988
01:43:43,036 --> 01:43:46,335
PETER: (SINGING)
Everybody hates you

1989
01:43:46,438 --> 01:43:49,806
Everybody wishes
that you were dead

1990
01:43:49,909 --> 01:43:51,500
Because, Peter, you suck

1991
01:43:51,611 --> 01:43:53,476
Peter, you suck

1992
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:56,845
Peter, your music
is fucking terrible

1993
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,509
Peter, you suck

1994
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:00,144
Peter, you suck

1995
01:44:00,255 --> 01:44:03,450
Peter, you don't
do anything of value

1996
01:44:03,556 --> 01:44:05,045
Peter, you suck

1997
01:44:05,157 --> 01:44:09,458
Write some music but instead
you sit and write
these bullshit songs

1998
01:44:09,696 --> 01:44:11,288
It's so self-loathing

1999
01:44:11,397 --> 01:44:14,662
Go see a psychiatrist
I hate the psychiatrist

2000
01:44:14,768 --> 01:44:16,235
Well, go see one anyway

2001
01:44:16,337 --> 01:44:17,702
I don't like the psychiatrist

2002
01:44:17,804 --> 01:44:19,397
You need to go and see one

2003
01:44:19,505 --> 01:44:20,972
See a psychiatrist

2004
01:44:21,074 --> 01:44:22,474
I'm not going

2005
01:44:58,281 --> 01:45:03,718
(SINGING) It's getting
kind of hard to believe things
are going to get better

2006
01:45:50,702 --> 01:45:52,295
I don't understand
what there is
to think about.

2007
01:45:52,404 --> 01:45:53,497
Because, D, he...

2008
01:45:53,605 --> 01:45:56,038
She licked the tip.
That doesn't count.

2009
01:45:56,207 --> 01:45:57,674
Of course
it counts. He...

2010
01:45:57,776 --> 01:45:58,902
He what?

2011
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:02,537
He refused a blow job
from his ex-girlfriend
mid-blow job.

2012
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:03,979
Do you know
what that's like
for a man?

2013
01:46:04,082 --> 01:46:05,550
It's called
blue balls, Rachel.

2014
01:46:05,652 --> 01:46:07,744
This guy is like Gandhi,
but better.

2015
01:46:07,854 --> 01:46:09,251
He likes puppets.

2016
01:46:09,355 --> 01:46:10,515
I love puppets.

2017
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:14,559
I love Fraggle Rock.
I love Lamb Chop.
I love Elmo.

2018
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:18,117
Sesame Street, Bert and Ernie,
Snuffelupagus.
Fucks my shit up.

2019
01:46:22,367 --> 01:46:25,894
(SINGING) This is a song that
I never thought I would write

2020
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,132
On the night I'm dying

2021
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,300
Sorry for all the wrong
I've done

2022
01:46:31,412 --> 01:46:33,173
I'm finished trying

2023
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:38,342
It was a wonderful dream
Now let him come and slay me

2024
01:46:38,451 --> 01:46:39,974
There he is

2025
01:46:40,085 --> 01:46:42,748
The demon
who haunted
the streets of London

2026
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,381
I've come to slay you

2027
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:46,015
Here I am!

2028
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:48,594
I'll leave you
bleeding in my dungeon

2029
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:52,392
I'll never obey you
I'll rip out
your esophagus

2030
01:46:52,499 --> 01:46:57,299
Please,
Mr: Van Helsing
Listen to me

2031
01:46:57,404 --> 01:47:02,843
He is just a man
who wishes to be free

2032
01:47:02,943 --> 01:47:06,071
Lay him in a hearse
You must end this curse

2033
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:07,909
He is the worst!

2034
01:47:08,048 --> 01:47:09,173
(EXCLAIMS)

2035
01:47:09,516 --> 01:47:11,075
(ALL LAUGHING)

2036
01:47:20,564 --> 01:47:23,862
Don't go my love

2037
01:47:23,964 --> 01:47:27,901
I can't say goodbye

2038
01:47:28,003 --> 01:47:31,700
My reign is done

2039
01:47:31,806 --> 01:47:37,074
It's time to die

2040
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:39,608
I'm pregnant

2041
01:47:39,717 --> 01:47:41,411
Dracula

2042
01:47:41,518 --> 01:47:42,677
What have I done?

2043
01:47:42,786 --> 01:47:44,980
Has flown above

2044
01:47:45,087 --> 01:47:46,748
Who killed Dracula?

2045
01:47:46,856 --> 01:47:49,882
But he found a taste

2046
01:47:49,992 --> 01:47:52,925
A taste for love

2047
01:47:53,028 --> 01:47:55,590
My life is a lie

2048
01:47:55,699 --> 01:48:01,331
Sweet Dracula
I miss
my young dead prince

2049
01:48:01,438 --> 01:48:05,603
I'll never see him again

2050
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:08,144
Until my death

2051
01:48:08,246 --> 01:48:11,477
What a wonderful dream

2052
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:17,043
To find a taste for love

2053
01:48:17,155 --> 01:48:23,526
A taste for love

2054
01:48:52,491 --> 01:48:56,427
Wow. You came.
I can't believe
that you came.

2055
01:48:57,529 --> 01:48:59,394
Peter, this is great.

2056
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:00,965
It was really
funny. Yeah.

2057
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:02,590
Thank you.

2058
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:04,329
You know what?
I didn't realize
that it was a comedy,

2059
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:09,000
and then someone told me that,
and it just, like,
opened the whole thing up.

2060
01:49:11,178 --> 01:49:12,940
How long
are you in town for?

2061
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:14,412
Open-ended.

2062
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:15,538
Bold. Yeah.

2063
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:17,115
Yeah, you know,
I'm kind of checking
out some schools.

2064
01:49:19,785 --> 01:49:21,083
Congratulations.

2065
01:49:21,187 --> 01:49:22,414
Yeah, maybe.

2066
01:49:25,626 --> 01:49:27,322
You never called.

2067
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:31,894
You told me not to.
And I listened.

2068
01:49:33,068 --> 01:49:34,034
Right.

2069
01:49:34,135 --> 01:49:35,193
Wasn't easy.

2070
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:37,737
I might have called
once and hung up.

2071
01:49:37,838 --> 01:49:40,363
From a private number. No. No.

2072
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:42,198
No.

2073
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:44,045
Maybe.

2074
01:49:44,212 --> 01:49:46,407
MAN 1: Peter!
MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.

2075
01:49:46,515 --> 01:49:47,641
Well, you should
probably go back.

2076
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:49,909
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

2077
01:49:50,018 --> 01:49:51,349
Maybe we could
go to dinner or...

2078
01:49:51,452 --> 01:49:52,441
Yeah.

2079
01:49:52,554 --> 01:49:54,750
Still have my number?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

2080
01:49:54,857 --> 01:49:55,949
Go.

2081
01:49:56,058 --> 01:49:57,526
Yeah, I should do that.

2082
01:49:57,626 --> 01:49:59,526
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

2083
01:50:03,633 --> 01:50:04,826
MAN 1: Hey, Peter!
MAN 2: Hey, Bretter!

2084
01:50:04,933 --> 01:50:06,561
Come over here
and meet my mom!

2085
01:50:06,669 --> 01:50:07,827
Go, go.

2086
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:09,302
Off I go.

2087
01:50:09,405 --> 01:50:10,998
MAN 1: Hey, Peter.
MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.

2088
01:50:11,107 --> 01:50:13,075
The play was
sick, man. Good work.

2089
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,302
Nice job.
Good job, man.
That was awesome.

2090
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:16,537
So cool!

2091
01:50:16,646 --> 01:50:18,580
Peter, congratulations.

2092
01:50:18,682 --> 01:50:20,081
I just wanted
to say thank you.

2093
01:50:20,184 --> 01:50:22,117
I had such
a great time
tonight.

2094
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,585
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change
out of this unitard,

2095
01:50:24,687 --> 01:50:26,486
'cause I'm getting
a chafe. Okay.
Enough said.

2096
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,581
Thank you. Congratulations.

2097
01:50:54,885 --> 01:50:56,215
Hey, Peter?

2098
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:00,149
I was just calling you.

2099
01:51:07,799 --> 01:51:09,789
Wow.
Oh, Peter.

2100
01:51:10,933 --> 01:51:12,367
I'm sorry.

2101
01:51:12,904 --> 01:51:14,498
Stop laughing.

2102
01:51:14,974 --> 01:51:17,169
Can you please
stop laughing?

2103
01:51:19,346 --> 01:51:20,835
I missed you.

2104
01:51:21,947 --> 01:51:22,934
I just...

2105
01:51:23,047 --> 01:51:27,644
You know, I actually wanted
to tell you that I've been
thinking so much about...

2106

NARRATOR: This fall,

NARRATOR: Get ready
for the most daring show
on television:

2109
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:30,613
Just came home,
and she was lying there.

2110
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,153
Right.

2111
01:52:32,255 --> 01:52:35,555

2113
01:52:39,028 --> 01:52:41,894
Charlie, who's
Franco Marconi?

2114
01:52:41,997 --> 01:52:43,123
No. No.

2115
01:52:43,233 --> 01:52:45,064
Gun, gun, gun, gun.
Drop it, drop it.

2116

your animal instincts:

that's exactly
what you'll be.
