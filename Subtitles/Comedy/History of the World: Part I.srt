1
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,995
20 million years ago,

2
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:17,998
an apelike creature
inhabited the earth.

3
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:21,024
[Also Sprach Zarathustra
playing]

4
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:44,547
And the ape stood
and became man.

5
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:04,010
-Rrr!
-Arrgh!

6
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,523
-Ahh...
-Ahh...

7
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,519
The greatest calamity
that could befall early man

8
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,032
was the loss of fire.

9
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,967
Fire-- the mysterious phenomenon
that cooked his food,

10
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,971
heated his cave,
and kept him alive.

11
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,974
If he could not
start a fire,

12
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,499
he and his would surely die.

13
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,000
Even in most primitive man,

14
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:37,492
the need to create
was part of his nature.

15
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,506
This need,this talent

16
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,509
clearly separated
early man from animals,

17
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:45,205
who would never know this gift.

18
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,017
And here, in a cave

19
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:53,519
somewhere in
the North American continent

20
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,613
about 2 million years ago,

21
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:58,557
the first artist was born.

22
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:19,969
And, of course,
with the birth of the artist,

23
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,609
came the inevitable
after birth...

24
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,175
The critic.

25
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:45,505
In the year 1 million BC,

26
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,031
it is thought the first
homo sapien marriage occurred.

27
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:02,989
It was shortly followed by
the first homosexual marriage.

28
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:10,952
One of the first weapons
man invented

29
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,989
was the spear.

30
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,489
[Pfftt!]

31
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:16,825
[Pfftt!]

32
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:35,646
Aah!

33
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:41,020
Aah...Ah ah...

34
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,498
Ohh...Ah--

35
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,510
In ancient times,
man was ignorant

36
00:05:57,544 --> 00:06:00,513
as to the cause
and nature of death,

37
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:04,449
so death was greeted
with a certain degree of awe.

38
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:07,113
-Aw...
-Aw...

39
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,452
Bungwa.

40
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,459
But because man
did not have the time

41
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:14,461
for complicated rituals,

42
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,259
funeral services
were often brief.

43
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,959
-Aah!
-Aah!

44
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:19,966
[Thud]

45
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,490
[Ptooey]
[Ptooey]

46
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,973
Even in early man,

47
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:31,000
the need to laugh was vital
for emotional survival.

48
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:45,517
Rrrr!

49
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,963
Aaaghh! Aah!

50
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:53,023
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!

51
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,443
Aahhhh!

52
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,446
Music began
long before it was formalized

53
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,448
into notes and phrases.

54
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,940
For mankind, it began
with an accident.

55
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:14,955
Goonga heard the sound
and liked it.

56
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,958
Goonga begged Gowi
to repeat the beautiful scream,

57
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,960
but Gowi could not.

58
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,962
So Goonga thought and thought,

59
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,464
and finally he found the answer.

60
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:27,956
Ahha aha ah--

61
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,494
Aaahhh--

62
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:36,507
Aah ah ah ah!

63
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,475
Aaahh--

64
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:40,980
Aaahhh!

65
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,983
Aahahah!

66
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,008
Wooh ahhh...

67
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,819
And so, music was born.

68
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,825
Hallelujah

69
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,952
Hallelujah

70
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,985
Hallelujah, hallelujah

71
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,497
Halle-lu-jah!

72
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:01,160
Owh owh owh owhh!

73
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,941
Moses went to the mountain,

74
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,966
and God spoke unto him.

75
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,948
Moses,this is the Lord,
thy God,

76
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,450
commanding you to obey my law!

77
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:19,452
Do you hear me?

78
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,455
Yes, I hear you,
I hear you.

79
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,957
A deaf man could hear you.

80
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,459
What?

81
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:27,960
Nothing. Forget it.

82
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:30,964
Oh, Lord,why have You
chosen me?

83
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:33,967
What would You
have me do for you?

84
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,469
I shall give you my laws,

85
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:39,472
and you shall take them
unto the people.

86
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:40,939
Yes, Lord!

87
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,465
[Thunder]

88
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,977
Wow!

89
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:53,475
Lord, I shall give these laws

90
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,488
unto Thy people.

91
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:57,990
Hear me! Oh, hear me!

92
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,993
All pay heed!

93
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,928
The Lord,the Lord Jehovah,

94
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:06,126
has given unto you these 15--

95
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,435
Oy!

96
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,964
10, 10 Commandments
for all to obey!

97
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:25,441
Rome--vortex
of modern civilization.

98
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:28,455
Rome--fountainhead
of culture.

99
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,458
Rome--blazing pronouncement

100
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:34,655
of mankind's
most glorious achievements.

101
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,331
All right, now.

Columns! Columns!

103

Ionic, doric, corinthian!

Put a few columns
out in front,

105
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,978
turn any hovel
into a show place!

106
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:54,480
Columns! Sir, don't TOUCH
the merchandise!

107
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,506
All right, now.

Haircut, shave,

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,259
I can tell you your future!

113
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:14,495
Ha! Yes,yes! I see, I see!

116
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,510
But I am in Rome!

117
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:25,011
Do I lie?

118
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,013
-No! No!
-Ha ha!

119
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,016
Ah ha! Sooth, sooth!
We give great sooth!

120
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,517
Ha ha ha!

121
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,020
Chariots! Used chariots!

122
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:36,750
Low mileage! They're great!

123
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:56,042
I'm very excited about it.

124
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:59,045
It's a new concept.
It's called a centerfold.

125
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,047
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!

126
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,480
Plumbing!

127
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,983
Plumbing!

128
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,985
Plumbing here! Plumbing!

129
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,987
Yes, citizens, plumbing!

130
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,990
It's the latest invention
to hit Rome!

131
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:14,482
It moves water
from one place to another!

132
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,496
It's astounding, it's amazing!

133
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,498
Get on the bandwagon!

134
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:22,491
Pipe the shit

Plumbing! Brand-new invention!

137
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:36,839
Occupation?

138
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,350
Gladiator.

139
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,353
Did you kill last week?

140
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,354
No.

141
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:44,357
Did you try to kill last week?

142
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,517
Yeah.

143
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,528
This is your last week
of unemployment insurance.

144
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:52,521
Either kill somebody, or we'll
have to change your status.

145
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,056
Sign here.

146
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,437
Next!

147
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:01,600
Occupation?

148
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,303
Standup philosopher.

149
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,401
What?

150
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,469
Standup philosopher.

151
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,971
I coalesce the vapor
of human experience

152
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:13,077
into a viable
and logical comprehension.

153
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,281
Oh! A bullshit artist!

154
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,798
Mmmmmm...

155
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:20,457
Did you bullshit last week?

156
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,128
No!

157
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,694
Did you try
to bullshit last week?

158
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,366
Yes!

159
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,738
Comicus!

160
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,437
Comicus! Comicus!

161
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,378
Back in the line!

162
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:35,507
He's not in line.
He's my agent, Swiftus.

163
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,383
Good news!
I just got you a job!

164
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,944
Now you won't be needing this.

165
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,888
Wait a minute! That's mine!

166
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,892
I'm on my wine break!

167
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:45,893
[Smash!]

168
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,292
Ooh ooh oo!

169
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,397
Dopus!

170
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,628
I almost had
the money in my hand.

171
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,226
I like that.

172
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,229
I bust my anus to get you a job,
and you're angry?

173
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:02,174
You are nuts, N-V-T-S, nuts!

174
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,143
OK. What's the job?

175
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:06,669
Just the best gig in Rome,

176
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:10,013
a date that every standup
philosopher, including Socrates,

177
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:11,518
would die for.

178
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:15,511
Believe it or not,you're going
to play Caesars Palace!

179
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:17,023
The Main Room?

180
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,525
The Main Room!

181
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,856
-Groovus!
-Groovus!

182
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:23,853
Let's not be late!
The show starts in an hour!

183
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,365
The Main Room!

184
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,867
10, 10, 10.
20, 20, 20.

185
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:30,370

[Pfftt!]

374
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:54,396
All hail the commander
of His Majesty's Roman legions,

375
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,899
the brave and noble
Marcus Vindictus,

376
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:01,346
who returns to Rome
after winning a great victory

377
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,872
over the Cretins at Sparta.

378
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,378
Make that the Spartans at Crete!

Remember,thou art mortal.

Remember,thou art mortal.

Remember,thou art mortal.

383
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,370
Oh, blow it out your ass.

384
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,371
Ohh!

385
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:26,804
Oh, Caesar--

386
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,205
[Burp!]

387
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:31,541
I have brought your illustrious
name before the earth.

388
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:34,376
I've subdued and conquered
the barbaric hordes

389
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,382
in the name of Rome.

390
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,884
I've penetrated
into the farthest--

391
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,853
What's under the sheet?

392
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:42,378
Sheet?

393
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:43,889
Sheet!

394

Sheet! Oh! Oh,the sheet,yes.

395
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:48,394
To begin with, number one--

396
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,396
a beautiful hand-carved
alabaster...

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,022

398
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:53,896
Nice.

399
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,902
Nice.

400
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,871
Not thrilling...but nice.

401
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:02,342
Aha! But to fill the tub,

402

403
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:07,540

407
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:16,356
Bathtub...

408
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,857
Treasure bath.

409
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm going to have
a treasure bath!

410
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,759
Treasure bath!

411

00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:41,381
Oh, Nympho. I would do
anything, anything

416
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:44,384
if you would only
grant me your favors.

417
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:48,377
How can I entice you?
How can I ensnare you?

418
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:51,880
What bait must I use
to catch your love?

419
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:53,893
I am your servant.

420
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,895
Ah, but the servant waits

421
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,897
while the master bathes.

422
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,421
Yes--

00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,526
Hee hee hee--

424

Uh,yes, sire.

The muse...is upon me!

428
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:21,444
Thank you, Caesar.

429
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:23,353
All be quiet!

430
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,359
His Divine Immortality
has consented to favor us

431
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:28,384
with a new poem.

432
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,861
Speak,

433
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,363

Good evening,

from Venice,

this new sect,the Christians?

471

for premature ejaculation...

Losing weight is all the rage.

487
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:53,074
Everybody in Rome
is either in a steam room

488

or a vomitarium.

555
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,218
Oh, Emperor,
spare this poor man.

556
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,948
He has fought so bravely
for your amusement.

557
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,456
Let him...

558
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,152

-Oh!

561
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,858
Tough shit.

562
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,595
Oooh! Please!

563
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,627
Oh, please, buddy.

564
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:07,139
Ooh!

Oh, I can't do it!

568
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,477
Take the shield.
We'll fight our way out.

569
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:20,042
Guards, destroy them!

570
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:29,858
You're the first white person
I even considered liking.

571
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,663
Oh,the tide is turning.

572
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:41,071
Hold it right there.

573
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,701
In the name of Caesar--

574
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:45,267
[Whistles]

575
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,869
The rope!

576
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,781
Aah!

577
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,307
[Emperor]
No! Your hands are cold!

578
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,289
Find them! Capture them!

579
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,790
Kill them!

580
00:30:58,825 --> 00:30:59,792

581
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,225

582
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:02,728
Whoa!

583
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:03,660
Oh!

00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,735
Oh!

585
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,259
Oh, it's you.

586
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,771
This way, men!

587
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,275
All right!

588
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,777
Forget that shit.

589
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:53,301
I almost fell.

590
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:57,282
Virgins,fall out!

591
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,807
-Oh!

593
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh, Competence,tell me.

594
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:09,718
What will happen to those two
rogues when they are caught?

595
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,731
If they're captured,
they're hung.

596
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,563
Not necessarily. Ha ha!

597
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,066
My goodness!

598
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,743
Where are you leading me?

599
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,745
To the reviewing stand.

600
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,747
You must choose your escorts

601
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,544
for the midnight orgy.

602
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,252
Send them in.

603
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,117
Quickly, march!

604
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,691
Arms rest!

605
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,196
Very nice selection.

606
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,828
I'm going to start on this end.

607
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,438
Hmmm.

Quick time harch!

Where are we?

623
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,278
Don't worry.

624
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:51,286
Who's that?

625
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,293
Quick. Hide behind the drape.

626
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:04,204
I liked your choices. You made
some very big decisions.

627

They couldn't have gotten far.

How dare you?

635
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,569
No men may search
the Empress' quarters.

636
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:36,097
As you wish.

637
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,473

What?

644
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,292
That slave over there.
He looks rather puny.

645
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,254
When eunuchs are castrated,

646
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,458
don't they become enormous?

647
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,196
It's Josephus,
your wine steward.

648
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:04,703

You have to give him some time.

He has just been snipped.

-Ooh!
-Ooh!

653
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:17,204
If he is truly a eunuch
like the others,

654
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,219
there would be no harm
to take the test.

655
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:21,914
Test?

656
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,387

00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:33,425
Eunuchs! Come down here.

663
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:45,733
And if all these creatures
are indeed eunuchs...

Hmm hmm hmm!

665
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:50,749
..then nothing should arise.

666
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:52,250
Get it?

their big heads so hard!

He is a eunuch.

00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,248
He's dead.

675
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,758
He'll never survive!

Quick. Back through
the corridor.

He's heading for the Senate.

00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:40,019
We can meet him
near the cloakroom.

684
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,447
In pectorum, quid pro quo.

685
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:04,454
In pecuniam,
sic transit gloria.

686
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:07,423
I didn't know
Gloria was sick.

687
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,948
Where is he?

688
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:11,961
Don't worry.
He has to come this way.

689
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,963
He should have been here.

690
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:15,988
The Senate is in session.

691
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,594
All fellow members
of the Roman Senate, hear me.

692
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:22,469
Shall we continue
to build palace after palace

693

for the rich,

694
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:27,465
or shall we aspire
to a more noble purpose

695
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,979
and build housing
for the poor?

696
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,140
How does the Senate vote?

697
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:35,481

How do we get out of here?

703
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:54,503
Put this on.

00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:57,996
I'll find Swiftus then meet you

I got absolutely
nothing for sale!

Bonjour, Madame de Farge.

All right, keep quiet.
The meeting begins.

1124
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:05,089
Fellow wretches...

1125
01:03:05,126 --> 01:03:07,754
I don't have to tell you

1126
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:10,594
that poverty stalks
the streets of Paris.

1127
01:03:10,632 --> 01:03:12,099
-Yes.
-Yes.

1128
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:15,933

have enough money for bread.

-No.
-No.

1130

We are down to almost nothing.

1131
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:23,102
Last week, I myself
ran out of wool.

[Ding]

1133
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:28,711
We have no rights.

1134

We have no say.

-No!
-No!

1138
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:37,119
We are so poor,

1139
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:40,127
we do not even have a language.

1140
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:43,028
Just a stupid accent.

1141
01:03:43,064 --> 01:03:45,123
-She's right!
-She's right!

1142
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,726
We all talk like
Maurice Chevalier.

-Auh hauh hauh!
-Auh hauh hauh!

1145
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,733
What we need...

1146
01:03:52,774 --> 01:03:55,242
is a new language--

1147
01:03:55,276 --> 01:03:58,575
A song that speaks
of struggle,

1148
01:03:58,613 --> 01:04:00,581
that speaks of triumph.

1149
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,082

No, no, no, dumb scum.

1158
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,406
I mean, death to King Louis!

1159
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:33,471
Death to King Louis!

1160
01:04:33,515 --> 01:04:35,312
Good! Good!

1161
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:39,613
And now, let's end this meeting

1162
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:41,622
on a high note.

1163

[All sing a high note]

1164

this exhausting conversation,

I'm famished. Bearnaise...

1166

Yes?

1167
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:04,070
Do we have any of those...

1168
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,444
delicious raisins left?

1169
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,416
You ate yours.

1170
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,577
These are mine.

01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,246
Au contraire.

I don't like your cuffs.

I don't like your cuffs,
I don't like your cuffs.

1191
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,934
A man's cuffs should be even

01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:20,436
with the tip of his pee-pee.

Everything's so green.

1294
01:11:34,451 --> 01:11:37,420
Majesty, may I have
a word with you?

1295
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:39,479
Ooh! Care for a toot?

1296
01:11:39,523 --> 01:11:40,922
Non. Merci.

1297
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,927
Don't indulge? Well,
that leaves more for us.

1298
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:45,519
Who are you?

1299
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:49,362
Your Majesty, I am
Mademoiselle Rimbaud.

1300
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:51,867
Mmm. Nice names.

1301
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:55,360
Tell me, my dear,
what can I do for you?

1302
01:11:55,405 --> 01:11:57,373
My father, Monsieur Rimbaud,

1303
01:11:57,407 --> 01:12:00,376
for 10 years has languished
in the Bastille.

1304
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,868
If I don't get him out soon,
he will surely die.

1305
01:12:03,914 --> 01:12:07,441
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please release him.

1306
01:12:07,484 --> 01:12:10,385
Why was he put
into the Bastille?

1307
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,389
He said something
at a royal dinner party.

1308
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:15,391
What did he say?

1309
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:18,394
He said,
"the poor ain't so bad."

1310
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:20,396
"The poor ain't so bad"!

1311
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,625
You're lucky he's still alive.

1312
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:25,567
Please,Your Majesty,
don't let him die.

1313
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,571
I'll do anything to gain
his pardon. Anything.

1314
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:30,402
Anything?

1315
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,409
Your Majesty!
I was raised in a convent.

1316
01:12:33,443 --> 01:12:37,004
I don't indulge
in pleasures of the flesh.

1317
01:12:37,047 --> 01:12:40,847
You don't put out,
he don't get out.

1318
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:43,978
But Your Majesty,
I simply don't do it.

1319
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:47,923
Come on. You do it.
You know you do it.

1320
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:50,927
We love to do it. You do it.

1321
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:52,428
No, I don't.

1322
01:12:52,462 --> 01:12:53,952
You want to do it.

1323
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:57,763
I do it. I love to do it.

1324
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:01,464
I just did it, and I'm ready
to do it again.

1325
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:04,440
Don't tell me
you don't do it.

1326
01:13:04,474 --> 01:13:08,467
You do it, or your father dies.
Hump or death.

1327
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:09,945
Humperdinck?

1328
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,448
Not Humperdinck.
Hump or death.

1329
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:14,450
You got 10 seconds

1330
01:13:14,484 --> 01:13:16,452
to make up your mind.

1331
01:13:16,486 --> 01:13:18,784
Hump, death. Hump, death.

1332
01:13:18,822 --> 01:13:20,414
Hump, death.

1333
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:23,051
Your time is running out!

1334
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:25,459
All right, all right!
Hump! Oh!

1335
01:13:25,495 --> 01:13:28,464
Very good. I'm glad
you thought it over.

1336
01:13:28,498 --> 01:13:31,126
Be at my chambers at midnight.

1337
01:13:31,168 --> 01:13:32,965
A tout a I'heure.

1338
01:13:33,003 --> 01:13:34,868
Wait.

1339
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:37,965
Don't wear anything...

1340
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:39,999
complicated.

1341
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:49,919
Ah.

1342
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:51,443
Ohh.

1343
01:13:52,456 --> 01:13:54,947
It's good to be the King.

1344
01:13:59,963 --> 01:14:02,932
Your Majesty, I must
speak to you. Aah!

1345
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:04,934
Ah,the Count de Money.

1346
01:14:04,968 --> 01:14:06,094
De--

1347
01:14:06,136 --> 01:14:08,604
Don't correct me.
What is it?

1348
01:14:08,638 --> 01:14:10,731
Of course,Your Majesty.

1349
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:12,935
I've come on urgent business.

1350
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,945
It is said that
the people are revolting.

1351
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:17,947
Yeah. They stink on ice.

1352
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:19,949
This is a serious problem.

1353
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:23,441
The peasants feel
you have no regard for them.

1354
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:26,456
What? I have no regard
for the peasants?

1355
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,459
They are my people.
I am their sovereign.

1356
01:14:29,493 --> 01:14:31,757
I love them. Pull!

1357
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:32,955
[Gunshot]

1358
01:14:32,996 --> 01:14:35,021
Aaaah!

1359
01:14:35,065 --> 01:14:36,965
Drifting to the left.

1360
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,468
Your Majesty,
the situation is worsening.

1361
01:14:39,503 --> 01:14:41,971
The peasants may grow violent.

1362
01:14:42,005 --> 01:14:43,472
Violent?

1363
01:14:43,507 --> 01:14:44,974
Yes.

1364
01:14:45,008 --> 01:14:46,407
I hate violence.

1365
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:49,412
It's the one thing
I detest. Violence.

1366
01:14:49,446 --> 01:14:51,971
I abhor it. Pull!

1367
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:52,982
[Gunshot]

1368
01:14:53,016 --> 01:14:53,983
Aaah!

1369
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:56,076
Fell like a stone.

1370
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:58,587
ButYour Majesty,

1371
01:14:58,622 --> 01:15:00,954
just in case
of the remote possibility

1372
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,084
of a temporary revolution,

1373
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:07,927
wouldn't it be wise to have you
safely spirited out of Paris?

1374
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:09,431
Perhaps you're right.

1375
01:15:09,466 --> 01:15:12,435
But who would sit
on my throne?

1376
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:14,437
We'll find a double.

1377
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:18,430
Ah. A double in case of trouble.
I like it.

1378
01:15:18,475 --> 01:15:20,306
Ha ha ha!

1379
01:15:20,343 --> 01:15:24,939
But where would you find
a handsome dog to replace me?

1380
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:28,542
Oh,yes. Of course, of course.
That's it!

1381
01:15:28,585 --> 01:15:31,952
Your Majesty,
you look like the piss boy.

1382
01:15:31,988 --> 01:15:35,446
And you look like
a bucket of shit!

1383
01:15:35,492 --> 01:15:37,960
You don't understand,
Your Majesty.

1384
01:15:37,994 --> 01:15:39,962
It is God's will, sire.

1385
01:15:39,996 --> 01:15:42,965
Except for the beauty mark
and the mustache.

1386
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:44,466
There's our double.

1387
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:47,902
You're right.
I do look like the piss boy.

1388
01:15:47,938 --> 01:15:50,406
At the first sign of trouble,

1389
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,738
he shall be King. Go.

1390
01:15:52,776 --> 01:15:54,243
Immediately, sire.

1391
01:15:54,277 --> 01:15:57,405
Garcon, I must have
a word with you.

1392
01:15:57,447 --> 01:15:58,914
I'm not finished.

1393
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:00,917
You're finished.
Come with me.

1394
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:02,077
You'refinished.

1395
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:03,085
Ooh!

1396
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:04,609
Lackey.

1397
01:16:07,457 --> 01:16:09,118
Your Majesty.

1398
01:16:12,963 --> 01:16:14,624
Ohh!

1399
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:19,465
It's good to be the King.

1400
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:22,939
Good. Now the beauty mark.

1401
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:24,463
It's coming.

1402
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:30,776
Na na na!

1403
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:33,442
Wonderful. No one
would ever suspect

1404
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:37,943
that His Royal Highness
is really the lowly piss boy.

1405
01:16:37,988 --> 01:16:40,582
Ha ha ha!

1406
01:16:40,624 --> 01:16:43,149
This is never going to work.

1407
01:16:43,193 --> 01:16:45,161
Please, Count de Money--

1408
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:46,594
De Monet.

1409
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:49,098
De Monet, Dubonnet, see Bonet.

1410
01:16:49,132 --> 01:16:52,932
It won't work.
I can't behave like a King!

1411
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:57,099
Please. See? See? I can't
even walk like a King.

1412
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,769
I can't walk in heels.
He's good in heels.

1413
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:03,779
Why are you doing this to me?

1414
01:17:03,813 --> 01:17:07,772
Why are you dressing me up
like the King?

1415
01:17:07,817 --> 01:17:09,785
It's very simple, really.

1416
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:11,787
Is my hair all right?

1417
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:13,288
Dreadful.

1418
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:15,857
Well,fix it.

1419
01:17:15,991 --> 01:17:18,482
Recently,there has been a rumor

1420
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:19,994
about a revolution,

1421
01:17:20,028 --> 01:17:22,496
and if this revolution
should succeed,

1422
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:25,500
the people will
cut off the King's head.

1423
01:17:25,534 --> 01:17:28,992
But if there is
a double on the throne,

1424
01:17:29,037 --> 01:17:31,005
the King can remain safe

1425
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,008
while they cut off
the double's head.

1426
01:17:34,042 --> 01:17:37,170
I get it. Whoa! I get it!

1427
01:17:37,212 --> 01:17:38,679
[Knock knock knock]

1428
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:40,807
They're here to kill me!

1429
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:43,545
Hide. I'll see who it is.

1430
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:51,459
All right,take me!

1431
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:53,461
Ravage me,Your Majesty!

1432
01:17:53,495 --> 01:17:55,486
A bargain is a bargain!

1433
01:17:56,498 --> 01:17:57,965
All right.

1434
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,968
Wait! You're not the King.

1435
01:18:00,002 --> 01:18:03,460
True. I am the Count de Money.
De Monet.

1436
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:05,973
The King is
temporarily indisposed.

1437
01:18:06,008 --> 01:18:09,466
You've come to the right place.

1438
01:18:09,511 --> 01:18:11,001
Please.

1439
01:18:16,184 --> 01:18:18,152
You seem troubled, my dear.

1440
01:18:18,186 --> 01:18:20,654
Let me helpyou.

1441
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:22,316
Whah.

1442
01:18:22,357 --> 01:18:25,485
I don't see how you can.

1443
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:27,427
Why not?

1444
01:18:27,462 --> 01:18:29,987
I've decided to
trade my virginity

1445
01:18:30,032 --> 01:18:32,000
for my father's freedom

1446
01:18:32,034 --> 01:18:35,003
and submit to
the King's lustful wants.

1447
01:18:35,037 --> 01:18:37,005
Uh suh luh--

1448
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:38,006
[Clink]

1449
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,530
Ohh.

1450
01:18:41,543 --> 01:18:43,101
Chipped.

1451
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:47,979
This is the saddest night
of my life.

1452
01:18:49,551 --> 01:18:52,520
And the happiest night of mine.

1453
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:53,748
[Sobbing]

1454
01:18:53,789 --> 01:18:55,279
Excuse me.

1455
01:18:55,323 --> 01:18:57,450
Whooaa!

1456
01:18:57,492 --> 01:18:58,959
Whoa!

1457
01:18:58,994 --> 01:19:00,791
[Branches breaking]

1458
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:02,990

1459
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,960
Count de Money!
Count de Money!

[Weakly] De Monet. De Monet.

1461
01:19:09,504 --> 01:19:12,473
Excuse me.
Did you see the Count?

1462
01:19:12,507 --> 01:19:14,975
He was here a moment ago.

1463
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,637
Oh! All right!

1464
01:19:16,678 --> 01:19:18,976
Your Majesty,
please ravage me!

1465
01:19:19,014 --> 01:19:20,982
Gee, I just ate.

1466
01:19:21,016 --> 01:19:23,985
Oh,take me,
Your Majesty! Take me!

1467
01:19:24,019 --> 01:19:25,486
Where?

1468
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,488
Defile me! Humiliate me!

1469
01:19:27,522 --> 01:19:30,491
Only do it!
