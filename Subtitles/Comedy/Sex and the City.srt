00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,247
CARRIE: <i>Year after year, 20-something</i>
<i>women come to New York City...</i>

2
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,245
<i>... in search of the two L 's:</i>

3
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:49,603
<i>Labels and love.</i>

4
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,626
- Yeah.
- He's the best.

5
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,818
WOMAN:
Hot dress!

6
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:01,312
<i>Twenty years ago, I was one of them.</i>

7
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:17,486
<i>Having gotten the knack for labels early,</i>
<i>I concentrated on my search for love.</i>

8
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,812
<i>Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot</i>
<i>when it comes to love.</i>

9
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,880
What? You're married?

10
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,306
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

11
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,803
<i>- Until it is.</i>
- I fucking hate you.

12
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>That is why you need help to spot them.</i>

13
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,557
<i>Lots of help.</i>

14
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:36,749
<i>Help also known as Charlotte York...</i>

15
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,218
<i>... Miranda Hobbes...</i>

16
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>... and Samantha Jones.</i>

17
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:46,506
- Oh, my God, look at his.
MAN: Hey.

18
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:48,033
Hi, how are you?

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,889
Oh, well.

20
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:58,775
<i>My name is Carrie Bradshaw,</i>
<i>and I'm a writer.</i>

21
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:02,743
<i>Year after year,</i>
<i>my single girlfriends were my salvation.</i>

22
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,534
<i>And as it turns out, my meal ticket.</i>

23
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,755
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

24
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,326
<i>Charlotte was looking</i>
<i>for the perfect love.</i>

25
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:16,546
- Trey can't get it up.
<i>- Well, almost perfect.</i>

26
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,242
I'm becoming a Jew.

27
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,403
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

28
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,797
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

29
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:31,360
<i>So Charlotte and Harry journeyed</i>
<i>to China and back...</i>

30
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,718
<i>... for their daughter, Lily.</i>

31
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:37,075
<i>Miranda was a disciple of tough love.</i>

32
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,943
Bye. Great sex.

33
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,367
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

34
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:43,565
Carrie.

35
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,600
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

36
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,786
<i>And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn</i>
<i>for Brady and Steve.</i>

37
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:52,119
Who wants a Popsicle?

38
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,255
Oh, man. Boy.

39
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:57,349
<i>Samantha's love was sex.</i>

40
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,037
<i>Lots of sex.</i>

41
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:01,732
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

42
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,236
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

43
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:06,992
<i>And then she found a man</i>
<i>that combined sex and love.</i>

44
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,494
I'm gonna help you be a star.

45
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,554
Yes, he is interested...

46
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:16,943
<i>So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood</i>
<i>with television star Smith Jerrod.</i>

47
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:21,337
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>I was looking for something big.</i>

48
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,799
Get in.

49
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,983
<i>Mr. Big. Turns out when that big</i>
<i>love comes along, it's not always easy.</i>

50
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,416
CARRIE:
Just tell me I'm the one.

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,709
<i>And despite all the other chapters</i>
<i>of my life...</i>

52
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:38,367
<i>... no one was ever quite</i>
<i>big enough until...</i>

53
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:39,838
Carrie, you're the one.

54
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,901
<i>And just like that, I was.</i>

55
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:47,290
<i>Three books and three years later...</i>

56
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:51,217
<i>... we still feel like those four single girls.</i>

57
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:53,941
<i>And even though time had moved us on...</i>

58
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,668
<i>... I managed to stay exactly where I was:</i>

59
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,995
<i>In love.</i>

60
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:15,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,139
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

62
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,361
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

63
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,321
Hi, 3C?

64
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,357
<i>Finding the perfect apartment</i>
<i>in New York City...</i>

65
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:30,180
<i>... is like finding the perfect partner.</i>
<i>It can take years.</i>

66
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,040
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

67
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,367
Lucky 33.

68
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,493
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

69
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,548
CAROL:
That's the window with the best view.

70
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:52,968
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

71
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:56,463
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,465
We're very interested in this building.

73
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:02,494
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

74
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:03,921
Care to take a look?

75
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:05,115
- Sure.
- Sure.

76
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,845
All right, then.

77
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,244
It's more than you were looking to pay.

78
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,707
- How much more?
- More.

79
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,985
So this is where they keep the light.

80
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,211
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:31,243
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

82
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,306
Just a simple home for two.

83
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,832
And across the rooftop terrace...

84
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,256
What, nirvana?

85
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:48,406
Hello. I live here.

86
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,739
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

87
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:54,998
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

88
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:57,328
This way.

89
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:02,116
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

90
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,114
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

91
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:10,004
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

92
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,570
And this is the master bedroom.

93
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,997
Uh.

94
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,424
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

95
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,383
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

96
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,672
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

97
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:34,463
Hm.

98
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:38,286
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

99
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:42,718
Welcome home, baby.

100
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,876
Can...? Can we afford this?

101
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,732
I got it.

102
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:53,464
BIG:
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

103
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:54,892
"I got it." Just like that.

104
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:58,024
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

105
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,450
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

106
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,244
And he says the kitchen needs work.

107
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:05,742
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

108
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,033
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

109
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,501
Yes, together. That's right.

110
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:12,326
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

111
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,053
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

112
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,622
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

113
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,878
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

114
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,483
And I love you for that.

115
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,203
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

116
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,568
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

117
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,192
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

118
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,190
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,253
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

120
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,314
<i>New York</i> magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

121
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,308
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

122
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,872
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

123
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:49,499
CARRIE:
Oh, lady. Hi.

124
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,630
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

125
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:52,819
- Oh, good.
- Good.

126
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,753
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
CHARLOTTE: Show us.

127
00:07:55,956 --> 00:08:01,005
<i>It was a rare occasion that brought</i>
<i>all types of New York women together.</i>

128
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,700
Sorry.

129
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:06,994
<i>Blair Elkenn was a waitress</i>
<i>turned model turned actress...</i>

130

00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,046
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:18,547
<i>And now she was getting</i>
<i>the ultimate breakup revenge:</i>

134
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:20,736
<i>An embarrassing</i>
<i>and very public auction...</i>

135
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:24,031
<i>... of all the jewelry he had given her</i>
<i>when they were happy.</i>

136
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,524
There it is. My baby.

137
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,186
Oh, she's a beauty.

138
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:32,292
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

139
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,907
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

140
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,011
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

141
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,696
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

142
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:46,832
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,021
That's it.

144
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,920
We'd like to start the bidding

00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,571
Fifteen thousand. At $ 15,000.

147
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,642

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,269

- Bitch.

149
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:05,457
The gloves are off.

150
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:08,186
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

151
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,789
- I work hard, I deserve this.
AUCTIONEER: At 40,000 now.

152
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:14,449
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

153
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:17,544
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

154
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:20,265
Fifty fucking thousand.

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,657

At $55,000 against you.

156
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:30,256
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

157
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:32,476
I draw the line at 50.

158
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,105
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

159
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:39,331
Isn't it?

160
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:42,662
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

161
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,525
But it really is sad, huh?

162
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,084
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

163
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,721
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

164
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:55,172
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

165
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,602
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

166
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:02,597
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

...afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley
Louis Vuitton bag?

1000
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,612
It's rented. Bag Borrow or Steal?
It's like Netflix for purses.

1001
01:12:16,282 --> 01:12:19,890
- How can I not know about this?
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.

1002
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:28,633
<i>And did she hook me up.</i>

1003
01:12:29,173 --> 01:12:33,144
Hi. This is Louise.
I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

1004
01:12:33,787 --> 01:12:37,825
Yes, she received your invitation,
but she will be unable to attend.

1005
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:39,618
Thank you.

1006
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:45,722
LOUISE:
Put that over there.

1007
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:48,682
<i>After only three days...</i>

1008
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:53,457
<i>... I began to think of her</i>
<i>as Saint Louise from St. Louis.</i>

1009
01:12:54,194 --> 01:12:56,379
Ain't nothing in there for you.

1010
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,358
<i>And as I moved back</i>
<i>into my old apartment...</i>

1011
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:03,486
<i>... Miranda searched for a new one,</i>
<i>downtown.</i>

1012
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:06,605
MIRANDA: You see the Chinese writing?
BRADY: Yeah.

<i>New York</i> magazine says this is
the new up-and-coming neighborhood.

1014
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:13,927
- Okay, maybe down that way?
- Maybe you come home.

1015
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,014
Look, white guy with a baby.

1016
01:13:18,385 --> 01:13:21,826
Wherever he's going,
that's where we need to be.

1017
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:24,082
Come on.

1018
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:29,229
MAGDA: I lived here before.
It used to be all-Ukrainian area.

1019
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:30,455
Mm-hm.

1020
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,316
A U-Haul.

1021
01:13:33,053 --> 01:13:33,631
Coming or going?

1022
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:37,265
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

1023
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:38,342
Wait down here, okay?

CARRIE: "And there they remained
for the rest of their days...

1026
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:50,244
...for the birds
were constantly on guard...

1027
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:54,413
...and the women could not so much
as step one foot out the door.

1028
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:56,831
And Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after."

1029
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,166
You know that this is just a fairy tale,
right, sweetheart?

1030
01:14:01,347 --> 01:14:04,714
I mean, things don't always
happen like this in real life.

1031
01:14:05,393 --> 01:14:09,734
- I just think you should know that now.
- Again.

1032
01:14:10,919 --> 01:14:12,766

1033
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,949

CARRIE: Hi.

1034
01:14:15,432 --> 01:14:17,421
Mommy's home.

1035
01:14:18,026 --> 01:14:20,452
Thanks for watching Lily
while I went to the doctor.

1036
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:24,759
- Oh, sure. Everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

1037
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:29,416
- I'm pregnant.
- How?

1038
01:14:29,586 --> 01:14:34,297
You know how people always say
that when you stop trying, it can happen?

1039
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,838
And my doctor says that she knows
other couples who have adopted...

1040
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,192
...and then they get pregnant.

1041
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:44,173
- Sweetie.
- Carrie, I'm pregnant.

Oh, that was really hot.

01:14:55,904 --> 01:15:02,000
