flake off for two days!

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,278
Those fuckheads down at the DMV
took my goddamn license away

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,759
because of these fucking
cataracts in my eye.

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,558
But I can still hit the shit
out of a golf ball, that's for sure!

172
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,836
I made a tee time for us in Florida
for this afternoon.

173
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,035
You can use your
grandmother's lady clubs,

174
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,472
they're right there
by the front door.

175
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,028
Okay.

176
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,711
All right, you ready?

177
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,437
I thought the plan was
to have breakfast here?

178
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,591
That's your breakfast. Now let's go get
in that giant labia you drove up in

179
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,750
and get the fuck out of here.

180
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,952
You sure I should be
driving with this, Grandpa?

181
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,836
Don't worry, if you spill it,

182
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,000
this giant tampon we're driving
in should soak it up.

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,990
Just finishing a work email

184
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,993
for the Steinhart file...

185
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,754
So you're a lawyer at your dad's
firm now, is that right?

186
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,195
That's right, and Meredith is too.

187
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,475
You know, her dad is one of
the managing partners there, so...

188
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,754
- I know, that's...
- Yeah.

189
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,274
It couldn't have worked out better.

190
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,509
Because it's just that I remember
when you were in high school,

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,193
you told me how much you wanted to be
a photographer, travel the world.

192
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,394
That sort of thing.

193
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,630
You remember when I got you that
subscription to Time magazine?

194
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,798
Yeah, I used to be
into photography, but, um...

195
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,950
I mean, with Dad
being at the firm, pfft,

196
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,236
it just made so much more sense
to focus on a college curriculum

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
that stressed the law school track.

198
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,392
I mean, I love what I do, Grandpa.

199
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,671
Being a corporate lawyer is awesome,
I get to handle SEC compliance...

200
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,115
- No shit!
- Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,509
You handle SEC compliance?

202
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,672
- LP agreements.
- Oh, man, I didn't know that.

203
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,557
- LLC agreements.
- You're shitting me!

204
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,995
Being a corporate lawyer,
it's got its upsides.

205
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,587
- You know what I'd rather do?
- What?

206
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,352
I'd rather let Queen Latifah
shit in my mouth

207
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,874
from a fucking hot air balloon.

208
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,712
That's me. I'm gonna hit
the liquor store over there,

209
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,513
get some more of the creature. Meet you
back at the Dildomobile in five.

210
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,875
You're paying the check,
Alan Douche-owitz.

211
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,711
(DOOR OPENS)

212
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,951
Where do I know that guy from?
He looks so familiar.

213
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,349
He looks like
Abercrombie fucked Fitch.

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,549
Mmm, yeah, while J.Crew J'd-off.

215
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,028
Shit! No, you guys, he was...
It's so funny.

216
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,350
He was my lab partner
in photography class, freshman year.

217
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,557
No shit!
He's a Florida alum?

218
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,231
Lenore, you can totally
finish the trifecta.

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,913
Oh, my God, I already
have alum, remember?

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,559
I fucked that crying divorced guy, Tony.

221
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,312
- With the big balls.
- Right. Yeah.

222
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,548
- In the porta-potty.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,913
- At the tailgate.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I need a professor.

225
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,115
Wait, I'm sorry.
What's the trifecta again?

226
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,918
It's this thing I read about

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,072
where in my senior year
I have to fuck a freshman,

228
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,354
an alumni, and a professor.

229
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,395
- Where did you read that?
- In my diary.

230
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,118
Hmm.

231
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,758
- Where I wrote it...
- Yeah.

232
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,513
He used to take
the most beautiful portraits

233
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,476
without using any filters
or Photoshop...

234
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,437
- LENORE: I've read your diary.
- SHADIA: He was amazing.

235
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,554
BRADLEY: Oh, my God, you did?

236
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,754
- Yeah.
- BRADLEY: Did you like it?

237
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,433
You guys aren't listening.
I'm gonna go say hi to him. Okay?

238
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,475
- Slut...
- Cool...

239
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,836
I hope you don't get
Tommy Hilfingered.

240
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,433
That was really late,
but it still counts.

241
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,475
Just like all my periods...

242
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,559
- Ew.
- What?

243
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,833
Hi. How are you?

244
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,639
Good. Here you go,
you can keep the change.

245
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,354
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not... You...

246
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,432
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

247
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,749
Um...

248
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,798
- Guys? Guys, listen to me.
- What?

249
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,437
- Let's go.
- Bitch, what?

250
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,192
- Shut the fuck up! Go!
- Oh, my God!

251
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,033
- You all set?
- (DOOR OPENS)

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,634
Yeah, I just gave my money
to the other waitress, sorry.

253
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,789
There is no other waitress.

254
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,713
I'm the only one who's
ever worked here. Ever...

255
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,313
Shit! The fucking piece
of shit car never starts!

256
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,914
Hey!

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,629
God, he's like a Mitt Romney Terminator.

258
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,232
Excuse me!

259
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,995
Uh, sorry, my shift is actually over,
so... Sorry...

260
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,514
- Oh, no way.
- What?

261
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,471
- I know you.
- No.

262
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,397
Yeah, I do. You were
in my photography class.

263
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,953
You took all those landscapes. Right?

264
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,749
- Shadia.
- Yeah. Shadia.

265
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,149
Holy shit, you're Shadia?

266
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,871
- Yeah. Shadia.
- Shadia.

267
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,315
- Jamba!
- (EXCLAIMS) What the fuck!

268
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,994
Shadia. It means
"singer" in Arabic.

269
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,429
Or in ancient Arabic,
"al-munshida alati tunadi lel-mei."

270
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,158
Or, "she whose name
calls others to water."

271
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,548
- That's actually right.
- Uh, Shadia, this is my...

272
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,153
Dr. Richards. I teach history
at the University of Georgia.

273
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,037
You're a professor?

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,269
Yeah. Why? You looking
for some extra credit?

275
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,470
Jason and I are doing
a story on the Middle East.

276
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,471
He's a photographer
for Time magazine.

277
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,552
You know, I lost my virginity
at my pop-pop's bingo night.

278
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,709
My name's Lenore.

279
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,793
Ah! "The rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels named Lenore"

280
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,471
Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'"

281
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,394
- Diplomaticos, huh?
- Hey, you know your cigars.

282
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
What are you,
half Cuban or something?

283
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,792
Actually, I am, professor.

284
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,991
- The bottom half.
- Okay.

285
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,068
SHADIA:
Okay, yeah, we're heading out.

286
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,229
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

287
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,389
We're going
to Daytona Beach for the week.

288
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,913
Oh, my God, and we should have been
there three fucking hours ago...

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,990
- (SNAPPING FINGERS)
- ...so let's go, bitches!

290
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,990
- Holy shit.
- What?

291
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,548
Nothing. You're just really gay.

292
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,154
Oh, am I?
Thanks, Captain Gaydar.

293
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,595
Jesus! You know,
I'm also black, right?

294
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,591
Yeah, I know. That's funny too.

295
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,034
So you guys wanna tag
along for a bit maybe?

296
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,793
Party some babies into us?

297
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,073
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

298
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,152
- Why?
- We have a very important tee time.

299
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,349
Of course you do.

300
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,192
And do you also have to take a nap
before you play Mahjong?

301
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,918
- No, it's shuffleboard.
- Shuffleboard.

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,955
And then early dinner at 4:00.

303
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,315
We have a long-standing bet.
Who's the better golfer.

304
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,436
Obviously I've got the bigger 3-wood...

305
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,557
Good. Maybe you can use it
to hit your balls right into my vagina.

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,436
- Holy shit!
- Okay, we're going inside now.

307
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,112
- Jesus!
- Let's go. That's enough.

308
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,713
- Bye, professor.
- Thanks for lunch.

309
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,034
Peace!

310
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,671
- Nice girl.
- Yeah.

311
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,993
(WOMEN LAUGHING)

312
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,910
Well? How do I look?

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,308
Like the keynote speaker
at a butt-fucking convention.

314
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,392
- What?
- What?

315
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,438
We're gonna write in the first hole,
it's an easy par-4.

316
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,714
- No, no, no, no. Hey...
- Jump in.

317
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,233
- This is against the rules, Grandpa.
- Fuck the rules. Jump in. Come on.

318
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,471
Not to mention,
a breach in golf etiquette.

319
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,311
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

320
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,833
- Whoa! Hey!
- Out of my way, butt-fuckers!

321
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,318
Really? What are you doing?

322
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,197
We gotta get this guy
to his butt-fucking convention.

323
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,555
MAN: What are you trying to do, man?
What was that all about?

324
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,432
Hey. Now there's
a million-dollar swing!

325
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,192
(CHUCKLING)
I'm sorry! Um...

326
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,397
You can go in front of us
if you want to. We are not very good.

327
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,592
No, it's a good cut, you're just
not bending your knees enough.

328
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,559
I'm a licensed golf pro.
You mind if I show you?

329
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,835
Yes, please.

330
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,593
Maybe bend over
a little bit... Here.

331
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,510
That feels about right,
doesn't it?

332
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,636
Hands on my shaft...
The shaft.

333
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,789
Let me just get

this entire fucking time?

don't I know about you?

510
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,635
How the hell do you know
how to speak Arabic?

511
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,471
Dad's never said
anything about that.

512
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,630
That's because your dad
doesn't really know much about me.

513

during most of his childhood.

I got mushrooms, I got meth.

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,992
All right,
let's get you out of there.

829
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,039
All right! Whoo!
I don't like being in a cage.

830
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,554
You're letting him out?
He's the one that sold drugs.

831
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,358
- Why are you letting him out?
- Hey, man! Not cool!

832
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,556
That's a real dick move,
throwing me under the bus.

833
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,992
What the fuck are you talking about?

834
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,831
You're the one that sold drugs
last night!

835
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,594
- Hey, guy, snitches get stitches!
- All right.

836
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:26,556
So why don't you shut
your fucking mouth, bro.

837
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,474
Yeah. Snitches get stitches,
my friend.

838
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,074
My name's Pam. (LAUGHS)

839
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,434
- All right.
- You're incorrigible.

840
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,353
- Hey, how are you, Finch?
- How you doing? Good to see you.

841
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,000
- Finchy! Finch!
- Hey! You got it.

842
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,159
Must beautiful woman
on the police force, right here.

843
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,992
- Jeez!
- The only woman, but...

844
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,307
- Here's the deal.
- What's up?

845
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,755
I came in here with a bag of drugs,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

846
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,559
I can't leave without it.

847
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,550
- Can you guys hook me up there?
- Yep...

848
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,436
- Ooh! Gary!
- These yours?

849
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,239
- Yeah. Thanks, Gare-Bear.
- Oh! Nice catch.

850
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,311
PAM: Hey, right? Please remember,
next Tuesday is the election.

851
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,550
Vote for me for mayor.
I'm gonna win this year.

852
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,755
- I'm gonna beat that goat.
- You got my vote.

853
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,548
- (LAUGHS)
- Pam! Pam!

854
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,632
- FINCH: He is just a good one.
- He is just a number one...

855
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,677
- Lover and a fighter.
- Okay, listen.

856
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,918
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

857
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,239
I'm being completely honest,
from the bottom of my heart,

858
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,192
I look up to you.
I fight for the law.

859
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,394
Thank you, no one ever
says that to us.

860
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,038
- Ever.
- That's what I wanted to do

861
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,235
when I was a kid.

862
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,911
Like, I wanted to do
what you guys do.

863
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,708
Mostly people just call us pigs
and throw bags of fast food at us.

864
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,755
- Yeah.
- I'm incredibly sorry

865
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,318
for all this confusion,
but listen to me, please.

866
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,277
I have to let you know,
I am a lawyer.

867
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,114
- Whoa! You're a lawyer?
- I am, yeah. I'm actually a lawyer.

868
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,793
Whoa!
You don't look like a lawyer.

869
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,268
Yeah. Yeah, I handle, like, uh,
corporate stuff.

870
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,239
Like, uh... like LLC agreements,

871
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,309
- LP agreements...
- You lost me.

872
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,436
- I don't even know what that means.
- I mean, like, you...

873
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,077
- ...you don't look Jewish.
- No.

874
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,594
- Which is weird.
- It's actually pretty funny.

875
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,518
- (LAUGHING)
- There you go...

876
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,110
That is funny!
It is so weird!

877
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,791
- It's darkly ironic.
- It really is.

878
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,110
Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

879
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,556
I thought you had to be, like,
at least 80 to be a lawyer.

880
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,028
- Like, it's a lot of school, right?
- Yeah.

881
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,588
It's... it's, uh...
it's a lot of school.

882
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,434
The bar...
something I took and passed.

883
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,909
It's not something
I stand behind.

884
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,079
- (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah. I'm not on this side, typically,

885
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,469
and I just, uh, I just...
I know my rights,

886
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:38,800
and I would love my phone call.

887
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,148
- Objection.
- Overruled.

888
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,913
- Permission to approach the bench?
- Denied!

889
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,672
- What?
- It's easy to be a lawyer.

890
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,876
- It's so easy.
- I would love my phone call.

891
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,509
- (MIMICKING)
- Okay. I know my rights.

892
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,954
- I want my phone call.
- (BABBLING) Give me my phone call!

893
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,713
- I should have a phone call!
- This is my First Amendment right.

894
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,996
(MIMICKING) My first, page one,
number one amendment

895
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,355
- says that I have a telephone!
- I get a phone call.

896
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,597
- This is my First Amendment right.
- I'm guaranteed a phone call.

897
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,869
- I don't sound like that.
- (MIMICKING) Yeah?

898
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,996
- What do you sound like then?
- Not like that.

899
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,476
- I don't even sound like that.
- (MIMICKING, BABBLING)

900
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:18,074
- Give me my phone call.
- (MIMICKING) Oh, please, let me

901
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,911
- have my phone call.
- (MOANING)

902
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,514
I'm an American
and I'm fucking guaranteed...

903
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:24,396
- (MIMICKING)
- I am an American...

904
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,356
- (MIMICKING)
- I am guaranteed a phone call.

905
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,909
(STRAINED VOICE) My right to have
a phone call!

906
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,114
I just said I'm an American,
and I'm guaranteed a phone call.

907
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,474
- Hm. Well, now he's getting demanding.
- Yeah.

908
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,153
- We better give him his phone call.
- Better give him his phone call.

909
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,027
Guys, come on. Come on, please.
(STAMMERS) Why are we doing this?

910
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,871
This is your phone right here, right?

911
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,032
- That is my phone, yes.
- Well, you know what?

912
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,038
We get to make one phone call
on your phone.

913
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,672
That's where you're a little bit
mixed up.

914
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,556
Yeah, hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

915
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,869
- No, no, no.
- Get a free Uber ride on that.

916
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,398
- Go ahead.
- Take us out to lunch.

917
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,916
You know what? We're gonna be kind
and set you up with a Tinder account.

918
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,309
- How about Grindr? What about, uh...
- Look at this!

919
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,630
- Jefe, is that how you pronounce that?
- Yeah, how about Jefe.

920
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,068
Yeah, huh? A little alone time
with Jefe?

921
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,675
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting,

922
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,431
- flirting, flirtations.
- He looks thick and lonely.

923
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,835
FINCH: You will meet him at
eight. You'll bring wine coolers.

924
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,552
- And... children's condoms.
- (LAUGHS)

925
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,393
- Just gonna take a little picture.
- Snatch-chat.

926
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,356
- Yeah, a little Snatch-chat.
- Please don't do that with my phone.

927
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,713
Hope you got a wide-angle lens on that.

928
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,597
- Oh! Wow.
- (PHONE RINGS)

929
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,829
(CHUCKLES) Kidding.

930
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,556
Somebody just posted his bail.
Get that pervert some pants.

931
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:43,277
FINCH: All right.

932
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,112
These were
a couple pair of pants

933
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,556
from murder victims
from a 1990s orgy gone bad.

934
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,349
We got semen-stained
or blood-stained.

935
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,034
Take your pick.
What's it gonna be?

936
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,355
- Blood.
- Semen it is.

937
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,632
- Hey, there he is.
- No.

938
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,311
Don't even fucking talk to me.

939
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,076
I know things got a little chaotic,
but I'm so close with Lenore...

940
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,838
What the fuck is wrong with you?

941
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,228
I'm about to get fucking
married, Grandpa!

942
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,153
In one week! To a Jewish girl!
And I just woke up in fucking jail

943
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,791
with a bunch of penises on my forehead
in the shape of a swastika!

944
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,275
Could call it a swasticock.

945
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,476
- What?
- It's a play on words.

946
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,072
Oh, it's a play on words.

947
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,231
A play on words.

948
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,952
Play on these words.

949
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,793
I'm dropping you off
at your old army vet buddy's house,

950
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,677
he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.

951
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,876
Because I'm fucking
done with you.

952
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,590
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- I can't help staring at your tits.

953
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,547
- Pow!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

954
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,349
You know, Stinky
had more confirmed kills

955
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,353
than anyone in our platoon
back in 'Nam? 118.

956
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,509
Shut the fuck up.

957
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,952
- What is this place?
- I don't know. Or care.

958
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,239
At least just come in with me.

959
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,197
Let's make sure
it's the right house.

960
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,110
After you.

961
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,269
Grandson of the year.

962
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,157
Your grandmother's
ashes are in there.

963
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:28,635
She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

964
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,036
Oh, well,
better late than never.

965
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,554
Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

966
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,391
Motherfucker!

967
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,516
Stinky?

968
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,478
What the fuck
are you doing here, Dick?

969
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,471
Oh, this?

970
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,119
This is liver failure.

971
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,070
- Who's the lesbian?
- That's my grandson, Jason.

972
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,152
Yeah? Is he here to scissor with me?

973
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,911
Okay, that's just
offensive to lesbians.

974
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,389
I am very sorry, K.D. Lang.

975
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:06,431
Time for Bingo!

976
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,909
Come on. Stinky, we got to get
you the fuck out of here.

977
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,675
- Come on, let's go.
- I have one fucking month left, Dick!

978
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,637
I don't want you
to remember me like this, man.

979
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,438
I want you
to remember me as a warrior.

980
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,431
- Please. Leave me be.
- But, Stinky...

981
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,590
No, no, no...
Just let me finish, Dick.

982
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:29,436
Leave me your beautiful lesbian grandson
so he can blowjob me to death.

983
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,873
It's all over for me, Dick.

984
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,795
You know, all I wanna do is play Bingo.

985
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,358
Go.

986
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:45,713
NURSE: All ready?

987
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,559
Bingo!
(LAUGHING)

988
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm sorry about

who else in our family knows

1155
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:46,599
that you were, uh,
Special Forces or whatever?

before my missions were declassified.

I was just an army mechanic.

would get along a little better

01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,350

Lenore and Dr. Richards

I have to tell her the truth.

1451
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,636
Well, maybe telling her
tonight is a little abrupt.

01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,792
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

- That's right.
- And I'm going to start now.

Or you can just wait till
I have sex with Lenore tonight,

1455
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,710
then you can tell Shadia everything.

1456

- No. I'm just lying.

that college girl!

Can you please go tell Meredith
that my cousin Jason is very sorry,

1645
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:22,347
but they cannot get married?

1646
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:25,592
Come on, man.
It's my first day...

1647
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,000
NICK:
I know it's your first day,

1648
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:28,871
but everybody needs
you to be a man here.

1649
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,439
Okay.

1650
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:34,997
Just real quick...

1651
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:38,152
He sent me...
He wants me to tell you that...

1652
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,150
Um... (STAMMERS)

1653
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,470
He doesn't think that he can marry you.

1654
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,198
But that he's sorry that he can't.

1655
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:51,154
(LAUGHING)

1656
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:55,028
She's laughing, so I think
that you're in the clear, bro.

1657
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:56,677
No, it's good.
That was good.

1658
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,796
You can just go back and tell him

1659
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,235
that I fucked his cousin Nick
while he was gone.

1660
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,671
She's so super cool about it.

1661
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,157
She's like,
"Go! Do your thing. Do you."

1662
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:13,198
- She said that?
- NICK: That's what she said, verbatim.

1663
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:15,110
Wait. Should I come down and say bye?

1664
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,872
- NICK: No. God! Fuck no!
- No?

1665
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,631
Yeah. No need to even...
Let's not even...

1666
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,188
You just... I've done it...
We're great!

1667
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,238
Wait, where the fuck is he going?

1668
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:26,748
Jason! Jason!

1669
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,597
It's actually the guy
on the moped with the iPad.

1670
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,592
NSA stopped using
utility vans years ago.

1671
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,796
I figured once you sent
the camera back,

1672
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,871
it was time to take
drastic measures.

1673
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,951
What'd he say?
Are we doing this?

1674
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,314
DICK: Plan B,
have Pam kidnap you.

1675
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:56,710
- I've got to get her back.
- You want me to kidnap her?

1676
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,836
I'll bring her back to you
in a box, bro.

1677
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,832
She's on a bus headed west
on I-85 across Florida.

1678
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,069
Her boat leaves in four hours.

1679
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,798
It was easy to track her down because
of the whole Middle Eastern thing.

1680
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,792
Bet you never thought you'd 69 a girl
because of the Patriot Act.

1681
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,234
You 69 her, man!

1682
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:14,037
And then she's dead.

1683
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,877
Are you kidding me, Pam?
This is what you drive?

1684

What were we supposed to do?
Just leave him on the side of road?

1705
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:07,670
Hey, man, can you slow down?
You're making this very difficult.

1706
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,479
What the fuck! That was you who drew
all those dicks on me last week?

1809

- Thank you for...
- Don't give me any of that shit.

1810
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:05,037
Just let me know when you get back.

1811
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:08,590
And I actually want to see
your photos in Time magazine.

1812
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,877

three months of my army pension!

1813
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:26,878
Thanks, Grandpa.

1814
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:32,310
- Oh, and, Jason...
- Yeah?

1815

Back in the '80s,
when Andre the Giant

1816
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:39,238
used to go to the Playboy Mansion,

1817
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:42,756
he'd stack five playmates
on top of each other on a bed

1818
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,956
and fingerfuck them all.
Five at a time.

1819
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:46,837
Because his hands were so big.

1820
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:53,198
So... that's it.

1821
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:00,439
Thanks, Grandpa.

1824
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,030
It means "to liberate the oppressed."

1825
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:25,033
- Hey. You ready?
- Yep.

1826
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,311
I don't think he's gonna find
anybody as good as me.

1827
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,150
I'm sorry, but you know what they say...

1828
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,231
Um... tough times

1829
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:46,198

1831

Yeah.

1832
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:10,828
Holy fucking shit!

1833
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,829
Has anyone ever told you
that you have the pussy

1834
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,069
of an English sheepdog?

1835
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,631
Well, thanks for the ride.

1836
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,313
You gonna be okay, Dad?

1837
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,238
I miss her.

1838
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:40,917
But I'll be okay.

1839
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:51,034
- I was a shitty father and I'm sorry.
- Well, we'll work on it.

1840
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:09,673
You're a hard man
to track down, professor.

1841
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,391
- Are those my pants?
- Yeah, these are your pants.

1842
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:18,390
I found a Werther's
Original in the pocket

1843
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:20,310
and I've been
sucking on it all morning.

1844
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,914
You do know that
I'm not a professor, right?

1845
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,114
Yeah, I know.

1846
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,760
You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa,

1847
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,912
and I'm just a girl
from Long lsland City

who likes to fuck old people.

1849
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,591
I like your pull-out couch.

1850
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,478
Yeah, well, I got news for you.

1851
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,836
That's the only thing
that's gonna be pulling out tonight.

1852

I'll be right back.

Oh, hey.

1854
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:06,636
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know if I can do this.

1855
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,118
I haven't done it for a long time.

1856
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:30,238
Whoops! I guess they just slipped off.

1857
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,757
I want you to tear open my bra
like it's a social security check.

1858
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:47,755
Tell me you've fallen
and you can't get up.

1859
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,672
"Help, I've fallen
and I can't get up."

1860
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,988
Oh, no!

1861

you're trying to find your glasses.

I can't see.

I found them! I can see! I can see!"

1864
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,676
Tell me it's 4:00
and you want to eat dinner.

1865
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,909
"It's 4:00 and I want to eat dinner."

1866

on your remote control

1867
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,710
are so small

"The buttons on my remote control
are so small I can't find Fox News!"

1869
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,875
- Tell me how small they are!
- "They're real small!"

1870
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,800
Tell me how this neighborhood
used to be safer!

1871
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,353
"This neighborhood used to be safer!"

1872
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:24,475
Tell me how things were
better under Eisenhower!

1873
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,595
"Things were better under Eisenhower!"

1874
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,512
- We like Ike!
- We like Ike!

1875

Great fucking idea.

- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

I know your baby just got baptized.
