00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,639
Besides that?

361
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,642
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

362
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,611
and nobody don't bother
the Mayor but you?

363
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,615

366
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,187
Hold your tongue?

367
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,778
You don't have that much love?

368
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,991
One dayyou gonna be nice to me?

369
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,993
We may both be dead and buried,

370
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,222
but you gonna be nice?

371
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,458
At least civil?

372
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,476
I told you, I'm not going
to baby-sit foryou,

373
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,705
and that's it!

374
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,208
What areyou

375
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,214
Yesterdayyou said you would?

376
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,682
Now today
you're changing your mind?

377
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,218
No, I'm not changing--

378
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,219
¿Ay, Mommy,

379
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,221
Get off of me, please!

380
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,655
I do everything foryou?

381
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,590
You can't do shit for me!

382
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,355
Yo tengo
el derecho de salirte.

383
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,796
Right, right?
You know it's not like that, Mommy?

384
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,795
I can do everything foryou,

385
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,299
but you won't do shit for me?

386
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,531
Stop it!

387
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,266
That lady makes me sick!

388
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,680
Your father makes me sick, too?

389
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,752
Everybody makes me sick?

390
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,042
Shit?

391
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,587
Your father ain't no real father?

392
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,520
He's a bum?

393
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,150
Chump change, to-the-curb,

394
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,728
pulling no major pub, bum!

395
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,589
Mike?

396
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,097
Fuck Mike Tyson!

397
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,533
I rememberwhen he mugged
that woman on Lexington?

398
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,694
I remember that shit?

399
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,702
You're going to tell him?

400
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,636
I'll tell him?
Fuck MikeTyson!

401
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,639
To his face?

402
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,674
You goddamn right!

403
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,301
He'll knock
your goddamn ass off?

404
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,675
You talk shit now?

405
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,282
I'll drop him like a bad habit?

406
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,250
IfTyson dream aboutwhippin' my ass,

407
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,047
he betterwake up and apologize?

408
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,055

00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,099
And all those parts

414
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,136

Don't worry about it?

418
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,544
When it happens,
and I'm in my boat

419

You're afraid of the goddamn oven?

00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,726
Hit the oven!

536
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,165

00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,543
Make it plain?

904
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,114
OK, but listen up?

905
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,114
I'm going to break it down?

906
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,513
Let it be broke?

907
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,813
Can you dig it?

908
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,213
It's dug?

909
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,189
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street?

910
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,226
Bet they haven't been
offthe boat a year

911
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,693
before they opened
their own place?

912
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,297
Right? It's been about a year?

913
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,299
A motherfuckin' year
off the motherfuckin' boat,

914
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,733
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?

915
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,303
A good business,

916
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,703
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

917
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,105
for longer than
I care to remember,

918
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,042
and I've been here a long time?

919
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,477
Yeah, a long time?

920
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,445
Hear, boy?

921
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,709
Now, for the life of me??

922
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,547
you know, I can't
figure this out?

923
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,215
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses??

924
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,257
oryou black asses
are just plain dumb?

925
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,128
Fuckyou?

926
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,132
It's got to be
because we're black?

927
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,530
Ain't no other explanation?

928
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,136
You know it's true?

929
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,229
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

930
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,706
Oh, oh! You motherfuckers
hold that shit down?

931
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,574
I'm tired ofthat
old excuse, that shit?

932
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,179
I swear, man,

933
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,215
I will be one happy fool

934
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,614
when we open
our own business

935
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,583
right here in our neighborhood?

936
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,210
I swear to God,

937
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,723
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?

938
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,760
You motherfuckers
are always talking

939
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,726
that old Keith Sweat shit--

940
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,298
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"

941
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,299
You ain't gonna do nothing?

942
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,301
You're gonna sit on this corner?

943
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,735
When you going
to getyour business?

944
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,305
Just like I thought?

945
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,705
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing?

946
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,311
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

947
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,743

948
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,279

1004
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,827
and listened toyour
five hungry children

1005
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,396
crying for bread,

You can't even look

you don't know my pain,
my hurt, my feelings?

1011

It's disrespectful?

1017
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,623
Your mamas and papas

1018
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,456

1024
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,301
I'd be getting a job,

1026
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,542
You're right?
I don't want to knowyour pain?

1027
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,838
I don't care?

1028
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,705

00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,620
You'll never get
respect here, boy!

1037
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,198
I respect those
who respect themselves!

1038
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,163
Ahmad!

1039
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,597

1046
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,688

1047
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,587

That's fucked?
Don't talk about Jesse?

1124
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,644

1133
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,832

1134
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:50,861
That's right?

1135
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,760

Static?

and the left hand
is kicking much ass?

1223

But if I hate you??

1233
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,745
There it is--
love and hate?

1234
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,316
I love you, brother?

1235
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,542
