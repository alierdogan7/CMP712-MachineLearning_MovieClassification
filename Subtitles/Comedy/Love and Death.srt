isn't all mankind in the same boat?</i>

5

<i>Isn't all mankind ultimately executed
for a crime it never committed?</i>

I would like to buy your land.

and his son, Young Gregor.</i>

25

was older than Old Gregor.</i>

26

how that happened.</i>

<i>For years,
I thought he was an Italian widow.</i>

42

FATHER NIKOLAI:
Every action has a cause.

43
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,732
The universe exists,
therefore it has a cause.

44
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,985
It follows God created the universe,
therefore He exists.

YOUNG BORIS: And yet, Spinoza
didn't believe in the Holy Trinity.

46
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,366
- Spinoza was a Jew.
- What's a Jew?

47
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,321
You never saw a Jew?
Here, I have some sketches.

48

- No kidding!

Spiders and bugs
and then big fish eating little fish

Boris, let me show you
how absurd your position is.

100
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,340
All right.
Let's say that there is no God,

and each man is free to do
exactly as he chooses.

Well, what prevents you
from murdering somebody?

103

- Murder's immoral!
- Morality is subjective.

104
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,343
Yes, but subjectivity is objective.

Not in any rational scheme

106
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,724
Perception is irrational.
It implies imminence.

But judgment of any system
or a priori relation of phenomena

108
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,781
exists in any rational or metaphysical
or at least epistemological contradiction

to an abstracted empirical concept
such as being

110

or of the thing itself.

Well, Minskov has proposed.

And he's very sweet and wealthy
but the age difference is too great.

124
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,383
- I'm 28 and he's 81.
- Oh, that is big.

125
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,803
When I'm 50, he'll be, uh, 103.

126
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,972
That's a bad age for men.
They slow up a lot.

Oh, and Voskovec has made
his intentions clear

128
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,435
but he deals in herring,
and he always smells of herring.

129
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,105
Do you know, he even bought me
herring-scented cologne?

130
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,691
Oh, really? That's probably why
the cat follows you around.

Love is everything, Boris.

132
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,443
I want to meet some man
and scale the heights of passion.

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,409
Some man who embodies
the three great aspects of love.

134
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,121
Intellectual, spiritual and sensual.

135
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,415
Well, then,
there's not too many of us around,

136
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,367
but it can be done.

137
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,295
- So many women settle cheaply.
- I know. Poor things.

138
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,841
- They marry for money.
- (SCOFFS) Money! Well, money.

139
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,635
But I tell you, I feel as though
my life would be wasted

140
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,514
if I didn't love deeply
with a man whose mind I respected,

141
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,683
whose spirituality equaled mine

142
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,770
and who had the same,
oh, lustful appetite for sensual passion

143
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,688
that drives me insane.

144
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,646

145
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,525

I'm half-saint, half-whore.

00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,442
- Boris?
- Yes?

- I have a confession to make.
- Yes?

- Yes?

- He has true animal magnetism.
- Animal magnetism?

All that talk about some perfect love,
and you're hot for Ivan?

156

- He kissed me.
- Any place I should know?

157
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,934
It warmed the cockles of my heart.

That's just great.
Nothing like hot cockles!

ask me to marry him.

But he's a gambler and a drinker.
He's got a Neanderthal mentality.

Napoleon has invaded Austria.

Why? Is he out of Courvoisier?

At last, a chance
to taste the glories of battle!

No, Boris. You're going to fight.

your head examined.

What are you going to do
when the French soldiers rape your sister?

- I don't have a sister.
- That's no answer.

Oh, she's not my mother.

My mother's standing right here,

332
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,864
That's the Countess Alexandrovna,

333
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,535
one of the most enticing woman
in St. Petersburg.

334
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,204
Ample bosoms, yes? (CHUCKLES)

335
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,581
Mmm-hmm. I'd say ample for a regiment.

336
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,458
WOMAN: She's recently widowed.

337
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,795
And they say her husband, the Count,
died in her arms

338
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,757
trying to satisfy
her prodigious sexual desires.

339
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,177
No kidding! Died smiling, I bet.

340
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,305
Who's the character with her
with the wry moustache?

341
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,850
WOMAN: That's Anton Ivanovich Inbedkov,
her current lover.

342
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,729
Although the way
she keeps staring at you!

343
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm sure I could work
something out with him.

344
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,898
I'd let him warm her up
for a few minutes

345
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,942
and I could come in at the end
and finish her.

346
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,945
MAN: You must be careful
of Anton Ivanovich.

347
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,573
- He has a furious temper.
- Really?

348
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,200
Mmm. He has killed several men in duels.

349
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,162
All in a jealous rage over the Countess.

350
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,997
- (MUSIC STARTING)
- Glad you mentioned it.

351
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,949
Think I'll watch the opera.

00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,133
Oh, there is something about Mozart!

355
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,435
I think you're probably
responding to his music.

356
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,145
- Oh.

357
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,269

Couldn't you be careful?

- I believe... I believe...

I believe that the lobby... (COUGHING)

360
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:49,119
I believe that the lobby of
the St. Petersburg Opera House

361
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,038
is one of the most beautiful in Europe.

362
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,248
Who is this attractive
and mysterious soldier?

363
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,125
Boris Grushenko.

364
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,632
Ooh, I'm sorry. I goosed that lady.

365
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,801
ALEXANDROVNA: He has
quite a sensitive face, hasn't he?

366
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,386
That's just the part of me that shows.

367
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,762
Grushenko.

368
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,099
Isn't he the young coward
all St. Petersburg is talking about?

369
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,851
I'm not so young. I'm 35.

370
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,727
The one who's so afraid
for his own safety

371
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,688
that he is reluctant
to defend his country.

372
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,106
He is in a bad mood, isn't he?

373
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,478
What's the matter?
Don't you like your seats?

374
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,733
You must visit me for tea someday.
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.

375
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,655
It's okay with me.
I'll bring the tea bags.

376
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,991
We could run a quick check
on your erogenous zones.

377
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,993
What about the dybbuk?

378
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,117
Why do you persist
in taunting me in public?

379
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,040
If you so much as come
near the Countess,

380
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,543
I'll see that you'll never see
the light of day again.

381
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,671
If a man said that to me,
I'd break his neck!

382
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,047
I am a man!

383
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,126
Well, I mean a much shorter man.

- Boris Dimitrovitch!
- BORIS: Sonja!

386
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,314
Look at you.
You look so handsome in your uniform.

387
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,650
Well, I got a perfect build for clothes.
I'm a 28 dwarf.

388
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,862
And you, Sonja, my God,
you look more beautiful standing here

389
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,071
than you do in person.

390
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,491
- Oh, Boris, I'm so unhappy.
- Oh, I wish you weren't.

391
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,786
Voskovec and I quarrel frequently.
I've become a scandal.

392
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,288
Poor Sonja!

393
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,207
For the past weeks,
I've visited Seretsky in his room.

394
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,376
Why? What's in his room?

395
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,702
Oh.

396
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,047
And before Seretsky, Alexi.

397
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,924
And before Alexi, Alegorian.

398
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,509
- And before Alegorian, Asimov...
- Okay!

399
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,720
Wait! I'm still on the A's.

400
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,548
- How many lovers do you have?
- In the midtown area?

401
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,350
(GROANS) Oh, Sonja.

402
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,099
Boris, my life is ruined. Over.

403
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,189
I can't stand Voskovec!

404
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,567
He's a man whose mentality
has reduced all the beauty of the world

405
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,565
to a small pickled fish!

406
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,948
Sonja, what you need is somebody
to take you away from Voskovec.

407
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,408
Somebody who loves you,
somebody who's always loved you

408
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,656
and who's always
cared for you very deeply.

409
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,908
How is your brother, Ivan?

410
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,542
(STAMMERS) Oh, Ivan's all right.

411
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,211
Yes? Ivan is well?

412
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,420
You know Ivan is a tiger.

413
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,922
He went through basic training
in two weeks.

414
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,214
They made him a major.

415
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,593
- And does he ever speak of me?
- Sonja, he's busy.

416
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,972
Well, he must! He must speak
of me sometimes. He must!

417
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,182
Take it easy, will ya?
This is army property.

418
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,393
(STAMMERS) Once he was sick.

419
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,687
He was delirious.
He called your name out.

420
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,810
Really? Then there's hope.

421
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,235
Look, tomorrow my regiment pulls out.
We're going to the front.

422
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,778
We're badly outnumbered by the French.

423
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,572
There's very little chance that
any of us will ever come back.

424
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,445
Exactly what did he say about me?

425
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,238
Sonja!

426
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,578
Oh, now where did you say
you were going?

427
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,580
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, the war.

428
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,455
Well, uh, dress warmly, Boris,
and have a nice time.

(HORSES NEIGHING)

430
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,640
The idea is not to panic and run.
Then they shoot you in the back.

431
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,935
I don't want to be trampled by a horse.
What about you, Boris?

432
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,730
Yeah, I want to be trampled by a horse.
I don't even want to fight.

433
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,524
Think there's any difference whether
we live under the Czar or Napoleon?

434
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,985
They're both crooks.
The Czar's a little taller.

435
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:11,780
Boris, if you don't like Napoleon
and you don't like the Czar,

436
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,949
who do you think
should be running the country?

437
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,785
- You really want to know? The serfs.
- MEN: Oh, the serfs?

438
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,996
That's right. They're the only ones
who know how to do anything.

439
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,914
If a fence needs putting up,
or a picture needs hanging,

440
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,458
it's always the serfs.

441
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,461
- He wants the serfs to run the country!
- (ALL LAUGHING)

442
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,631
Why not the criminal element,
or the Jews?

443

Some Jews are smart!

444
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,510

don't believe in sex after marriage.

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,804
- Are you married, Boris?
- Me? No.

446
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,681
- You got a sweetheart?
- No, no.

447
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,392
I'm in love with a girl.
She's married to someone.

448
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,644
And she's in love with someone,
and he's married.

449
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,354
It's a real healthy situation.

450
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,899
- Hey, look, Boris. Look, look.
- What do you got there?

451
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,818
I got a lock of my wife's hair. Look.

452
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,280
A lock of her hair? She...
She's probably running around bald!

453
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,409
Don't drop it. Don't drop it.
You got a lock of your sweetheart's hair?

454
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,995
No. My sweetheart's married.

Oh, God is testing us.

why doesn't he give us a written?

will be around in a second.

have gotten a lot worse if He wasn't.

- Oh... Does it hurt?
- I feel nothing.

for a guy who's dead.

- Oh, you want me to give it to her?
- No! What's the point?

- Take it back to the jeweler's in Smolensk.
- Right.

- Petroshkin. Vladimir Petroshkin.

and get the deposit back.

- I know.

495
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,175
- Two little baguettes.
- This is insane.

496
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,010
- I could have gotten you this ring for 1200.
- Not this.

497
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,638
- Never... Never that ring.
- Same ring. The exact same ring.

498
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,092
Never. Listen.
Anyway, listen, take the deposit,

499
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,185
- go to Kiev.
- Right.

500
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,854
Give it to a woman
named Natasha Petrovna.

501
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,857
- Right. Okay.
- Get a receipt. Make sure you get a receipt.

502
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,651
Why do you need a receipt? You're dead.

503
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,900
- Tax purposes.
- Oh, good thinking.

504
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,659
- What happened?
- He was cleaning his pistol and it went off.

505
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,079
- The bullet is lodged in his heart.
- Is it serious?

506
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,621
With proper medical care,
he could last another 10 minutes.

507
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,038
Why? Why were you cleaning your pistol?

508
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,919
I was going to fight a duel
to defend your honor.

509
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,057
A Turkish cavalry officer
cast aspersions on it.

510
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,845
He said you were sleeping around.
I knew he was lying.

511
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,397

I know I could have been
a better wife to you.

520
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,119
I could have made love with you
more often, or once even.

521
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,796
Once would have been nice.

522
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,212
You were a kind and loving husband.

523
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,177
Generous, and always considerate.

524
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,343
What's he got? About eight minutes?

525
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,300

I realize this must be
a great blow to you, Sonja.

529
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:49,030
But you must not allow yourself
to be consumed with grief.

530
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,612
The dead pass on.

531
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,328

532
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,828
I guess you're right.
Where do you want to eat?

533
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,754
Let's go to Rykoff's.

534
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,381
- No, no. Not Rykoff's.
- Why?

535
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,634
I feel like meat. What do you get at Rykoff's,
maybe a cheese sandwich?

536
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,677
- If it's not meat, it's nothing.
- It's not good for your health.

I wanted you to have
some of his possessions.

How kind.

556

Also, some string.

561
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,835
Ivan saved string.

562
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,791
I know. It was one of the reasons
why I loved him.

563
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,634
I understand that.

564
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,221
I loved him for his string, too.

00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,164
He's much better than I am at it,
and I'll probably be killed.

665
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,500
I wanted to take this time,
if I don't see you again,

666
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,086
- to say that I love you.
- Boris...

667
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,754
I've always loved you
ever since we were kids.

668
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,632
I was heartbroken when you loved Ivan,
but I still love you.

669
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,509
Why didn't you say something?

670
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,588
- Would it have mattered?
- Oh, of course not, darling.

671
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:52,221
If by some miracle I'm not killed tomorrow,
would you marry me?

672
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,303
What do you think the odds are?

673
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,691
(GROANS)
Going to die before the harvest!

674
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:04,195
The crops, the grains,
fields of rippling wheat.

675
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,865
Wheat. All there is in life is wheat!

676
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,196
Sonja, here's your chance
to do something kind for a dying boy.

677
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:17,083
But I don't really love Boris. I mean,
I love him, but I'm not in love with him.

678
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,627
Oh, wheat, lots of wheat.

679
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,081
Fields of wheat!
A tremendous amount of wheat!

680
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,175
And yet he loves me,
and would make a devoted husband.

681
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,219
Not too exciting, but devoted.

682
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,222
We'd have a family. Maybe not
our own. We could rent one.

683
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,517
I could learn to love him.
Me, Boris and six rented children.

684
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,354
(GASPS) Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? Can't breathe!

685
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,442
Open a window. No, no, no. Not that one.
The one in the bathroom.

686
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,522
Yellow wheat, red wheat,
wheat with feathers, Cream of Wheat!

687
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,282
Poor boy, dueling with Anton Inbedkov!

688
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,491
By this time tomorrow morning,

689
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,202
my beloved Cousin Boris
will look like a Swiss cheese.

690
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,372
Promise him anything.
Make him happy for a night.

691
00:41:56,472 --> 00:42:00,209
Oh! Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? My youth gone!

692
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,379
Living with a Swiss cheese
and rented children.

693
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,049
Of course, I'll marry you, Boris.
It would be an honor for me.

694
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,471
Uh, this Anton Inbedkov,
he is a good shot, isn't he?

695
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,726
- I'm afraid so.
- Well...

696
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,688
Since this may be
your last night on Earth,

697
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,061
let's go back to my room and make love.

698
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,730
Oh, nice idea.

699
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,937
I'll bring the soy sauce.

700
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,939
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

701
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:04,148
At last! You're late, Boris Grushenko.
We thought you weren't coming.

702
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,194
- Well, I overslept.
- Can you be so relaxed and confident?

703
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,322
You know, I hate to shoot anybody
before I've had my morning tea.

704
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,241
I get a lot of bad mail from the serfs.

705
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,952
I implore both of you,
come back to your senses.

706
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:20,081
There is still time to call it off,
by mutual consent, with no loss of honor.

707
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,875
Since you put it that way,
maybe I will hop back into bed.

708
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,668
ANTON: We'll do it now.

709
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,671
And to the death.

710
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:30,008
Oh, no, I can't do anything to the death.
Doctor's orders.

711
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,553
I have an ulcer condition, and dying
is one of the worst things for it.

712
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,925
Begin!

713
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,467
You have been challenged. Choose.

714
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,926
Oh.

715
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,642
Sure.

716
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,561
Uh... Oh.

717
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,985
All right. I'll take these.

718
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,319
Just one.

719
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,443
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Oh, he gets one! That was silly.

720
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,985
MAN:
Starting back-to-back, on my signal,

721
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,455
you will walk 10 paces, turn and fire.

722
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,499
- Is that clear?
- Of course.

723
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,327
Of course.

724
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,082
MAN:
Good luck. And God be with you both.

725
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,001
You listening?

726
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,684
MAN: One, two.

727
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,350
Three, four, five,

728
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,687
six, seven, eight,

729
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,727
nine, 10!

730
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,174
Does this come out from
dry cleaning or is this like gravy?

731
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,797
You must shoot.

732
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,015
No, no, no. I don't wanna shoot.

733
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,967
You must! It's the law.

734
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,189
Well, if it's the law,
then I'll shoot in the air.

735
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,810
There! I fulfilled my obligation.

736
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:22,578
Boris Dimitrovitch,
I've learned a great lesson here today.

737
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,704
Yes, me too.

738
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,248
Never shoot up in the air
when you're standing under it.

739
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,669
You could have killed me,
and you didn't!

740
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,420
How can I ever repay you?

741
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,006
Well, you can start
by getting off my toe.

742
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,879
Oh, I beg your pardon.

743
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,263
Boris Dimitrovitch, from this day on,
I will lead a new life.

744
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,306
I will modify my views.

745
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,601
I will preach goodness.
Perhaps join the church.

746
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,974
I will lead a righteous life.

747
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,691
Devote myself, as I did
in my childhood, to my singing.

748
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,768
(SCATTING)

749
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,653
(LAUGHING)

750
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,115
He's got a great voice, hasn't he?
I should've shot him.

751
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,534
<i>So, Sonja and I married.</i>

752
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,079
I know pronounce you man and wife.

753
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,747
Oh!

754
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,449
I'm so happy!

755
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,794
Look at the kid, she's so happy,
she's speechless.

756
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,462
He missed. (SCOFFS)

757
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,836
He missed it. He missed.

758
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:26,976
I know what's bothering you.

759
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,770
You're worried whether you're gonna
be a stimulating enough wife for me.

760
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,774
Whether it's possible to live up to the
chores and obligations of married life.

761
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,235
But it's gonna be a cinch. I promise.

762
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,487
I have no bad habits at all.

763
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,948
Granted, I have a few eccentricities.
(STAMMERS)

764
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,576
I won't eat any food that
begins with the letter "F,"

765
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,077
like chicken for instance.

766
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,747
Boris, I just don't love you.

767
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,873
Oh, Sonja...

768
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,168
Oh, I mean I love you,
but I'm not in love with you.

769
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,503
Sonja, do you even know what love means?

770
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,215
There are many different kinds
of love, Boris.

771
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,967
There's love between a man and a woman,

772
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,053
love between a mother and a son.

773
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,263
Two women. Let's not forget my favorite.

774
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,515
But then there's the love
I've always dreamed of

775
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,060
- ever since I was a little girl.
- Yeah.

776
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,355
The love between
two extraordinary individuals.

777
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,772
Sonja.

778
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,982
Oh, don't, Boris. Please!

779
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,399
Sex without love is an empty experience.

780
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:24,109
Yes, but, as empty experiences go,
it's one of the best.

781
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,032
<i>At first, things were
a little tense between us.</i>

782
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,248
<i>But after a while, she relaxed.</i>

783
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,886
Don't. Not here.

784
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,642
<i>BORIS: Soon Sonja got more used to me.</i>

785
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,353
<i>Sometimes she actually had fun.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

786
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,397
<i>Like the time she baked
her first soufflé.</i>

787
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,156
<i>Money was scarce,</i>

788
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,034
<i>and Sonja learned to make
wonderful dishes out of snow.</i>

789
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,995
Sweetheart, it looks
a little rare to me.

790
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,997
Oh, I left it in the oven
for an hour-and-a-half.

791
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,916
Did you? 'Cause it looks, you know,
it's all, uh... What's for dessert?

792
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,043
- A surprise, Boris.
- Yes, what?

793
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,837
A nice, big bowl of sleet!

794
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,961
Oh, sleet, my favorite!
That's wonderful.

795
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,051
<i>Evenings we played music together.</i>

796
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,754
<i>And as time passed, I won her heart.</i>

797
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,967
Oh, Boris, I've never been
so happy in my entire life!

798
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:35,021
I love you, Boris, in a deeper way
than I ever thought was possible.

799
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,438
Really?

800
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,318
I want to have children with you.

801
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,395
- What kind?
- Little children.

802
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,656
Of course!
The big ones are mentally slower.

803
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,359
- I want to have three children.
- One of each.

804
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,747
Oh, Boris... Boris, I'm actually happy.

805
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,491
Well, I hate to say I told you so,

806
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,161
but some men have it,
and some men don't.

807
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,415
Fortunately, I have so much of it.

808
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,714
<i>Those next months
were the happiest time of my life.</i>

809
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,396
<i>Then one day, at the height
of my sense of well-being,</i>

810
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,565
<i>I suddenly and for no apparent reason</i>

811
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,610
<i>was seized with an urge
to commit suicide.</i>

812
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,029
No. You're healthy.
You have a beautiful wife.

813
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,739
Your work is going well.

814
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,158
- I know, but something's missing.
- What?

815
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,786
I don't know. I feel a void
at the center of my being.

816
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,287
What kind of void?

817
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,040
- Well, an empty void.
- Empty void?

818
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,377
Yes. I felt a full void about a month ago,
but it was just something I ate.

819
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,581
Mmm. Maybe what you have
is a sickness of the soul.

820
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,175
- BORIS: Look! There's Death!
- MAN: What? Who?

821
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,669
BORIS: Death! He's got Krapotkin,
the wine merchant.

822
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,339
- MAN: Really?
- BORIS: Yeah, and a woman.

823
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,724
Ooh, it's not Mrs. Krapotkin!

824
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,226
- You're kidding?
- No.

825
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,145
I always knew Krapotkin
was diddling somebody else.

826
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,606
Where are you taking Krapotkin?

827
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,566
DEATH: Away. Forever.

828
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,191
Listen, if you run into my wife,
tell her I'm with you.

(BELL TOLLING)

832
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,456
Father Andre, holiest of holies,
aged and wise,

833
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,835
you are the most wrinkled man
in the entire country.

834
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,164
Get off my beard, you little jerk!

835
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,081
Oh.

836
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,008
Rise, my child.

837
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,552
- Rise!
- I'm standing.

838
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,427
My eyesight is poor.

839
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,685
Everyone says you're senile with age

840
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,562
but you're the only one
that can help me.

841
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,890
I don't think you're senile.

842
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,977
- Where did you say the fish was caught?
- What fish?

843
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:49,029
Didn't you say something about fish?

844
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,574
Father, Boris is trying
to commit suicide!

845
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:57,288
Last week he contemplated killing himself
by inhaling next to an Armenian.

846
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,707
Tell Boris this.

847
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,748
I have lived many years.

848
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:09,884
And after many trials and tribulations,

849
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,723
I have come to the conclusion
that the best thing is...

850
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,970
SONJA: Yes?

851
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:21,933
- Blonde, 12-year-old girls!
- Father...

852
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,357
Two of them, whenever possible.

853
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,480
Father, I counted on you!

854
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,275
I forgive you.

855
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,031
I forgive you.

856
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,950
Yes, thank you, thank you,
Your Grubbiness.

857
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,331
<i>BORIS: As I dangled at the rope's end,</i>

858
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,533
<i>I was suddenly seized
with an urge to live.</i>

859
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,252
<i>All I could think of was Sonja.</i>

860
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,672
<i>I wanted to hold her close to me,
weep tears on her shoulder</i>

861
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,795
<i>and engage in oral sex.</i>

862
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,344
<i>It was then
that I made the decision to live.</i>

863
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,797
<i>To live and become a great poet.</i>

864
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,424
I should have been

865
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,805
a pair of ragged claws

866
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,816
scuttling across

867
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,603
the floors

868
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,655
of silent seas.

869
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,280
(SIGHS) Too sentimental!

870
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,790
<i>That winter, Sonja and I
had a wonderful time.</i>

871
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,168
<i>We found a new friend,
Berdykov, the village idiot.</i>

872
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:30,422
<i>Berdykov would sit smiling for days,
and stroke a little piece of velvet</i>

873
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,467
<i>while Sonja would make him happy
by feeding him cookies.</i>

874
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,971
<i>We looked forward to the spring
when we could have a child of our own.</i>

875
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,889
<i>Little did we know.</i>

876
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,017
MAN: War! Napoleon has invaded Russia!

877
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,015
It's war! War!

878
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,819
Oh, what about all our plans?
We were gonna be parents this year.

879
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,612
Well, there's gonna be
a slight change in our plans.

880
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,698
Instead of parents,
we're gonna be refugees.

881
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,400
Well, that's terrible!

882
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,327
We have to take our possessions and flee.
I'm very good at that.

883
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,831
I was the men's freestyle fleeing
champion two years in a row.

884
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,458
Then we have to remember to burn
the food so the French don't get it.

885
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,127
Although I know it's tough
to light borscht.

886
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,378
- SONJA: Boris.
- What?

887
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,046
- I have an idea.
- What?

888
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,379
Let's assassinate Napoleon.

889
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,844
Yeah, interesting.
It's getting a little late.

890
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,137
You want to start knitting dinner?

891
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,681
- I'm serious.
- What do you mean you're serious?

892
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,225
I mean, let's you and I kill Napoleon.

893
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,520
Sonja, you been drinking from the glass
we use for the village idiot?

894
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,564
It's the answer to all our problems.

895
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,483
No, it's not the answer. It's an answer.
And it's the wrong answer.

896
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,062
The correct answer is "flee."
F-L-E-A. Flee.

897
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,947
No, no, the French occupy Moscow.

898
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,866
- His headquarters are there.
- Sonja...

899
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,410
Two innocent-looking types like us
could work our way in to see him,

900
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,578
and then shoot him.

901
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:45,289
Sonja, we'd never get near him.
If we did, we'd shoot and miss.

902
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,374
He's a tough target. He's very small.

903
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,294
Boris, it's our chance to perform
a truly heroic act!

904
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,713
Since when is murder a heroic act?

905
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,087
Violence is justified
in the service of mankind.

906
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,886
- Who said that?
- Attila the Hun.

907
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,096
You're quoting a Hun to me?

908
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,391
Don't you know that murder carries
with it a moral imperative

909
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,687
that transcends any notion
of the inherent universal free will?

910
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:13,184
Oh, that is incredibly jejune!

911
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,900
- That's jejune?
- Jejune!

912
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:21,241
You have the temerity to say that
I'm talking to you out of jejune-osity?

913
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,615
I'm one of the most "june" people
in all of the Russias!

914
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,614
I have Ivan's old pistol!

915
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,918
Sonja, political assassination doesn't work.
Violence leads to violence.

916
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,587
He who lives by the sword,
dies by the sword.

917
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,589
Well, I'm out of clichés now.

918
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,591
What, are you suggesting
passive resistance?

919
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,927
No, I'm suggesting active fleeing.

920
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,679
You can't run away all your life.

921
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,933
I know, but murder!
The most foul of all crimes.

922
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:50,104
And, not abstract murder, shooting a rifle
at an unknown enemy on the battlefield,

923
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,315
but standing in a closed room
with a live human being

924
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,442
and pulling the trigger face-to-face

925
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,362
and a famous human being,
a successful one,

926
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,364
one who earns more than I do.

927
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,367
My God, you figure Napoleon,
why he's gotta be good for

928
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,036
10,000 francs a week, that's minimum!
That's minimum.

929
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,789
That's without tips or extras.
Nothing like that.

930
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,791
And me, what am I?

931
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,420
He's a great man.
He thinks like the super man,

932
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,214
and I'm just a worm, an insect.

933
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:22,511
Some kind of crawling, disgusting,
creeping little vermin.

934
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,598
- You know you can stop me.
- I will when I disagree.

935
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,393
(GROANS) Oh, Sonja,
who are we to kill somebody?

936
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:33,522
Boris, for the first time in my life,
I feel free! Weightless!

937
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:37,352
I have an exhilarating feeling
of human freedom!

938
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,194
It's called the guillotine.

939
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,404
Oh, look, Boris.

940
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:44,616

Well, perhaps not legend,

00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,586
and no raisins!

998
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,798
- But at our last meeting, you said raisins.
- No!

999
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,102
If this pastry is to bear my name,
it must be richer.

1000
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,599
More cream.

1001
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,439
- Is there time?
- Very little.

1002
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,275
My spies tell me that
my illustrious British enemy

1003
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:52,356
is working on a new meat recipe
which he plans to call Beef Wellington.

1004
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,075
(CHUCKLES)
It will never get off the ground.

1005
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:59,280
We must develop the Napoleon
before he develops Beef Wellington.

1006
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,791
The future of Europe
hangs in the balance.

1007
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,915
Yes, Your Highness.

1008
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,252
We must see you, Your Highness.

1009
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,051
We have reason to believe that
there is a plot to take your life.

1010
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,377
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1011
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:19,182
That's why we've made up an obscure
private from the ranks to look like you.

1012
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,976
- Look.
- How do you do, Your Highness?

1013
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,646
He looks like me?

1014
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,315
You're seeing him without his rug.

1015
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,032
Come.

1016
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,906
Uh, just let me get this on,
Your Highness.

1017
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,280
And now, I take your place.

1018
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:47,620
I will teach you to walk like me.
I have a great walk.

1019
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:54,468
With the Emperor out of the way,
all that remains is to kill Don Francisco.

1020
01:00:55,318 --> 01:01:00,015
That will destroy His Highness's
stupid dreams of a treaty with Spain.

1021
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:07,181
Then I'll sail to Austria
and form an alliance with the crown.

1022
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,355
Not the king, just the crown.

1023
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,612
They call me mad,

1024
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:17,032
but one day
when the history of France is written,

1025
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,693
they will mark my name well.

1026
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,533
Sidney Applebaum!

1027
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,632
We're here to see the Emperor.

1028
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,722
Who is calling?

1029
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,799
(SCOFFING)

1030
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,511
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1031
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,314
- Who? Oh, that's droll!
- Droll, yes.

1032
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,693
Apparently, he's not familiar with the list
of the 100 most important "Spanishers."

1033
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,947
Yes! It is only Don Francisco
and his sister.

1034
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,740
Yes, the "Donessa."

1035
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,742
Yes. We have an appointment
with Napoleon.

1036
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,246
Right. Napoleon Bonaparte,
the noted international tyrant.

1037
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:08,208
- You? You are Don Francisco and his sister?
- Oh, for sure.

1038
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,211
- Well, we've had a long, a hot journey.
- A hot journey.

1039
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,504
And our throats are parched.

1040
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:13,922
They're parched.
Our throats, they're parched.

1041
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,758
- Parched! We seek succor. Succor! Succor!
- Yes. Succor! Succor!

1042
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,461
- Yes, is succor here by any chance?
- (MAN CLEARS THROAT)

1043
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,930
I never knew your name, madam.

1044
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:26,560
Oh, uh, the boys usually
just call me Juanita.

1045
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,761
Juanita.

1046
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,522
(IN ACCENT) Juanita.

1047
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:32,232
(CHUCKLES) Juanita.

1048
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,985
The Emperor is a man who
appreciates magnificent women.

1049
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,736
He'll be much taken with you.

1050
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,405
Good! I wore my flats.

1051
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,159
Uh, we are of course all most anxious
to hear your proposal for a treaty.

1052
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,911
Oh, good.
Yes, I've given it a lot of thought

1053
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,913
and I've come up
with all the little details, you know.

1054
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,208
Now if I can just think of
the main points, we got something.

1055
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,128
Well, there is no time for business.
You've had a wearing journey.

1056
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,505
Yes, well, we should say
hello to the Emperor.

1057
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,757
That's right.
Shorts gets touchy if we bypass him.

1058
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,176
There will be time for that later.

1059
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,760
First, you'll be shown your quarters

1060
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,805
and wined and dined in a manner
befitting Spanish nobility.

1061
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,183
Oh, wonderful!
But go easy on the champagne.

1062
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:07,642
- The Donessa has gout.
- (CHUCKLES)

1063
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,937
Well, if you'll proceed,
your needs will be attended to.

1064
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,480
Oh, thank you.

1065
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,442
While you're here with your sister,

1066
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,111
should you desire
a little blonde French love dream

1067
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,697
to be sent to your room,
it will be arranged.

1068
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,576
Good, good. Maybe I'll have two
to keep the symmetry perfect.

1069
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,244
I prefer two myself!

1070
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,539
Hmm, I prefer three,
but it's hard enough to get one.

1071
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,719
This room big enough for you?
Or would you prefer a suite?

1072
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,429
Boris... Boris, I'm scared.

1073
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,431
You're scared?
I'm growing a beak and feathers.

1074
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,100
- What are we gonna do?
- I say we get out of here now!

1075
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,520
I'm not leaving here
until we shoot Napoleon. Here.

1076
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,731
Oh, I see. Thanks! I'm the hitman.

1077
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,943
Remember. You can't take any chances.

1078
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:03,491
Now make sure the barrel of the gun
is pressed against his head or his chest.

1079
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:07,327
And don't pull the trigger, Boris.
Squeeze it.

1080
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,206
Hey, where did you go to finishing school?
On a pirate ship?

1081
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,667
Let's just make sure
our plans are straight.

1082
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,751
Okay, here's one.

1083
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,379
You flirt with him,
bring him back here after dinner,

1084
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,507
lull him into a state of satisfaction,
and I'll shoot him.

1085
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:24,007
"I'll shoot him."
Can you believe I'm talking like this?

1086
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,679
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1087
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,763
Mmm.

1088
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,183
Yes! Yes, Spain is quite warm
this time of year.

1089
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,394
Uh, Barcelona is warmer than Madrid,

1090
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:37,725
but then, the people are so different,
the Barcelonians and the Madridniks.

1091
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,361
Are all the ladies in Spain,
as beautiful as you are, madam?

1092
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,862
(GIGGLES) Oh, well, not all.

1093
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,823
- You've gotta have some beasts.
- Uh-huh.

1094
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:47,701
- (LAUGHING)
- Oh, General! Do excuse me, madam.

1095
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,203
Oh, yes, yes.

1096
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,414
Take it easy, will you?
You're making a fool of yourself.

1097
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,082
- Hey, this is good champagne.
- Yeah?

1098
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,376
Have you had enough,
or are you gonna drink another case?

1099
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,420
I'll be fine.
All I need is a few solids.

1100
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,588
A few solids, huh?
You should drink a blotter!

1101
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:04,342
Oh, I believe I had the pleasure
of meeting your sister once.

1102
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,553
- My sister? Which one?
- (CHUCKLES)

1103
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,639
- I thought you only had one.
- One? One? No.

1104
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,143
Oh, no, no. Actually, well,
I have a half-sister.

1105
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,477
Well, no, not exactly half.

1106
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,896
- It's two-fifths.
- Oh.

1107

MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

1108
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,611
His Imperial Highness,
the Emperor Napoleon.

1109
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,622
So you are Don Francisco!

1110
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,916
Yes, I have regards
from your brother in Spain.

1111
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,668
Says you went away,
you don't write, nothing.

1112
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,545
Comes a Friday night,
he never hears from you.

1113
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,589
You took his razor,
you never returned it.

1114
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,425
- This is an honor for me.
- No, it's a greater honor for me.

1115
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,428
- No, a greater honor for me.
- No, it's a greater honor for me.

1116
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,929
No, a greater honor for me.

1117
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,265
Well, perhaps you are right.
Perhaps it is a greater honor for you.

1118
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,184
And you must be Don Francisco's sister.

1119
01:05:54,284 --> 01:06:00,106
No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.

1120
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,649
No, it's a greater honor for me.

1121
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,361
I see our Spanish guests
have a sense of humor.

1122
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,988
- Yeah, she's a great kidder.
- No, you're a great kidder.

1123
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,865
No, you're Don Francisco's sister.

1124
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,614
- Shall we dine?
- Oh, can we eat first?

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

1126
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:26,087
Your sister and His Highness
seem to be getting along quite well.

1127
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,259
Do you find me attractive as a man?

1128
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,928
Yes! I think that's your best bet.

1129
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,849
How much of your feelings for me are
because I've conquered half of Europe?

1130
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,227
Oh, I'd say half my feelings.
It evens out.

1131
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,313
I wonder if you should be
more difficult to conquer than Russia?

Well, I weigh less.

1133
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,733
I'll go to your room after dinner.

1134
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,731
- Good. I'll go to yours.
- Hmm?

1136
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:01,000
Sonja... Sonja, I've been thinking
about this. It's murder!

1137
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,170
What if everybody acted like this?
It'd be a world full of murderers!

1138
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,839
You know what that would do
to property values?

1139
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,508
I know! And if everybody went
to the same restaurant

1140
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,176
on the same evening
and ordered blintzes,

1141
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,637
there'd be chaos, but they don't.

1142

and she's telling me blintzes.

there is no right or wrong.

- That's right, and I choose danger!

- Oh, really?
- No, but it did sounded great.

Oh, Boris,
if only we could be children again.

Yeah, I know.
Preferably French children.

Do you know the only truly happy person
I know is Berdykov, the village idiot?

Well, it's easy to be happy,
you know, if your one concern in life

01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,500
is figuring out how much
saliva to dribble.

- Give me a number eight.

(GASPS)

1159
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,434
Ugh.

1160
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,279
- Are you alone?
- Of course.

1161
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,781
- I thought I heard voices.
- I was praying.

1162
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,743
- I heard two voices.
- Oh, I do both parts.

1163
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:20,573
- Champagne! From France.
- Oh.

1164
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,787
I see you brought the whole kit.

1165
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,092
(CHUCKLES)

1166
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,892
- To your eyes.
- To the bridge of your nose.

1167
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,942
My lust knows no bounds.
Shall we, to the bed?

1168
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,480
Shall we what to the bed?

1169
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,146
Forgive my haste.

1170
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:58,280
We have always heard
that Spanish blood is the hottest.

1171
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,287
- I had mine cooled for the summer.
- You may set the pace.

1172
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,497
Good, good!

1173
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,458
Why don't we just sit a while
and build slowly?

1174
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,834
You don't wanna peak too early.

1175
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,795
You'll be back in your room
before midnight.

1176
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,588
You are a temptress.

1177
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,632
Oh, please, Excellency.

1178
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,302
- Call me Napoleon.
- Good! You can call me Napoleon, too.

1179
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,346
I've never met a woman like you.

1180
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,849
I could rest my head on your shoulder
like this forever.

1181
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,435
(FAKE LAUGH)
Yes, it sounds like it'd be fun

1182
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,437
except for the grease mark.

1183
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,059
His Excellency.

1184
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,522
Mmm.

1185
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,857

- What's that?
- Oh, just a breeze.

1188
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,534
- Breeze?
- A breeze with mice.

1189
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,327
Mice! What's the difference?

1190
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,289
If I had a woman like you
instead of my wife,

1191
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,867
I would conquer all of Europe.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

1193
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,253
- What's that?
- What... Oh, that? (LAUGHS)

1194
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:53,172
I think that was just
the old closet door slamming shut.

1195
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,382
One can't be too careful.

1196
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:56,843
The Russian underground
would love me dead.

1197
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,922
I take a great chance
in an occupied territory.

1198
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,056
Assassins surround me.

1199
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,935
Every day is another encounter
with death.

1200
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:10,231
Oh, yes, well, this is the price
one pays for political power.

1201
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,609
Yes, life at the top is hell.

1202
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,194
Which is why I relish
every minute with you.

1203
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,318
Every second means something to me.

1204
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,366
That's why the sooner we...

1205
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,537
The sooner we consummate
the act of love the happier I will be.

- Don Francisco!
- Shoot!

1208
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,920
Put down that pistol. She's over 18.

1209
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,590
You're a tyrant and a dictator,
and you start wars!

1210
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,383
Why is he reciting my credits?

1211
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,551
- Kill him!
- Guards!

1212
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,886
No!

Boris, we're not here on a vacation!

1216
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,563
Well, I can't shoot him.
He's a live human being.

1217
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,731
He'll bleed on the carpet.

1218
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,274
Give me that gun!

1219
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,732
- Oh!
- Ah, see? It's not so easy.

1220
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:02,116
- Why? Why can't I do it?
- Because it's morally wrong!

1221
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,118
Oh, I see.
Well, can you define your terms?

1222
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,912
Yes, there's a moral imperative
involved here.

1223
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,413
Yeah, where...
Where's the moral imperative?

1224
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,791
Don't you see? By killing Napoleon,
you're actually killing yourself

1225
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,919
because we were involved
in a kind of total absolute.

1226
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,922
Oh, come on, this isn't a total absolute.
You're being pantheistic again.

1227
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,965
- How is that pantheistic?
- Come on!

1228
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,135
- We all relate universally to a giant oneness.
- Mmm-hmm.

- Oh, you wanna hit him?

1230
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,347
He's coming to again.
Just give him a little shot.

1231

- (SLAMS)
- Yeah, good.

1232
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,517
You see, we're dealing
with an ethical question here.

1233
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,269
Oh, come on, Boris! You're not
gonna quote Thomas Aquinas again.

1234
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,397
Absolutely, where he said,
"You must never kill a man

1235
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,065
"particularly if it means
taking his life."

01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,863
- What's the matter?
- Don't you see?

1238
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,574
And if we don't stop him,
he'll burn down half of Europe!

1239
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,494
Well, maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll
do the half with our landlord in it.

1240
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,996
- Boris! For our children.
- We don't have children.

1241
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,082
- Then for our parents.
- They don't have children, either.

1242
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,625
Well, I'm going back
and I'm gonna kill him!

1243
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,751
- Sonja!
- I am.

1244
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,002
No!

1245
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:58,547
All right. Look. Pull the carriage
out front. I'll go kill him.

1246
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,807
Look at him.

1247
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,886
If I don't kill him,
he'll make war all through Europe.

1248
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,221
But murder.

1249
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,806
What would Socrates say?

1250
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,064
All those Greeks were homosexuals.

1251
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:22,021
Boy, they must've had some wild parties.

1252
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:25,700
I bet they all took a house together
on Crete for the summer.

1253
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,369
A, Socrates is a man.

1254
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,830
B, all men are mortal.

1255
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,541
C, all men are Socrates.

1256
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,828
That means all men are homosexuals.

1257
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,038
Oh, I'm not a homosexual.

1258
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,633
(SCOFFS)
Once, some Cossacks whistled at me.

1259
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:47,847
I happen to have the kind of body
that excites both persuasions.

1260
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,767
But, uh, you know,
some men are heterosexual

1261
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,140
and some men are bisexual

1262
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:58,399
and some men don't think about sex
at all, you know. They become lawyers.

1263
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,694
My problem is that
I see both sides of every issue.

1264
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,362
I'm too logical.

1265
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,697
You know, I...

1266
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,033
The world is not logical.

1267
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:11,162
If it was logical, how would Old Nehamkin
be younger than Young Nehamkin, huh?

1268
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:14,123
I knew there was something crazy
about that when I was a kid

1269
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,452
but every time I said something,
they'd smack me, so, you know...

1270
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:23,549
I'm just racked with guilt
and I'm consumed with remorse

1271
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:27,094
and stricken with suffering
for the human race.

1272
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:31,140
Not only that, but I'm developing
a herpes on my lip here

1273
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,892
that is really killing me.

(STAMMERING)

1275
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,262
Oh, what to do!

1276
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,331
Arrest this man for murder!
Fortunately, he only killed an impostor.

1277
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,209
I didn't do anything.
Hey, take it easy, will you?

1278
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,377
You're bending my throat.

1279
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,964
The Spanish government
will hear about this!

1280
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:06,092
Don Francisco is not a man
who takes these things lightly.

1281
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:11,799
Oh, there's Don Francisco now.
There's been a mistake. I know. I made it.

01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,451
Remember that nice boy next door?
Raskolnikov?

1288
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,074
- Yeah.
- He killed two ladies.

1289
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,373
No! What a nasty story.

1290
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,958
Bobick told it to me.

1291
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,627
He heard it from
one of the Karamazov brothers.

1292
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,462
Oh, he must have been possessed.

1293
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,258
- Well, he was a raw youth.
- Raw youth? He was an idiot.

1294
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,510
And he acted insulted and injured!

1295
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,637
Well, I hear he was a gambler.

1296
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:56,138
- You know, he could be your double!
- Oh, really? How novel.

1297
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:02,648
Son, for long years, I have
saved this piece of land for you.

1298
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,650
Look. It has a house on it.

1299
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,026
It's a nice little house, too.
You haven't wasted your life, I see.

1300
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:12,033
Don't let any strangers come on it.

1301
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:16,830
No. No strangers.
You're a major loon, you know that?

1302
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,207
- Next year...
- Yes?

1303
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:25,463
- I expect to build a guest house.
- Oh, a little tiny guest house

1304
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:30,676
with a handball court, and a little,
swimming pool for fleas or something.

1305
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:35,052
Yes, well, you'll want to get some rest
in your rubber bedroom now.

And at the last minute
before the execution,

01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,843
the Emperor plans to pardon you.

01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,388
Really?

01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,933
He will make a great personal show
of his generosity

1316

and you will have learned your lesson.

01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,951
smeared on his gums in abundance

1323
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:49,338
and he shall dwell in the house
of the Lord for six months

1324
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,634
with an option to buy.
But the wicked man...

1325
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,846
The wicked man shall have
all kinds of problems.

1326
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:00,057
His tongue shall cleave
to the roof of his upper palate

1327
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:03,477
and he shall speak like a woman,
if you watch him closely.

1328
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,813
And he shall... He shall...

1329
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:09,400
The wicked man shall be delivered
into the hands of his enemy

1330
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,111
whether they can pay
the delivery charge or not.

1331
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,656
And... And... Wait, I have more
about the wicked man.

1332
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,486
I shall walk through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death.

1333
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,455
In fact, now that I think of it,

1334
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,666
I shall run through
the Valley of the Shadow of Death

1335
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,502
'cause you get out of the valley
quicker that way.

1336
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:32,715
And he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart

1337
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,300
is okay in my book.

1338
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,803
But he that fools around

1339
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:42,266
with barnyard animals
has gotta be watched.

1340
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,683
I thank you.

1341
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,021
All right, Grushenko, come on, let's go.

1342
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,320
You guys are late.
I've been waiting here since 6:30.

1343
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,821
You're awfully cheerful.

1344
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,032
Yeah, you know how it is
when you're extra brave.

1345
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,700
Probably not.

1346
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,538
Busy day, huh?
Are you guys having a sale?

1347
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,548
Oh, no blindfold. That's for losers.

1348
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,802
I like to see where the bullet hits.
I learned that during the war.

1349
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:20,471
I was decorated, you know. Yeah.

1350
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:23,345
(EXHALES)
Wonder what the Emperor's doing today.

1351
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,059
Ready.

1352
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,393
You guys want to move a little closer?

1353
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:29,267
You don't wanna miss, you, know.
Looks bad on the report.

1354
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,856
- Aim.
- Uh...

1355
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,484
Boy, the Emperor's
really cutting it close.

1356
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,528
What a flair for the dramatic.

1357
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,526
That old sly boots.

1358
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,315
Fire!

1359
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,286
It's a very complicated situation,
Cousin Sonja.

1360
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,415
I'm in love with Alexi. He loves Alicia.

1361
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,961
Alicia's having an affair with Lev.

1362
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,630
Lev loves Tatiana.

1363
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,798
Tatiana loves Simkin.

1364
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,384
Simkin loves me.

1365
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:04,097
I love Simkin, but in a
different way than Alexi.

1366
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,094
Alexi loves Tatiana like a sister.

1367
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:12,516
Tatiana's sister loves Trigorian
like a brother.

1368
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,610
Trigorian's brother is having an affair
with my sister,

1369
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,781
whom he likes physically,
but not spiritually.

1370
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,575
Natasha, it's getting a little late.

1371
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,828
The firm of Mishkin and Mishkin

1372
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:29,032
is sleeping with
the firm of Taskov and Taskov.

1373
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,747
(SIGHS) Natasha, to love is to suffer.

1374
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,792
To avoid suffering, one must not love.

1375
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,215
But then one suffers from not loving.

1376
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:42,553
Therefore, to love is to suffer,
not to love is to suffer,

1377
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:47,141
to suffer is to suffer.
To be happy is to love.

1378
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:51,478
To be happy, then, is to suffer,
but suffering makes one unhappy.

1379
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:55,065
Therefore, to be unhappy one must love,

1380
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:58,027
or love to suffer,
or suffer from too much happiness.

1381
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,070
I hope you're getting this down.

1382
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,990
I never want to marry.

1383
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,995
I just want to get divorced.

1384
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,449
Oh, look! Look, it's Boris.

1385
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:18,414
Boris! Boris, what happened?

1386
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,925
- I got screwed.
- How?

1387
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,135
I don't know. Some vision came and said

1388
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,554
that I was gonna get pardoned,
and they shot me.

1389
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,265
You were my one great love.

1390
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:32,770
Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate that.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dead.

1391
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,482
- What's it like?
- Uh, what's it like? Uh...

1392
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,400
You know the chicken
at Tresky's restaurant?

1393
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,193
- Yeah.
- It's worse.

1394
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,193
(SIGHS)

1395
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,328
Worse than the chicken at Tresky's.

1396
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,077
Oh, well, life must go on.

1397
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,334
The last traces of the shimmering dusk

1398
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,788
are setting behind
the quickly darkening evening

1399
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,214
and it's only noon.

1400
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,553
Soon we shall be covered by wheat.

1401
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:10,099
Did you say, "Wheat"?

1402
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,930
BOTH: Wheat.

1403
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:17,773
Wheat. I'm dead,
they're talking about wheat.

1404
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,227
The question is,
have I learned anything about life?

1405
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,736
Only that... Only that human beings
are divided into mind and body.

1406
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,367
The mind embraces
all the nobler aspirations,

1407
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,695
like poetry and philosophy,

1408
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,247
but the body has all the fun.

1409
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:34,498
(SIGHS)

1410
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,793
The important thing, I think,
is not to be bitter.

1411
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:42,214
You know, if it turns out that there is a God,
I don't think that He's evil.

1412
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,466
I think that the worst
you could say about Him

1413
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,177
is that basically He's an underachiever.

1414
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:51,181
(EXHALES) After all, you know,
there are worse things in life than death.

1415
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,435
I mean, if you've ever spent an evening
with an insurance salesman,

1416
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,763
you know exactly what I mean.

1417
01:21:56,995 --> 01:22:00,733
The key here, I think,
is to not think of death as an end,

1418
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,153
but think of it more
as a very effective way

1419
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,776
of cutting down on your expenses.

1420
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,657
Regarding love... (SCOFFS)

1421
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,659
You know, what can you say?

1422
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:15,247
It's not the quantity
of your sexual relations that count.

1423
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,082
It's the quality.

1424
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:21,587
On the other hand, if the quantity drops
below once every eight months,

1425
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,131
I would definitely look into it.

1426
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:29,261
Well, that's about it for me, folks.
Goodbye.

1427
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,763
