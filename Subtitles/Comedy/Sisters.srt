You scored yourself a
nice corner. Good job.

00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,671
Hi. I'm Maura Ellis.

4
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:59,772
I'm not part of a
religious group or anything.

5
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:03,143
I'm just a nurse who likes
to give back on her days off.

6
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:05,112
You know, when you're living outdoors,

7
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,946
skin cancer is a real concern.

8
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,714
So I got you some sunscreen,

9
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,550
and you, my friend, have
some irregular moles.

10
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,452
You're a very friendly person.

11
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,755
Wanna come to my house and take a shower?

12
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,023
Maybe make a list of goals?

13
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:18,824
Oh, I have a girlfriend.

14
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:20,860
Great. It's important to have
a lady out there in the street.

15
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:23,529
What do you call it, a
road bitch or something?

16
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,663
Her name's Karen.

17
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:26,732
Your little mama? Your street wife?

18
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,901
(SIGHS) Anyway,

19
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:29,403
I'm pretty good with sayings,

20
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:33,874
so I make these cards for my sister,
but I think maybe you could use one.

21
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:37,109
Without the dark night, we
would never see the bright stars.

22
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,412
Is this from <i>Twilight?</i>

23
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:39,478
No, I made it up.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
Mmm, no, you didn't.

25
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:41,948
Yeah, I did.

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,817
See you later.

27
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:44,918
Wait.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,485
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:47,720
Hey!

30
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,156
You're not homeless?

31
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,589
You were on a roll.

32
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,991
Well, give me back the sunscreen

33
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,993
so I can give it to an
actual homeless person!

34
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,162
Like this lady.

35
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:58,865
Fuck off! I'm the manager here.

- Okay.

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,524
Can you guys both sit in front
of the camera when you talk

47
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,727
so that I can see you and
hear you at the same time?

- <i>We don't get this Skype crap.</i>
- There's nothing to get.

- You're doing it.
- DEANNA: <i>Maura,</i>

Yeah, okay. Funny joke. What's the news?

00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,619
<i>We are. We're selling it.</i>

58
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:54,086

59
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:55,187
Are you selling it to each other?

60
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:56,655
<i>No, honey.</i>

61
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,024
- Why would you do that?
- DEANNA: <i>We don't want it anymore.</i>

blow it is they color your hair

00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,918
- but they leave your Santa eyebrows.
- Hmm.

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,987
They half-ass it, but I'm a perfectionist.

85
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,288
Thank you.

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,225
So why are we covering
this gray today, Phil?

87
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:09,796
Well, I have a date with an engaging
new gal, somewhat younger than me.

88
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:12,097
Good for you, because ladies
your age are gross, right?

89
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,234
Well, I just hope it looks
natural. It smells very strong.

90
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,870
No. It's super gentle. They
use it on pageant babies.

91

00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:36,822
I've only been gone a month, and
I stopped growing a long time ago.

99
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:38,591
Um, is this supposed to be getting warm?

Why are you doing some
guy's hair in the bathroom?

Why aren't you doing it in a salon?

Please don't tell me
you quit your job again.

108
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,106
I didn't quit! All right.

109
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,041
You know that dipshit
lady on Channel Eleven

110
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,010
who does the segments
where she tries new things?

111
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:00,312
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, she wanted bangs,

112
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,949
but then afterwards she decided
that she didn't want bangs.

113
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,817
And my manager started bitching me out,

114
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,320
so I shoved him and his
American Girl Doll glasses broke.

115
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,788
Okay. So you got fired.

116
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,690
Why do you keep doing this, Mom?

117
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,093
You wanna have a cereal party?

118
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,997
No, I don't. I want you to be
responsible so that I don't have to be.

119
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,365
It is too stressful

120
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,901
sleeping with you on a pull-out
couch in your friend's dining room.

121
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,836
She is not my friend. She was our bug man.

122
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:26,238
I need to learn to be more irresponsible

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,709
otherwise I'm going to be
hazed so bad in college.

124

It's bubbling like Pop Rocks.

00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:32,077
- I'm gonna stay at Annie's house again.
- All right.

126
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,781
Okay, that's a lie because Annie
is in Italy with her family.

127
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,117
I know how to use Facebook.

128
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,019
I will keep sending you pictures
so that you know that I'm safe.

129
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,122
No. You cannot just leave again
and not tell me where you are.

130
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,390
You know why I don't
tell you where I'm going?

131
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:47,360
Because you'll show up there and
you'll make a big scene like a hothead!

132
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,130
I am not a hothead! I am brassy.

133
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:53,433
I love you, Mom, but your life
is just too chaotic right now.

134
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,570
- It is not chaotic.
- DANA: Kate!

135
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,772
Is this your waxing strip?

136
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,007
I don't know, Dana. It must be a client's.

137
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,743
My dog had this in his feces.

138
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,211
- (WHIMPERS)
- And before I could stop him

139
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,914
he ate the poop with the
waxing strip in it again.

140
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,117
- And then he threw that up.
- Okay.

141
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,920
You know how many times a day
I kiss that dog on the mouth?

142
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,387
An unsettling amount.

143
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,423
Now when I kiss him,

144
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,293
I'm gonna picture that he ate

145
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,995
some stranger's pubes.

146
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,231
And it's gonna affect
my relationship with him.

147
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,800
KATE: Oh, boy.

148
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,067
All right. Let's bring
this in for a landing, Dana.

149
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,902

- Where the hell am I gonna go?
- (BARKING)

152
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,009
You wanna explain that to my daughter?

- Haley?

Haley!

Okay, Haley, just come back
up, and we will talk about this.

158
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,921
Hey, it's me.

159
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,724
Hello? This is very unprofessional.

160
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,325
Hey. I can't talk right now.

161
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,793
Real quick. Mom and Dad called.

162
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,128
Ugh, what now?

163
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,997
What's up? Everything all right?

164
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,200
- No, I don't need lotion in there.
- (SHUSHES)

165
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,836
Yeah, you do need lotion in there.

166
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,771
Hey, here's something fun.

167
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:07,005
Mom and Dad want us to come down.

168
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,743
<i>They need us to clear out
some of our old bedroom stuff.</i>

169
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,444
Why? They have other rooms.

170
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:14,147
MAURA: <i>I don't know. Maybe
they wanna get a treadmill.</i>

171
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,819
(SCOFFS) A treadmill? Mom
can't even sit right on a couch.

507
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:56,087
Oh, and you can invite
that cute neighbor guy

508
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,456
and you can finally have
sex in your old, crappo bed!

509
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,357
Yeah, but he's younger than me.

510
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,793
Yeah, but he's taller than you,
and that's all that matters.

511
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:03,394
Oh, my God. I need this
night to reset myself!

512
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,797
(YELLING) We are having a party!

513
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,469
(BOTH YELLING)

514
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,205

515
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:15,440
(LAUGHS)

516
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,978
(CLOCKS CHIMING)

517
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,219
(MUMBLES) How'd you sleep?

518
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,955
I dreamt I had no job and no place to live.

519
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:30,956
Oh, wait.

520
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,159
- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)
- Got a picture from Haley.

521
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:36,495
Well, Her friend has a
fancy-ass fireplace in her house.

522
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:39,363
MAURA: No, it's one of
those Cosi Sandwich Shops.

523
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,535
- (VEHICLE APPROACHING)
- Oh. Who the crap is that?

524
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:46,838
MAURA: Are those the new owners?

525
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,007
- KATE: Ew. Fuck my life.
- MAURA: Gross!

526
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,909
MRS. GEERNT: I want the
front yard to be open-concept.

527
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:52,844
MR. GEERNT: That old tree has gotta go.

528
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,748
Oh, you just try to take down our
sister tree, you stupid stinkbug!

529
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,449
KATE: I can smell that
bitch's hairspray from here.

530
00:23:58,451 --> 00:24:01,519
No, they can't fucking roll in
here like Jehovah's Witnesses!

531
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:03,089
- (MAURA STAMMERS)
- KATE: Rude.

532
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,357
What?

533
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,227
- Can we help you?
- Yes.

534
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,394
Our secretary didn't tell us
that we had an appointment.

535
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:13,231
Oh, I'm Patrick Campbell.
This is Jane and Henry Geernt.

536
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,433
They're relocating from New
York City and buying this house.

537
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:18,003
So, are you their interpreter?

538
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:20,439
If so, please tell them hello for us.

539
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:23,307
They just want to see what these
blues look like on the sun porch.

540
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,209
- What do you mean? Sun porch?
- PATRICK: Mmm-hmm.

541
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,179
Are you even old enough to get a mortgage?

542
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:29,914
Oh, yes. But we're buying it with cash.

543
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:33,117
You're painting the sun porch? No.

544
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,388
It's a little "country" for us.

545
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,324
Can you let your parents know that if
things like this aren't fixed by Monday,

546
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:43,528
we're gonna have a real issue
following through with the sale.

547
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,396
- (STAMMERS)
- Yeah. That won't be okay.

548
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:46,565
I got a question.

549
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,901
What percentage of your
wardrobe is dry clean only?

550
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,170
Seventy-eight?

551
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:53,037
You know there was a murder here, right?

552
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,873
No. What? I don't.

553
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,307
Major cult stuff. Yeah.

554
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,276
What, like a mass murder?

555
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:00,444
- Seven?
- Okay.

556
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:01,513
Seven sets of twins.

557
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:03,849
- So, 14.
- I'm sorry. What?

558
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:05,049
You know your cousin's gay, right?

559
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,450
That's not my cousin. That's my husband.

560
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:08,253
That's your husband?

561
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,988
You're gonna have some surprising
shit go down in about 10 years.

562
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,123
Blue?

563
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,927
What would possess a person
to paint stained wood blue?

564
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,995
What, were you raised on a tugboat?

565
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:20,298
I'll drop off the paint later.
Unless you'll be day-napping.

566
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,636
We sleep with our eyes open, like sharks.

567

568
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,508
MAURA: Smell you later.

569
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,477
KATE: What kind of last name is Geernt?

570
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,180
Geernt. Sounds like a queef on a yoga ball.

571
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:38,185
Yeah. More like the last sound you
hear before you shit your pants.

572
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,552
- (YELLS) Oh, my God.
- (GASPS) Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:41,620
(BOTH LAUGH)

574
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:44,825
MAURA: Okay. Let's start
working on those invites.

575
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:58,003
Okay, let's see who we got. Okay.

576
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:01,006
- KATE: Vicka Bastione.
- MAURA: Yeah.

577
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:04,042
No on Alex. He's always
on. It's annoying as fuck.

578
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:06,510
I know. He breaks my heart.
He wants to be funny, though.

579
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:08,947
Yeah, well, people in
hell want ice water, too.

580
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:11,949
KATE: Brinda is a hard no.

581
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,018
That monster and her
minions are not coming.

582
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,152
Why is she a monster?

583
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,555
KATE: She knows what she did.

584
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:18,055
Okay. Rob and Liz!

585
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:20,459
KATE: They used to have
sex in the weirdest places.

586
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:22,960
MAURA: He took her from
behind in line at graduation.

587
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:25,963
They could use a party.
They are terminally suburban.

588
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,466
KATE: Kelly. That bitch is fun.

589
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,533
- Yeah.
- Kelly is fun!

590
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,535
Kelly is fun.

591
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:33,274
(CLICKING)

592
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,179
So, we should go! We have so much to do.

593
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,047
You have to invite that cute
guy from down the street.

594
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:46,686
Mmm. Maybe. I don't know. We'll see.

595
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,601
Have a great day, Fran.

596
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:04,702
Oh, my God. It's Brinda.

597
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,005
KATE: Ugh...

598
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,074
Brinda always looks like she
has a fart coming out sideways.

599
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:13,444
I feel bad that we didn't invite her.
I hate it when people aren't included.

600
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,013
Oh, God. What if she asks
us to come to the party?

601
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,515
I'm not gonna be able
to say no to her face.

602
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,616
You know I can't reject people.
I have a dog with one eye.

603
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:20,084
Here she comes. She's coming
close. She's right here.

604
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:21,652
She's almost here. She's here now.

605
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:23,521
Hey, Brinda. What up?

606
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:25,990
Well, well, well.

607
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,326
I thought I saw the Ellis sisters.

608
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:31,063
Hey, Brinda. What have you been up to?

609
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:33,731
Not much. Just, you
know, building a career.

610
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:38,536
Being successful and having a
really full and wonderful life.

611
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,538
I'm very blessed.

612
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,574
I'm sure you've seen around town,
I'm a pretty successful realtor now.

613
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:46,244
I'm plastered all over the bus stops.

614
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:47,578
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

615
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,015
I thought you were missing. I
saw your picture on the bus stop.

616
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,350
I just assumed you were missing.

617
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,085
And you? What are you up to? Nothing?

618
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,153
What are you buying? Stool softener?

619
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,422
No. Actually, um, Diet Coke.

620
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:00,624
Don't you look great. That's a snazzy belt.

621
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,361
Oh, thank you!

622
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:05,296
Yeah, congrats on your
wrestling championship.

623
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,465
It's Ralph Lauren.

624
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,499
- Is that how you say it?
- Uh, yeah.

625
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,001
Do you get good Wi-Fi with that?

626
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,170
So I see you're having a party.

627
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:13,572
I mean, we're just kind of picking...

628
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,172
- Yep. Having a party.
- Yeah.

629
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,342
I heard you were having a party.

630
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,745
From someone who got invited.

631
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,646
You were on our list, but
you're very hard to track down.

632
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:24,048
MAURA: Are you on email?

633
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,551
Uh, it's
B-dot-rinda...

634
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:29,187
That's what I did wrong. I forgot the dot.

635
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:30,488
- And we forgot to type it.
- (STAMMERING)

636
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,490
And also we didn't send it.

637
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:34,226
(CHUCKLES) I must admit,

638
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:36,193
when I heard you were
having an Ellis Island party

639
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,497
I was like, "What? What year is it?"

640
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,099
It's pretty sad.

641
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,837
You know, because it's
such a desperate event.

642
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,874
(LAUGHS) Bye.

643
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,410
You're a desperate event!

644
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:53,077
I can still hear you!

645
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,546
KATE: Good. Can you hear this?

646
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,248
Suck a fucking bag of dicks!

647
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,482
She can't hear that.

648
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:00,117
KATE: Strutting around Big
Lots like it's Bloomingdale's

649
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,553
in her bullshit shoes.

650
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:04,389
Real estate bitch acting like Suze Orman.

651
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:06,824
You know what she has?
Crabs in her eyebrows.

652
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:09,193
Tumbleweeds rolling across her beav.

653
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,229
I am done wasting words on that ho.

654
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:15,400
- I'm sorry, Vicky.
- Don't apologize for me.

655
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:18,103
Is Vicky your real name?

656
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,074
What's your Korean name?

657
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:24,776
(WHISPERS) Hae-Won.

658
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:27,746
Hae-Won. What a beautiful
name. What does that mean?

659
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:29,280
Hae-Won mean "head."

660
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:31,716
Oh.

661
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,652
Hae-Won? Am I saying it correctly?

662
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:35,853
Hae-Won.

663
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,622
Oh, Hae-Won.

664
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,757
No. Hae-Won.

665
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,226
Hae-Won.

666
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:44,362
Not Hae-Won.
Hae-Won.

667
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,698
- Hae-Won.
- No. Hae-Won.

668
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,632
- Hae-Won.
- Hae-Won.

669
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:51,402
- Hae-Won.
- Hae-Won.

670
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,572
I feel like I'm saying it right. No?

671
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm too high. (DEEP
VOICE) Hae-Hae-Won.

672
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,209
Yes.

673
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,744
It's not coming out right, but I'll get it.

674
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:02,581
Like, "I'm having fun at party."

675
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,784
"Hey." Plus "one."

676
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:08,786
Hey one.

677
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,455
- So you like parties.
- HAE-WON: Yes.

678
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:11,555
Hmm.

679
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:14,325
- Your name?
- Oh, my name is Maura.

680
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,794
Maura.

681
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:17,295
Watch me. Maura.

682
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,763
(GROWLING) Maura.

683
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:21,399
I don't open my mouth like
that. (CHUCKLES) Just, Maura.

684
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,633
Maura.

685
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,803
It's not Maura.

686
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,439
You see the difference in my mouth? Maura.

687
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,640
(GROWLING) Maura.

688
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:30,142
We have different mouths.

689
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,045
It's okay.

690
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:38,549
Why do they always have to give
them American names? It's so sad.

691
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,686
I bet Nail Pimp Daddy over there
treats them like his whores.

692
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:43,889
- We need to get Lucy Liu to go under...
- Lisa Ling.

693
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:47,292
Lisa Ling to go undercover and
investigate these dirty-ass nail salons.

694
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:50,761
But they are hiring and you
are licensed to do nails.

695
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,797
I don't wanna work here. They
have a bass in their aquarium.

696
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,601
It's beautiful here.
Everything smells like lavender.

697
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:58,937
Plus, you could teach them a
lot, because you know your shit.

698
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,771
I do know my shit.

699
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:03,509
I could French manicure a
chicken while it was running away.

700
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,878
Guess I could get something
better once we're settled, right?

701
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,382
Exactly! And then just wait
until you get that better job

702
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,717
before you quit this one.

703
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,421
I'm open to new ways.

704
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,957
(SIGHS) So, do you like working here?

705
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,061
I love it.

706
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:23,827
Do you get proper lunch breaks?

707
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:25,963
What is lunch?

708
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:28,199
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

709
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,567
Hey.

710
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,569
Thank you so much for
this. This is a great place.

711
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,873
NAIL SALON OWNER: Of course.

712
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,045
So, uh, I see you're hiring.

713
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:42,948
Oh, we are not hiring right now.

714
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,683
You just got a big old sign.

715
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:49,554
Hey, Hae-Won. Would you like
to come to a party tonight?

716
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:51,555
You and your friends come, okay?

717
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:52,958
To do nail?

718
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,427
Oh, no. No, no, no. Party?

719
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:56,728
You can bring whoever you want.

720
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,264
Party, yes.

721
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,665
- Sojus.
- Jews.

722
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,001
- Soju there?
- Sure. There'll be Jews there.

723
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:07,271
I love jus. Koreans love jus.

724
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,440
Koreans love Jews.

725
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,307
- I love jus.
- I love Jews, too.

726
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:11,543
Jus.

727
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,511
Adam is thinking of coming,
and Gabe is on the fence, so...

728
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,613
Soju.

729
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:18,783
I'm worried we aren't
talking about the same thing.

730
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:20,719
- Juice. Drinking juice.
- HAE-WON: Jus.

731
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,254
You stupid.

732
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,689
There'll be juice there. There'll be
food there. There'll be Jews there.

733
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:26,658
- Okay. Yes.
- Great.

734
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,526
Okay, listen. My daughter
and I are moving to Orlando

735
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,729
and I really need a job.

736
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:34,066
Oh, no.

737
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:39,770
Okay, look. Just smile and shake
my hand like you gave me a job

738
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,472
and I will text you a picture of my boobs.

739
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:43,607
Real good ones. High and happy.

740
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,376
No? I misread your deal.

741
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:46,577
Smile and shake my hand

742
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,947
(WHISPERING) or I will text
you a picture of my boobs,

743
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:50,481
and I know you don't wanna see them.

744
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:52,383
(CHUCKLES)

745
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:54,686
Awesome! Thank you, Vicky.

746
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:57,788
I will see you on Monday.

747
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,958
Boom! I got a job.

748
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,994
And look what I pulled out of your
wallet. "Success is desire in action."

749
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:04,763
Amazing! You're crushing it!

750
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:06,064
Whoo!

751
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,365
KATE: We need to cancel
dinner with Mom and Dad.

752
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,468
What if we lie to Mom and Dad
and then they die in their sleep?

753
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,569
Don't let them smell your guilt.

754
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,072
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

755
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,472
Girls.

756
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,642
Hey, Mom, we are doing
so much work over there

757
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:20,478
and doing nothing else,
and I am telling the truth.

758
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Well.

759
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:26,317
I was just, um, putting the
silverware in the drawers here.

760
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,452
Hey, we can't have dinner tonight.

761
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:33,591
Yeah, because we're in such packing
mode we don't wanna stop our groove.

762
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,362
Sounds good!

763
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,774
Oh.

764
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,609
No. We've...

765
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:52,977
Okay!

766
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,845
- KATE: Bye.
- We're leaving!

767
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:57,015
Did we just cock block our parents?

768
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,682
They were fresh off the sex griddle.

769
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:00,786
There was so much color in her face.

770
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:05,957
Hey, see you tonight! You know, I'm
laying down a bread base. (CHUCKLES)

771
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,125
So I wanna stop by Sam and
Cray's house, real quick.

772
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,894
Oh, I haven't seen those
homos since high school!

773
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,862
I know.

774
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,865
They said that we could borrow those
cool chairs they had at their wedding.

775
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:16,501
Gays know how to throw a party.

776
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:19,737
Go to Costco, get a pan of hot wings.

777
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,972
Get some big, basic salamis.

778
00:34:21,974 --> 00:34:24,708
Or just make a fuckload of potato salad.

779
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,043
With Tostitos Scoops.

780
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:29,046
It's like a spoon you can eat.

781
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:33,617
Obviously, it's the gay men
who have the great party ideas.

782
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,887
I wish being gay was a choice because I
always did like that shorts and boots look.

783
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,789
Yeah, I don't know.

784
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,492
For me, the deal breaker might
be the eating of the pussy.

785
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:43,762
Oh, really? Because for me it would just
be the fucking unbearable amount of talking.

786
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:45,498
Bye, guys!

787
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:49,201
(EASY LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING)

788
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:54,104
Hmm, what do you think, Brayla?

789
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:56,508
That looks amazing on you.

790
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,809
I never met a Brayla before.

791
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:00,478
I know, like, three.

792
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,148
Oh, so you're trending. God bless.

793
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,851
You know, it's a lot of under teat
but I think I'm getting away with it.

794
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:10,289
Also it's, um, on backwards.

795
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,126
- You think?
- Yeah.

796
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,728
How's it going in there?

797
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,796
I don't get this dress.

798
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:21,865
One of my apples keeps
rolling out of the bag.

799
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,836
But I like the story it
tells with the fringe.

800
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,637
You're gonna have to rock
a thong with this, though.

801
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,673
Oh, no, I don't wear thongs.
I have a very fussy taint.

802
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:32,110
You just have to build up
a callus. Right, Brayla?

803
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:34,579
That looks amazing on you.

804
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,215
I worry that she just wants the
sale. She's not telling us the truth.

805
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:40,918
- No. Brayla has no pleasure center in her brain.

are you?

HALEY: <i>You can trust me.</i>

809
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,126
I am at a friend's house.

810
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,161
<i>So I got your text message</i>

811
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:53,597
about moving in with Gram and
Gramps, and you know I love Orlando.

812
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,934
I'm super excited about this!

813
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,969
Yeah, you know what? I was
real excited about it, too,

814
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:01,039
and it turns out that Gram and
Gramps are selling their house.

815
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,673
Oh...

816
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,844
Okay, I like that it has a strong message,

817
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:08,012
but I am afraid that I'm
gonna zip my bush up in there.

818
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:13,050
We can still make Orlando happen.
I promise, I will find another way.

819
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:15,153
Don't be upset.

820
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,720
Okay, give it to me.

821
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,789
- Hey, honey. It's Maura.
- Hey.

822
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,958
Listen, your mom forgot to tell
you the most important part,

823
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,496
which is that she got a job out
here at a very fancy nail salon.

824
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:26,930
- Really?
- MAURA: <i>Yes.</i>

00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:28,499
Try something on.

826
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:33,570
So I think maybe you should come here
earlier next week, and surprise her.

00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:34,905
She really misses you.

Aunt Maura, I don't know. I don't know.

Haley, I know I said that I was
going to help you for a while,

830
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,646

back with your mother.

Okay. But what should I do with Polenta?

MAURA: <i>The dog-sitter's
number is on the counter.</i>

Use my credit card, and
get a flight, and come here.

It's gonna work this
time, honey, I promise.

I don't know about that one.

something in return for the money,

and I don't want you to think that
this loan is contingent on that,

960
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,965
but I will say that if you don't do it,

961
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,934

at Disney and he was coming.

I narced because he made me!

1834
01:20:49,193 --> 01:20:51,226
How? How did he even know?

1835
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:54,495
Because when I found out that
I wasn't invited to your party

1836
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:58,767
it hurt me so very deep,
that I threw up really hard.

1837
01:20:58,769 --> 01:21:01,337
Why didn't you invite me?

1838
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:05,540
(SQUEALS) Why?

1839
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:07,808
I was kind and clean!

1840
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,343
And I got mostly B's!

1841
01:21:09,345 --> 01:21:10,611
I know, I cheated off you.

1842
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:13,482
And then you decided that I was a "no."

1843
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:16,585
And then everybody
decided that I was a "no"!

1844
01:21:16,587 --> 01:21:19,955
And then guess who
decided that I was a "no"?

1845
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:21,522

1846
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:23,592

1847
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:29,531
So, I have decided that
tonight I deserve to be here.

1848
01:21:29,533 --> 01:21:33,268
Tonight, I am a "yes."

1849
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,937

1855
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:49,284
Your vagina?

1856
01:21:49,286 --> 01:21:50,384
No.

1857
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:52,787
The saddest part

1858
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:55,691
is that you and I used to
have a blast in grade school.

1859
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:58,259

Your first instinct is gonna be

01:37:29,626 --> 01:37:31,625
just to go to sleep and
deal with it in the morning,

2202
01:37:31,627 --> 01:37:32,727
but don't do that.

- I got a ladder.
- Kate!

2204
01:37:33,863 --> 01:37:34,928
- Is it cold?
- KATE: Yes, it's fucking cold!

2205
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,429
- Hush!
- It looks cold.

2206
01:37:36,431 --> 01:37:39,166
Everyone's distracted by
the emergency right now.

2207
01:37:39,168 --> 01:37:41,602
I wanna be balls deep in joy.

2208
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:43,537
Then be in it.

01:37:43,539 --> 01:37:45,339

- Okay, I got you.
- BUCKY: We got the ladder.

2214

- Kate!
- Come on up the ladder.

2215
01:37:57,186 --> 01:37:58,585
We can do this together, all right?

- KATE: It's the only way out.

- Look, there's Gramps.
- Oh, you're not gonna slip, honey.

- Come on.
- I can't, I can't.

them. I need all your carabiners!

here, before I call your children!
