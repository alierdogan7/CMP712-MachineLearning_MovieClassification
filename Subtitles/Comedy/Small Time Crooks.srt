<i>#</i> Oh, baby,
what I couldn't do, ooh

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,470
<i>#</i> With plenty of money
and you, ooh

3
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,236
<i>#</i> In spite of the worry
that money brings

4
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,155
<i>#</i> Just a little filthy lucre
buys a lot of things

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,030
<i>#</i> And I could take you
to places you'd like to go

6
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,513
<i>#</i> But outside of that
I've no use for dough

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,075

- May I help you?

12
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,559
I'm looking for
a box of chocolates.

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,631
Something fancy, if you have it.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,631
- Is it a gift?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,393
I want something fancy
and not too rich,

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,109
because she tends to put on
a little blubber, the wife.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,077
- Uh-huh.
- On the thighs.

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,799
What about this one?
It's kinda rich.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,348
- It's from Belgium.
- Er, from Belgium?

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,793
- It's very pretty.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,158
Hey, Frenchy, I'm home!

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,832
(Woman ) Who's that?

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,708
Who do ya... It's the Pope!
I wanted to see your apartment.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,759
- Who comes home every night?!
- I'm watching Princess Diana.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,718
Again? How many times
you gonna do that?

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,518
Look at those clothes.

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,479
I told you time and again,
she got all that stuff discount.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,789
It's a known... Hey, here,
I got you some chocolates.

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,359
Chocolates?

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,238
You heard of chocolates?
I got you chocolates.

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,232
- How come?
- Whaddya mean?

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,630
They're from Belgium,
handmade by Belgiumites.

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,077
Tell it to the Marines. You get
caught hitting on a waitress?

34
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,358
Hey, in 25 years of marriage
have I ever hit on anybody but you?

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,591
Hmm, well, I don't buy it, Ray.
You got a scheme.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,717
OK, forget it. Get me
dinner. They're not for you!

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,472
- OK.
- I got you nothin'.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,838
Just get my dinner, right now.
And hurry up.

39
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,718
Before you make dinner,
I gotta talk to you.

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,837
What did I tell you?
Here comes the commercial.

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,309
Frenchy, I need our $6,000.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,312
- What?!
- I gotta have our six G's.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,790
- That's our savings.
- Don't get dramatic about it.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,871
Ray, that's all we got, right?

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,793
I got a brilliant idea.
I'll make us rich.

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,836
How? You gonna rob a bank?

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,514
How'd you know that?
That's fantastic.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,194
- What?
- First shot, you got it.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,716
Is that why Tommy Beale's
coming over, and Denny?

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,318
What if I told you you were
married to a very brilliant man?

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,550
I'd say I'd have to be a bigamist.

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,631
This is foolproof - foolproof!

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,915
You said you were finished with that.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,788
I was, but I've been kicked
from stupid little job to job.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,316
- You like the way we live?
- It beats your old residence.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,234
You think I like looking at you
through glass talking over a phone?

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,914
Frenchy, you stood...you stood by me!

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,560
- Yeah...
- Granted, you stood by me.

59
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,108
Two years I waited,
and what did I get?

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,875
You got Belgian chocolates!
What's wrong with that?

61
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,748
God, I got an idea, this is
so incredible, but I need money.

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,276
We need seed money for this,
we need 18,000 bucks.

63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,509
(Gasps )

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,831
Denny and Tommy kick six
and I gotta put in my six.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,993
- How can those bums get that?
- They didn't go to Harvard but...

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,231
They were drafted before
they finished kindergarten!

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,436
You're such a snob, Frenchy!

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,512
Denny's not stupid
because he drives a truck!

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,353
No, he's stupid
because he has a low IQ.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,318
- I'd like to flatten you once.
- Oh, yeah...

71
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,277
Tommy's got street smarts.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,555
Yeah, his brain's got potholes.

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,959
(Buzzer)

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,713
She's got an answer for everything.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,712
Forget it!
I'm not spending our last bucks!

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,836
I got my end! I said I could.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,956
Well, he can't get his end.

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,349
Frenchy, I gotta have that money.

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,512
Yeah, maybe if you
needed a Quadruple bypass.

80
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,398
- This is brilliant!
- No, Ray is a genius.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,153
Compared to you,
this chair is a genius.

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,595
No, this is the plan of a great mind.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,877
I can't believe
you're just a dishwasher.

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,359
Thank you.

85
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,876
I don't get your agreeance,
I count to three...

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,839
You can count to 53, I did
a lot of nails for that money.

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,911
That's all you wanna do? Nails?

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,197
- Take a hike, OK?
- Frenchy, I-I'm countin'...

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,748
- Oh, yeah?
- If I lose it, you're gone.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,478
I'm Quaking.

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,959
(Buzzer)

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,191
- You're embarrassing me!
- How did you get a cookie?

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,032
- One cookie?
- Hey, guys!

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,270
- Got your share?
- Share of what?

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,510
- Yeah, I sold some stuff.
- What?

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,830
- A rented car.
- He can't get his.

97
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,675
- What are you tellin' him?
- The candy didn't work, then?

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,557
Will you shut up?!

99
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,474
All that's missing from him
is some velvet and a pet mouse.

100
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,312
Frenchy, gimme the money.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,675
I wouldn't invest it on a legit idea,

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,070
much less something
that'll land you back in stir.

103
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,912
You said you call the shots.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,753
For God...
Will you knock it off? Jesus...

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
- Frenchy, that money's mine.
- It's MINE, I earned it.

106
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,429
- But I'm your husband...
- Take a hike.

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,318
Frenchy, I... I'm gonna get violent.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,197
Oh, yeah? With your hernia?

109
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,670
Fellas, I can't do it,
it's over. Forget it.

110
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,637
But you said you're the boss.

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,075
Stop telling me what I said!

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,593
Frenchy, it's over.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,638
Let the bank lay there,
let someone else do it.

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,870
I-I gotta get some air on the roof.

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,077
Don't jump, you're
too valuable as a dishwasher!

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,718
Knock it off!

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,631
Can I have another cookie?

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,675
(Frenchy ) No!

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,156
(Distant police siren )

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,716
(Sighs )

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,473
All right, tell me your idea.

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,074
I told you my idea. You shot it down.

123
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,515
You gonna tell me or have a tantrum?

124
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,878
You know, for some reason you're
always shooting down my dreams.

125
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,111
Because your dreams
are like the ones people get

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,236
from putting opium in brownies.

127
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,151
Can I just tell you this?

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,153
You're not a bank robber.
Your two-year vacation proved it.

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,913
Not as a stick-up man, that's all.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,675
When I hit that bank that time,
we were inexperienced,

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,116
the whole group of us
all put on Ronald Reagan masks

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,510
so it was confusing,
I didn't know who was who.

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,398
You're lucky your lawyer
knew the judge!

134
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,118
Can I tell you my idea?!

135
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,557
(Ray ) 'A few weeks ago, a couple
of doors down from the bank,

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,829
'a pizza joint there folded
and it's for rent, Frenchy.'

137
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,038
And then it hits me,
and believe me, I'm no genius...

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,156
Yeah, you don't have to sell me.

139
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,438
..but I figure we tunnel under,
take the pizza joint,

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,511
we come up under the bank vault.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,309
I know the layout cos I used to
know a guard - I got diagrams.

142
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
We clean out the vault,
we go to Florida.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,190
Ray, we're poor but we're happy.

144
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,714
No, you're always complaining.

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,679
Are you happy doing cuticles?
Is that what you want?

146
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,799
Mother said never get involved
with a guy from the rackets.

147
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,440
Frenchy, what's wrong? We had dreams.

148
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,149
What's gotten into you?
Did...did we not have dreams?

149
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,073
When we met, yes, granted,
I was in rackets.

150
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,232
I was running numbers,
you were an exotic dancer,

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,151
your parents didn't approve.

152
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,071
I tried to go legit, OK?

153
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,232
- I know.
- What do you want me to do?

154
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,199
'B-but this pizza place
is just waiting for us.'

155
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,430
Ray, it's gonna look suspicious,

156
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,318
a group of guys
drilling in an empty store.

157
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,119
No, that's where you come in,
you front it.

158
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,033
- What?
- You front it, you make pizzas.

159
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,951
I can't cook pizzas!

160
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,838
So cook cookies!
What's the difference?!

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,629
Tell fortunes, you look like a
gypsy, make it a travel agency.

162
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,951
You work there and
we tunnel under into the bank.

163
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,349
- God...
- Frenchy, come here.

164
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,000
- You see how beautiful this is?
- Yeah.

165
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,640
What you see,
it's not just New Jersey.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,633
When we first met there was
a sunset just like this, very...

167
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,472
- Remember?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

168
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,279
But in Columbia
there was an earthQuake!

169
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,670
Sorry, the location
was taken by someone else.

170
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,079
What?!

171
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,119
Yesterday. I told you,
if you waited too long...

172
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,839
Who did? Wh-who took the place?

173
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,388
Can you give me...? You got the name?

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
Mrs Neddy Goldberg.

175
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,156
Oh, Jesus. For what?

176
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,470
I believe a flower shop.

177
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,199
A flower shop?

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,349
(Sighs )

179
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,032
It's a little old lady,

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,113
her husband just died and she
wants to start a flower shop.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,475
Somebody's got to get to her.

182
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,154
- Get to her what?
- Beg her, con her.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,754
I'll go to her shop and threaten her.

184
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,276
- No, you can't.
- Don't do that.

185
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,157
I gotta talk to her.

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,916
And say what? If her husband
just died, you need a plan.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,070
I don't know. I'll charm her.

188
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,628
What are you gonna use
for charm, Ray?

189
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,199
Knock it off.

190
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,748
Some master plan, you lost the lease.

191
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,593
I'll get it,
that's what this is about.

192
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,559
You're gonna rob a bank and some
little old lady has it first.

193
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,108
Very funny, what...you...you...

194
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,519
(Mumbles )

195
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,238
I'll slam your head off.

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,514
- Hey!
- Jesus.

197
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,478
The bank isn't even
next to the pizza joint.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,632
I told you that before!
That's what's great...

199
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,314
- What?
- There's nothing suspicious.

200
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,119
The only thing suspicious
is your sanity.

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,714
And when did you guys
ever dig a tunnel?.

202
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,313
It's no big deal.

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,039
You underestimate Ray's personality.

204
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,112
He's the most likeable
dishwasher I ever met.

205
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,113
Don't pay any attention to her,
we're gonna proceed.

206
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,833
- Uh...
- Yeah?

207
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,036
I'm looking for Neddy Goldberg.

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,434
Who wants her?

209
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,476
Uh, I got something for her.

210
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,269
I wanna make her a big offer.
Big dough. BIG dough.

211
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,279
Come in.

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,873
(Locks door)

213
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,996
I'm Neddy Goldberg.

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,354
I know you...

215
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,194
You're...you're Benny,
from cell block eight!

216
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,794
- Oh...oh, God, Ray!
- Ray!

217
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,190
- Ray! How are you?
- You look like I'm a stranger!

218
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,872
I'm sorry, come on in.

219
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,236
- It's a small world.
- You leased that empty store?

220
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,595
Yeah, I'm gonna open a flower shop.

221
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,592
- What you gonna do with that?
- Burn it down.

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,990
You're still burning
stuff down for insurance?

223
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,548
That's how I sent
two kids through college.

224
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,790
There's no money in that!

225
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,555
That's... You... Benny,
you gotta come in with us.

226
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,676
- Who's us?
- What?

227
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,036
Why are you so suspicious?
It's me, Ray...

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,429
Remember my nickname in the joint?

229
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,112
- The Brain?
- The Brain.

230
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,952
That's what they called me.

231
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,315
But Ray, that was sarcastic.

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,118
No, that was real.

233
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,749
- No, it was sarcastic.
- There was nothing sarcastic!

234
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,400
- No, it was.
- Benny, it was real.

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,357
- I was...
- It was sarcastic.

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,273
- It wasn't sarcastic...
- Oh, God. Oh, God!

237
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,669
- I was The Brain!
- It was sarcastic!

238
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,513
Fellas, this is Benny. He's in.

239
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,637
- Benny? Looks like a cop to me.
- How you doin'?

240
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,280
You know you're workin'
with a genius?

241
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,511
We're all smart,
but he wears glasses.

242
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,749
Yeah.

243
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,673
W-what's good? Pine, right?

244
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,877
Oak, redwood. Redwood is what
woodpeckers peck on.

245
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,269
It's supposed to be the strongest.

246
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,271
- Good trees, right?
- Yeah.

247
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,477
- This looks good.
- Whoa, look how long it is.

248
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,039
We could build a house.

249
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,237
- We're just building a tunnel.
- Whoa.

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,550
- Or, like, a house.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,596
(Ray ) How much is that?

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
- 1,000 bucks.
- 1,000 bucks a box? Jesus!

253
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,754
- How many sticks in a box?
- 50.

254
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,960
My God, this is...this is
robbery. This is unbelievable.

255
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,349
What do we need this dynamite for?

256
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,795
What? Just be careful...

257
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,596
I don't like the colour...

258
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,153
Ohh, phew!

259
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,231
Can I have one of these?

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,639
Uh, OK.

261
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,472
- One of these?
- Mm-hm.

262
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,949
- OK, you want a bag?
- No, that's OK.

263
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,237
I haven't got a bag.
You'll take 'em like this?

264
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,308
(Ray ) It's a lot of work,

265
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,995
but when it's over we're all
gonna be well compensated.

266
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,435
Who's gonna work the drill?.

267
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,796
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how to.

268
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,030
There's nothing to that.

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,432
Whoever's working it, I tell ya,
it's gonna make a lot of noise.

270
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,080
No, no, hey,
what do you think this is?

271
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,833
We wrap this blanket around it,
it's fine.

272
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,434
No, no, you gotta know
how to work that.

273
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,794
(Tommy ) Whoa! Shut it off!

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,394
(Shouting and drilling)

275
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,190
Guys, shut up! What did you do?!

276
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,431
- We ain't started yet.
- What are you waitin' for,

277
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,839
the drilling season?

278
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,878
Do me a favour,
go upstairs and bake, will ya?

279
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,157
You know,
I-I don't need any help.

280
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,073
(Denny ) Got it?
(Ray ) You better brace me.

281
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,550
You said you were fine!
What are you doing?!

282
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,469
Get that thing! Get that thing!

283
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,154
- Got it?!
- Yeah, I got it!

284
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,719
I can't hold it!

285
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,151
(All shouting and screaming)

286
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,078
I'm gettin' out of here!
I can hear somebody in the store!

287
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,155
Could we have half a dozen
of the chocolate cinnamon?

288
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,958
We're closed. For Easter.

289
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,792
That was three months ago.

290
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,519
- Greek Easter.
- That was two months ago.

291
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,919
Chinese Easter!

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,230
I'd like a cookie for my daughter.

293
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,390
- Honey, what kind?
- All right!

294
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,233
Have a cookie.
Yeah, sure, take a cookie.

295
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,754
- How you doing?
- Oh...hi!

296
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,479
- You still open?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,996
- Two cherry cinnamon.
- Cherry cinnamon, right.

298
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,469
- New here, huh?
- Just opened today.

299
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,675
(Banging)

300
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,193
What's all that noise?

301
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,113
That's...the cookie press.
It needs oil.

302
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,397
There's...
a slight leak...downstairs.

303
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,278
- This is the plumber.
- There's a tiny leak.

304
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,920
- What do I owe you?
- Oh, no charge.

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,515
- Thanks a lot. Take it easy.
- I gotta get some sandbags!

306
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,194
Oh, the cookies are 85 cents for...

307
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,795
- Get the sandbags!
- Relax, you're a perfect fit!

308
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,553
- Where are the sandbags?!
- Just relax!

309
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,190
OK, so we got off to a shaky start.

310
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,430
Yeah, I'd say it was shaky, yeah.

311
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,717
Frenchy, there's gonna
be glitches, so what?

312
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,995
Tomorrow I'll bring a bathing suit.

313
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,595
I'm not discouraged,
cos I don't get discouraged.

314
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,878
There was a woman on before,
she's got 200 pairs of shoes.

315
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,793
You'll get yours Frenchy,
I promise you.

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,678
This time in a month or two
we'll be in Miami,

317
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,273
it'll be great.

318
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,397
"A patron of the arts",
don't that sound great?

319
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,233
- Frenchy...
- Opening night at the opera.

320
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,470
I love you, Frenchy, you know why?

321
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,710
Because you back me all the time.

322
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,633
You know when I first knew
I loved you?

323
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,359
This was a long time ago
if you remember.

324
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,079
Remember I taught you
how to open a safe

325
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,038
by listening to the tumblers,
and you got it.

326
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,317
- That's when I knew.
- You're a very romantic man,

327
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,358
and I'm very lucky because
not many wives get to see

328
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,273
their husbands battling
a ruptured water main.

329
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,794
- I'm crazy about you.
- I'm crazy about you.

330
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,233
- Here, Benny.
- Benny, put it in the bag.

331
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,073
- You... I'll...
- He puts it in the bag.

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,594
- This is efficiency.
- Hurry up!

333
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,592
What... Why are you putting
it in his shovel?.

334
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,399
- He puts it in.
- It's called efficiency.

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,869
It saves energy.

336
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,598
(Customers chatting)

337
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,274
- Chocolate chip, please.
- Here.

338
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,396
Little girl, what do you want?

339
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,472
- Chocolate fudge.
- OK. You can only have two.

340
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,312
What are you stopping for?

341
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
Why? I'm trying to figure this out!

342
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,555
According to this,
we're supposed to take a left turn.

343
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,915
That doesn't mean stop! Let's go!

344
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,151
Will you give me a...
What the hell are you doing?

345
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,993
- What?
- You got your hat on backwards.

346
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,479
Yeah, so?

347
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,279
The flashlight goes in the front!

348
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,316
But it looks cooler like this.

349
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,436
What are you, a jerk?

350
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,671
It's a lot more stylish
than that - look at that!

351
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,149
- You think so?
- Yeah, turn it around.

352
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,357
This is chic.
Yeah, look at that. That's cool.

353
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,192
You got a mirror?

354
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,159
No, I don't. That looks good,
I'll show you when we get out.

355
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,037
Can you keep going, please?

356
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,315
I'm trying to figure the map out!

357
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,277
You want two?

358
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,669
OK, OK, everybody hold on.

359
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,435
That's 1.70, that's it.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

360
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,432
OK, here...chocolate chip...

361
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,715
(Tommy ) What you
gonna do with your share?

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,030
How much is my share?

363
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,078
Well, I figure
there's gotta be two million,

364
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,276
I'm counting the jewellery too.

365
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,751
(Benny ) Divided four ways,
that's a half million bucks apiece.

366
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,877
- What about Frenchy?
- She's just a front.

367
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,598
But without her we're dead.

368
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,910
Any broad could sell cookies.

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,470
I say she gets a share
but not a full share.

370
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,152
I'd go for that.

371
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,789
What if we each get a fourth
and she gets, like, a third?

372
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,475
- She'd be getting more than us.
- How you figure?

373
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,677
Where you gonna get
four-fourths and a third?

374
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,718
- I don't do fractions.
- Let's not get greedy.

375
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,759
Remember that Bogart movie
where they're digging for gold?

376
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,958
They find the gold and then
this guy turns on his friends.

377
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,113
- Let's not let that happen.
- And he's killed by Hispanics.

378
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,839
- The Treasure Of...
- Treasure Island.

379
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,435
- Right! That was a good movie.
- The best.

380
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,910
OK, folks, here's the deal.
I'm out of cookies, OK?

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,797
(Crowd groans )

382
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,189
It's gonna be another two minutes.

383
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,714
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

384
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,395
I've got one cookie left, you
know who's gonna eat this? Me.

385
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,475
(Frenchy ) I gotta put on help.

386
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,879
Help?

387
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,235
Yeah, I can't handle the volume.

388
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,390
What...? A second person?

389
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,870
I can't help it, Ray,
the cookies are selling.

390
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,875
Gee, I never counted on that.
You gotta manage it somehow.

391
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,236
What about my cousin May?
We can trust her.

392
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,393
May's a dodo,
I bring a dodo into a master plan?

393
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,234
- She's not a sQuealer.
- But we'd have to cut her in.

394
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,232
The pot's getting
smaller and smaller.

395
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,279
Well, I can't cook and sell at
the same time, it's a madhouse,

396
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,873
we'll get caught.

397
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,838
Hey, you know what we could do?

398
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,118
May... We could hire May and
not tell her what we're doing.

399
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,352
And she...she'll never catch on.
She's got, you know, and...

400
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,637
We're making enough
from the cookies to pay her.

401
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,077
Absolutely, she'll never figure
out or catch wise to anything.

402
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,517
If you think Denny's slow,
your cousin May is dumb like a...

403
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,875
like a horse
or a dog or something.

404
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,235
Maybe it's not such a great idea.

405
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,993
No, I think...
I think we could do it.

406
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,514
- Where are we?
- Supposed to be here.

407
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,113
Excuse me!

408
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,919
Where's the sugar?
Frenchy wants sugar.

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,993
May, stop bothering us,
we're busy here.

410
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,719
I just don't understand the drilling.

411
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,634
I told you, business is good,
we're expanding.

412
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,919
Yeah, a little tea shop so people
can eat cookies and drink tea.

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,310
Where are they gonna
drink the tea, in the tunnel?.

414
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,870
I'd explain it but you gotta
understand engineering.

415
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,473
What's engineering?

416
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,599
May, do me a favour,
I told you, we're expanding.

417
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,353
But there's a nail shop next door.

418
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,228
- We made a deal with them.
- You're expanding into there?

419
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,639
May, get your stuff.

420
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,154
You want the sugar... Take a hike.

421
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,834
Get the sugar and go, we'll call you.

422
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,878
(Tommy ) This broad's big trouble.

423
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,428
Is it safe having that broad around?

424
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,873
She's harmless.

425
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,633
(Benny ) I think
we've made a wrong turn.

426
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,075
Oh, please! Give me the map.

427
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,550
- What're you talkin' about?
- For God's sakes.

428
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,315
This is fine, I don't know
what you're in a dither about.

429
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,631
- You're holding it upside down.
- I am?

430
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,871
You were reading this
upside down all along?

431
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,313
Get off my back.

432
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,551
Can I help it
if they print these things like this?

433
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,756
OK, thank you very much.

434
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,957
I gotta get another plate
of the...cherry...

435
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,271
- Can I help you? Next?
- I'm coming right back.

436
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,114
Can I get two cherry cinnamon?
How you doin'?

437
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,556
We're doin' something right!
Two cherry cinnamon.

438
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,598
- You new here, huh?
- No, this is my first day.

439
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,717
These are the greatest cookies
I ever tasted.

440
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,509
- Oh, really? We're expanding.
- No kidding?

441
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,160
Yeah, some guys are
working right now,

442
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,038
- tunnelling under next door.
- Really?

443
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,111
- Yeah.
- Did you try the fudge?

444
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,556
We were talking about
what a success this place is.

445
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,518
- About the restaurant.
- What restaurant?

446
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,832
You know, the guys in the back
tunnelling under the nail shop?

447
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,753
- What are you talking about?
- The tea room.

448
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,717
May, come here!

449
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,713
We're at the Sunset Bake Shop
where the lines wait patiently

450
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,598
for the most
fabulous cookies in New York.

451
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,272
What's goin' on here?!

452
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,670
And you're the heart
of Sunset Cookies, Miss...?

453
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,318
Frenchy Winkler.

454
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,597
Frances, but everybody
calls me Frenchy.

455
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,958
Standing here, one can inhale
the aroma of chocolate, cinnamon

456
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,271
and a dozen other
mouth-watering taste treats.

457
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,716
Is it true customers wait
half an hour for a cookie?

458
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,518
(Crowd mumble agreement)

459
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,477
That you've rationed sales?

460
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,916
Well, it happened once but...
what's all the fuss?

461
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,072
Where did you learn
the secret of your baking?

462
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,358
It's all I can cook, that and
linguine with turkey meatballs.

463
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,793
(Laughter)

464
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,916
Sir, how is your cookie?

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,356
I don't know, it's baked
with nutmeg or something.

466
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,998
But it's great.

467
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,119
And we're expanding, there are
men in the back tunnelling...

468
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,713
No, no, May! Get back!

469
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,669
I can't take this, Frenchy!
We don't want this attention.

470
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,230
I didn't hire a publicity agent,
they just showed up.

471
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,073
I know, but it's putting us
in the toilet!

472
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,994
I can't concentrate,
there's people demanding cookies,

473
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,436
and Denny got bit by a rat,
he needed rabies shots.

474
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,751
- Who, the rat?
- Funny. You should be on TV.

475
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,273
I am! Open your eyes!

476
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,316
Frenchy, I don't like this.

477
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,632
You've been digging for weeks,
when you gonna get somewhere?

478
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,678
It's complicated,
we keep getting lost!

479
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,752
The other day I was in deep
and my hat went out.

480
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,879
- That stupid coal miner's hat?
- It's a life-saver, that bulb!

481
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,633
We'd do better
just with a cookie store,

482
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,676
we're making good dough.

483
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,352
Hey, making good dough!

484
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,318
It's a cookie store
but we're making dough.

485
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,198
- We're making dough but...
- I get it.

486
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,513
(Benny ) I knew
we were going the wrong way!

487
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,795
What are we doin' in a dress shop?

488
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,475
At least it's a Sunday,
we can patch this up and get out.

489
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,154
- Patch it up?!
- Tile it!

490
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,038
- I'm not a tiler.
- We don't have any tiles!

491
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,714
Where do you get cement
in a dress shop?

492
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,349
Besides, BRAIN, how can you
close the hole and tile it?

493
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,830
We're inside the store!
How do we get out?

494
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,356
Well... He's got a point.
You can't tile it from that side.

495
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,396
- No kidding.
- No, you can't.

496
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,632
This is very discouraging, guys,
I'm ready to pack this in.

497
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,951
Everybody freeze!

498
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,476
Ray, your wife's cousin
talks too much.

499
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,638
Sorry to spoil
your expansion plans...

500
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,678
Officer, listen,
we didn't do anything yet.

501
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,354
It's true,
we were gonna...rob the bank

502
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,115
but we screwed up everything
except for the cookie shop,

503
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,272
that's doing great,
you like the cookies!

504
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,990
Let us forget all this and just
concentrate on the cookie store.

505
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,755
Hey, look, I'm not trying
to ruin anybody's life, OK?

506
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,956
Then, give us a break.

507
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,679
Think I could get
a piece of the action?

508
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,149
I don't mind paying off the cops.

509
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,549
It's a standard business expense.

510
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,872
Don't think of it as a pay-off.
I think I'm Qualified

511
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,555
to make a major contribution
to this whole enterprise.

512
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,995
My brother-in-law
majored in business.

513
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,150
Let us hear this contribution.

514
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,279
- One word.
- Yeah, and that word is?

515
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,516
Franchise.

516
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,111
(Ray ) 'We got about 600 trucks
and we're all over the country

517
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,239
'and Canada, and we make
a lot of different cookies now.

518
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,788
'We got pistachio,
we got pretzels,

519
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,793
'we make chicken chip cookies,
tuna mint...'

520
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,030
(Reporter) 'Virtually overnight,

521
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,954
'the Winklers and associates have
gone from a small cookie shop

522
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,032
'to something approaching
a baking empire.'

523
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,476
This is where we
package everything, you know?

524
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,395
And, uh...we, uh...the cookies
have a wonderful fresh smell

525
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,119
and that's put on
with a chemical spray.

526
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,519
We do that here.

527
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,990
There's no denying
he's refreshingly down-to-earth

528
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,832
for a corporate executive.

529
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,276
In fact, Sunset Farms
has captured the imagination

530
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,351
of the public and the industry.

531
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,113
We wondered
what the competition thinks,

532
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,873
so we went to American Cookies.

533
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,952
The bottom line is
they make a great product.

534
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,669
And everything else pretty much
takes care of itself.

535
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,318
This is your office?

536
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,391
Yeah, this is where I operate.

537
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,634
Frenchy decorated this place,
she's got...all her stuff here.

538
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,837
This is an antiQue, you know.

539
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,993
She says it's Louis the...
I don't know, Louis XIV, or XV.

540
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,197
I don't know how high
the Louis go, actually,

541
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,555
but it's a top Louis, one of the...

542
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,154
And Frenchy
stuck a TV in it, you know,

543
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,233
because she's got a...you know,
she's a creative decorator.

544
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,471
It's very original.
Um, how much are you worth?

545
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,073
Oh, plenty. Plenty.

546
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,720
- How much? Between you and me.
- A lot.

547
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,872
I mean, whatever you see is antiQues.

548
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,635
You know, this thing here,
this is from the Renaissance

549
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,679
or the Magna Carta or something
but that's where it's from.

550
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,150
Why did you decide to go
into baking so late in life?

551
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,357
Well, Frenchy, we found out,
can make cookies.

552
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,238
(Reporter) 'The Frenchy
they're talking about

553
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,357
'and culinary genius
of Sunset is Frances Fox,

554
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,556
'the wife of the CEO.'

555
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,679
So everybody told you how
delicious your cookies were?

556
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,433
- I thought they were BSing me.
- Really?

557
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,910
Yeah, cos someone gives you
something they cooked

558
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,312
you always say you enjoy it even
if you threw up, so, you know.

559
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,995
In an age where everyone has
public relations handlers

560
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,674
it's hard to imagine
a group more direct

561
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,116
and less image-conscious
than Sunset Farms.

562
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,875
Each person we met seemed
more eccentric than the last,

563
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,155
like Tommy Walker, the chairman.

564
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,358
Frenchy makes the best cookies
in the world. We're very proud.

565
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,795
What are your duties as chairman?

566
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,350
The board meets twice a week
and we take up issues.

567
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,793
Issues?

568
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,917
Yeah, facts, problems,
things like that.

569
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,471
What problems does an overnight
success like Sunset Farms face?

570
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,711
Last week the toilet on
the fourth floor wouldn't flush.

571
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,995
The water kept coming to the top,

572
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,152
so the board voted
on getting a plumber.

573
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,153
'An architect of Sunset Farms'
unorthodox marketing strategy

574
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,358
'is head of advertising,
Denny Doyle, a former truck driver.'

575
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,639
Did you have the idea to advertise
in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler?

576
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,110
I figured if a guy's staring
at a naked piece of tail,

577
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,432
he sees the breasts and
the legs, he's gonna salivate.

578
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,080
So if he's salivating
and turns the page

579
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,833
and comes across
a picture of our cookies,

580
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,753
he thinks maybe
that's why he's drooling.

581
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,956
It's psychology. It's science.

582
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,953
It's like Pablo's theory,
with the dog when he feeds him?

583
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,349
- Pablo?
- Pablo, with the dogs.

584
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,512
'Then there's
ex-police officer Ken Deloach,

585
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,591
'in charge of distribution.

586
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,593
'And Benjamin Borkowsky,
in charge of plant safety.'

587
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,638
I made sure
the building was fireproof.

588
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,030
'And lest they be accused
of being a male club,

589
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,318
'May Sloane handles public
relations and physical therapy.'

590
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,154
I understand public relations,
but physical therapy?

591
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,312
Well, all the chocolate chips
are put in by hand

592
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,313
and that's really hard
on the back and the leg muscles.

593
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,118
I do deep massage.

594
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,873
She's also a vice president.

595
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,270
So that's a brief glimpse
into a corporate culture

596
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,750
that has industry leaders
and management analysts

597
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,356
scratching their heads, wondering
what Sunset Farms will try next.

598
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,638
But it may be as simple as the
Winklers' chief competitor said.

599
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,430
You've got something people want,
everything else falls into place.

600
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,476
Or as we in TV might say,

601
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,915
there's no accounting
for the public's taste.

602
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,754
Keep coming through with the stuff.

603
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,833
I think it's better the way
I had it. Put the doll there.

604
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,117
(Chef) Mrs Winkler?
You wanted to check the menu?

605
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,237
Right. Stevens,
bring that piece downstairs

606
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,880
and try it again
next to the fireplace.

607
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,269
I want a lot of nuts and crudites.

608
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,193
What did we say for openers?
Yeah, snails.

609
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,431
Escargot, yes,
then potato and truffle salad.

610
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,273
By all means,
but I hate those thin pieces.

611
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,669
When you shave it,
lay it on big time.

612
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,877
Truffles are always shaved
finely, Mrs Winkler.

613
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,599
I wouldn't suggest anything overdone.

614
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,513
(Chef) ..then poached
sea bass in filo,

615
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,990
and spinach souffle
and salad and dessert.

616
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,638
And finger bowls.

617
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,234
Nothing being served reQuires them.

618
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,392
You never know
whose fingers need washing.

619
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,870
- Did you rearrange this again?
- Hold your water!

620
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,158
Every time I come home it's like
walking into a strange house.

621
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,435
Did I tell you to get rid of this?

622
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,034
It's a harp. You got no flair, Ray.

623
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,475
Nobody plays the harp. Who plays it?

624
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,949
What's it doing in the living room?

625
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,951
I like the visual sweep.

626
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,077
You know, I don't know
what's gotten into you,

627
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,720
you're so hoity-toity
all of a sudden.

628
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,633
My cookies pay for this,
so turn it off.

629
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,312
What's for dinner?

630
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,234
And don't tell me it's little
sparrows on a bed of lettuce,

631
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,232
cos I never want anything
on lettuce again.

632
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,311
They're pheasants and you ate 'em.

633
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,834
And I almost choked on a BB!

634
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,878
Can I get a cheeseburger,
is that possible?

635
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,872
Are you forgetting?
It's the dinner party.

636
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,714
Oh...great(!)
Just when I got a lot on my mind.

637
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,358
Your mind don't hold a lot.

638
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,273
Come on, get dressed. It's tuxedo.

639
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,079
- I'm hungry.
- You want a snail?.

640
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,993
A...? Are you nuts?
I'm gonna have a snail?.

641
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,071
Come on, you eat steamers.

642
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,869
Hey, a snail leaves a trail
of scum in the yard when it walks.

643
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,712
Not in France, they don't.

644
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,635
Jesus, what happened to all the
turkey meatballs and spaghetti?

645
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,076
Have a potato and truffle thing,
that'll hold you.

646
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,675
Truffles got no flavour, Frenchy!

647
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,433
They're subtle,
only pigs can find 'em.

648
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,035
You're thinking of pearls,
they come in oysters.

649
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,918
- Take a hike.
- You're such an ignoramus.

650
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,073
That's what I love about you,
you're... Pearls are in oysters.

651
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,912
Ray, Ray, Ray...please.

652
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,834
- Don't spoil my big night.
- What's so big about tonight?

653
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,071
There's a lot of important
arts people coming.

654
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,833
Hey, we donate,
you'll be on the boards.

655
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,276
- I wanna be a patron.
- You wanna be a socialite.

656
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,476
So what? Is that so terrible?

657
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,348
But when we talked about
making it, we were gonna hit it big,

658
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,910
move to Florida,
swim, eat stone crabs...

659
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,275
We can get a place in Palm Beach.

660
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,715
Palm Beach is ritzy.

661
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,076
I want to go to Miami,
be at the dog track every day.

662
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,153
I just wanna be as far away from
Frenchy Fox the topless wonder

663
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,071
as I can be.

664
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,799
Hey, you were beautiful
as Frenchy Fox.

665
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,589
You'd come out, remember
you'd give it a little of this?

666
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,477
Those days are over.

667
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,235
And our accountants want us
to be twice as big next year.

668
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,279
What good is that
if I can't get a cheeseburger?

669
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,794
Ray, please, be charming tonight.

670
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,078
I've seen you when you wanna
turn on the charm, you sparkle.

671
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,355
All right. (Chuckles )

672
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,237
I gotta go.

673
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,075
Good evening! Welcome to
our humble little abode.

674
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,720
Charles Bailey,
this is my wife, Emily.

675
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,916
- How you doin'?
- David Parret.

676
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,514
- Hello, hello.
- Linda Rhinelander.

677
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,751
- Can I get you drinks?
- Just Evian, or Perrier?

678
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,673
- Certainly.
- We got anything you want.

679
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,550
I take tap water. The fluoride
keeps your teeth from rotting.

680
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,756
Hey! Look at this!

681
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,592
(Posh voice ) Hello!

682
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,638
So glad you could attend
our humble abode.

683
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,315
We just got back.
Didn't want to miss the new Traviata.

684
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
- Have you seen it?
- No, not yet.

685
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,190
Nor have I. What is it?

686
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,999
Ray, why are we standing
in the hallway?

687
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,914
Please, let's retire
to the living room.

688
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,470
(Parret) Are you a fan
of the ballet, Mrs Winkler?

689
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,350
I used to be a dancer, but,
please, call me Fren...Frances.

690
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,830
- Frances Fox-Winkler.
- The Foxes from Saratoga?

691
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,753
I don't know,
I never checked my pedigree.

692
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,834
Can we change the music? I feel like
I should be wearing a wig.

693
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,592
You will be soon.

694
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,591
Did you do the place yourself?

695
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,240
They say I have a flair
for decorating.

696
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,595
- This rug lights up.
- It lights?

697
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,037
Yeah, it's made of fibre-optics.
I'll turn it on later.

698
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,509
Stevens,
what's with the snails?!

699
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,919
(Doorbell)

700
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,639
W-w-why don't I get the door

701
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,793
and you show them your
collection of leather pigs?

702
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,953
- Do you play the harp, Frances?
- No, it's a visual, honey.

703
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,838
The sweep kills me.
Oh, finally. Girls...

704
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,469
Hey, how you doin'? Come on in.

705
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,950
Right there, all the action...
Hey, honey? Toots?

706
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,031
Shake it, they're in there.

707
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,395
- How you doin'?
- Garth Steinway.

708
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,755
- Garth Steinway.
- Garth...? Yeah.

709
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,718
- I'm Anthony Gwynne.
- Oh, no kidding?

710
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,473
You're the outfielder
with the Padres?

711
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,551
Our goal is to raise $2 million,

712
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,279
then the company
can tour the west coast

713
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,112
and include the new opera.

714
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,474
Right.

715
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,233
Well, count me in.
I love serious music.

716
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,437
Ray, on the other hand,
opera freaks him.

717
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,512
Have you tried your finger bowl?.?

718
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,751
So the guy says,
"What do you do for a living?"

719
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,478
He says, "I'm a monback."

720
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,120
He says, "What's a monback?"

721
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,034
"You know, I stand behind
a truck saying "'monback"!"

722
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,479
H-he stands behind the truck,
he goes "'monback"!

723
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,517
He says... I think
it's too fast for her.

724
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,239
'Monback. He says 'monback.

725
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,392
I do think they overpaid
for the Picasso.

726
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,268
I mean, for me it was unusually
mediocre, don't you think?

727
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,399
I agree completely. Excuse me,
I have to go find my wife.

728
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,998
I saw a beautiful painting of
fruit at the Met or the Whitney,

729
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,310
it might have been the Holocaust.

730
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,312
Are you affiliated
with any of the museums?

731
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,072
No, I'm a private dealer.

732
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,438
We have one or two paintings but
I haven't gotten around to...

733
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,750
- building a collection.
- Uh-huh.

734
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,195
So what are you interested in?

735
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,273
Er, Rembrandt, Picasso, Michelangelo.

736
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,635
- You know, the boys.
- Yeah, yeah.

737
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,917
I might be out of Michelangelos
at the moment.

738
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,039
But I have come into possession
of an incredible Damon Dexter

739
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,918
that someone's trying to sell,
is he...?

740
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,991
I'm not aware of him.

741
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,435
No, well, he's new, you know.

742
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,799
I have to say, your wine
is absolutely delicious. Really.

743
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,839
The chef who did the finger
bowls chose it. Have you rinsed?

744
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,038
David used to own a vineyard,
so he's a tough audience.

745
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,509
Did you study art at school?.

746
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,955
No, I didn't. I think I should have.

747
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,951
No, I studied literature.

748
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,918
Then inevitably
wound up as a stockbroker,

749
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,675
then I dropped out,
went to Japan and became a Buddhist

750
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,038
blah blah blah,
and then I did teach art for a bit.

751
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,156
And then the vineyard.

752
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,437
My God, what a life,
and you're still so young!

753
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,476
Don't be fooled.

754
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,597
Somewhere in a closet
there's a portrait of me ageing.

755
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,318
In the closet?

756
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,356
Why would it be...?

757
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,352
Oh! How droll.

758
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,793
(Chuckling)

759
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,189
You hear about the Polish carpool?.

760
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,716
Every day they meet at work.

761
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,430
I can't believe this room.
This takes bad taste to new heights.

762
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,636
(Woman ) This is excruciating.

763
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,350
(Man ) And can you believe them?
I can't keep a straight face.

764
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,716
(2nd Man ) And this apartment,
the flawless vulgarity.

765
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,712
(Woman ) She must've been
frightened by a leopard.

766
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,792
(Man ) I think they plan
on being very generous.

767
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,668
(2nd Man ) And the house?
Not to mention her clothes.

768
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,593
(Man ) This is
the definition of bad taste.

769
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,430
(Ray ) I never saw so much jewellery.

770
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,354
It makes me sad that I don't
have to steal any more. Really.

771
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,069
What's the matter, honey?
You've been Quiet all night.

772
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,593
What's bothering you?

773
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,592
What's bothering me
is that we got no class.

774
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,071
Speak for yourself,
I was very charming tonight.

775
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,393
Ray, I went to sit in the bar.
They were in there talking about us.

776
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,109
You shoulda heard 'em.
And they were right.

777
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,509
We got more dough than all of them.

778
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,990
It ain't dough.
It's knowing the finer things.

779
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,559
Like what? Opera?

780
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,030
Like food and wine
and painting and books.

781
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,554
Stop it, will you? I'm unimpressed.

782
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,191
All my life I've been ignorant,
I could never afford to learn.

783
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,111
And I was a good student...

784
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,909
Well, I was a lousy student
and I always hated school.

785
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,673
If I could find
my school principal today,

786
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,716
I'd put a contract out on her.

787
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,270
Class is something
you can't fake and can't buy.

788
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,432
I got more class
in my little finger than them.

789
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,353
We came into a few bucks
but we're phoneys,

790
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,749
we're trying to act like big shots.

791
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,637
- Not me.
- Well, me.

792
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,952
But the time has come to use our
dough to amount to something.

793
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,519
Like what?

794
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,511
To change our lives.

795
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,114
I'm too busy to change my life.

796
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,236
Doing what? Playing pinball?.

797
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,598
I don't wanna wear a tux any more,
I wanna go to Florida and swim.

798
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,716
Well, I wanna be the real thing.

799
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,429
Wise up, because if I grow and
you stay as stupid as you are,

800
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,954
we're gonna have
big problems, Ray.

801
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,112
Smarten you up,
is that what you said?

802
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,475
Yeah, you said you were a teacher,

803
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,836
you know art, opera,
books, wine, you know,

804
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,434
we want to learn it all,
don't we, Ray?

805
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,512
I'm flattered you think
I'm capable of...

806
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,512
Turning two slugs like us
into classy items?

807
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,559
No homework. I never did any
when I was young, I'm not...

808
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,030
You know, not doing
anything that's got homework.

809
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,635
Naturally, we'd make it
worth your while, David.

810
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,234
No, it's absolutely
not about money,

811
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,552
it's just that...I've never been
asked to do anything like this.

812
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,915
I'm not sure
I'd know where to start.

813
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,798
I know I gotta get
a better vocabulary.

814
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,714
Have you ever thought about
enrolling in college?

815
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,349
I didn't go to high school,
why would I go to college?

816
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,116
That takes four years, we want
a private crash course, right?

817
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,909
Am I crazy? She's nuts!
David, tell her she's nuts.

818
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,356
What are... I'm gonna
learn about life suddenly?

819
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,716
I must say, Frenchy,
Ray has a point, you know.

820
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,157
He could probably teach me more
about life than I could teach you.

821
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,117
What's he gonna teach you?

822
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,432
I can figure the point spread
and count cards at blackjack.

823
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,590
- Close your bazoo.
- I can...

824
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,113
Close your bazoo!

825
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,555
I don't want to be discouraging

826
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,518
because what you propose
is admirable...

827
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,239
I'd like to be able
to spell Connecticut.

828
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,676
Don't ask why, I never knew
how to spell Connecticut.

829
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,832
Fair enough.
You could teach him that, right?

830
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,353
Yeah.

831
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,398
You said this is
a slow period in the art market

832
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,517
and we would take
VER Y good care of you, right?

833
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,751
Like I say, I don't want
to discourage you...

834
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,469
I'd just have to think about it
a bit, I haven't...

835
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,996
If I could envisage a plan,
a starting point.

836
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,789
We could start by, you know,
building our art collection.

837
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,270
You'd make a few bucks
and we can learn something.

838
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,715
But I'm not going to museums.

839
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,268
The...pictures spook me out...

840
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,316
- (Laughing)
- Virgins...

841
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,150
- What are you laughin' at?
- Spooked by the virgins!

842
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,470
- I'm sorry.
- Work on the laugh.

843
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,118
You can see the difference
between this Tintoretto

844
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,510
and the earlier Byzantine
painting we looked at.

845
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,354
What would you say is the
most significant difference?

846
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,035
I would say that
the frame's bigger here.

847
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,914
Mm-hm. Yeah, it is bigger,

848
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,913
but there's also a difference
in the paintings themselves

849
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,117
and it's important
because it characterises

850
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,918
the great technical leap

851
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,673
from the ancient
into the modern world.

852
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,877
You remember how the saints
had very flat faces

853
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,794
and the background was on the
same plane as the foreground?

854
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,519
- Perspective.
- Right, perspective.

855
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,910
Let me show you another
very good example of that.

856
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,154
"The frame on this one is bigger"?
Oh, boy, you are a dummy.

857
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,515
Hey, don't give me "perspective."

858
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,750
Take a hike, will ya?

859
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,637
(Woman's voice ) 28.

860
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,156
- Four.
- Lev axle.

861
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,559
51.

862
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,679
- You niv dee can.
- 87.

863
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,638
- (Groaning)
- 90.

864
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,597
- Darvo sed.
- Four.

865
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,195
- Red do.
- 10.

866
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,192
(Screeching)

867
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,636
(Wailing)

868
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,234
(Ray ) I'm hungry.
(Frenchy ) Learn something.

869
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,117
There's nothing to learn!

870
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,316
This is where Henry James lived.

871
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,630
- Who?
- The band leader, stupid.

872
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,915
- Married to Betty Grable?
- Yes!

873
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,312
No, you're thinking of
Harry James, who's brilliant too.

874
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,516
This is Henry James, the author.

875
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,113
- Oh.
- Yeah?

876
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,873
This is where he lived
and worked and...

877
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,794
I don't care where he lived,
where did he eat?

878
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,555
- The Heiress, right?
- The "H" is silent.

879
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,358
Oh. Did he write that too?

880
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,878
Oh... Frenchy!

881
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,632
Frenchy, I'm still sick.

882
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,029
I'm weak, I can't go.

883
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,159
You're gonna miss an interesting
"great books" discussion.

884
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,597
Yeah, I know. It kills me.
But I... I'm just gonna lay here.

885
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,875
See you when you come back.

886
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,032
- Hello.
- Hello.

887
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,997
Ray's got a cold.

888
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,911
- I bet 500.
- 500?

889
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,150
See your five, raise you 500.

890
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,912
I'm out.

891
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,468
I'll see the five, and a thou.

892
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,630
What did you think of the book?

893
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,712
Well, I thought
it was very romantic.

894
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,759
I mean, he loved her but their
backgrounds were so different.

895
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,034
Right.

896
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,271
So you thought
it was doomed from the start?

897
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,237
I guess, cos he wound up dead,

898
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,677
but I think that two people
from different backgrounds

899
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,799
can make it if, er...
the juice is there.

900
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,552
Right.

901
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,996
- Sorry, juice is...is?
- You know, the hots.

902
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,594
Right.

903
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,750
Wine, would you like some wine?

904
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,638
I brought over a bottle
of Chateau Margaux.

905
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,359
We can compare that
to my Clos de la Roche

906
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,274
and see the difference between
a Bordeaux and a burgundy.

907
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,999
I've got two others
of the same vintage

908
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,548
that I thought
it might be fun to try.

909
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,313
I see the five, I raise a thou.

910
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,759
I'll see it,
raise you a thousand more.

911
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,718
And a thousand.

912
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,355
- And a thousand.
- OK. Call.

913
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,079
Read it and weep,
a pair of threes.

914
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,754
Oh, good,
I thought you were bluffing.

915
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,035
So what do you wanna play now?

916
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,509
What about Indian Poker?

917
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,673
Seven cards, hold them over
your head, nobody sees their hand,

918
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,595
we bet on each other's hands,
high-low, wild cards all the reds.

919
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,432
Do you wanna sit down, May?

920
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,398
(Benny ) Old Maid?
Can you play Old Maid?

921
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,313
So, um...try this one.

922
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,833
Well, OK.

923
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,591
Nice nose.

924
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,989
Yeah, the bouQuet is very special.

925
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,753
No, I mean you got a nice nose.

926
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,115
- Me?
- Yeah.

927
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,193
I can't describe it,
it's like kind of...

928
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,113
- It's just any old nose...
- AQuiline.

929
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,910
Yeah, um, talking of which, how
is your vocabulary coming along?

930
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,630
Oh, good. I'm almost through all
the "A" words in the dictionary.

931
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,199
Right, right.

932
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,159
Thing is, I'm not convinced
that memorising the dictionary

933
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,913
is the best way
to improve your vocabulary.

934
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,788
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

935
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,271
You sold the Damon Dexter so
fast and at such a good price.

936
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,272
That'll really
take a bite out of our debts.

937
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,353
Oliver, it's dawning on me
that the opportunity has arisen

938
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,318
for me to become Quite,
er, obscenely rich.

939
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,198
They're serious
about an art collection?

940
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,158
- No, that would be peanuts.
- What, then?

941
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,358
Well, I think that she
might be falling for me.

942
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,998
Frenchy Winkler?

943
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,958
How much do you think
she's worth, roughly?

944
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,477
- Her husband, you mean?
- No, it's all in her name.

945
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,551
What are you saying?

946
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,598
I don't know, I suppose I'm saying...

947
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,673
people grow and marriages
sadly break up and...

948
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,876
women remarry, you know?

949
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,110
Fortunes, they change hands.

950
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,518
(Ray ) What is this?

951
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,637
It's a Damon Dexter,
a discovery of David's.

952
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,278
I say it's depressing.

953
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,511
You wouldn't know a masterpiece
if it bit you.

954
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,990
- I refuse to look at this.
- What does that mean?

955
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,072
It means I won't look at that wall.

956
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,878
Oh! You're a head case.

957
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,110
I bet David made a profit on this.

958
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,430
Whose cookies pay the rent, huh?

959
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,192
He's making a fool out of you!

960
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,989
Stevens, what time is it?
I no longer look at this wall.

961
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,594
- 11am, sir.
- Thank you very much.

962
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,149
David, what's this? Oh...

963
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,674
Oh, that?
That's a citrine necklace.

964
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,115
- You know about citrines?
- No.

965
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,716
They're not precious stones,
but the lustre's very special.

966
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,313
And that?

967
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,799
Ah...

968
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,269
- Talking about lustre...
- Uh-huh.

969
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,636
This is very special
and very, very expensive.

970
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,236
It's a cigarette case that
belonged to the Duke of Windsor.

971
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,073
I know the Duke of Windsor!

972
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,152
He also married
beneath his station, right?

973
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,391
He did, he did,
like our friend Henry Higgins.

974
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,871
It was such a romantic story,
I saw it on television.

975
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,552
Uh-huh?

976
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,631
Ray? Ray!

977
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,473
What are you doin' here?

978
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,391
I'm...having Chinese food.

979
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,711
That's what they serve
in a Chinese restaurant.

980
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,109
- You want some company?
- Who?

981
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,430
Who's talking to you? Me!

982
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,909
All right...but where's Frenchy?

983
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,310
She's at a concert,
some piano concert with a guy.

984
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,918
Oh. They have take-out here
but they won't deliver to a concert.

985
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,877
Don't worry about it, May.

986
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,111
<i>#</i> Rachmaninoff:
Prelude in B Minor, Opus 32 <i>#</i>

987
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,835
(Ray ) Dinner was so great, May.

988
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,198
All that MSG and the grease,
it was just... What a treat.

989
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,477
I'm so sick of continental food
every night.

990
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,869
You know,
Frenchy eats frogs' legs.

991
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,235
(May ) Do they taste like chicken?

992
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,878
(Ray ) Rabbit.

993
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,033
- Rabbit tastes like frog legs?
- No... Forget it, forget it.

994
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,236
(Ray ) Are you happy being rich?

995
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,719
(May ) It's OK.

996
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,677
I got a lot of charge accounts

997
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,832
and a really, really
nice apartment and a maid.

998
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,037
- I'm still lonely though.
- Yeah? How come?

999
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,712
The guy I was seeing left me

1000
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,712
because he was so embarrassed
about being poor

1001
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,268
and hated that I paid
for everything.

1002
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,636
So I stopped paying,
and that's when he left me.

1003
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,075
Yeah, I can...understand your...

1004
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,913
- You...you enjoy being rich?
- I hate it.

1005
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,595
- You're kidding?
- No, I hate the life, you know?

1006
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,592
- It's making me lose Frenchy.
- What?

1007
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,990
I mean she's outgrowing me,
that's what she said.

1008
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,752
She's a different person.

1009
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,991
I think she's got a crush
on her teacher, David.

1010
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,119
Yeah, well, he's very
good looking and really bright,

1011
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,113
- very charming and elegant...
- OK, I got the picture.

1012
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,670
You really know
how to make a guy feel good.

1013
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,548
- When you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.

1014
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,200
(David) What did
you think of it?

1015
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,317
I thought the whole evening
was apocalyptic.

1016
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,790
- Apocalyptic?
- Totally. I really was agog.

1017
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,235
Well, me too, she's fabulous.

1018
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,279
And I have to asseverate
she deserves accolades.

1019
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,272
Have you been
memorising the dictionary?

1020
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,920
Yeah. Next week the "B"s.

1021
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,513
How do I look?

1022
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,197
I have to say,
that dress is just...gorgeous.

1023
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,999
See? Your influence. Low-key, right?

1024
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,913
Well, that's very flattering...

1025
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,309
Ray thinks it's dullsville.

1026
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,992
David?

1027
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,072
- Paige.
- Wasn't Rachmaninoff inspired?

1028
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,479
Wasn't it?

1029
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,472
I thought it might incur
my animadversion

1030
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,712
- but realised it was apposite.
- A-ha! I think I see drinks.

1031
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,519
- Good to see you, David.
- Nice meeting you.

1032
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,068
I love your friends, David.

1033
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,392
They're so bright and cultured
and refined, it's another world.

1034
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,358
It's a world I know
you'd love to belong to.

1035
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,908
This looks a lot more civilised.

1036
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,719
- Oh, beautiful.
- Let's take a seat here.

1037
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,713
'Anything we get,
Cody's in for his full share.

1038
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,472
'That's how it is.'

1039
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,279
(May ) You know why
I respect Cody?

1040
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,999
- Why?
- Because he loves his mother.

1041
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,957
I understand that, May.

1042
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,192
Even though he's a cold-blooded
killer and she encourages him,

1043
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,918
still, it's sweet.

1044
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,309
Yeah, I wish
I had a mother like that.

1045
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,709
- More Pepsi?
- Yeah, please.

1046
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,678
And this is the best part,
I love this part.

1047
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,193
Yeah...

1048
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,158
Will you pass me the Crackerjack?

1049
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,957
What are you lookin' at?

1050
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,837
I happen to be noticin' you,

1051
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,912
I was lookin' at you
a couple of times tonight,

1052
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,514
cos for the first time
I had the thought

1053
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,115
that in a very, very strange way,
you got a sweet face.

1054
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,909
It's off-beat
in a kind of bizarre...you know.

1055
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,310
I don't know how to explain it
exactly, but it's...

1056
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,753
it's right up there.

1057
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,752
- What d'you mean?
- It's a compliment, May,

1058
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,831
I'm trying to say a nice thing.

1059
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,195
Cos you being a relative of Frenchy

1060
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,795
I never before classified you
as a human-type female.

1061
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,950
- So...
- I-I-I was married.

1062
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,429
A long time ago, right?

1063
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,115
It was a really tragic story
because my husband, Otto,

1064
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,079
was dyslexic, and the only thing
he could spell was his name.

1065
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,628
That is... That's, er...

1066
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,359
There's no doubt about it,
burgundy really goes to my head.

1067
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,510
What did you want to talk about?

1068
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,072
I've, um...

1069
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,072
Well, I've...got
a little present for you.

1070
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,513
- For me?
- Yeah.

1071
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,034
- Here.
- Oh...pretty...

1072
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,509
I love leather books.

1073
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,229
Oh, Pygmalion.
I love that story, David.

1074
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,550
There's a little inscription.

1075
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,358
"To my favourite Eliza,

1076
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,318
"from your Professor Higgins,
love David."

1077
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,834
- I got a confession to make.
- What?

1078
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,672
I got you a present too.

1079
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,035
Oh, no, you didn't have to do that.

1080
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,557
It's in appreciation of all the
stuff you've been doing for me.

1081
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,153
Oh, my God.

1082
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,310
Oh, my God, Frenchy...

1083
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,992
- This is...
- Frances!

1084
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,911
Frances, this is...

1085
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,753
It must have cost you a fortune.

1086
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,230
What good's having dough
unless you spend it, huh?

1087
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,108
This is...this is so extravagant...

1088
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,872
I-I'm embarrassed.

1089
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,598
Don't take up smoking,

1090
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,434
but if it's good enough for
the Duke of Windsor, right?

1091
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,556
Well, I'm really overwhelmed

1092
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,076
and my little Bernard Shaw
is so insignificant...

1093
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,957
No.

1094
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,439
But you see I just...

1095
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,638
I just wanted you to know how
unbelievably proud I am of you.

1096
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,029
David, this is not insignificant.

1097
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,998
Maybe I'm talking
out of turn here but...

1098
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,789
you've just
developed so much and I...

1099
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,871
I just feel that you belong

1100
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,191
in a world of society
and high culture now.

1101
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,068
It's frustrating because
you should continue growing,

1102
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,151
you should be branching out.

1103
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,392
There's Paris and Rome and the
great opera houses and museums.

1104
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,473
You should be able to cultivate
the right kinds of friends...

1105
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,313
Anyway, I, you know... Biff.

1106
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,994
It's hard,
cos Ray's not like that.

1107
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,550
He likes watching TV
in his underwear, suckin' a Bud.

1108
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,760
Well, I don't know what to say.
I can't...can't comment on that.

1109
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,750
- Can I be frank, David?
- Mm-hm.

1110
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,150
(Sighs ) Sometimes
I think I've outgrown him.

1111
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,515
- Pretty late.
- You too. What did you do?

1112
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,751
Ah, you know,
I-I, uh, worked late

1113
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,559
and then May and me
had some Chinese food.

1114
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,757
You and May.
What did you talk about? Cartoons?

1115
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,799
No, we went up to her apartment
and watched "White Heat" on TV.

1116
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,917
- Till 3am?
- Then we went and got a pizza.

1117
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,911
Chinese food and a pizza?

1118
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,152
I'm surprised you didn't break
into the Pepto-Bismol factory.

1119
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,074
No, Frenchy, for the first time
in a long time I had fun.

1120
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,229
- I wanna talk to you, Ray.
- Now?

1121
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,754
David's going to Europe for a month,

1122
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,798
I thought we might go along,
see some sights.

1123
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,351
- What kind of sights?
- Churches, opera houses, ruins.

1124
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,510
What are you, a stroke victim?

1125
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,717
Fly 3,000 miles
to see opera houses and ruins?

1126
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,233
Well, I wanna go.

1127
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,596
- What do you mean?
- It's part of my development.

1128
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,514
You're Frenchy Fox from
New Jersey, stop putting on airs.

1129
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,034
David thinks it would be good for me.

1130
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,352
- I get a bad vibe about him.
- You think everybody's a crook.

1131
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,352
I wish I still was a crook,
I'd feel like a person.

1132
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,874
You haven't grown along with me.

1133
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,238
The only thing that's grown
about you is your rear end.

1134
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,788
I'm sorry, Ray,
I wanna go to Europe.

1135
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,509
We're married! You can't
just go to Europe with David.

1136
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,831
- I asked you to come!
- Cos you knew I'd say no!

1137
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,957
My idea of fun is
not going to operas and ruins.

1138
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,076
I get enough sleep at home.

1139
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,991
I never thought I'd say this,

1140
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,834
but maybe the time has come
to re-evaluate our marriage.

1141
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,754
If you go with David, you'll
have to re-evaluate it big time.

1142
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,118
I won't be held back by an
over-aged juvenile delinQuent!

1143
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,270
Then get yourself a lawyer.

1144
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,115
We don't need lawyers, I'll go 50\50,
even though it's all in my name.

1145
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,555
You're right,
we don't need lawyers

1146
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,790
because I don't want anything.

1147
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,348
You can have the house, the business,

1148
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,637
custody of all the
chocolate chips, I just want out.

1149
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,518
(Ray ) You know, May, it was on a
boat that I proposed to Frenchy.

1150
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,158
(May ) Yeah, yeah, I know.

1151
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,550
Suddenly I'm not her type
after all these years.

1152
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,518
Oh, may I tell you something, Ray?

1153
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,919
What?

1154
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,355
You're not my type either.

1155
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,908
What? What the hell does that mean?

1156
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,956
Maybe Frenchy wasn't so wrong

1157
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,918
to try and make something
out of herself.

1158
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,956
Frenchy overdid everything.

1159
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,031
Well, you underdo everything.

1160
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,749
There's more to life
than turkey meatballs.

1161
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,628
I don't know. I get a bad vibe
about this guy David.

1162
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,871
It's my street instinct,
but I don't trust him.

1163
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,795
Because he's younger than you,
he's handsomer than you,

1164
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,316
he's much taller than you are,
he's smarter than you,

1165
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,595
he's much more exciting than you.

1166
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,956
May, don't pull any punches
with me, I can take it.

1167
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,160
Women... You know, women like
a little elegance. It's more...

1168
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,153
So if I did it again I would
do some things differently.

1169
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,437
Maybe I'd sit through
more operas with Frenchy.

1170
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,830
Especially now they got
the new Sony Walkmans.

1171
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,196
Now you split with Frenchy,
you don't even work.

1172
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,397
No, I don't work,
but I got an idea for something

1173
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,756
and I want to talk to you about it.

1174
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,592
Really?

1175
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,474
(May ) Wow, what a place.

1176
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,678
That's the home of
Chi Chi Potter, the socialite.

1177
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,716
Now, Chi Chi's got a necklace,

1178
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,678
it's all emeralds
with diamonds around it,

1179
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,673
it's a very famous necklace,
maybe you saw it in a magazine.

1180
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,352
Would it have been on TV?

1181
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,989
I don't know, but it's been
in magazines, it's famous.

1182
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,390
I wanna... I could live off
that necklace, if I fenced it,

1183
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,436
for the rest of my life.

1184
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,239
Remember what happened
with the tunnel.

1185
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,312
Yeah, but we don't
have to tunnel any more.

1186
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,392
Now, Frenchy and I,
we're patrons of the arts

1187
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,517
so Chi Chi invited us to a big party,

1188
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,513
Frenchy's out of town, you come
with me, we get the necklace.

1189
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,034
Oh. I never heisted anything before.

1190
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,193
There's nothing to it, I know where
the safe is, I've been planning.

1191
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,636
'I had dinner there one night
and I excused myself,

1192
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,948
'I was very crafty.

1193
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,508
'I went upstairs
and I scoped it all out

1194
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,434
'and found the safe and I got
the whole layout in my mind,

1195
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,239
'so I know we can do this.'

1196
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,674
I don't wanna wind up in jail,
and if this is such a big item

1197
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,469
they'll be turning the town
upside-down looking for it.

1198
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,518
No, I have
a particularly shrewd mentality,

1199
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,716
I got a connection in Chinatown.

1200
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,473
I bring in
a picture of the necklace,

1201
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,678
he makes me an exact duplicate,
I switch, she never knows.

1202
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,514
She's a... Chi Chi's a dumb,
flighty society dame.

1203
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,912
By the time she figures out
there's been a switch,

1204
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,309
I'll be in Florida
or the Cayman Islands.

1205
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,151
(Melancholy classical music)

1206
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,631
(Mobile phone )

1207
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,560
Hello? What?

1208
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,949
- I can't hear you, what?
- Shh.

1209
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,110
I'm in a crypt! I can't!

1210
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,997
What do you mean?

1211
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,833
What are you talking about? How?

1212
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,797
Give me a break, sister, OK?

1213
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,598
- Today?!
- Shh!

1214
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,958
What do you mean
it's an emergency? I...

1215
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,274
- Oh, hi.
- Mrs Winkler?

1216
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,511
We're sorry to bring
you back from your vacation.

1217
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,273
- What's goin' on?
- I've terrible news.

1218
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,399
- Something happened to Ray?
- Sunset Enterprises is bankrupt.

1219
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,596
- How?
- Fraud.

1220
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,911
- Fraud? Who?
- Your accountants.

1221
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,356
I-I-I don't even know
who they are. What?

1222
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,399
- You should have looked.
- We let them handle everything.

1223
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,358
What do I know
about running a corporation?

1224
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,273
Did you ever read
anything you signed?

1225
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,113
No, but they assured us
everything was OK.

1226
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,475
Mrs Winkler, do you want a drink?

1227
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,235
I'd like a 1961 Romanee
Saint-Vivant if we have it.

1228
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,311
I'd have a whisky if I were you.

1229
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,951
Well, I don't understand,
I mean, Sunset's gone?

1230
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,951
Can't we do anything?

1231
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:26,033
We could put a few people
in jail IF we could find them.

1232
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,759
Oh...this is the worst news.

1233
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,070
Oh, no. No, Mrs Winkler, it's not.

1234
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,037
No? It is to me!

1235
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,475
No, no, the worst news is coming up.

1236
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,756
Oh. All right.

1237
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,913
All right, you better tell me.
Let me sit down.

1238
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,719
They talked about expanding Sunset.

1239
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,791
That's right, yeah.

1240
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,429
To do that you needed a bank
loan, are you aware of that?

1241
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,272
Quite a substantial loan.

1242
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,634
Get to the point.

1243
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,439
You signed a promissory note
to the bank.

1244
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,991
This is exactly what
I've got accountants for.

1245
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,231
Yes, but your accountants
are in Venezuela.

1246
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,437
Wh... This is all so confusing!

1247
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,354
You put up your home and savings
for a monster loan.

1248
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,989
Could you put some cyanide in here?

1249
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,675
- It needs to be stronger.
- You've lost it all, Frenchy.

1250
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,673
Or should I say you've been
swindled out of it all?.

1251
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,435
- You mean I got...
- Nothing. You have nothing.

1252
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,991
No house, no bank account,
just some large, outstanding loans

1253
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,517
which we feel you can best deal
with by filing for bankruptcy.

1254
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,434
Bankruptcy? Bankruptcy?
I'm not up to the "B" words yet.

1255
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,080
- Sorry.
- Does Ray know about this?

1256
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,197
What difference
does it make to Ray? He's gone.

1257
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,994
What did you say?

1258
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,911
(Frenchy ) I'm bankrupt.

1259
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,232
Sunset's gone. Worse,
all my personal dough is gone.

1260
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,276
The whole ride's over.

1261
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,839
Well...

1262
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,394
How could that possibly happen?

1263
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,869
Fraud. My accountants.

1264
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,317
Ray said not to trust them because
the whole firm had moustaches.

1265
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,918
I-I'm gonna get myself
a little Valium.

1266
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,913
David, I can't give you
that loan I promised you.

1267
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,797
What? What did you say?

1268
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,155
It turns out I got people I owe.

1269
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,993
But you did say
I could borrow $400,000.

1270
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,196
I was using it to cement a deal!

1271
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:52,195
It kills me to cop out on you
like this, but I'm busted.

1272
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,999
- What an idiot.
- I guess I am, yeah.

1273
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,231
H-how could you be
so stupid and irresponsible

1274
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,199
as to allow some patently
cheap and thieving accountants

1275
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,316
to defraud you out of a future?

1276
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,233
How could anyone be that stupid?

1277
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,436
Aren't you a little out of line?

1278
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,035
I've made plans,
I've made commitments to people!

1279
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,156
Oh.

1280
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,233
You got a strange look in your
eye, like the guy from the book.

1281
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,154
Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde or
Ted Bundy, I can never remember.

1282
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,313
The time I've put in nurturing
an idea that's not gonna happen.

1283
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,755
Is that what it was? The money?

1284
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,071
I-I need my prescription,
my little blue pills

1285
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,151
so I'm gonna...go and get them.

1286
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,677
And I would very much appreciate it
if when I came back you were gone.

1287
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,478
Thank you.

1288
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,875
David, I'd like the cigarette
case back that I gave you.

1289
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,552
I don't think so.

1290
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,115
Wow.

1291
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,873
I asked you for lessons in life.

1292
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,190
I guess I really got one, right?

1293
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,790
(Lively jazz )

1294
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,079
Oh, we're so glad you could come!

1295
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,832
- How are you?
- Good.

1296
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:24,313
Langston wants to talk to you
about a theatre project in Aspen.

1297
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,755
- Do you ski?
- Me? No, never.

1298
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,311
Do either of you play miniature golf?

1299
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,311
- There's Minky.
- Hello.

1300
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,154
Oh, for heaven's sake! Er... Mingle.

1301
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,435
I don't think you should speak.

1302
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,318
- You said make conversation...
- I know.

1303
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,755
Make conversation but don't speak.

1304
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,195
You know,
don't bring up anything.

1305
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,113
Maybe the weather,
but don't...don't...

1306
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,988
I'm gonna get in the flow
and then kinda glide upstairs.

1307
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,992
- Shall I glide with you?
- No, I'll contact you.

1308
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,709
- Can I get you some champagne?
- Uh...sure.

1309
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,956
(Woman ) Ray!

1310
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,356
I was gonna make a phone call.

1311
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,829
- Have you seen Edgar?
- Edgar?

1312
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,832
Where that man gets off to!

1313
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,911
I was gonna make a phone call...

1314
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,719
- I'll look downstairs.
- Try back there.

1315
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,756
Thank you, Ray.

1316
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,390
(Man ) Oh, Winkler? Do you play golf?

1317
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,552
Golf? No. I was just
gonna make a phone call...

1318
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,677
Guess I was mis...misdirected.

1319
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,149
Yes, I'll just go and use the phone.

1320
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,755
I wanted a match on Sunday
but I'll get somebody else.

1321
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,796
So sorry.

1322
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,635
There'll be rain over
the tri-state area, and fog.

1323
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,269
Temperatures will hover
in the low 60s till Tuesday.

1324
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,672
(Laughs ) I must say,
you are most amusing.

1325
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,318
Would you like a canape?

1326
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,551
Those are shrimp,
these are Quail eggs, and...

1327
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,995
I don't have
any idea what they are.

1328
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,878
Thank you,
I hate things with toothpicks,

1329
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,632
they lodge in your throat.

1330
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,713
(Chuckles ) I'm George Blint,
Mutual Funds, and you?

1331
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,553
May Sloane, I'm a lookout.

1332
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,950
I noticed the way
you walked and carried yourself

1333
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,519
from across the room.

1334
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,229
You remind me
of my wonderful departed wife.

1335
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,437
You can't carry yourself
across the room,

1336
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,590
that's physically impossible.

1337
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,989
(Laughs ) You're charming.

1338
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,277
You're the first woman
I've met since Helen died

1339
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,952
that I could say that about.

1340
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,838
Was Helen your wife
or just a woman who died?

1341
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,518
Where's Mr Winkler?
I wanted to talk to him.

1342
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,672
Oh, he's mingling.
Cloudy today, wasn't it?

1343
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,036
With a chance of light sprinkles
followed by sunshine.

1344
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,715
Absolutely. Chi Chi, would you
get those photos in the bedroom?

1345
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,917
I want to show Mr Winkler
the property in Aspen.

1346
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,673
Yes, I just want to talk
to Dr Henske.

1347
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,399
He'd be perfect
to do Beth Kramer's face

1348
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,553
after the unbelievable job
he did on Mrs Morton's buttocks.

1349
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,710
Oh, I'm going to be right back.

1350
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,756
Would you just...?

1351
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,233
(Door opening)

1352
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,959
Ray...

1353
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,793
Shh! You scared me.

1354
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,758
- For God's sake.
- I came to warn you,

1355
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,559
Mrs Potter's coming
to get some pictures

1356
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,631
that Mr Potter wants you to see.

1357
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,392
She's looking for you.

1358
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,118
Now I've closed the safe.

1359
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,760
It's a tough safe,
I'm out of practice.

1360
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,355
- Did they see you come up here?
- Uh, I don't think so.

1361
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,273
(Sighs ) Get out there
and stand watch.

1362
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,920
I'm gonna do this again.

1363
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,433
Are you OK?

1364
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,512
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Get out, get out!

1365
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,151
If you could fit it in to
your schedule, it would mean so much.

1366
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,674
She's been so down since the divorce

1367
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,673
and don't you think -
he got custody of the Pola-Polas.

1368
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,469
Chi Chi, don't forget those
photographs for Mr Winkler.

1369
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,834
Oh, I'll get them.

1370
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,672
So, you will try?

1371
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,751
- I'll do my best.
- Kiss kiss.

1372
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,156
Mrs Potter is coming!

1373
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,754
(Footsteps fading)

1374
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,559
She's gone.

1375
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,870
- Shh!
- (She's gone.)

1376
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,439
She's gone.

1377
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,718
Mr Winkler wouldn't go without
saying goodbye, would he?

1378
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,791
He's not upstairs.

1379
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,199
Jesus.

1380
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,714
I met a wonderful man downstairs.

1381
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,552
He seemed to like me.

1382
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,598
He said I reminded him
of his wife who's dead,

1383
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,319
but I assume he meant
when she was alive.

1384
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,359
May, can you stop talking
while I'm doing this?

1385
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,718
Little short fella, bright
yellow shirt, unbelievable tie.

1386
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,316
Oh, yes, I know the gentleman,
he was going upstairs before.

1387
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,359
- Are you sure?
- Er, yes, um... Mr Winkler.

1388
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,996
Ray, I hear something.

1389
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,993
- Oh.
- Ooh!

1390
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,358
She's not feeling well.
She had one of her spells.

1391
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,670
- Spells?
- Yes, she gets spells.

1392
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,593
- We have a doctor...
- No, not necessary.

1393
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,591
I-I-I'm a haemophiliac.

1394
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,036
- Dear God, are you bleeding?
- Why would I be bleeding?

1395
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,439
Oh, no, she... Her neck...

1396
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,796
There is, but my nasal passages
are clearing up.

1397
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,348
On weekends
I do this for a hobby.

1398
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,319
- She had champagne, you know...
- Oh, I'll get Dr Henske.

1399
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,631
Really... Ray, you have
my cortisone pills?

1400
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,438
- Me?
- My medication?

1401
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,069
I'll feel better
if Dr Henske looks at her.

1402
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,277
You relax and I'll go get Dr Henske.

1403
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,673
A haemophiliac? Cortisone?
Where do you get this?

1404
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,718
- On TV.
- I said stay with the weather!

1405
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,189
I thought I did
some Quick thinking!

1406
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,033
Yes, and you're going
to be examined now!

1407
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,917
Why? I just had a check-up.

1408
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,753
Jesus, I got no time to work here.

1409
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,671
They'll be back in seconds.

1410
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,118
I can't tell the difference
between these!

1411
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,316
Then you gotta take 'em both.

1412
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,233
I can't, if they
don't find any necklace...

1413
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,359
we've been suspiciously seen
in here, I'll go right to jail!

1414
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,670
Especially with your DNA!

1415
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,433
What has my DNA got to do with it?

1416
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,069
You better choose,
they're gonna be back any minute.

1417
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,116
I ca... I ca...

1418
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,436
Ray, let's go!

1419
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,670
Oh... Grrr!

1420
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,432
All I know
is what I've told you, Doctor.

1421
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,114
She's right in here. Come along.

1422
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,395
Here's Dr Henske!

1423
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,471
What seems to be the trouble?

1424
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,630
False alarm, it was a hot flash.

1425
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,076
I think it was menopausal,
I've seen it before.

1426
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,594
I-I'm given to occasional spells.

1427
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,399
- Spells?
- Not spells, but she...

1428
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:50,190
No, no! Sometimes for no reason
I get hot and cold flashes

1429
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,955
and the room will spin
and spots will flash before my eyes

1430
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,429
and I'll hear
a ringing in my ears...

1431
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,909
You're making
too much of it, May.

1432
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,754
..and then my tongue turns black
and I can't swallow.

1433
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,114
Really?

1434
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,031
They diagnosed Parkinson's

1435
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,078
but it could be Ebola
or mad cow disease...

1436
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,311
We got to go...
It was a false positive, I think.

1437
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,550
Come on, sweetheart, we're due.

1438
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,155
I do hope you feel better,
and not to worry, Mr Winkler,

1439
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,435
Aspen will have to wait.

1440
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,034
Ebola virus or mad cow?

1441
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,556
I just said the first thing
that came into my mouth.

1442
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,029
- Great.
- Hello, again.

1443
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,157
George. Do I still remind you
of your wife?

1444
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,038
(Laughs ) You kill me, you're great.

1445
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,999
You're not feeling well,
remember? I'm taking her home.

1446
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,470
I'm in the book, May Sloane.
I'll be better.

1447
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,516
Well, I'll call you.

1448
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,554
Ray, I just got the news
about Frenchy.

1449
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,789
Frenchy?

1450
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,440
Didn't you hear? Sunset's gone under.

1451
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,988
She was defrauded out of every penny.

1452
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:06,074
- I figured you'd know.
- Yeah. No, I do know. I...I...

1453
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,832
(Ray ) Shit.

1454
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,919
(Ray ) I came as soon as I heard.

1455
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,473
I got exactly what I deserved.

1456
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,676
You know, I missed you, Frenchy.

1457
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,435
I'm sorry I blew our cookie company

1458
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,432
but I'm even more sorry
I blew our marriage.

1459
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,830
What are you gonna do?
Everybody makes mistakes.

1460
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,639
The important thing is
I still love you.

1461
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,234
I don't deserve it, I behaved badly.

1462
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,958
You behaved like an ass.

1463
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:49,635
That's one of those "A" words
you used to practise. Ass.

1464
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,918
But I'm not the easiest guy in
the world. I'm not Mr Sensitive.

1465
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,878
There's things
I coulda done differently.

1466
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,909
We stayed in separate rooms the
whole trip, Ray, that's the truth.

1467
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,991
So where's David now?

1468
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,958
He split the second I went bust.

1469
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,712
No, I don't believe it(!)

1470
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,075
He was hustling me for the dough.

1471
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,516
Jeez. So now we got to
begin again, you know?

1472
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,477
And in more ways than one.

1473
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,755
You still want me?

1474
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,230
Still want you?
You got to ask a Question like that?

1475
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,915
I'm crazy about you.
You're a goddess to me.

1476
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,276
I'm nuts for you.
Of course I want ya.

1477
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,079
But we're broke,
we haven't got a dime.

1478
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,799
We don't own a stick
of this furniture.

1479
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,236
Can I show you something?
May I show you one thing?

1480
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,470
- OK...
- Just let me...

1481
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,076
I think you're gonna be
very, very proud of me.

1482
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,117
That's Chi Chi Potter's!

1483
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,475
Was... Was Chi Chi... Was!

1484
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,516
- Ray!
- Key word, "was".

1485
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,909
- You didn't?!
- I never felt so great.

1486
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,594
I was back in action, I felt alive.

1487
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,195
- Cos I always felt...
- Hey, this is glass.

1488
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,113
What are you talking about?
How's it glass?

1489
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,078
- It's fake.
- What? How would you know?

1490
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,072
I can tell fake,
this ain't even good fake.

1491
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,515
What are you talking about?

1492
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,752
Oh, you know, it might fool some
idiot with no eye and no brains

1493
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,638
but it'd never pass
with a normal person.

1494
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,077
You're saying I got the phoney?
I came away with the wrong thing?

1495
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,037
Sounds like your MO.

1496
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,588
- Nuts! I was in the room...
- Yeah.

1497
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,515
I was gonna substitute the
glass one for the real one...

1498
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,149
It's good to see that you got
the same great instincts.

1499
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,073
You're so wrong...
Can I tell you...?

1500
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,515
- What?
- You take those lessons...

1501
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,194
Wait, I'm gonna show you something.

1502
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,113
..but you know nothing
about jewellery.

1503
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,715
This is... We take this
and fence it, go to Florida...

1504
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,279
It's the goods.

1505
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,750
That won't get us on the subway,
much less to Florida.

1506
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,910
You're such a know-everything.

1507
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,355
You don't have to be
a rocket scientist

1508
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,396
to spot a clinker like this.

1509
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,471
Whoever made it, you overpaid.

1510
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,949
What can I do if you're wrong?
Tell me.

1511
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,430
Can I take your nose
and twist it till you turn blue?

1512
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,953
Sure.

1513
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,439
(Banging)

1514
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,953
Gee... You broke it.

1515
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,031
It's glass, Ray.

1516
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,112
I know, but... Wh... Eh...

1517
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,599
It's, well...

1518
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,069
I'm not cleaning it up!
You broke it!

1519
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,594
You got glass over everything!

1520
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,035
It's dangerous, you...

1521
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,079
Jesus... I don't know what you
see in me, I'm such a screw-up.

1522
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,116
- It's glass!
- Ray...

1523
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,078
All that matters
is that we have each other.

1524
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,878
We didn't there for a while

1525
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,157
and it made me realise
how much I need you.

1526
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,834
But you're married
to a loser, Frenchy.

1527
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,718
No, I'm the luckiest woman
in the world.

1528
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,358
And the brokest.

1529
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,398
We got nothing.
As usual, I come up empty.

1530
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,879
We could pawn this.

1531
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,475
What is this? What is this thing?

1532
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,788
Who...?

1533
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,997
I don't understand,
who's the Duke of Windsor?

1534
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,991
We could probably auction it.

1535
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,594
- Where'd you get this?
- From David.

1536
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,318
David gave you this?

1537
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,958
He doesn't know it yet.

1538
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,235
I don't get it, what do you mean?

1539
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,233
Hey, it was you who taught me
how to open a safe.

1540
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:36,553
I... That was one of my fondest
memories of our time together.

1541
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,474
What are you saying?
You boosted this from David's safe?

1542
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,597
- Frenchy, that's stealing.
- Not exactly.

1543
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,433
It's a long story, Ray.
Let's sell it.

1544
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,159
I'll fill you in
on the flight to Miami.

1545
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,150
Sweetheart, you...

1546
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,958
are the greatest.

1547
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,671
<i>#</i> Oh, baby,
what I couldn't do

1548
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,514
<i>#</i> With plenty of money
and you, ooh

1549
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,912
<i>#</i> In spite of the worry
that money brings

1550
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,154
<i>#</i> Just a little filthy lucre
buys a lot of things

1551
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:27,268
<i>#</i> And I could take you
to places you'd like to go

1552
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,229
<i>#</i> But outside of that
I've no use for dough

1553
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,629
<i>#</i> It's the root of all evil

1554
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,280
<i>#</i> Of strife and upheaval

1555
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,351
<i>#</i> But I'm certain, honey

1556
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,477
<i>#</i> That life could be sunny

1557
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,757
<i>#</i> With plenty of money and you <i>#</i>

1558
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,869
