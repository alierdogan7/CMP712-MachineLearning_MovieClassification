ring mine first, please?

There's someone
ahead of you, sir.

- Okay.

I'm flying to L.A. to start
an anchor job in the local news,

that I'm sitting next to you.

So the cosmic purpose of our meeting
is for me to give you free advice.

Your hair's too big,
your brows are too dark,

and your foundation's
too orange.

Your perfume's too sweet.
It's the news, honey, not the prom.

- What about my accent?

I'm always being warned
to stop saying ''y'all.''

Don't ever stop saying ''y'all.''
Your ''y'all'' is your trademark.

Janet, how could you know
I'm wearing my yellow tie?
You can't even see me.

77

I can hear the stress
in your voice.

78
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,728
Whenever you're stressed,
you wear the yellow tie,

79
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,697
which makes you feel
all-powerful, so you're
probably gonna yell at me,

which I'm not in the mood for,
so don't.

- I am not stressed.

sleep last night. Can I
have today's work, please?

in my office, Janet?

is gonna have to do.

highly important people

1164
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,998
There is something else.

1165
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:16,127
I want you to find out
why the full moon looks orange
sometimes when it rises.

1166
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,607
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Janet. Goodnight.

1167
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,292
Hey, kid. Rusty.

1168
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

1169
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,762
Wanna help me
with something?

1170
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,933
- I think it might
get you back to your time.
- Sure.

1171
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,568
Good.

1172
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,144
Anything about me?

1173
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,048
Yeah. Anything
that'll take me back.

1174
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,144
Hmm.

1175
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,849
You know how I like
to find caterpillars...

1176
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,688
and put them in jars
and feed 'em...

1177
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,763
and watch 'em
make cocoons?

1178
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,536
No.

1179
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,605
And then one day,

1180
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,230
they break out
and it's really cool.

1181
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,974
No. Not a clue.

1182
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,479
But keep going.
Tell me some more stuff.

1183
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,415
Remember last summer
at Josie's birthday party...

1184
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,214
when I got Parmesan cheese
stuck up my nose?

1185
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:43,614
[Rusty]
Got any sixes?

1186
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,693
Nope. Go fish.

1187
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,955
Any fours?

1188
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,258
Negative. Go fish.

1189
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,769
Got any sevens?

1190
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,401
Tell me some more
about Dad.

1191
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,245
Sometimes...

1192
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,405
he lets me help him
work on the car.

1193
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,540
If I do something wrong...

1194
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,641
he yells at me.

1195
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,115
Sometimes he buys me
ice cream afterwards.

1196
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:18,317
But still,
I don't like messing up.

1197
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,827
Like last week...

1198
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,056
I lost a screw.

1199
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:25,725
I was afraid to tell him.

1200
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,265
I found it later on
in my pocket.

1201
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,932
Look, I still have it.

1202
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,571
I'm afraid
to give it back to him.

1203
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,317
Got any nines?

1204
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,616
No.

1205
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,854
My homeroom teacher last year
was fat Mrs. Kinkel man.

1206
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,760
She was so much better
than Mr. Lupus.

1207
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:59,231
He had that purple bump
on his face.

1208
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,564
I don't remember the bump guy.
What grade was that?

1209
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,638
How come you're asking me
all this stuff?

1210
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,969
'Cause I'm
forgetting something.

1211
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,508
I'm forgetting this one event
that meant something to me...

1212
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,602
and if I can remember that one thing,
maybe I can get you home.

1213
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,181
Are you sure it's not
the purple bump?

1214
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,910
- It's not the bump, kid.
- It was a pretty big bump.

1215
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,009
- Tell me more about second grade.
- Why?

1216
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,089
Nobody had a bump
in second grade.

1217
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:26,653
[ Rusty]
My best friend was Tim Wheaton,
until a few months ago.

1218
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,730
Remember him?

1219
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,798
[ Russ ]
No, I don't.

1220
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,891
- His house smells like fish sticks.
- No.

1221
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:37,904
Well, he was my best friend
until he started
hanging out with Vince...

1222
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,634
and these other creepy guys.

1223
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:44,143
He threw a rock at me
and we haven't been friends since then.

1224
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,545
- He threw a rock at us?
- Oh, yeah.

1225
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:50,140
- Why? What happened?
- Oh, those guys get together...

1226
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,812
every recess in the corner
of the playground yard...

1227
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,889
where they like
to pick on kids.

1228
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,493
Back behind the kindergarten.

1229
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,994
Yeah. Where the yard monitor
can't see you!

1230
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:04,565
- Where that big sliding board is?
- Yeah, the really huge one!

1231
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,634
- You remember it!
- Go on. Don't stop.

1232
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:09,727
There's four of them,
and if they don't like you...

1233
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,204
they make
your life a nightmare!

1234
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,944
And the worst thing
about them is they're
really mean to animals.

1235
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,281
Especially this one
three-legged dog.

1236
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,412
[Barking]

1237
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,513
Tripod!

1238
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:32,058
Tripod!
The dog's name is Tripod!

1239
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,357
I know the dog's name!
I know everything, kid.

1240
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,454
I know why you're here!
This is the event!

1241
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,693
Vince Kajinski, the fight!
The fight!

1242
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:43,760
It was my eighth birthday.
It was 32 years ago.

1243
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,363
Today! Ha, Ha, Ha!

1244
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,077
Holy smokes.

1245
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,416
Look at the car!

1246
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:04,455
Look at your clothes!

1247
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,520
[ Whispering ]
Holy smokes.

1248
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,259
- Holy smokes!
- Holy smokes!

1249
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:17,532
- We did it, kid!
- Am I home! Is it really 1 968?

1250
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,910
No doubt about it, kid.
What time's recess?

1251
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,914
- 1 0:30.
- Hang on, kid.

1252
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,280
We've got 1 5 minutes
to change our life.

1253
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,218
Okay, now listen.
This is gonna happen real fast,

1254
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,983
so you gotta remember
what Kenny told you, all right:
one, two, one, two.

1255
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,992
- One, two--
- Keep your head down, keep swingin'.

1256
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,685
[Bell Ringing]

1257
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,806
Look, look, look!
There's the really big slide, remember?

1258
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,376
[Russ]
It used to be a lot bigger.

1259
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,470
Here's what I remember:

1260
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,018
Some really bad guys
tie up that three-legged dog, Tripod.

1261
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,087
When you try to stop them,
you get really thrashed.

1262
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,179
Oh, no.
Do I save him?

1263
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,418
No. You go down
after only one punch,

1264
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,551
thereby solidifying
your reputation as a loser...

1265
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,687
for the next eight years,
all the way through high school...

1266
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,527
and ruining our life
from that moment on.

1267
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:21,067
Oh, holy smokes.

1268
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:24,969
Any second now, Vince Kajinski
and his cohorts are gonna
come around that corner.

1269
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:30,043
- Look. There they are.
- Hey, boo!

1270
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,773
They're gonna say something to you
to get you to come over there.

1271
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:36,180
Once you get back there,
they have Tripod tied up.

1272
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,775
Any questions?

1273
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,412
Yeah. What's a cohort?

1274
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,692
Hey, Rusty,
come over here.

1275
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:48,194
It's your birthday, right?
We got a present for you.

1276
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,891
Look, kid. You don't have
to do this at all.

1277
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,900
You don't have
to fight today.

1278
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,993
[Kid]
Come on, hurry up!

1279
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,874
No. If I don't
go against them today,

1280
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,879
I'll have to fight tomorrow
or the next day,

1281
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,541
and today,
you're here with me.

1282
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,142
That's right.
I'm here with you today.

1283
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:16,057
I can do this.

1284
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,889
You can do it.
Don't be afraid.

Come on, man, it'll be great.
Why don't you go?

- Yeah.
- It'll be fun.
There's your present.

- This stinkin', three-legged
dog's worthless.

Let the dog go.
You guys are dirt bags.

- Dirt bags!

- Uncle. I'm sorry.

1312
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:29,580
Yes! You won.

01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:32,159
- Holy smokes! You did it!
- Yabba-dabba-doo!

Ha, ha!
Yabba-dabba-doo is right.

- I did it, I did it!

That's all!
I did what I had to do.

Everything's gonna
be different now.

- [Russ]Oh, no.
- What?
