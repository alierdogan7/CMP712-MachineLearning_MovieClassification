He's sullen.

- Backstabbing.

[Choking And Gasping For Breath]

935
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:33,975
Bravo!

936
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:36,886
Bravo!

937
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:38,921
Bravo!

938
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:40,512
Bravo!

939
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:44,592
Bravo!

940
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:46,356
Bravo!

941
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:50,365
There were sailors, pirates,

942
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:54,369
and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

943
00:54:54,437 --> 00:54:57,133
all lost in the Triangle.

944
00:54:57,207 --> 00:55:00,074
Uncle Fester,
will you take me there someday?

945
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,077
It's a promise.

946
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:03,908
Good night, Wednesday.

947
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,912
Good night.

948
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:06,414
You were terrific.

949
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:09,583
Uncle Fester?

950
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:34,105
A theatrical triumph.

951
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:36,236
It's like a dream.

952
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:37,779
When we first met,

953
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:40,611
it was an evening much like this.

954
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:43,117
Magic in the air.

955
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:45,120
A boy.

956
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:46,917
A girl.

957
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,924
An open grave.

958
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:51,085
It was my first funeral.

959
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:54,619
You were so beautiful.

960
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:56,824
Pale and mysterious.

961
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,801
No one even looked at the corpse.

962
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:02,804
Your cousin Balthazar.

963
00:56:02,872 --> 00:56:05,204
You were still a suspect.

964
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:08,711
I couldn't stop staring at you

965
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:10,712
all through the eulogy.

966
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:16,047
Your eyes, your mustache,

967
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:17,984
your laugh.

968
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:21,556
You bewitched me.

969
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:25,617
I proposed that very night.

970
00:56:25,695 --> 00:56:27,128
Just think--

971
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:29,631
Someday we'll be buried here,

972
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:33,635
side by side, 6 feet under,

973
00:56:33,703 --> 00:56:36,137
in matching coffins,

974
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:38,470
our lifeless bodies

975
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:42,841
rotting together for all eternity.

976
00:56:44,914 --> 00:56:46,643
Cara mia.

977
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:50,544
Mon sauvage.

978
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:22,310
Hey, bigfoot.

979
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:27,514
Don't stare.

980
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,023
Just get me out.

981
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:37,298
Did you like the blood?

982
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:40,228
I was so proud.

983
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:41,235
Weren't we all?

984
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:43,932
Wednesday, play with your food.

985
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,975
Aah!

986
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:51,639
Aah!

987
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:53,875
Mama?

988
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,884
Who put this in here?

989
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,144
That's for company.

990
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:00,849
Rascals.

991
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,825
Doctor, you were so right.

992
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:05,588
What an evening.

993
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,493
[Morticia]
Fester fit right in.

994
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:08,791
The displacement is over.

995
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:11,026
Isn't that nice?

996
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,567
Does he really have to go?

997
00:58:12,635 --> 00:58:14,603
Yes, he does.

998
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,936
Well, if he insists upon leaving,

999
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:20,373
we shall mark the occasion.

1000
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:22,874
Tish?

1001
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:24,880
We've planned a farewell party.

1002
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:28,281
We've invited the entire clan.

1003
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:29,841
What a lovely gesture.

1004
00:58:29,919 --> 00:58:31,819
We're a family again,

1005
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:34,857
and we owe it all to you,
Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

1006
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:37,119
Please--Greta.

1007
00:58:37,193 --> 00:58:38,490
Greta.

1008
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:41,996
Fester, walk me out.

1009
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,370
I'm fine, Mother.

1010
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:49,871
I'm completely in control.

1011
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:51,873
They're not your family, Gordon.

1012
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:52,873
I am.

1013
00:58:52,942 --> 00:58:54,307
They don't love you.

1014
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:55,366
I do.

1015
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:57,879
They're evil
and corrupt and degraded.

1016
00:58:57,947 --> 00:59:00,347
I can give you that.

1017
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,849
I'm fine. Really.

1018
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:02,850
We'll see.

1019
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:03,851
Open up.

1020
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,814
A party?

1021
00:59:34,884 --> 00:59:37,318
For me?

1022
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:38,820
Here?

1023
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:46,884
Tish,

1024
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:50,865
how long has it been
since we've waltzed?

1025
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,833
Oh, Gomez.

1026
00:59:56,906 --> 00:59:58,339
Hours.

1027

~ Too legit, too legit to quit ~

1028
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:54,454

[Gibberish]

1038
01:01:09,812 --> 01:01:10,779
You're right.

1039
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:11,973
Far too long.

1040

[Gibberish]

1041
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,150
Don't let me out of your sight.

1042
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:21,656
Don't threaten me, Margaret.

1043
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,157
These people are abnormal.

1044
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:24,158
Don't exaggerate.

Oh, by all means.

1048
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:33,993
They're clients, Margaret.

1049
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,867
Wheeee!

1050
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:42,944
Wednesday?

1051
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,479
Yes, Mother?

1052
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:46,412
Would you run upstairs

1053
01:01:46,482 --> 01:01:48,313
and check on your uncle, please?

1054
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:49,942
Why, Lumpy Addams.

1055
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:52,351
Look at you.

1056
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,321
All grown up.

1057
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:07,835
Uncle Fester?

1058
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:11,905
[Gordon]
I understand.

1059
01:02:11,974 --> 01:02:13,339
[Mother]
I hope so.

1060
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:14,842
I'm counting on you.

1061
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,846
Don't let me down.
Don't buckle.

1062
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:19,347
It's not gonna be easy.

1063
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:20,712
There are people everywhere.

1064
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:23,718
You can do it
if you stop whining.

1065
01:02:23,786 --> 01:02:25,219
Nobody likes that.

1066
01:02:25,288 --> 01:02:26,812
It's unattractive.

1067
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:28,322
All right. Fine.

1068
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:31,155
I will try and reach
the vault tonight.

1069
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:33,422
But if I can't,

1070
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,430
well, then that's it.

1071
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:37,295
O.K., Mother?

1072
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:39,231
I knew it.

1073
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:40,599
You are a fake.

1074
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,070
Come here, my little one.

1075
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:44,071

I am blinded by such beauty.

Gomez Addams.

1081
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,297
You terrible flirt.

1082
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:43,297
Always was.

1083
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:44,298
At least with me.

1084
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:45,299

Tag-along!

1086
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:48,300
Why, Gomez, the Amor twins.

1087
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:50,305
I've heard so much about you.

1088
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:51,772
Morticia, you nabbed him.

1089
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:52,808
This darling man.

1090
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,001

How can I compete?

1093
01:03:57,179 --> 01:03:59,113
You're twice the woman I am.

1095

They're waiting for Fester.

1096

Amuse them.

Hello, Tully.

It's too intriguing.

Fester's king of the castle again,
isn't he?

1103
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:26,007
Fester's the older brother,
so he gets it all--

1104
01:04:26,075 --> 01:04:28,009
The house, the money,
you name it.

1105
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:29,601
Fester's single, isn't he?

1106
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:31,510
Are you, Mr. Alford?

1107
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,343
Why, Fauna--

1108
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,781
I'm Fauna.

1109
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,784
I'm Flora.

1110
01:04:36,852 --> 01:04:38,285
I'm flattered.

1111
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:40,254
Excuse me, ladies.

1112
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,794
I can't find her anywhere.

Out the back.

1115
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:51,127
Now pull yourself together.

1116

She'll turn up,
the little cockroach.

1117
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:55,470
Get to the party
or they'll suspect something.

1118
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:56,800
I'll be down soon.
