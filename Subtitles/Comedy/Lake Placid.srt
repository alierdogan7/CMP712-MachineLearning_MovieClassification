LAKE PLACID DivX By Rahul

1
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,604
They actually
pay you forthis,

2
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,606
to tag beaver?

3
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,607
Imagine.

4
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,609
Imagine.

5
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,610
Was that,
like, sarcastic?

6
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,613
'Cause I know what you
Fish and Game guys think

7
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,615
of county sheriffs.

8
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,617
We know you like to
give these one-word,

9
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,619
sarcastic answers.

10
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,622
Gee.

11
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,623
You ask me,

12
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,625
whatan animal
does in the wild

13
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,627
is his own business.

14
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,630
So long as he
doesn't do itto man.

15
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,632
I think Mark Twain
said that.

16
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,634
Yeah, I think he didn't.

17
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,627
butsince you said it,
I guess we're covered.

18
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,648
Everyone's a comedian,
sarcastic.

19
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,741
 I'm sleepin'?

20
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,743
 And right in the middle
of a good dream ?

21
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,745
 And all atonce
I wake up?

22
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,749
  From something that keeps
knocking atmy brain ?

23
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,751
  Before I go insane?

24
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,744
  I hold my pillow
to my head...?

25
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,768
[squeaking]

26
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,780
Aah!Aah!

27
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,794
  So whatam I
so afraid of? 

28
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,796
  I'm afraid
that I'm notsure of... 

29
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,798
[gurgling]
Help!

30
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,801
[gurgling]

31
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,803
  I think I love you ?

32
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,806
  Isn't that what life
is made of?

33
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,808
 Though it worries...?

34
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,809
Aah ha!

35
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,811
Ohh! Ohh!

36
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,804
No!Aah!

37
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,836
Aah!

38
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,837
Aah!

39
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,841
[growling]

40
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,843
Ohh! Don't let go!

41
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,836
Oh ho ho!

42
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,842
Aah!

43
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,853
Aw,Jesus Christ.

44
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,859
[siren]

45
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,875
[horns honking]

46
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,868
[horns honking]

47
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,882
Kelly?

48
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,884
Hey, Kevin.

49
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,885
Hi.

50
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,888
Listen, uh, could I
stealyou for a minute?

51
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,881
[panting]

52
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,900
What are you doing?

53
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,902
Heavy breathing,
meditating.

54
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,903
Meditating?

55
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,905
Yes.To relieve stress.

56
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,906
Remember, Myra,
you're the one

57
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,908
who taughtme
all about breathing.

58
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,910
Yes, butyou're doing Lamaze.
are you giving birth?

59
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,913
If you're upset,
long, deep breaths.

60
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,915
[inhales, exhales]

61
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,917
[exhales]

62
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,918
Kevin dumped me.

63
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,922
I know.

64
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:10,923
He told you?

65
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,916
Well, I sort of had, uh,
inside information.

66
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,933
You?

67
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,935
Itstarted before you,
Kelly.

68
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,936
I neverwould have--

69
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:24,937
You?

70
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,940
Itwas justa quick thing
thatwe thoughtwas over,

71
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,942
and...it's notover.

72
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,944
You and Kevin.

73
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,948
I--I wish I could
say something to...

74
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,941
the heartwants
whatthe heartwants.

75
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:51,964
Sheriff Keough?

76
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,965
Yeah.

77
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,968
Fish and Game.
Jack Wells.

78
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,970
Any recent
bear attacks?

79
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,971
This was no bear.

80
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,973
Bears don'tattack
people underwater.

81
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,976
Probably a beaver,then.

82
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,969
Ah, a whole sentence
sarcastic.

83
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,992
Thatthe way
he came outofthe water?

84
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,985
Yeah.

85
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,008
Hey.

86
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,010
Hey, Kevin,what's going on?
What's happening?

87
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,012
How's it goin'?
How's yourfamily? Good?

88
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,014
It's great.
So nice to see you.

89
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,015
Fuck off.

90
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,016
This is business.

91
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,019
There was an accident
in Maine.

92
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,021
Some guy got killed
by something in a lake.

93
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:53,025
Probably a bear,
butthey found a tooth.

94
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,026
Atooth?

95
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,027
Afragmentof a tooth,

96
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,030
one they say couldn't
have come from any bear.

97
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,034
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

98
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,036
Oh,well,then I'm sure
thatthat's what itwas.

99
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,038
He was killed
by a dinosaur.

100
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,040
Is there anything else?

101
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,041
I, uh,wantyou
to go there.

102
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
What?

103
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,046
It's probably nothing,
butyou're a paleontologist.

104
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,048
This is whatwe do.

105
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,049
What do you mean,
this is whatwe do?

106
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,051
I'd like you to
check outthis tooth.

107
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,053
I'm nota field person.

108
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,056
Well, on this one,
I would like you to be.

109
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:28,049
You wantme to go to Maine
to look ata tooth?

110
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,064
Oh,this was Myra's
idea,wasn't it?

111
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,066
- Uh--
-Oh, of course.

112
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,067
Getme outofthe office
for a few days,

113
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,068
waittill I cool off...

114
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,070
It has nothing
to do with that.

115
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,072
I don't do field work,
and even if I did, Maine?

116
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,074
I'm allergic to timber.

117
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,076
- Kelly.
- I am not going to Maine.

118
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,078
I'm not going
to Maine.

119
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,071
It's ridiculous.

120
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,087
It's gonna be rough

121
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,089
as we go over
these mountains.

122
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,091
Yeah,that's fine.
Thank you.

123
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:03,095
We're doing
the bestwe can.

124
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,098
Could you not
talk to me?

125
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:10,091
Thank you.

126
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,110
Keough:
Justcame up screaming.

127
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,111
Kelly:What did he say?

128
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,114
Just kind of gurgled.
He was pretty much dead.

129
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,116
You didn'tsee anything?

130
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,118
The lake was calm
until up he came.

131
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,119
The tooth is in here.

132
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,121
Oh,that's--
that's the morgue.

133
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,123
Yes.

134
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,126
Well, is the dead guy
in there?

135
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,130
That's where they
keep them.

136
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,131
Look...

137
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,133
you wantme to bring
the tooth out here?

138
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,134
No.

139
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,136
No. Let's...

140
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,137
Afteryou.

141
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,138
[door closes]

142
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,142
This is reptilian.
And this is nota fossil.

143
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,144
You really pulled this
outofthis guy?

144
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,146
Yes, I did.

145
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,149
I'll need to get
a microscopic look at it.

146
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,150
There you go.

147
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,154
Great.

148
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,155
Maybe I should see--

149
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,158
I wouldn't.

150
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,151
I can deal with
dead men--bodies.

151
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,167
Ohh.

152
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,160
Uhh. Ohh,jeez.

153
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,178
How long did this attack
go on for?

154
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,181
Seconds.
8 maybe 10.

155
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,184
Oh, and, uh,this is how
he came up to the boat?

156
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,185
Yes.

157
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,188
Uh-huh.

158
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,192
I'd like
to see this lake.

159
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,195
Keough: Nobody lives
within 25 miles of it,

160
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,198
exceptsome old couple
who live righton the lake.

161
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,200
Teenagers trek in
every once in a while

162
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,202
to skinny-dip.

163
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,204
None have disappeared.

164
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,206
None have spotted
anything unusual.

165
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,208
Did you talk
to the old couple?

166
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,209
Notyet.

167
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,211
What kind of backup
do we have?

168
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,212
We?

169
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,214
What?

170
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,217
I'm a little unclear
as to why the museum

171
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,218
would send
somebody here.

172
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,219
You gota thing
againstmuseums?

173
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,221
No, I got nothing
againstmuseums.

174
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,214
Ever been in one?

175
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,230
What is that?

176
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,232
Lightweightforward-area
air-device unit.

177
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,234
Whatever's outthere,

178
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,236
one shotwith this,
it's dead.

179
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,238
Why exactly
would you have that?

180
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,240
[buzzing]

181
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,233
God.

182
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,249
Mosquitoes. I gota thing
aboutmosquitoes.

183
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,250
If you're all set,
let's go.

184
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,252
We're saved.

185
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,253
Amuseum in New York

186
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,256
just sent us some
additional backup.

187
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,258
Kelly Scott.

188
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,260
Jack Wells.

189
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,261
Hi.

190
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,263
Uh, some museum
sentyou, huh?

191
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,265
What, are we all
museum bigots in Maine?

192
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,266
She's rude sarcastic.

193
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,268
You two should
get along.

194
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,270
I'm afraid I can't letyou
go with us, ma'am.

195
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,272
Sheriff Keough
said I could.

196
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,274
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedes the sheriff.

197
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,276
Why do you have to supersede?
Maybe I might be of--

198
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,277
Ma'am, look,

199
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,279
this isn'tsome kind of
fact-finding expedition.

200
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,281
Yes, I knowthat.

201
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,282
It's nota science trip.

202
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,283
Could you be
a little more condescending?

203
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,287
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

204
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,289
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

205
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,291
I appreciate
you're trying to help.

206
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,294
I'm really glad that you
brought the raid.

207
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,295
Now,that's better.

208
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,296
Ma'am,
it's not gonna work--

209
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,298
If you call me ""ma'am""
one more time, I'll sue you,

210
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,299
and with today's laws,
it's possible.

211
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,302
She's good.

212
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,304
Look, I won't interfere.

213
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,306
And if I do,you've got
a sheriff handy to arrestme,

214
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,309
but I understand if I threaten
your Fish and Game authority--

215
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,310
Excuse me.

216
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,311
Is ittrue
you're going to look

217
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,313
for some kind of monster
in Black Lake?

218
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,316
Well,we're just gonna
investigate an accident.

219
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,317
There's no monster.

220
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,319
We heard a man
was bit in half.

221
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,321
Well,
there was an accident.

222
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,314
That's all. It's
nothing to worry about.

223
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,331
Oh, please.

224
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,324
All right. Let's go.

225
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,357
Well, my husband
passed away.

226
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,360
It's been
almost 2 years now.

227
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,362
My department doesn't
have any record ofthat,

228
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,364
Mrs. Bickerman.

229
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,365
Well, I'm sorry.

230
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,368
Incomplete records
hauntme so.

231
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,370
Whatwas the cause
of your husband's death,

232
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,373
ma'am, do you know?

233
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,375
We don't mean
to invade your privacy,

234
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,377
but was he ill?
Was he sick?

235
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,378
Was he swallowed?

236
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,379
[whispers]
Sheriff!.

237
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,381
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,
the reason we're here.

238
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,383
Aman was fatally
attacked yesterday

239
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,386
by some animal
in this lake.

240
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,388
Do you know
howyour husband died?

241
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,389
Oh,yes.

242
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,393
I killed him.

243
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,394
You killed him?

244
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,395
Oh,yes.

245
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,396
Wells: Uh...

246
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,400
and how would you have
accomplished this, ma'am?

247
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,401
Well...

248
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,403
He was very sick,

249
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,406
and--and he refused
to go to a doctor.

250
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,409
He'd be coherent one day
and incoherent the next.

251
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,412
And,well,
one coherent day

252
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,413
he asked me to end
his suffering.

253
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,415
And, um...

254
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,418
he kept insisting
and insisting

255
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,421
and then,well,
finally Ijust gave in,

256
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,423
and I hit him on the head
with a skillet,

257
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,416
then buried him
out at the bulkhead.

258
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,431
Well, dig him up
if you don't believe me,

259
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,424
Sherlock.

260
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,442
Keough: Half mile up
there's a clearing.

261
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,444
What's with the water?
It's so black.

262
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,446
There's no waves
or anything.

263
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,448
Well,theywanted to
call it ""Lake Placid,""

264
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,452
butsomebody said
that name was taken.

265
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,455
It's too bad.

266
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,457
Tents were sent
ahead.

267
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,458
They should
already be set up

268
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,460
by the time
we getthere.

269
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,461
Tents?

270
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,462
We're staying
in tents?

271
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,465
I told you, 2 days
we'd have to camp.

272
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,467
Yes, camp,

273
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,468
but I thought that meant
""Ramada Inn.""

274
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,470
I never heard tents.
Will there be toilets?

275
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,472
Maybe we should
justtake you back.

276
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,475
Why, because
I prefer a toilet?

277
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,476
Oh, God.

278
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,478
We forgot to pack
feminine napkins.

279
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,479
Oh, so you're
with him now?

280
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,480
Taking his side.

281
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,482
I didn't
say a word.

282
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,484
Oh, no, maybe I should
just wipe myself

283
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,486
with some leafy little piece
of poison oak.

284
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,487
And then I could
spend the whole day

285
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,490
scratching my ass,
blending in with the natives.

286
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,492
Then you'd be back
on my side.

287
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,494
You know,you really
don't have to bother

288
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,496
telling people
you're from New York.

289
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,497
What the hell
is that?

290
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,498
What?

291
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:50,502
There. I thought
I saw something.

292
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,505
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

293
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,507
Oh, my God.

294
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,509
Aah!

295
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,510
Aah!

296
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,511
Hey.

297
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,513
You threw it at me!

298
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,514
Ijust let go of it.

299
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,516
You threw it at me!

300
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,517
Did you see that?
Oh!

301
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,518
Ma'am!

302
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,520
Stop hitting me.

303
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,521
Don't throw heads
at me!

304
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,523
Stop calling me
""ma'am!""

305
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,525
Aw,Jesus.

306
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,526
Oh, God.

307
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,529
So, sheriff...

308
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,522
howm any deputies you got?

309
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:28,529
What?

310
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,545
Could it be a bear?

311
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,547
I mean,the bears
get big here, right?

312
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,551
Hmm. I don't think a bear
could bite off a moose's head.

313
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,553
Everything you need
should be in there.

314
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,555
Ok. Good. Good.

315
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,556
So will we be
tent-mates then?

316
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,558
Nope.
This is all yours.

317
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,560
Ohh. Great.

318
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,561
Excellent.

319
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,562
If there's anything else
you need...

320
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,564
Uh, one thing
I wanted to ask you.

321
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,566
Uh,what's it like
to be a woman

322
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,568
in the woods of Maine?

323
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,570
I mean,the guys don't turn
all horny or anything

324
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,563
like they did in
Deliverance, right?

325
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,578
Oh.

326
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,580
I knew you were there.

327
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,582
Hmm.

328
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,584
Never been to Maine
before, huh?

329
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,588
I have good hygiene.
I'm not welcome.

330
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,589
Why are you here,
really?

331
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,591
I told you.

332
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,593
A museum doesn't send an
investigator into the woods--

333
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,594
How would you know

334
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,595
what a museum would
or would not do exactly?

335
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,597
Well, even if they did,

336
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,600
I doubtwhether he or she
would have problems with tents.

337
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,601
So I don't like tents.
Why--

338
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,603
Oh,you don't like tents,
and you don't like mosquitoes.

339
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,604
Well, nobody likes
mosquit--

340
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,605
Look at
your finger nails.

341
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,607
What's wrong
with my finger nails?

342
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,608
You have as much business
being in the woods

343
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,610
as Emily Post.

344
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,611
No, it doesn't make sense.

345
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,614
They sent you out here
to examine a tooth.

346
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,618
And what are you doing
out here on the lake?

347
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,620
Oh, no.

348
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,623
What?

349
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,627
Ifthis is
who I think it is...

350
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,628
It is.

351
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,630
Who?

352
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,631
Hector Cyr.

353
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,624
He's this rich, kook
mythology professor.

354
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,641
You know him?

355
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,643
He's done some work
with our museum.

356
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,646
He also treks the world to s...

357
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,647
What?

358
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,640
To swim with crocodiles.

359
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,655
Crocodiles?

360
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,656
If he's here,

361
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,659
he must think
you've gotone.

362
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,660
Oh, look...

363
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,662
I admit I'm no
brain scientist,

364
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,665
but I do know there's
no way a crocodile

365
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,658
can be in Maine, right?

366
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,672
You beat me!

367
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,674
Balls!

368
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,675
Splendid lake, eh?

369
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,677
Became a man
on a lake like this.

370
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,679

371
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,681
Sylvia Blake.

372
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,683
She gave a like a cow.

373
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,684
Who do we have
from Fish and Game?

374
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,685
Me.

375
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,686
Who is this man?

376
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,688
I can see the algae blooms
justcoming in.

377
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,690
Look almost stagnant.

378
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,691
Hector Cyr.

379
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,692
Oh,the earth is round
and so should you be.

380
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,694
Who is he?

381
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,696
I need topographic studies.
You got any?

382
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,698
You don't justfly in here
and start barking orders.

383
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,700
I apologize. Ijust don't
wantto lose the light

384
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,702
when we gottime
for a quick scout.

385
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,703
Have you had
a little work done?

386
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,704
I have not.

387
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,705
Who are you?

388
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,707
Hector Cyr.
I said itonce.

389
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,708
Letme know
when its inks in, ok?

390
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,709
Have you seen it?

391
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,710
No.

392
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,712
Excuse me.
You came here to...

393
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,714
help you find it.

394
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,715
A crocodile?

395
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,716
Yeah.

396
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,718
They've been migrating north,
you know?

397
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,719
This lake does connect
to the ocean.

398
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,721
It's not as far fetched
as it may sound.

399
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,723
Crocodiles can't swim
in saltwater.

400
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,726
Yeah,well,that'll be
your little secret.

401
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,729
Come on.
We're losing time.

402
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,730
Why did the big one
heckle me?

403
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,723
Hey, pal...

404
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,762
If he's close,
we'll find him.

405
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,765
Their signatures
are unmistakable.

406
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,769
She tellyou
that we had sex together?

407
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,770
So vigorous!

408
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,772
I never had sex
with you.

409
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,775
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

410
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,776
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

411
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,777
God.

412
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,778
Wait.

413
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:27,779
Stop!

414
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,771

415
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,785

416
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,787
Thought
I heard something.

417
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,789
I don't mean
to be discourteous,

418
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,791
but, uh, how is it

419
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,793
a person could come
to believe

420
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,795
a crocodile
is in New England?

421
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,797
How could it
survive winter?

422
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,799
Long as their nostrils
don't freeze,

423
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,800
they survive.

424
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,802
Am I foolish
to explain things?

425
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,803
He had such trouble
with my name.

426
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,805
- Hector.
- Hey.

427
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,806
Is this
where it happened?

428
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,808
Around here.
Yeah.

429
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,810
We're a mile from the ocean.
Could've easily made it here.

430
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,811
Kelly:Assuming he got
this far up the seaboard.

431

[sonar pinging]

432
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,814
The big ones
have been on the move.

433
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,816
What have I been telling you?
You call me crazy.

434
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,818
Kelly:
Hector,just paddle.

435
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,820
You know, Sheriff,

436
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,822
when friends or family
say things,

437
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:11,823
they tend not to register,

438
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,825
so sometimes it helps
to hear it

439
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,826
from a total stranger.

440
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,828
You're fat.

441
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,830
Jesus. Hector!

442
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,831
Oh,yeah.

443
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,834
Kelly:What's that?

444
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,835
What is it?

445
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,838
White perch.

446
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:27,839
Are they feeding?

447
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,841
They aren'tfeeding.

448
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,844
They're scared.

449
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,846
-Aah!
-Aah!

00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:40,841
Oh!

453
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,856
Get your legs
out of the water.

454
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:45,857
Don't move
your legs.

455

Keough:
Are you kidding me?

456
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,851
Cyr:
Keep your legs still.

457
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,865
Get off!.

458
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,866
Hector,
to the left.

459
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,868
Move it left!

460
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:57,869
Paddle, paddle!

461
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,872
No one actually saw
anything.

462
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,874
Yes, I realize that, sir,

463
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:03,875
but something
flipped us over,

464
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,878
and I doubt very much
if it was a mink.

465
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:07,879
I am a paleontologist.

466
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,881
I work for
a natural history museum.

I am notsome--

468
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,884
They don't believe her.

469
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,885
Thank you.

470
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,887
It's so rewarding to
imagine my tax dollar

471
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,889
finding its way to you,
you fuck-shit!

472
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,892
You're a saucy flirt.

473
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:21,893
You were right.

478
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:28,900
Yeah?

479
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,893
Might wanna come
take a look atthis.

480
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,906
Oh, my God.

481
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,907

about worms.

00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,917
Some decomposition,
a little acidic--

485
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,910
definitely
been swallowed.

486
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,926
Is this the man
who was killed?

487
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,928
He seemed taller.

488
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,930
Phew.

489
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,931
You gota croc,
all right.

They're
a keystone species.

491
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,935
Did he just
explain something?

492
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,938
Keystone species effects
the whole ecosystem.

493
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,940
That would explain
these worms

494
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,943
and those perch.

495
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,946

  It's not unusual ?

 To have fun with anyone?

504
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,978

hangin' around ?

509
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,986
It's a trap.

510
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,990
You accepted money
from him?

because I believe in being
straightwith people.

547
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,061
I think you are a mental.

548
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,064
Sheriff...

549
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,066
I appreciate your candor.
Really, I do.

550
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,068
I think it's always good
to know

551
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,070
where somebody's
coming from,

552
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,071
and,frankly,

553
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:24,064
your origins have been
a bitof a mystery to me.

[crickets chirping]

Look howflat
thatwater is.

556
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,099
You could get 10 skips
on a good one, easy.

557
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,100
Sorry?

Skipping stones.

559
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,105
Growing up,

560
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,107
I used to summer
atmy grandparents' place

561
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,109
on a lake like this.

562
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,112
I'd skip stones all day.

563
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,114

with the other kids.

564
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:07,118
I'm sure it did.

565
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,121
Look, I think it's best

566
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,123
if you stayed onshore
a while.

567
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,124
I beg your pardon?

568
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,126
I'm not trying
to pick a fight,

569
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,128
but what ever's out there
did flip a canoe.

570
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,130
I am not
staying onshore.

571
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,132
It's dangerous.

572
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,134
No, I didn't fly up here
just to roast marshmallows.

573
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,136
Why did you fly up here?

574
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,137
Look...

575
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,139
paleontologists are not
sentto Maine

577
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,142
I was sent up here
to look atthe tooth.

578
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,144
You looked atthe tooth.

579
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:37,137
What are you doing
out here?

580
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,152
I was dating my boss...

581
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:45,156
and he turned out to be
involved with a coworker

582
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,158
who was also my friend.

583
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,160
And for the sake
of comfort--theirs--

584
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,162
I was shipped off
to Maine.

585
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:55,155
And I don't feel
like going back yet.

586
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,171
I'm not making it up.

587
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,172
Still,you don't
have to stay out here.

588
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,174
I mean,
you can stay in town.

589
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,176
I've come. I'm here.
I'm staying...

590
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,177
unless there are ticks.

591
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,179
I know crocodiles.

592
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,181
And I won't
get in yourway.

593
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:14,174

to be a part ofthis.

are you doing?

are you doing?!

Oh,Jesus.

I'm laying
a spring trap!

610
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,315
I keep telling you
they can come on land.

00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,317
I could've shotyou.

612
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,319
This could end up
saving your life,

613
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,320
which is meaningful
for you,

614
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,322
because the more
you live,

615
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,324
the more sex you getto
have with your sister!

616
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,325
What's going on?

617
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,327
He's crawling around
like a cockroach here.

618
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,328
I don'tcare
how much money--

619
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,330
He's waving
his little wang around!

620
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,331
He's scaring the shit
outof me!

621
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,332
How big is this?

622
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,333
All right, all right!

623
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,335
I'll say this once.

624
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,336
Your fancy equipment
aside,

625
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,338
which we appreciate--

626
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,341
if you interfere,
you're gone.

627
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:54,334
Simple as that.

628
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,351
How much of a wacko
is this guy?

629
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,353
Well...

630
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,355
the thing about Hector

631
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,357
is he takes this
crocodile business very...

632
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,359
Oh, man.

633
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,361
He thinks they're godly.

634
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,363
Whatwas that?

635
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,364
In his defense,

636
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,366
every primitive culture
known to man deified them.

637
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,369
Ancient China, Egypt,
Australia,Asia.

638
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,371
Going back in history,

639
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,373
crocodiles have been
more worshipped than Jesus.

640
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,375
Is this supposed
to make us

641
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,376
take him
more seriously?

642
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,378
No, it's supposed to make you
understand him.

643
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,380
He's a mythology professor.

644
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,382
He believes
thatthey're divine conduits.

645
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,384
And he can find them,

646
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,385
so we should try
to put up with him.

647
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,388
He's a fruitcake.

648
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,390
We should get
some sleep.

649
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,391
Yeah.

650
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,392
Aah!

651
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,393
Damn it!

652
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,386
And he's a good trapper.

[squawking noise]

654
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,420
We can expect
a quick response

655
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,421
if he hears that.

656
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:14,425
Adult crocs will move
on distressed hatchlings.

657
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,426
Again, I don'tmean
to be annoying

00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,428
with my questions

659
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,429
but if
it is a crocodile,

660
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,431
which I don'tthink
it is,

661
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,434
and they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds,

662
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,437
why would you want to be
underwater at the time?

663
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,439
With you,
it makes sense.

664
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,440
You see, Sheriff,
the thing is,

665
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,441
they don't really
attack underwater.

666
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,443
ThatWalt guy
got hit underwater.

667
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,445
True.They don'tsee
that well underwater.

668
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,447
They have nictitating
lenses on their eyes...

669
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,449
Burke, stop here.

670
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,450
- Now?
-Yeah.

671
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,452
...You dive underwater

672
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,453
and they probably won't
be able to see you.

673
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,455
Wells: I hate to interrupt
but we got work to do.

674
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,457
Hey,we can talk if we want.

675
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,459
Yeah,we can talk
if we want.

676
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,452
Would you mind putting down
the anchor?

677
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,466
Wait till
we're down there

678
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,468
before you turn
that thing on.

679
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,470
Got it.

680
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,473
Let's go, Hector.

681
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,466
Good luck.

682
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,487
I brought a pork chop
for luck.

683
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,489
Maybe you can hang it
around you neck.

684
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,491
That's sweet.

685
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,493
Maybe later you can
chew the bark

686
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,486
off my big,fat log.

687
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,493
Was that, like,
a homosexual remark?

688
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:39,499
Don'task me.

00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,560
Could be a mental.

691
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,562
I heard if a mental person
is rich enough,

00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,563
they justcall him
eccentric.

693
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,565
He's notmental.

694
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,567
He's seen every crocodile
in the world.

695
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,569
He even swam in the Grametti
with killer Niles.

696
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,571
He never got nipped.

697
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,573
And that's why he thinks
they're godly--

698
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,574
'Cause they don't
bite him?

699
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,576
I don't know.

700
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,578
He said he knew it when
he looked in their eyes.

""Eyes of a Dragon.""

702
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,638
So much for crocodiles.

703
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,655
It's probably on land.

704
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,648
Yeah, right.

705
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,661

I don't know.

the anchor line!

710

Untie the line!

[stalling]

729
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,698
Ok!

730
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:08,708
Oh!

731
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,714
Hurry!

732
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,728
Hurry.

733
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,721
My God,
it's right underyou!

734
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,737
Aah! Oh, Christ.

735
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,738
Come on,
get in the boat.

736
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,740
You all right?

737
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,741
Yeah.

738
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,743
Where's Hector?

739
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,744
[grunts]

740
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,745
I losttrack.

741
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:38,738
We went different
directions.

742
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,747
There's some bubbles
overthere.

743
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,768
Pull it up.

744
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,772
All right. Come on.
Bring him aboard.

745
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:02,773
Hector:What's happened?

746
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,774
Come on.

747
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,776
You see it?
How big is it?

748
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,778
Shut up
and geton board.

749
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,780
We losttrack of it.
Burke, pull up the speaker!

750
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,784
Are you all right?

751
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:17,777
[squawking noises]

752
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,795
[screaming]

753
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:25,796
-Grab him!
-Aah!

754
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,798
Pull him in!

755
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,800
Pull him in!

756
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,803
Aah!Aah!

757
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,804
That it?

758
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,807
Yeah.

759
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,809
Nobody actually saw it.
It happened suddenly.

760
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,812
Didn't get caught
in the out board?

761
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,805
It wasn't the outboard.

762
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,815
Tell them
to get here fast, huh?

763
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,831
You ok?

764
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,834
Kelly?

765
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,837
Yeah.

766
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,839
Nobody saw anything.

767
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,842
No.

768
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,844
U.S Wildlife's
on theirway.

769
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,846
The police wantto keep
everything quiet

770
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,849
so the press doesn't
getwind of anything.

771
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,852
Everybody just wants us
to...

772
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,845
""Sit tight.""

773
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,864
Are you...ok?

774
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:34,865
Well...

775
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,869
you know...

776
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,862
Yeah.

777
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,878
Well, Sheriff,
I'm, uh...

778
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,882
Very sorry
about your deputy.

779
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,885
He was a good man?

780
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,889
Yep.

781
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,891
Whenever somebody dies,
I...

782
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,893
I always think
that it's such a waste

783
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,896
that I didn't know them
any better.

784
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,900
Sorry for your loss,
Hector.

785
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,893
Not really what I meant.

786
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,908
Head was just...

787
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,912
bitten off.

788
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,914
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare

789
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,916
that I was headless.

790
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:26,917
I'd be down
on the ground

791
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,919
looking up atmy body,
no head,

792
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,922
just walking around
bumping into everything.

793
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,924
And my parents...

794
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,926
wouldn't letme
in the house.

795
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,928
Because they just bought
all these antique lamps,

796
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,929
and they didn't wantme
to knock them over,

797
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,930
the fuckers.

798
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,933
Then the neighborhood
bullies,

799
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,934
they'd see my round
head on the ground

800
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,936
looking like a ball,

801
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:46,937
and they'd come over,

802
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,939
and they'd start
a soccer game.

803
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:49,940
And as I was being
kicked around,

804
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,942
I'd actually
just feel grateful

805
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,935
for being allowed
in the game.

806
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,949
What are--
what are your thoughts?

807
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,952
You know, Hector...

808
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,954
I'm sure
you're a fine person

809
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,957
in your own mental way,

810
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:07,958
but I think it would be best

811
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,951
if you and I didn't speak.

812
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,966
Yaaah!

813
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,969
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

814
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,962
I'm still waiting
to confirm if they...

815
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,977
Oh,Jesus.

816
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,979
I--I could probably
cut him down,

817
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,982
but there's this
odd look of mayhem

818
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,985
on his
upside-down face.

819
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:35,986
Hank.

820
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:36,987
Yes?

821
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,989
Are you all right?

822
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,992
Could you cut me down?

823
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:42,993
Do you promise

824
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:43,994
that you won't attempt
to injure me?

825
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,997
I have no interest in ever
looking at you, Hector.

826
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,000
Ok.

827
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,002
Just, uh, pull him down.

828
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,006
It's a counter weight.

829
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,007
Here. I'll get the knife.

830
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,009
If I'd remembered
it was there,

831
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,011
I never would've let
you walk that way.

832
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,000
I never would've let
you walk that way.

833
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,014
All right. It's over.

834
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,015
It's over. Remember?

835
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,017
You promised
not to hurt him, so...

836
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,019
I lied.

837
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,020
Wait. Hey! Hey!

838
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,022
Come on! Hold up!

839
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,023
Now here to go,
my friend.

840
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,026
Now,just--come on!
Knock itoff!.

841
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,027
Knock itoff.
Put that down.

842
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,028
Just settle...

843
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,030
[roaring]

844
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,033
Jesus! Look out!

845
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,036
Whoa!

846
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:30,029
[roaring]

847
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,048
Aw, shit!

848
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:42,041
[groaning]

849
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,067
Ok.

850
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,069
I admit it.

851
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:02,072
It's a crocodile.

852
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,074
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

853
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,077
Scales were oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

854
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,080
Why would he come here?
It's impossible.

855
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,082
Asia.
How would he get here?

856
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,084
Obviously some
asshole in Hong Kong

857
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,085
flushed him
down the toilet.

858
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,087
He was 30 feet, right?
Had to be.

859
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,090
Well, nowmaybe somebody's
happy I broughtmy big gun.

860
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,092
Oh you're gonna
blow him away now?

861
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,093
I should think so.

862
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,094
With your cannon?

863
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,095
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

864
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,096
Well, he's a miracle
of nature,

865
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,098
but I know
he's very scary.

866
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,100
You're the miracle
of nature.

867
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,102
Guys, guys, easy.

868
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,104
We're not gonna do
anything tonight.

869
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,107
I never heard of a crocodile
crossing an ocean.

870
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,109
Well,they conceal
information

871
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,110
like that in books.

872
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,111
All right, pal!

873
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,112
Hey, hey, hey.

874
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,115
No, no.
Let him go.

875
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,116
I'm sick
of him,too.

876
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,117
I do need to warn
you, Sheriff.

877
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,119
The thing
about being rich,

878
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,120
my parents did have
the added luxury

879
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,121
of ditching me off
at karate school

880
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,123
on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

881
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,126
Go ahead.
Take your bestshot.

882
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,127
Ohh!

883
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,128
Hank!

884
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,130
He said he knew karate.

885
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,131
You hit him.

886
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,132
I did,yeah.

887
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,134
Here.

888
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,136
Did he say ""go""?

889
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,139
Aren't you supposed
to say ""go"" in karate?

890
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,140
You're supposed
to say ""go.""

891
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,143
Hank,just keep your
distance from him.

892
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,146
Go to your tent.
Cool down.

893
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,148
He doesn't answer
my questions?

894
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,150
Why don't you
answer my questions?

895
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,151
I fall into a hole.

896
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,153
I go up in a tree.

897
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,154
I swearto God,
I'll say ""go.""

898
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,155
You bow,
and then you say ""go.""

899
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,156
As in
""go fuck yourself.""

900
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,159
Jesus.They're just
like children.

901
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,160
Yeah.

902
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,162
Oh, my God.

903
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,164
Are you all right?

904
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,166
Yeah, I'm all right.

905
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,167
I've got something
for that.

906
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,168
I can fix that.

907
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,169
Yeah?

908
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,170
Yeah.

909
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,171
Ohh!

910
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,174
Ijust gotta pull it
a little tighter.

911
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,176
There we go.

912
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,178
Who taughtyou
to be a nurse?

913
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,179
Father's a surgeon.

914
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,181
I can even stitch
in a pinch,

915
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,183
which probablywouldn't
be such a bad idea.

916
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,185
Uh, no,thanks.

917
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,187
Ok.

918
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,190
You should have seen
the look on your face

919
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,193
when that croc jumped out.

920
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,194
Uh-huh.

921
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,196
You see the look
on the bear?

922
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:10,200
That was the look.

923
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,202
I don't know.

924
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,204
The laws of nature
could be changing,Jack.

925
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,205
That thing out there,
that's--

926
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,209
You're having the best time
of your life, aren't you?

927
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,211
What?

928
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,212
What? People
have been killed.

929
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,215
I hardly think I'm
having a good time.

930
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:29,219
Why would you--

931
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,212
Does it show?

932
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:39,229
This is the first time
I've ever actually...

933
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,232
you know, been in
the middle of anything.

934
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,233
Is that why you're here,

935
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:47,226
to get in the middle
of something?

936
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,242
Maybe.

937
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,244
I've always read
about what's happened.

938
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,237
I've never...

939
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,254
We should go to bed.

940
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,257
I mean we should
go to, uh...

941
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,258
rest.

942
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,261
We should go to our
separate tents,

943
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,264
and--here--
get some--go.

944
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,257
I got it.

945
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:25,275
Thanks for the bandage.

946
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,277
Night.

947
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,270
Yeah.

948
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,283
Cyr: It doesn't even see him.

949
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,299
There, he got it.

950
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,301
He has one
natural enemy.

951
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,304
Only one.

952
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,305
Man?

953
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,308
Man.

954
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,309
So you're
the big expert.

955
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,312
You think ours is some
kind of mutantor---

956
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,315
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

957
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,318
Biggestone ever killed
on record was 27 feet.

958
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,321
So why is he here?

959
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:15,314
Honestly...

960
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:21,320
I don't know.

961
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,353
Keep your eyes peeled.

962
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:46,356
You know how fast
these things can be.

963
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,358
I've got ticks,
I know it.

964
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,359
They're just
so drawn to me.

965
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,361
I got a thing
about ticks.

966
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,364
Crawling
up your pant leg.

967
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,366
Put their heads
under your skin.

968
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,368
Look.

969
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,369
What?

970
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,362
Jack.

971
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:12,371
That's a pretty big print.

972
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,390
Gare: Seems like
we're getting lower.

973
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,392
That's what happens
when I land.

974
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,394
Why are we landing?

975
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:28,398
Because this is the cove
that he obviously lives in.

976
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,401
So why are we landing?

977
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:35,394
Hector!

978
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,412
We can lift it?

979
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,414
Maybe.

980
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,415
Don't want
to mush it there.

981
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,417
I'm not mushing it.

982
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,420
You might mush it.
It's a little soft.

983
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,413
For Christ's sake,
I'm not mushing it!

984
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,427
Aah!

985
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,428
Aah!

986
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,429
Aah!

987
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,430
Aah!

988
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,432
Oh, God.

989
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,434
Ok.

990
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,436
That is it!
That is it!

991
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,439
No, no, I keep
getting hit with heads!

992
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,440
Try to calm down.

993
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,441
You calm down!

994
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,444
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

995
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,447
I'm being very calm!
I am composed!

996
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,448
This is the second time

997
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,449
I've been hit
with a severed head,

998
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,452
and it upsets me!

999
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,445
What the hell?

1000
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,461
Aah!

1001
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,462
I...

1002
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,465
I just want to go back
to my tent now.

1003
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,468
Can we please go back?

1004
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,470
You gotta be kidding.

1005
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,473
I'm not kidding!

1006
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:44,474
Look.

1007
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,475
The itsy-bitsy spider?

1008
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,477
  Crawled up the water spout?

1009
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,479
  Down comes the rain ?

1010
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:53,472
 To wash the spider out?

1011
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,488
Kelly:What is she doing?

1012
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,491
  Dum de dum de dum ?

1013
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,492
Kelly: Oh.

1014
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,494
Keough:What?

1015
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:08,498
Look 10 feet into the water.

1016
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,491
[crocodile growls]

1017
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,506
[moo]

1018
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,508
Come and get it!

1019
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,511
[moo]

1020
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:25,504
[moo]

1021
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,520
Wow.

1022
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,522
Disgusting.

1023
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,524
I haven't broken any laws.

1024
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,525
Oh, but you have,
ma'am.

1025
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,526
You lied to us.

1026
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,528
That can be
obstruction of justice.

1027
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,529
A man has been killed,

1028
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,531
in part because
of your silence.

1029
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,532
I could make out
a charge

1030
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,533
of reckless
endangerment.

1031
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,534
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed

1032
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,537
at how you treat
your cows.

1033
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,539
The reason I lied,
if I told you the truth,

1034
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:50,540
you'd hunt it down
and kill it,

1035
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,542
which seems to be exactly
what you're trying to do.

1036
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,544
How long have you
been feeding this thing?

1037
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,546
6 years.

1038
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,548
6 years?

1039
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,551
Well, Bernie
was outfishing,

1040
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,553
and it followed
him home.

1041
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,555
So we threw it
some scraps,

1042
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,557
and,well, he didn't
seem to bother anybody.

1043
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,560
He became kind of like a pet
who lives in the wild.

1044
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,561
He just appeared?

1045
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,563
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

1046
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,565
No. Do you?

1047
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,567
Your husband Bernie,

1048
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,568
you didn't,
by any chance,

1049
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,570
lead him to the lake
blind folded?

1050
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,571
If I had a dick,

1051
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:24,574
this is where I'd
tell you to suck it.

1052
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,576
Did the crocodile
kill your husband?

1053
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:29,579
Yes, but itwas all...

1054
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,580
itwas a mistake.

1055
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,582
A mistake?

1056
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,585
One of our horses
got loose 2 years ago.

1057
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,587
Went to the lake
to drink,

1058
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,589
and the crocodile
started coming in,

1059
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,591
and Bernie went
to intercede, and--

1060
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,593
if I'd reported it,

1061
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,596
they'd have sent people
to kill it.

1062
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,598
Ma'am, how could you
not report this?

1063
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,599
It puts human life
at risk.

1064
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,601
Nobody lives on this lake.

1065
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,594
It's really his lake now.

1066
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,608
Come on, Hector.
I know you're crazy,

1067
00:52:58,608 --> 00:52:59,609
but you can't do this.

1068
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,611
I need to see his habitat
up close, Deputy Gare.

1069
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,613
then watch Nova, ok?

1070
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,616
But don't go
in the water.

1071
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,617
Please.

1072
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,619
I'll have sex
with you.

1073
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,620
Let's just
getoutof here.

1074
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,621
Darling,

1075
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:15,625
he's not gonna hurt me.

1076
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:19,618
Don't.

1077
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,628
Hector!

1078
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,642
Murders and rapes
in the cities.

1079
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,644
People bomb planes.

1080
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,646
Can the police stop them?
No.

1081
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,648
Butfeed one little cow
to a crocodile--

1082
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,650
You stay right here
until the police show.

1083
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,652
You're under
full house arrest.

1084
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:43,653
Thank you...

1085
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,655
Officer Fuckmeat.

1086
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,657
Gare on radio: Sheriff,
we gota problem with Hector.

1087
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,659
What problem?

1088
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,663
He went swimming.

1089
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,656
Check.

1090
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,712
[hiss]

1091
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,737
Oh, my.

1092
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,730
[growls]

1093
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,746
Suddenly I feel
a bit foolish here.

1094
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:20,739
You're different
from the others.

1095
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,755
Holy Spiritof Sobek.

1096
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,756
Holy Ghost.

1097
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,759
Holy shit.

1098
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,761
Hector!

1099
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,764
Just turn the ignition.

1100
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,757
It's fuel injected.

1101
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,770
[starterturning]

1102
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,772
Come on!

1103
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,774
[engine starts]

1104
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,776
I know that under
the circumstances,

1105
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,777
biting my head off

1106
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,779
might seem viable.

1107
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:53,772
Itwould cheapen you.

1108
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,787
I may geta shot!

1109
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:58,788
No!

1110
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,790
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

1111
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,792
Oh,Jesus.All right,
justa little further.

1112
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,794
Just like that.

1113
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,787
[growling]

1114
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,802
Move over!

1115
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,818
Go!

1116
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:32,822
-Go!
- I'm trying!

1117
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,824
Ahh!Jesus!

1118
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,817
[gunshot]

1119
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:02,852
That's your last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

1120
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,854
You're grounded.

1121
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,855
This is some very
delicate equipment

1122
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:06,856
thatyou're
throwing around.

1123
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,858
I don't care.
You trying to kill yourself?.

1124
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,860
You want to meet
your maker, is that it?

1125
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,861
You might think
they're godly,

1126
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,863
you might get
some spiritual lift

1127
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,864
outof back stroking
with dragons,

1128
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,867
butyou just put a deputy
at risk out there, sir.

1129
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,869
Let's not over look the fact
that he didn't eatme.

1130
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,872
'Cause he justate
a cow, stupid.

1131
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,874
I'm a civilian.
I'm not a trout.

1132
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:25,863
You have no authority
overme what so ever.

1133
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:27,877
You have no authority
overme whatsoever.

1134
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:28,866
Hey, hey,
I can arrestyou.

1135
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,881
Well,then do it.

1136
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,883
You hurt his feelings.

1137
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,885
I don't care.
Do you care?

1138
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,878
No. He's an asshole.

1139
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,904
Did you want
to be killed by it?

1140
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,906
You think I'm that nuts?

1141
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:57,907
Hector.

1142
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,909
What you just did,

1143
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,912
there had to be at leastsome
sort of a death wish going on.

1144
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,914
In ancient Melanesia,

1145
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,916
people suspected
of crimes

1146
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,919
would be thrown
to the crocodiles.

1147
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:10,920
Crocodiles would decide.

1148
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,922
They would be the judge.

1149
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:16,926
Oh, and so that was you
wanting to be judged out there?

1150
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,928
Maybe I was,
and so what?

1151
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,930
Is that too arbitrary?

1152
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,933
Better to be measured
by my wealth?

1153
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,935
Betterforme
to getmy self-esteem

1154
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,937
looking in the eyes
of cheap sycophants

1155
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:28,938
craving a meal ticket?

1156
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,940
There was more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

1157
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,942
There was more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

1158
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:33,943
Jesus, Hector,
cutthe shit.

1159
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,945
Aw,fuck it.

1160
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,949
So, can I tell them you won't
go back in the water?

1161
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,950
Oh,yeah, sure.

1162
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,951
I'm not going
back in the water.

1163
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,953
No way I'm going
back in the water.

1164
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,955
Ok.

1165
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:49,948
Kelly.

1166
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,953
We can't let'em kill it.

1167
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,974
Wells:Yeah,
pull all the trucks in

1168
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,976
and start packing.

1169
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:07,977
Everything?

1170
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:08,978
Yeah.

1171
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:09,979
All right.

1172
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,982
Just heard from Wildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

1173
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:13,983
They're gonna be here
in 3 hours.

1174
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,985
Ok.

1175
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,987
So we might as well pack up.

1176
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,989
Good idea.

1177
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,992
Will they
try to trap him?

1178
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:23,993
Sorry?

1179
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,995
Florida Fish and Game.

1180
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,997
What'll they do
when they get here?

1181
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:32,001
Cyr:Tell her,Jack.

1182
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,004
Won't be able to snag him
in pitments, right?

1183
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,006
And you tranq him
in the water,

1184
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:38,007
and he drowns.

1185
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,009
They could try
to tranq him on land.

1186
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,011
Oh, sure,they could,
but they won't.

1187
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,012
He's taken human life.

1188
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,013
The mission will be
to put him down.

1189
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,015
Is that true?

1190
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:50,019
They've never been able
to trap anything 30 feet.

1191
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,021
But they have
to try, right?

1192
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,023
Where are they gonna
take him, Florida?

1193
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,024
Back to Asia?

1194
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,026
I got enough flaxidyl
with me to put him out--

1195
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,027
Forget it.

1196
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:01,030
Jack, hearme out.

1197
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,031
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nut fuck,wacko

1198
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,033
who's about as grounded
as a street pigeon,

1199
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,035
Keep going.

1200
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,037
Butthis thing...

1201
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,039
Here?

1202
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:13,042
Maine?

1203
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,043
30 feet?

1204
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,045
Don'tyou think
we're dealing

1205
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,047
with a bit
of a miracle?

1206
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,049
Yeah.The miracle would be
to take him alive.

1207
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,051
Yeah, but if we could
neutralize him--

1208
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,052
How are we gonna
neutralize him?

1209
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,054
Lure him on land
and pump him full of drugs.

1210
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,055
Oh, right.

1211
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,057
I know of an empty
oil tank in Portland.

1212
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,059
Ifwe drugged him,we
could contain him there.

1213
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,061
He's 150 years old.

1214
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:36,065
He probably swam here
from another continent.

1215
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,067
He's migrated to Maine.

1216
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:41,070
How the hell do we say
we just kill it?

1217
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,072
Jack,
this thing being here

1218
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,074
does have some
ecological significance.

1219
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,076
And you are
in the business

1220
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,078
of protecting things
against extinction.

1221
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,080
Including deputies.

1222
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,081
I understand that,

1223
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,083
but if it's possible
to take him alive--

1224
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,084
No, it's not possible.

1225
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,086
Look, he follows anything
thatmoves, right?

1226
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,089
We set a trap on the beach.
I got enough net--

1227
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,091
No.There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

1228
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,092
It'll keep him
tangled long enough

1229
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,094
forthe drugs
to kick in.

1230
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,095
For God's sake,Jack,

1231
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,097
they've trapped crocs
bigger than 20 feet.

1232
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:11,100
This is not completely
out of the question.

1233
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,101
It's possible,
and you know that.

1234
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,103
And those fucks from
Florida won't even try,

1235
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,106
and you know that,too.

1236
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,108
I gotthe drugs.
He's gota big cannon

1237
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,111
if anything goes wrong.

1238
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,113
How do you get him
to the net?

1239
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,115
Ask Mrs. Bickerman
to call him?

1240
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,116
You guys can be
in the trucks

1241
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,117
with the tranq guns.

1242
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,118
If he charges,
you take off.

1243
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,120
He's not that fast.

1244
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,124
We just have to try.

1245
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:39,117
One try.
Just one try.

1246
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:41,130
Like Hank says,

1247
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,133
how would we lure him in?

1248
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,135
I'll sue you!

1249
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,136
Go ahead.

1250
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,137
[helicopter]
[cowmooing]

1251
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,140
You can'ttake a cow
by eminent domain!

1252
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,141
We just did!

1253
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,144
We won't let her
get hurt, ma'am.

1254
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,146
You're all cocksuckers!

1255
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,149
I knew atfirst.
I just didn't want to say it.

1256
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,151
We know
what we're doing.

1257
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,152
[moo]

1258
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:07,145
We gota cow hanging
from a helicopter.

1259
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,158
Not much drag.

1260
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:13,151
As long as I can keep her
from swinging,we're ok.

1261
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:19,168
[moo]

1262
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,171
We're doing
the rightthing.

1263
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,173
You might feel different
if you get eaten.

1264
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:28,166
Yeah,thanks.

1265
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,190
Tranq gun with every rifle.

1266
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,183
That's as far back
as it goes, right?

1267
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,204
Hector, keep enough
tension to hold her up.

1268
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,206
We don't know
how well she can swim.

1269
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:01,199
Right.

1270
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,217
I hate to say it.

1271
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,220
The more she thrashes,
the better.

Woman: Ok.

1275
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:23,232

What's she doing now?

1278
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:30,239
She's trying to fly.

1279
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,232
This is nota happy cow.

1280
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,246
I'm rooting
for the crocodile.

1281
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,248
I hope he swallows
your friends whole.

1282
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,250
You might want to arrest
me for that,too.

1283
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,252
Is that a crime--

1284
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:46,255
To wish the chewing
of law enforcement?

1285
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,258
I'm notsure, ma'am.

What's the deal?

1291
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,268
Well,we tried.

1292
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,271
Justa little
longer, please.

1293
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,273
She doesn'tseem
to be swimming.

1294
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,275
No, she's floating.

1295
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,277
She looks like
a giant tea bag.

Good plan, bad bait.
Game's up.

1299
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,285
The cow disappoints me.

01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,290
I got something
on the screen.

1303
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,292
What do you got?

1304
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,293
He's coming.

1305
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,295
Where?

1306
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,296
How far out?

1307
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,298
30 meters or so.

1308
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,300
He's moving slow,
but he's definitely coming.

1309
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,303
Can you confirm visually
or just radar?

1310
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,304
Radar.

1311
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,305
He's underwater,

1312
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,307

1313
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,309

These darts
won't pierce his back!

1321

There he is!

1323

You little snacker.

1325
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,341
If he gets near her,
pull up.

1326
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,343
She's worried
about the cow now.

1327
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:18,336
Nice and slow, Hector.

1452
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,845
trapped him
with our chopper.

1453
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:40,838
[moo]

1454
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,861
Portland?

1455
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:53,862
Yes, Portland.

1456
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,864
They'll tank him there
until we figure out

1457
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,866
something better to do.

1458
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,868
So, Sheriff, Sheriff,

1459
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,870
you got to fire
your big gun finally.

1460
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,871
Was it fun?

1461
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,874
Over rated.

1462
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:06,875
What'd Bickerman say?

1463
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,877
Well, she didn't
want to tell us

1464
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,879
about the second croc,

1465
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,881
'cause she was afraid
we'd blow its head off.

1466
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:16,885
Women's intuition.

1467
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:17,886
We got room
for one more.

1468
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,888
Someone should
probably go with him.

1469
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,889
uh...

1470
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,892
I'm still packing
up some stuff,

1471
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,895
but, uh...

1472
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,897
I'll go.

1473
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,899
So, I imagine
you're gonna have

1474
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,902
a few reports to do.

1475
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,904
If you need anything,
letme know.

1476
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:39,908
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

1477
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:43,912
Gee, Hank,
don't get all choked up.

1478
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,914
With you,
I'm still mixed.

1479
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:49,907
Oh,well,then,just to
offend you on principle,then.

1480
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,924
See you.

1481
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:59,917
[engine starts]

1482
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:03,932
Well...

1483
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,934
You wanta ride
in my truck?

1484
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:06,935
Oh,we just finished

1485
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,937
loading up the front
of the truck.

1486
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,938
Do you want us to
take some stuff out?

1487
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,940
No, no,that's all right.

1488
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,941
I'm gonna be
a little while anyway.

1489
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,943
I want to go say
good-bye to the lake.

1490
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,946
You sure, because
I don'tmind--

1491
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,949
No. I actually want
to stay a little longer.

1492
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:21,950
All right.

1493
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:25,943
All right.

1494
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,957
If I'm ever
in New York, I'll...

1495
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,950
Yeah.

1496
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,956
Yeah.

1497
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,975
So, does nobody ever
make a move in Maine?

1498
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,991
That's it?
You slide your duffel bag?

1499
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,993
Just...

1500
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:05,994
get in the truck.

1501
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,996
Go for a beer.

1502
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,998
There's a good bar
in town.

1503
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,000
Bet that's charming.

1504
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,001
Are the glasses clean?

1505
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,003
Mostly.

1506
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,006
You gonna complain
the whole time?

1507
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,007
Jack.

1508
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:23,000
Start the truck.

1509
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:27,015
[starts engine]

1510
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:31,008
I already miss
the crocodile.

Come on.

1518

Eat your supper.

1519

Nibble mommy's toes.

1520

Yes.
