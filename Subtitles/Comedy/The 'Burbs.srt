168
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,238
I don't know.

169
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,795
- Hey, did I show you my new tools?
- No.

170
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,196
These are great.

171

Carol's father gave them

Huh?

173
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:06,323
- Look.
- Oh, those are beauties.

174
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:09,080
- You gonna build something with those?
- I think so.

175
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,965
<i>Probably.</i>

176
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,961
Hey, what time does
the ball game go on?

177
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,117
I think it's at about 1:00.

178
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,402
<i>You want to go down to the deli</i>
<i>and get one of those beef sandwiches?</i>

179
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,275

<i>Ray, come here.</i>

00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,764
What is it?

186
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,842
It's my neighbour.

187
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:56,206
Hey, one of the Huns
came out of the cave.

188
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,600
Why don't you go say hi?

189
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,117
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

190
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,005
This would be
the perfect time.

191
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,284
If you go talk to him,
we could see what he's like. Go.

192
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,597
[Ray]
You could say hi to him too.

193
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,962
- But he's your neighbour.
- No, he's your neighbour as well.

194
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,242
But you share a property line with him.

195
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,795
We're all on the same block,
so you could go too.

196
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,845
We're all in the same town,
but you're next to him.

197
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,077
<i>If he was gonna borrow anything,</i>
<i>he'd come over to your place.</i>

198
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,681
<i>Well, he's busy now.</i>

199
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,156
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in.
Go now because if...

200
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:05,718
<i>He's going back in. If you were</i>
<i>gonna say hi, you should probably...</i>

201
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,162
He's going into the house.
You're gonna lose him.

<i>He's gonna go in...</i>

203

- Now you've blown it, haven't you?
- No, I didn't blow it.

204
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,798
- Chicken. Chicken. [Clucking]
- He went into his house.

205
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,037
I'm not chicken because
he went into his house.

206
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,483
You look like a chicken in front of

- Hey, hey, it's a joke!

- Let's say hello.
- Why so edgy?

00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,718
- Come on, come on.
- Try decaf.

211
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,560
They're daring each other
to ring the doorbell.

212
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:35,719
- We shouldn't stare like this.
- [Chuckles]

213
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,321
Why don't we both go say hello,
or are you chicken?

214
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:40,363
Go for it, Mr Peterson!
Yes!

We should sue them.

<i>I think they're gone!</i>

The same thing happened to me
last week. I was over there.

It wasn't bees though.
It was a foaming squirrel.

Green sky at night?

Did you ever see the movie
<i>The Sentinel,</i> Mr Peterson?

265

It's about the old guy

It was a night just like this
that it happened.

00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,238
What happened,
Mr Weingartner?

275
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,603
It was a long time ago.
Hinkley Hills was a lot smaller then.

276
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,715
Safer too. You never had to lock
your doors. Everybody knew everybody.

277
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,083
I must have been maybe
nine, ten years old.

278
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,965
- You know where the big mall is?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:48,038
There used to be a big drugstore
on the corner there.

280
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:51,085
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember?
- Yeah.

281
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,125
The guy who ran it was a rotund guy,
had glasses.

282
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,675
His name was Skip.
Lived over on Elm.

283
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:59,884
Had a wife, a couple kids.
Not too sharp.

284
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,403
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing
a paper hat and making cherry Cokes.

285
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,955
It's a cinch he's not
running for governor, right?

286
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,356
Anyway, it got hot that summer.

287
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,438
It got real hot.
It was sweltering.

288
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,995
That heat where your unde<i>rw</i>ear sweats
and it crawls up the...

And they start smelling
this really vile stench over on Elm...

291
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,126
and they figure it's comin'
from Skip's place.

292
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,038
No one wants to say anything.

293
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,277
Do you knock on the guy's door,
"Hi, your house stinks"?

294
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,835
So people are trying
to ignore it, right?

295
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:32,363
They're trying to pretend it isn't
happening. You know those pine things?

296
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:34,438
They're trying to cover up with those
pine things that you can put in cars.

297
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,485
People are hanging those
on their porches.

- Well, yeah.

00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,997
Let me tell you
what happened next.

301
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,363
The state health inspector shows up.
They talk to Skip.

302
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,438
He says he's got a sump pump problem.
They leave.

303
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,643
The guy's got a sewer problem.
He says he'll look after it.

304
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,445
Everything's okay, right?

305
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,358
Wrong.
A couple hours later...

306
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,642
there's smoke pouring out
of the windows of Skip's house.

307
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,683
- The firemen go in. Know what they find?
- What?

308
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,235
Skip's family, dead.
Murdered...

309
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,797
by Skip... weeks earlier...
with an ice pick.

310
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,845

- With an ice pick.

312
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:17,485
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em
in the cool basement...

313
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:21,958
covered 'em up with a sheet and went
back to makin' treats for the townsfolk.

314
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:26,438
Only Skip didn't count on there
being a big heat wave that summer.

315
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:30,122
You know what all those people
were smelling on Elm, Ricky?

316
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:32,198
What?

317
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,437
Skip's family's bodies...

318
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,963
- decomposing in the summer heat.
- [Whistles]

319
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:41,005
Apparently, one day Skip made
Just one-too-many lemon phosphates.

[Snaps Fingers]
El snappo.

321
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:49,839
I remember that. I remember
hearing about that when I was a kid.

322
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:54,682
They-They tore down
the soda fountain that fall.

323
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:58,123
These towns are full of those stories.
They're happening right under your nose.

You know, speaking of noses...

uh, we're not gonna take it any more.

1289
01:31:17,927 --> 01:31:19,724
We're not gonna be content
to look after our lawns...

1290
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,559
and wax our cars, paint our houses.

1291
01:31:21,647 --> 01:31:24,639
We're out to get 'em, Don.
We are out to get them.

1292
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:30,603
- Hello.
- Hi.

1293
01:31:32,407 --> 01:31:36,241
[Sighs]
So, what are you gonna do now?

1294
01:31:36,327 --> 01:31:40,320
I'm gonna pack a bag
and go up to the lake.

1295
01:31:40,407 --> 01:31:42,238
We got 'em, neighbour.

1296
01:31:43,407 --> 01:31:46,797
- Get away from him.
- [Art] Hey, you guys.

1297
01:31:46,887 --> 01:31:49,606
You wanna go down to Bowl-O-Rama
for a beer or something?

1298
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:53,236
Man, that was an incredible choke hold
you put on me, pal. The guy's a brute.

1299
01:31:53,327 --> 01:31:55,158
How's that finger?
Is it okay?

1300
01:31:55,247 --> 01:31:57,238
Where are you guys going?
Where you going?

1301
01:31:57,327 --> 01:31:59,841
I'm going on vacation.

1302
01:31:59,927 --> 01:32:02,157
"Vacation"?
What, are you crazy?

1303
01:32:02,247 --> 01:32:04,203
This is a major media event here.

1304
01:32:04,287 --> 01:32:08,075
Geraldo Rivera's coming, and he's gonna
excavate the basement of the Klopeks!

1305
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:12,160
It's gonna be broadcast
on satellite all over the world, live!

1306
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:14,078
Art!

1307
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:16,920
Your wife's home.

1308
01:32:17,007 --> 01:32:20,522
- And your house is on fire!
- Art, where are you?

1309
01:32:21,607 --> 01:32:23,120
My wife is home!

1310
01:32:23,207 --> 01:32:26,279
Mr Peterson, where you going?

1311
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:29,200
It's just starting to get good.

1312
01:32:29,287 --> 01:32:32,006
I'm going away for a while, Ricky.

1313
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:38,722
I want you to keep an eye
on the neighbourhood for me.

1314
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:41,401
You betcha, Mr Peterson.

1315
01:32:41,487 --> 01:32:44,285
<i>No problem.</i>

1316
01:32:53,927 --> 01:32:55,758
[Barking]

1317
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:01,244
God, I love this street.
