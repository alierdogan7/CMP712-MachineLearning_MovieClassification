00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:05,109
The Sad Lady Book Club is reading

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,813
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> again.

3
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:14,085
There's not a dry seat in the house.

4
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:16,988
If those ladies are that
into light torture,

5
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:20,224
they should just apply for our jobs.

6
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:21,959
- [bell dings]
- Hey.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,562
Aww, you two are so adorable.

8
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:29,600
Like Romeo and Juliet, but
without the bright future.

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,402
Yeah...

10
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,671
I want him out of the diner.

11
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:34,905
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:36,340
Anyone who works in this diner

13
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,142
is like a fat guy in a smart car.

14
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:40,478
You can never get out.

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,879
It's true.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,382
I came in here in 1962
for a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:49,987
Someone asked me to break
a dollar, and I never left.

18
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:52,990
Look. Living, working, and
sleeping with the same guy

19
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,859
is never a good idea.

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,028
Just talk to Hillary Clinton.

21
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:59,930
I guess I can get a dishwasher fired.

22
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:04,134
When I was rich, I got Wolfgang
Puck fired from Wolfgang Puck.

23
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:05,703
Get yours, Max!

24
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,639
Hit it then quit it.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,310
That strategy served me
well in my 20s and 30s.

26
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:17,381
Evening, ladies.

27
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:20,784
Also, my 70s.

Well, someone's in a bad mood.
What's wrong, Oleg?

34
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:45,265
Did they discontinue
making Axe body spray?

35
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,268
Don't even kid.

36
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:51,171
No. I'm cranky because I'm
not having sex right now.

37
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,073
Yeah. I thought it was weird
seeing both your hands

while you were talking.

39
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:58,278
Sophie's idea. It's
some old Polish ritual.

40
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,414
The bride and groom
remain chaste for 30 days

41
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,549
before the wedding.

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,418
Apparently, the "something
blue" at the wedding

43
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,888
has got to be my balls.

44
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,423
So, you're practicing celibacy.

45
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:11,892
I'm trying, but there
are women everywhere.

46
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:16,530
I feel like a bull in a vagina shop.

47
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,331
Hear ye, hear ye!

48
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,501
I'm unveiling a major
improvement to the diner!

49
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:24,204
Well, we'll miss you, Han.

50
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,140
Nice try, Max, but like Ryan Seacrest,

51
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,377
I'll be here forever.

52
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:33,146
Now, will you all please do what
you have yet to do on Twitter

53
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:36,149
and follow me?

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,450
You too, Earl.

55
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,718
Hell, this better be good.

56
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,520
Every step I take could be my last.

57
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:46,793
And now...

00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,695
Without further a-douche...

00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,030
Ready to have your minds blown?

60

At this point, I'm ready
to have anything blown.

Ta-da!

62
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:59,572
That is the worst gift I ever received

63
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,374
and last year, my son
bought me a coffin.

64
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:08,514
This works out great then,
because it's not for you.

65
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,049
It's for Nash.

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,352
Oh, well, that's real nice.

67
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:15,655
Because the shower at Max's
place doesn't work at all.

68
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,523
You better believe it's nice.

69
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,492
That's the Spritzy 5000.

<i>Dishwasher Weekly</i> gave it
four out of four Dishies.

You know our oven doesn't work, right?

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,070
Hey, boss lady, if we work
hard, do we get a gift?

73
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,306
If you work hard, I'll die childless

74
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,841
with my mouth frozen open in shock.

75
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,244
Yeah, I went there!

76
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:43,282
Nash works hard, so only he
may handle my beautiful hose!

77
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:44,884
Well, if he's handling Han's hose,

78
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,553
he's never getting fired.

79
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:49,121
Okay. Step up here, Nash.

80
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:51,256
I'll show you what this puppy can do.

81
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:59,298
So far the puppy can't reach the hose.

82
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,299
A little help.

83
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,106
Aww, there's nothing cuter
than a hot guy holding a baby.

84

Now just grab that thing and
squeeze it till it sprays.

85

Move to call a moratorium on
the words "grab," "squeeze,"

86
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:20,184
and "sprays" till the wedding.

87
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:31,263
Damn! That's hot.

88
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:34,833
And me without any singles
to stuff down his pants.

89
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,836
Well, I better go dry
off in the men's room.

like he's a senior special

00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,297
at Sizzler's?

We might not be able to get Nash fired,

101
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,936
but we can get him hired
as a fashion model.

102
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,470
Look at their faces.

103
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:15,373
He could be the future
bulge of Calvin Klein.

104
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,342
Now you're talking about the future?

105
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,477
Why can't you just
accept that we are stuck

106
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,780
with a really crappy present?

107
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,748
Quit trash-talking the Spritzy 5000!

00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,891
Good afternoon. Welcome to The High.

109
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,759
I'll have somebody get you some water.

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,462
Not me, 'cause I'm past that.

You know, here.

112
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:41,766
I think I just sat another one
of those lesbian blind-dates

113
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,401
for our boss.

114
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:46,170
It's hard out there for a pimp.

115

Why do you think I got out of pimping?

116

beer bottle over my head.

117
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,977
So, did you get Nash a modeling job yet?

118
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,445
I'm working on it.

119
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:57,281
It's not like I can
just call Tyra Banks.

120

Well, that's what her
people said when I called.

"There's a Subaru outside
that's about to get a ticket."

If you had you told me, ten years ago,

I'd be on a dating site
called "Lez Meet Up,"

133
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,887
I would've told the youth
pastor I was married to,

from the Del Monico Modeling Agency.

139
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,799

And not just the pictures
of his butt on your phone.

141

Fine, you handle it.

142
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,339
The only thing I know about modeling is

143
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,875
a couple of years ago, I was
the face of shingles on WebMD.

144
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:08,054
Girls, perfect timing to ask
me to do this photo shoot.

145
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:11,357
The FBI just gave me my
camera back last week.

146

Oh, so you get your camera back,

147
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:15,461
but I'm still waiting
on that kilo of coke

148
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:20,033
that I spent hours carefully
filling my butt with?

149
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:21,801
Let me just change the settings.

150
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:27,340
This camera is used to taking
pictures from 800 feet away.

151
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,676
And we want those pictures back, Oleg!

152

158
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:52,064
It's only been years and years.

- Come on.
- And years.

160
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,535
Well, I could go for a brisket sandwich.

I know. I got one in my purse.

And why are you doing the photo
shoot in this skanky dishroom?

164

Because we're going with the
"hot dishwasher" angle.

165
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,816
The agency said every
model needs a hook.

Yeah, like how Cindy
Crawford has a beauty mark

167

Yeah, yeah. My sister is a model
in Poland and she has a hook.

169
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,363
It's her left hand, yeah.
It's is also great for kabobs.

The only other time I had my
picture taken was at school.

shirtless one for the roll call.

176
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:45,050
Wow. You sure look hot.

177
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,151
Careful, Sophie.

178
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,086
That's my brisket.

179
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:51,089
I'm not talking about
Daniel Day-Loser here.

180
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,527
I'm talking about Oleg.

181
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:00,132
You are sweating like an old knockwurst

182
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:05,103
that has been left out in the sun.

183
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:09,408
It's really breathtaking.

184
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:13,178
Okay, Nash, stand over
here near the hose

185
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,881
and give me hot face, dead eyes.

186
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:17,983
You know, like me when I
mix NyQuil and DayQuil.

187
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:20,252
I call it AfternoonQuil.

188
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:21,987
Okay. Now I'm gonna start shooting.

189
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:26,191
Yeah. Shoot, baby! Shoot!

190
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,726
- What do you think?
- [camera clicking]

191
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,395
Well, he's stiff, but
not in the good way.

192
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,030
Ugh, this is painful.

193
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:35,233
He's like Susan Boyle
without the star quality.

194
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,335
We need a little of what
he had the other day.

195
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,337
You'll thank me for this later.

196
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:42,107
[camera clicking]

197
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,508
Yes, Nash, yes!

198
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,612
Tear your shirt!

199
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:51,481
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:54,285
[gasps]

201
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:58,289
Stop!

202
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,192
What the hell is happening in here?

203
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,328
I didn't give anyone
permission to use my diner

204
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,629
for a photo shoot.

205
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,930
Calm down.

206
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,965
We are trying to get him a modeling job.

207
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,835
He has a job! He's my number one worker.

208
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,538
Like the doctor said to your
mother when you were born,

209
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,173
tough break.

210
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:17,841
You two crows don't
let me have anything!

211
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:25,283
Okay, Nash, part of the model audish

212
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,952
is to see how you'd be as a
performer in commercials,

213
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:30,488
and movies, and other things
people don't watch anymore.

214
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,423
Now, obviously, right out of the gate,

215
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,593
you're not gonna be as good
as that duck who says "Aflac,"

216
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,963
but you've got to be at least
as good as Ben Affleck.

217
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,599
I can help. For a time,
I had a rich acting career.

218
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,667
It started with a
starring role in<i> Annie,</i>

219
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,236
and ended when I portrayed Rosa Parks

220
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,670
in an ill-advised high school production

221
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,340
that led to an investigation by the NAACP.

222
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:53,210
Ooh, this is a commercial
for breakfast cereal!

223
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,013
Ah! Every actor's dream!

224
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,248
Hey, Nash, read this.

225
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,882
Think James Dean.

226
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:03,120
But alive and eating Cocoa Puffs.

227
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,089
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part

228
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,560
of any well-balanced breakfast."

229
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,928
I'm trying to find a nice way to say...

230
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,965
You suck, bro.

231
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,667
You... you get it.

232
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:18,936
You know the thrill of eating chocolate

233
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:22,206
at a traditionally
non-chocolatey time of day.

234
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,741
Let's tap into that.

235
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:26,043
Okay. Take it from the top.

236
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:28,679
And this time, go cuckoo.

237
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,982
Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

238
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,217
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious..."

239
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,252
Stop.

240
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:38,922
Don't phone this in.
It's not Raisin Bran.

241
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:40,357
"Pocoa Cuffs are a delicious..."

242
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,259
"Pocoa Cuffs"?

243
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,395
Pocoa Cuffs?

244
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,965
I just can't with these
rank amateurs, Caroline.

245
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,467
Max, calm down.

246
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,402
It's a fake tryout for
a cereal commercial,

247
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:55,605
not<i> Dance Moms.</i>

248
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,308
I'm nervous. I'm not an actor.

249
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,210
Uh, no, you are not.

250
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,579
Give me that.

251
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,514
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

252
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,151
Got it.

253
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:11,588
Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part
of any well-balanced breakfast!

254
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,189
They're good for you,
which parents love,

255
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,625
and they taste like candy, which I love!

256
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,628
I can't help it! I'm
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

257
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,098
Cuckoo!

258
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:26,970
I'm tearing up, and it's not
just the black mold in here.

259
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:30,373
Max, I think you may have just
set the acting bar too high.

260
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,941
- [knock at door]
- Oh.

261
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:35,244
I've never set a bar too high before.

262
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:38,848
I've set a bar on fire and
I've left a bar too high.

263
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,450
Oh, hey, girls.

264
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:43,286
Oh, do you mind if I hang down
here with you for a while?

265
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,189
Oleg is up there, he's
trying to seduce me

266
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,690
by cleaning the apartment.

267
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:51,794
And it's, oh, oh, so dirty.

268
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,529
[vacuum cleaner humming]

269
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,467
Oh, oh, he's vacuuming now,
which means he's naked.

270
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:02,972
Oh, me and my Polish values.

271
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,840
Polish Values?

272
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,410
That's the name of my favorite
dollar store in Brooklyn.

273
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,611
[vacuum humming]

274
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:13,282
Oh, he's deep-cleaning the shag.

275
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,318
Oh, my God. Somebody, do something

276
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:17,720
to make me not want sex.

277
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,788
All right, Nash, why don't you
show us your runway walk?

278
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,828
That was it.

279
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,164
Oh, I thought you were
going to pick up a pen.

280
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,000
Thanks, perfect.

281
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:35,304
Now I'm completely turned off.

282
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:39,541
Watching that potato walk across
the room really did the trick.

283
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,343
Nash, concentrate.

284
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,645
Follow my lead.

285
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,979
Bam. Pow. Bam. Pow.

286
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,148
And step and bam, and step and pow,

287
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:48,217
and step and bam!

288
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,519
Oh, even better!

289
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,856
I mean, after that, they
could film the sequel

290
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:56,724
to<i> Frozen</i> on my lady parts.

291
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:02,331
Yeah, me too.

292
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:05,834
But just 'cause I "Let
It Go" down there.

293
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:09,438
- [vacuum hum continues]
- Aaah!

294
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:13,775
Oh, now he's using the wand attachment.

295
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:18,413
Oh, and he's getting real
deep between the cushions.

296
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:20,782
Oh, my God, just screw it.

297
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:23,418
I'm never gonna make it to the wedding!

298
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,221
[groaning]

299
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,590
Oh, Grandma Kuchenski, please forgive me

300
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,724
for what I'm about to do.

301
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,060
I...

302
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,595
Well, you were no White Lily yourself!

303
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,796
[gasps] Wow.

304
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:46,352
He's bamming and powing up a storm.

305
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,554
When he's famous, I
hope he remembers us.

306
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,758
Pfft. I like to think I did some
things he will never forget.

307
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,427
How's that?

308
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,195
Great, you can walk.

309
00:14:56,196 --> 00:15:00,266
If you can read too, I'll
treat myself to a Snapple.

310
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,600
Let's get to the copy.

311
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,002
Actually, we came prepared.

312
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,304
Nash rehearsed the Cocoa
Puffs commercial.

313
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,039
I think you'll be quite moved.

314
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,707
Oh yeah, well, we'll
be reading something

315
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,142
a little different today.

316
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,411
[clears throat]

317
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,480
Don't panic. They do this all the time.

318
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,948
They want to make sure you're flexible.

319
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,416
Yeah. Go ahead, Nash.

320
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,753
Whatever cereal it is,
act like it's delicious.

321
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,089
Unless it's Rice Krispies. A-boring!

322
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,625
Okay, here goes.

323
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,626
"You know you like it.

324
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,596
Bend over, bitch."

325
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,233
Uh, are we missing a page?

326
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,536
Cereals have changed since I was a kid.

327
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,071
Should I read the part where I notice

328
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,572
the teacher's not wearing any panties?

329
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,474
Oh, my God. This is porn!

330
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,943
No wonder all those people
out there were freaks.

331
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,531
No wonder I recognized so many of them.

332
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,716
Don't act so surprised.

333
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:55,287
Everyone knows Cocoa
Puffs is code for porn.

334
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,656
Also, you sent us some
pictures taken by someone

335
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:01,626
very experienced in erotica.

336
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,729
We can't let him do this.

337
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,764
I have a movie that
starts shooting tomorrow

338
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,300
that pays $1,000 a day.

339
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,669
Can we?

340
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,270
Maybe we can't.

341
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,772
It's the lead in<i> Sorest Rump.</i>

342
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,581
Maybe we can.

343
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,016
I think we need a little
sidebar, Delores.

344
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,384
- [clears throat]
- Should I come with you?

345
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,719
No, we're good.

346
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,788
I have a couple of
questions for the actor.

347
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,708
Can you swim, and are you circumcised?

348
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,693
Max, this has gone too far.

349
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,146
I know, I was expecting you
to just crash with me

350
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:41,166
for a couple of days
and get your own place.

351
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,000
Are we really gonna
let Nash do porn

352
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,002
just so he doesn't work at the diner?

353
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,237
Hey, ladies, what's it gonna be?

354
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,239
I got other talent to see.

355
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,608
I got a guy named Lustin Beaver

356
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,043
taking the Amtrak in from Philly.

357
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:01,317
Max, if you're really keen
on me being a porn actor,

358
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,485
I'll do it.

359
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,253
She says, tomorrow, they start filming

360
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:08,124
<i>The Grand Booty Fest Hotel.</i>

361
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,426
And, they'll pay me more for my accent.

362
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:14,981
Also, what does "gay for pay" mean?

363
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:19,033
Ugh, I guess it means we got to go.

364
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,775
Look at him, Max.

365
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:30,146
A cute guy, eaten up and
spat out by show business

366
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:34,250
like so many Baldwin
brothers before him.

367
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,185
Nash doesn't care about modeling.

368
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:38,187
He's 21. He doesn't care about anything.

369
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:41,357
His biggest concern is
playing with the XBox.

370
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:44,393
Mine and, also, the popular
video game system.

371
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,628
He cares about you.

372
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,163
He was willing to do "gay for pay."

373
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:52,531
Did I hear Nash is going "gay for pay"?

374
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:56,839
'Cause I've got $4 burning
a hole in my pocket.

375
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,607
Oh, a customer.

376
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,943
Hi, welcome to The High.
Here for dessert?

377
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:04,179
Oh, thanks but I haven't
had cake since my Sweet 16,

378
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,616
and even then, I made
myself throw it up.

379
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:10,419
I'm meeting someone here
and my phone's about to die.

380
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,055
And if it dies, I will too.
Do you have an outlet?

381
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,123
Screaming in the shower
really works for me.

382
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,759
Like, right into the water.

383
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,562
Super cute. But I do
need a phone outlet.

384
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:21,963
I'll plug you in, honey,

385
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:25,467
and I'll take care of your phone, too.

386
00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:27,469
Girls, meet Marie.

387
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,771
Hi. Seriously, down to 10%.

388
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:32,407
Oh, did you two meet on "Lez Meet Up"?

389
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:36,244
No, honey, I've never
been on "Lez Meet Up."

390
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,847
Oh, you're thinking of me, Caroline.

391
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:42,117
You know how much I love lady tail.

392
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,352
This place is amazing.

393
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:46,488
Isn't it amazing?

394
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,290
I had the decorator redo it nine times.

395
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,793
You can feel his anger in the walls.

396
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:53,028
It's electric.

397
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,297
We're electric. Who is this miracle?

398
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,266
That's Nash. I found him in the Bowery

399
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,002
next to a pile of burning trash.

400
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,937
Go say hi.

401
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:06,741
He's even creamier and
more delicious up close.

402
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,776
You're eating? That is so punk rock.

403
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,346
Tell me everything right now.

404
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,181
Uh, well, I'm a dishwasher.

405
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm from Ireland.

406
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,818
Oh, I was trying to become a model

407
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:19,220
and I almost did porn an hour ago.

408
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,656
That is the best story I ever heard.

409
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:22,890
Tell it to me again standing up.

410
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,196
But this time, don't talk.

411
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:29,030
I see face, I see ass, I see model.

412
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,765
Do you have a manager?

413
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,534
I guess that'd be Caroline,
the blonde one over there.

414
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,138
Blonde one, come over here and
talk to me about your client.

415
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:39,674
I am in love. He's perfection.

416
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,842
Marie Prower, Senior VP of Marketing.

417
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:43,311
Sweet, what company?

418
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,378
Guess.

419
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,547
Um, Tommy Hilfinger.

420
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,983
I work for Guess, darling.

421
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:51,485
No more words. Listen.

422
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:53,421
He's amazing.

423
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:55,356
I would tweet about him right
now, but my phone is dead.

424
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,858
So bring him into my office on Monday.

425
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,093
You heard her, Caroline.

426
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:02,123
Bring him into her office tomorrow.

427
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:05,432
She's obsessed with me.

428
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,302
Max, I was right. He is a model.

429
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:10,738
Get me a hot wife and a hotter
woman to cheat on her with,

430
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:14,575
'cause I'm a big-time talent manager.

431
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,644
Congratulations, dude.

432
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:19,280
Well, I guess if this works out,
I'm gonna have to quit my job

433
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,781
at the diner.

434
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,984
Will you be mad at me?

435
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,653
I'll be really sad.

436
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:28,789
I'm gonna miss you a lot, you know?

437
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,858
Not seeing you 24/7.

438
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,560
But I would hate myself
if I didn't let you

439
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:35,796
follow your dreams.

440
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:40,567
Even if it means you moving
out of the apartment, too.

441
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:44,304
Now go.

442
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,039
Here comes that tear again.

443
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,075
I'm all choked up.

444
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,047
Max, you would have made
a great Rosa Parks.

445
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,648
If you had been black

446
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:56,263
Which I guess is what they insist on.

447
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:01,034
But you got him to move out!
You are good.

448
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:04,469
Yeah, well, I mean... he is cute, but...

449
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,443
I'm not all that coo coo
for his Cocoa Puffs.

450
