Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,999
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

229

He had a few suggestions

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,201
once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

249
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,279
These new long-range precision guns

250
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,919

hostiles a minute.

251

The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

we needed a quantum surge

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,525
Yeah, we compromised.

264

Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,439
But we did it so that
people could be free.

266
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,799
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

The honour's mine, Captain.

580
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,646
My father served in
the 101st. Come on in.

581
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,279
PIERCE: That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

582
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,839
when I was at State
Department in Bogota.

583
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,519
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

584
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,164
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

585
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,599
Nick was Deputy Chief of the
S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

586
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,119
and he comes to me with a plan.

587
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,159
He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

588
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,325
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

589
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,719
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

590
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,039
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

591
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,851
They find it empty.

592
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,759
Nick had ignored my direct order,

593
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,482
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

594
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,199
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

595
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,479
including my daughter.

596
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,279
So you gave him a promotion.

597
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,205
I've never had any
cause to regret it.

598
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,522
Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?

599
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,681
I don't know.

600
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,251
Did you know it was bugged?

601
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,481
I did, because Nick told me.

602
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

603
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,406
I want you to see something.

606
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,608
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

607
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,879
ROGERS:
Are you saying he's a suspect?

608
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,919
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

609
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,679
PIERCE: No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

610
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,479
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

611
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,362
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

612
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,971
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

613
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,199
The last one going
to a holding company

614
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,599
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

615
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,119
Am I supposed to know who that is?

616
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,519
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

617
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,651
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

618
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,688
When I first met Nick, his
mother lived at 1437.

619
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,648
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

620
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,844
The prevailing theory

621
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,519
was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition

622
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,287
and sale of classified
intelligence.

623
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,930
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

624
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,845
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

625
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,162
Why do you think we're talking?

626
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,159
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

627
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,326
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

628
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,124
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

629
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,327
to build a really better world

630
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,203
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

631
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,885
And that makes enemies.

632
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,839
Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

633
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,005
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

634
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,085
And the idea that those
people could be happy today

635
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,006
makes me really, really angry.

636
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,959
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

637
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,362
I don't think that's an accident.

638
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,524
And I don't think you do, either.

639
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,559

640
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,769
Why was he there?

641
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,001

00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,691
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

706
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,605
PIERCE: Because he lied to us.

707
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,722
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

708
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,884
He refused to share it.

709
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,048
As difficult as this is to accept,

710
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,408
Captain America is a
fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

711
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,799
- Where is it?
- Safe.

712
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,639
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

713
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,079
Why would I tell you?

714
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,319
Fury gave it to you. Why?

715
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,919
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

716
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,119
Stop lying.

717
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,965
I only act like I know
everything, Rogers.

718
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,000
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

719
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,199
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

720
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,806
I'm not gonna ask you again.

721
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,886
I know who killed Fury.

722
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,119
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

723
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,159
The ones that do call
him the Winter Soldier.

724
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,359
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

725
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,649
in the last 50 years.

726
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,599
So he's a ghost story.

727
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,879
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

728
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,359
Somebody shot out my
tyres near Odessa.

729
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,839
We lost control, went
straight over a cliff.

730
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,319
I pulled us out.

731
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,609
But the Winter Soldier was there.

732
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,599
I was covering my
engineer so he shot him

733
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,001
straight through me.

734
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,921
Soviet slug.

735
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,126
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

736
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,529
Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.

737
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,766
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

738
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,168
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

739
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,759
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

740
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,288
<i>PIERCE: Nick Fury was
murdered in cold blood.</i>

741
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,879
To any reasonable person,

742
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,599
that would make him a
martyr, not a traitor.

743
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,119
ROCKWELL:
You know what makes him a traitor?

744
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,639
Hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship.

745
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,119
SINGH:
Nick Fury used your friendship

746
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,399
to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.

747
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,999
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

748
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,079
At best, he lied
to you. At worst...

749
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,599
Are you calling for my resignation?

750
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,199
I've got a pen and
paper right here.

751
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,126
That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

752
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,639
But you do want to
have a discussion?

753
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,963
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

754
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,443
This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

755
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,088
If you want to say something
snappy, now would be a good time.

756
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,488
First rule of going on the
run is don't run, walk.

757
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,561
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

758
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,839
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

759
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,799
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

760
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,247
How much time will we have?

761
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,927
About nine minutes from

762
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,607
now.

763
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,359
ROMANOFF:
Fury was right about that ship.

764
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,639
Somebody's trying
to hide something.

765
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,839
This drive is protected
by some sort of Al.

766
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,399
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

767
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,450
Can you override it?

768
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,168
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

769
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,961
Slightly.

770
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,006
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

771
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,519
This is a program that
S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

772
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,039
to track hostile malware,

773
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,079
so if we can't read the file,

774
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,050
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

me with some honeymoon destinations.

<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1570
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,325
<i>ROMANOFF: I do.</i>

1571
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,799
<i>COMMITTEE MEMBER: Why haven't
we yet heard from Captain Rogers?</i>

1572
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,565
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

1573
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,439
I don't know what there
is left for him to say.

1574
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:58,479
I think the wreck in the
middle of the Potomac

1575
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,879
made his point fairly eloquently.

1576
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,039
COMMITTEE MEMBER:
Well, he could explain how

1577
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,799
this country is expected to
maintain its national security

1578
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:08,319
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1579
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,479
HYDRA was selling you
lies, not intelligence.

1580
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,559
Many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling.

1581
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,959
Agent, you should know

1582
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,839
that there are some
on this committee

1583
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,159
who feel, given your
service record,

1584
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,289
both for this country
and against it,

1585
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,599
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1586
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,968
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1587
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,484
You're not going to
put me in a prison.

1588
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:34,405
You're not going to put any of
us in a prison. You know why?

1589
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,119
Do enlighten us.

1590
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,851
Because you need us.

1591
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:42,039
<i>Yes, the world is a
vulnerable place,</i>

1592
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,602
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1593
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,925
<i>But we're also the ones best
qualified to defend it.</i>

1594
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,528
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.

1595
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,244
You'll know where to find me.

1596
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,564
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1597
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,605
You get used to it.

1598
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,319
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.

1599
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,848
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1600
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,765
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1601
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,960
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1602
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,770
There's something I
got to do first.

1603
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,206
How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

1604
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,964
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1605
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,844
All right, then.

1606
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,690
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

1607
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,879
You should be honoured. That's
about as close as he gets

1608
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,930
to saying thank you.

1609
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,161
Not going with him?

1610
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,719
No.

1611
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:19,122
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1612
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,919
I blew all my covers. I got
to go figure out a new one.

1613
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,321
That might take a while.

1614
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,444
I'm counting on it.

1615
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,759
That thing you asked for,

1616
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,481
I called in a few
favours from Kiev.

1617
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:37,171
Will you do me a favour?
Call that nurse.

1618
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,599
She's not a nurse.

1619
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,843
And you're not a
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1620
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,842
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1621
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,601
She's nice.

1622
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,844
Be careful, Steve.

1623
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,409
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1624
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,719
You're going after him.

1625
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,159
You don't have to come with me.

1626
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,641
I know.

1627
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,761
When do we start?

1628
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,801
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1629
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,851
Everything he knows about.

1630
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,079
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1631
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:31,079
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1632
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,209
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1633
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:37,044
Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

1634
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,370
What we have

1635
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,051
is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

1636
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,366
We've only scratched the
surface and already,

1637
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,006
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1638
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:04,399
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1639
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,439
and keep them off our scent.

1640
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,919
What about the volunteers?

1641
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,679
The dead will be buried so deep

1642
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:13,208
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1643
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,520
And the survivors?

1644
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:20,165
The twins.

1645
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,849
Sooner or later,
they will meet the twins.

1646
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,759
It's not a world of spies any more.

1647
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,128
Not even a world of heroes.

1648
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,851
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

1649
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,007
There's nothing more horrifying

1650
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,966
than a miracle.
