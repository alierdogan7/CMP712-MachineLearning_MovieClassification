Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,253
We all served.

191
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,691
No kidding?
What side were you on?

192
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,564
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

193
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,135
You aided and
abetted KGB agents

194
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:28,408
who broke into a top-secret
military installation

195
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,280
in the middle of the United
States of America, my country.

196
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:34,286
What was in the
steel box they took?

197
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,126
You tell us.
You've seen it before.

198
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,872
You mean that
Air Force fiasco in '47.

199
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,648
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

200
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,621
and 20 people I wasn't
allowed to speak to.

201
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,792
Hauled out in the middle of the
night in the middle of nowhere

202
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,396
on some urgent recovery
project and shown what?

203
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:58,000
Pieces of wreckage

204
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:02,341
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

205
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:05,347
None of us was ever
given the full picture.

206
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:08,086
And we were threatened with
treason if we ever talked about it.

207
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,023
So, you tell me,
what was in the box?

208
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,493
Indy, thank God.

209
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,797

Describe her.

Tall, thin, mid-30s,

217
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,565
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

218
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,210
Yeah, that's her.

Who is she?

I'm sure.

that you are of interest to the Bureau.

238
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:32,485

abandoned in 2500 B.C.

as to why its occupants

to Harold Oxley in 20 years.

He's a brilliant guy.

305
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:53,497
He could put you
to sleep just by talking.

306
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,670
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

307

Oxley's voice was better than

Oxley said he found it this time.

331
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:07,342
He said this was real and he was
off to a place called Akator with it.

332
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:10,146
Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

That's what he said. He
said Akator. What is it?

It's a mythical
lost city in the Amazon.

to build a giant city
out of solid gold.

338
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:31,389
It had aqueducts
and paved roads

be seen again for 5,000 years.

00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:45,282
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

342
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,488
I don't think it exists.

343
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,461
Why would Ox want to
take the skull there?

skull was stolen from Akator

that skull someplace,

come up with it,

692
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:39,998
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

693
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:46,845
Now I know why Oxley put the
skull back where he found it.

694
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,180
He knew you were
looking for it.

695
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,285
That skull is no
mere deity carving.

696
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,389
Surely you knew that the
moment you laid eyes on it.

697
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:55,495
It was not made
by human hands.

698
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:57,098
Who made it, then?

699
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:01,674
Come on.

700
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:06,383
The body we found in New
Mexico was not the first.

701
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:10,357
We'd already dissected two others from
similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

702
00:59:10,426 --> 00:59:12,194
Saucer men from Mars.

703
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:14,432
The legends about
Akator are all true.

704
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,937
Early men could not have
conceived it, much less built it.

705
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:19,175
It was a city
of supreme beings

706
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:22,348
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

707
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:24,819
You got to be kidding me.

708
00:59:24,886 --> 00:59:27,925
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

709
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:33,737
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

710
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,908
Unlike the others
we'd found,

711
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:38,078
its skeleton was
pure crystal.

712
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,053
A distant cousin, perhaps.

713
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,691
Maybe they, too,
were sent to find Akator.

714
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,730
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

715
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:52,907
There is no
other explanation.

716
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:54,911
There's always
another explanation.

717
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:59,253
The skull was stolen from
Akator in the 15th century.

718
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:00,923
Whoever returns it...

719
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:02,994
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

720
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:06,000
I've heard that
bedtime story before.

721
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:09,073
It's a legend. Why do you
think Akator even existed?

722
01:00:09,174 --> 01:00:11,644
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN) You should
ask your friend that question.

723
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,681
We're certain
he's been there.

724
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:16,187
Oxley?

726
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:33,220
Ox, it's me, Indy.

727
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:35,224
Ox?

728
01:00:37,195 --> 01:00:39,599
Ox, you're faking it, right?

729
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:42,605
"Through eyes
that last I saw in tears..."

730
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:46,713
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

731
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:48,350
You were born
in Leeds, England.

732
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:51,088
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

733
01:00:51,156 --> 01:00:54,227
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

734
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,235
My name is
Henry Jones, Jr.

735
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,108
What have you
done to him?

736
01:01:01,176 --> 01:01:03,446
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

737
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:06,752
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

738
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,257
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

739
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:11,962
His mind, it seems,
is quite weak.

740
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,066
Let's hope
yours is stronger.

741
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,980
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

742
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:23,218
opening a psychic channel.

743
01:01:23,285 --> 01:01:27,393
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

744
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:32,069
We believe you can get through to
him after you have done the same.

745
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:34,940
I've got a better idea.
You look at it.

746
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:38,047
The skull does not speak
to everyone, it seems.

747
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:42,088
Surely you're not
afraid, Dr. Jones.

748
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,760
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

749
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:47,933
Think of the truth
behind those eyes.

750
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:50,571
There may be hundreds
of skulls at Akator.

751
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,243
Whoever finds them will control
the greatest natural force

752
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:55,047

Power over the mind of man.

754
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:04,064
Be careful, you might get
exactly what you wish for.

755
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:05,868

not to come here.

1213
01:52:41,552 --> 01:52:43,789
Like a broom
to their footprints.

1214
01:52:46,629 --> 01:52:49,801
Where did they go? Space?

1215
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:53,241
Not into space.

1216
01:52:53,343 --> 01:52:55,779
Into the space
between spaces.

1217
01:53:04,832 --> 01:53:06,266
MUTT: I don't understand.

1218
01:53:08,205 --> 01:53:11,143
Why this legend
of a city of gold?

1219
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:15,318
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1220
01:53:15,386 --> 01:53:19,326
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1221
01:53:19,394 --> 01:53:21,497
Knowledge was
their treasure.

1222
01:53:37,295 --> 01:53:39,598
What? We're just
going to sit here?

1223
01:53:39,666 --> 01:53:41,369
Night falls quick
in the jungle, kid.

1224
01:53:41,437 --> 01:53:43,339
You don't want to climb down
the mountain in the dark.

1225
01:53:43,407 --> 01:53:44,308
No?

1226
01:53:45,945 --> 01:53:49,452
I can. Who's coming
with me? Come on.

1227
01:53:49,519 --> 01:53:51,856
Why don't you
stick around, Junior?

1228
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:54,461
(SCOFFS)

1229
01:53:54,528 --> 01:53:57,300
I don't know.
Why didn't you, Dad?

1230
01:53:59,572 --> 01:54:00,974
Dad!

1231
01:54:04,181 --> 01:54:05,950
Dad?

1232
01:54:10,961 --> 01:54:13,532
Somewhere your
grandpa is laughing.

1233
01:54:30,266 --> 01:54:33,638
Marvelous! Perfect! Make the
letters bigger, much bigger.

1234
01:54:46,665 --> 01:54:50,437
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

1235
01:54:50,505 --> 01:54:55,547
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

1236
01:54:55,615 --> 01:54:58,820
have promised your love
for each other by these vows

1237
01:54:58,888 --> 01:55:02,261
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

1238
01:55:02,329 --> 01:55:06,068
I now declare you to be
husband and wife.

1239
01:55:06,136 --> 01:55:10,811
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

1240
01:55:10,879 --> 01:55:13,683
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

1241
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,255
Congratulations.

1242
01:55:17,324 --> 01:55:19,261
You may kiss your bride.

1243
01:55:40,036 --> 01:55:41,307
Well done,
Henry!

1244
01:55:41,772 --> 01:55:43,675
BOTH: Thanks, Ox.

1245
01:55:54,297 --> 01:55:55,632
