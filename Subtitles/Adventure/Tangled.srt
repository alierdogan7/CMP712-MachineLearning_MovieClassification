<i>(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.</i>

5
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:03,038
<i>Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

6
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,587
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

7
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:10,038
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

8
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:16,509
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,212
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

10
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:26,545
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

11
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,657
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

12
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:31,563
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

13
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,356
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

14
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:39,028
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.</i>

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,389
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

16
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:46,525
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

17
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,007
<i>but she got sick,</i>

18
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,805
<i>really, sick.</i>

19
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,246
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

20
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,745
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

21
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:58,298
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

22
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,867
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

23
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,179
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,257
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

25
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:10,165
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

26
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:14,246
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

27
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:22,214
Mother Gothel: *Old voice: Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*

28
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:30,519
*Make the clock reverse,
(Younger voice) bring back what once was mine*

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,221
*What once was mine*

30
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,236
<i>Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

31
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,499
Guard: We've found it!

32
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,609
<i>Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.</i>

33
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,507
<i>A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.
(Baby giggles)</i>

34
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,608
<i>With beautiful golden hair.</i>

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,110
(Baby laughs)

36
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,246
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

37
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,024
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

38
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:26,583
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

39
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

40
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:39,136
<i>(Door creaks)
And then that moment ended.</i>

41
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:49,666
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*</i>

42
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,948
<i>*Make the clock re...*
HUH!</i>

43
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,708
<i>(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,</i>

44
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,559
<i>stole the child, and just like that...gone.</i>

45
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,163
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

46
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,030
<i>For deep within the forest</i>

47
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,567
<i>In a hidden tower.</i>

48
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,484
<i>Gothel raised the child
as her own.</i>

49
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:24,410
<i>Rapunzel: *...take what has been lost, bring back what
once was mine, what once was mine.*</i>

50
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,447
<i>Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.</i>

51
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,790
<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

52
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,606
Rapunzel: Why can't I go outside?

53
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,677
The outside world is a dangerous place.

54
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,032
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

55
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:44,043
-Gothel: You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Rapunzel: Yes, Mommy.

56
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,377
<i>Flynn: But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.</i>

57
00:04:55,534 --> 00:05:00,144
<i>Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.</i>

58
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:05,925
<i>In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.</i>

59
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,795
HAH!

60
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,879
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

61
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:33,306
(Snickers)

62
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,003
GOTCHA!
(Screams)

63
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,693
That's twenty two for me.

64
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,318
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

65
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,749
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

66
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,565
Yeah, I don't think so.

67
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,425
I like it in here and so do you.

68
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,446
(Blows raspberry)

69
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:58,837
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.

70
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,680
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

71
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,924
<i>*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*</i>

72
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,142
<i>*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*</i>

73
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:23,999
<i>*Polish and wax, do laundry and
mop and shine up.*</i>

74
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>*Sweep again, and by then
it's like 7:15.*</i>

75
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,207
<i>*So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.*</i>

76
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,915
<i>*Ill add a few new paintings
to my gallery.*</i>

77
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:42,331
<i>*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook
and basically.*</i>

78
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,377
<i>*Just wonder when will my
life, begin.*</i>

79
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,816
<i>*Then after lunch, it's puzzles,
and darts and baking.*</i>

80
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,336
<i>*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet,
and chess.*</i>

81
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,550
<i>*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*</i>

82
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:15,874
<i>*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*</i>

83
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:21,531
<i>*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*</i>

84
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:26,622
<i>*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.*</i>

85
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:30,920
<i>*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*</i>

86
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,941
<i>*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,
and wondering...*</i>

87
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:40,199
<i>*Wondering, when will my life begin?*</i>

88
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:49,062
<i>*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*</i>

89
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:58,108
<i>*Just like they do on my birthday,
each year.*</i>

90
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:08,454
<i>*What is it like, out there
where they glow?*</i>

91
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:17,362
<i>*Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.*</i>

92
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,369
(Rattling on shingles)

93
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:36,889
(Armor clanging)

94
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,402
Wow!

95
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,974
I could get used to a view like this.

96
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,441
-Stabbington brother 1: Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.

97
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:52,024
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

98
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:55,606
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.

99
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Aaaahchoo!

100
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,757
Flynn: Oh, hay fever?

101
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,827
Yeah.

102
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,589
Huh?

103
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,937
Guard: Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!

104
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:19,210
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?

105
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,295
'Cause I certainly can.

106
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,828
Flynn's voice fades: Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

107
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,484
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

108
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:30,860
This is it. This is
a very big day, Pascal.

109
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,779
I'm finally going to do it.

110
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,569
-I'm going to ask her.
-Gothel: RAPUNZEL!

111
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,034
Gothel: Let down your hair.

112
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,832
It's time.

113
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:45,210
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.

114
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:52,292
Gothel: Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.

115
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,165
Coming, mother.

116
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:21,355
Hi, welcome home, mother.

117
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:26,108
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,

118
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:30,147
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.

119
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:32,376
Oh, it's nothing.

120
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,422
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.

121
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,431
(Laughs) Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

122
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:44,696
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

123
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:47,571
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?

124
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:52,010
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

125
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,821
Oh look, you're here too.

126
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:58,153
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

127
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,072
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

128
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,724
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

129
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,063
Would you sing for me, dear?

130
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,737
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.

131
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,717
<i>(Sings VERY fast)
*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,

<i>*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

133
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,615
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,

134
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,768
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

135
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,003
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

136
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,383
TADA!

137
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,531
No, no, no can't be.

138
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:38,980
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

139
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,341
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

140
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:47,082
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

141
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,880
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

142
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,930
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...

143
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,613
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

144
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,650
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

145
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,748
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

146
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,217
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

147
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,083
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

148
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,737
-What?
-Rapunzel: Oh,...

149
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:19,406
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.

150
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,669
Oh, you mean the stars.

151
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,453
That's the thing

152
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:28,818
Rapunzel: I've charted stars and they're
always constant.

153
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,770
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

154
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,807
Only on my birthday.

155
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,594
And I can't help but feel like they're,

156
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,862
They're meant for me.

157
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:44,592
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

158
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,092
In person.

159
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,972
I have to know what they are.

160
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,214
You want to go outside?

161
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,445
Oh, why Rapunzel.

162
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:56,798
Look at you, as
fragile as a flower.

166
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,698

-Rapunzel?
-Yes?

194
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,522
Don't ever ask to
leave this tower, again.

195
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,560
Yes, Mother.

196
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:02,722
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

197
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,824

in a bit, my flower.

204
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,819
I'll be here.

205

(Panting)

206
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:59,487
No, no no. This is bad, this is
very, very bad, This is really bad.

207
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,962
They just can't get my nose right.

208

Who cares.

209
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,182
Well it's easy for you to say.

210
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:08,295
You guys look amazing.

and I'll pull you up.

213
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,311
Give us the satchel first.

Wha..? I just...

215
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,735
I can't believe, that after all
we've been through together,

216
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,127
you don't trust me.

Now help us up, pretty boy.

228
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,436
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.

229
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:43,844
No.

230
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,354
No, stop it.

231
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,525
Stop it.

232
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:48,010

shoop...shoop.))

in my closet.

I've got a person in my closet.

I've got a person in my closet!

258

To weak to handle myself
out there, huh Mother?

259

Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
(((Clang!)))

Gothel: Let down your hair.

264
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,123
One moment, Mother.

265
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:19,313
I have a big surprise.

266
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,587
Uh, I do too.

267
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,269
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

268
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,737
I seriously doubt it.

269
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:32,673
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

270
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:33,894
Surprise!

271
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,583
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.

272
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,268
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

273
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,934
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

274
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:44,729
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.

275
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,116
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

276
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,745
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.

277
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,049
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

278
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,027
No Mother, I'm just saying,

279
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,906
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

280
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:01,379
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

281
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,639
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

282
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,899
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.

283
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,288
-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.

284
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,484
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

285
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:14,026
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!

286
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:23,504
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

287
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,454
All I was gonna say, mother
is that...

288
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:42,758
I know what I want for my
birthday, now.

289
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,503
And what is that?

290
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:50,870
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.

291
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:53,987
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.

292
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,870
Almost three day's time.

293
00:23:56,092 --> 00:24:00,928
I just thought it was a
better idea than, uh, stars.

294
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,787
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?

295
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:10,825
I know I'm safe, as long
as I'm here.

296
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,825
(kisses)

297
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,834
Gothel: I'll be back in three days time.

298
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:25,143
I love you very much, dear.

299
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,099
Rapunzel: I love you more.

300
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,645
Gothel: I love you most.

301
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:45,536
(Chair legs drag)

302
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:50,682
(Takes in deep breath)
(Lets breath out)

303
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,311
Whispers: Okay.

304
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,279
((Plop!))

305
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:03,328
(squeaks on floor)

306
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:09,183
Hmm.

307
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,719
(Chair drags on floor)

308
00:25:20,007 --> 00:25:21,007
((Slap))

309
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,444
((Slap...slap))

310
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:25,612
((poke...poke))

311
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:29,897
((Squish))

312
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:30,881
AHHH!

313
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:35,096
(Grunts and struggles)

314
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Flynn: Is this...hair?

315
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:44,481
Rapunzel: Struggling...struggling is pointless.

316
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:45,564
Huh?

317
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,634
Rapunzel: I know why you're here.

318
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,358
And I'm not afraid of you.

319
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,871
What?

320
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,445
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

321
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,262
Ah hah.

322
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,963
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

323
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:16,104
(Clears throat)

324
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,763
Says in noble voice: I know not who you are.

325
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,928
Nor how I came to find you.

326
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,869
But may I just say.

327
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,107
Says in lecherous voice: Hi!

328
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,753
How you doing?

329
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,259
The name's Flynn Ryder.

330
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,138
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?

331
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:40,029
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

332
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,577
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.

333
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:43,725
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

334
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,519
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

335
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,671
I came across your tower and...

336
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:52,034
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

337
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,576
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

338
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,160
It's in that pot, isn't it.

339
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:01,855
(((Clang!!)))

340
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:05,783
Huh?

341
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,087
Ahh, will you stop that.

342
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:11,818
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

343
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,143
So, what do you want,
with my hair?

344
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,381
-To cut it?
-What?

345
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,041
-Sell it?
-No!

346
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,960
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

347
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,740
is to get out of it.
Literally.

348
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,216
Wait, you don't want my hair?

349
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,193
Why on earth would
I want your hair?

350
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,679
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

351
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,695
You're, telling the truth?

352
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,149
Yes.

353
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,263
Hmmm.

354
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,730
I know, I need someone
to take me.

355
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,118
(Pascal chatters)
I think he's telling the truth, too.

356
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,700
Doesn't have fangs,
but what choice do I have?

357
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
(Chair bangs on floor)

358
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:04,187
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

359
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,856
-Deal?
-Look this way.

360
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,437
Oh...oomph!

361
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,009
Do you know what these are?

362
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,311
Nasal voice: You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

363
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,189
Lanterns?

364
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,330
I knew they weren't stars.

365
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:22,812
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

366
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:26,851
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

367
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:30,462
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

368
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:34,741
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

369
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:35,939
That is my deal.

370
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,645
Yeah, no can do.

371
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:43,491
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
aren't exactly, simpatico,

372
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:45,783
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

373
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,991
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.

374
00:28:55,992 --> 00:29:00,188
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.

375
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,792
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

376
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,121
A horrible decision, really.

377
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,497
But trust me, when I tell you this.

378
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:12,602
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

379
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:17,015
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

380
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,988
Let me just get this straight.

381
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,876
I take you to see the lanterns.

382
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,176
Bring you back home,

383
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:25,347
and you'll give me back my satchel?

384
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,605
I promise.

385
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:33,381
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

386
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,222
EVER!

387
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:43,049
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

388
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,641
but you leave me no choice.

389
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:47,056
Here comes the 'smolder'.

390
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:51,706
*sexy music*

391
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,610
This is kind of an off day for me.

392
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,398
This doesn't normally happen.

393
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,986
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

394
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,487
Really!

395
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,899
-Ooops.
-Flynn: You broke my 'smolder'.

396
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,703
You coming, Blondie?

397
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,915
<i>*Look at the world so close, and I'm
half way to it*</i>

398
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:32,167

do I even dare?*</i>

399
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:37,097
<i>*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*</i>

400
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,121
Should I? No.

401
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:41,886
<i>*Here I go.*</i>

402
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:45,815
(Laughs)

403
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,475
*Triumphant music*

404

<i>(Rapunzel sings When will my life begin)

I can't believe I did this.

414
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,694
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

415
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,950
Mother would be so furious.

416
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:17,944
But that's okay, whatever she doesnt
know won't kill her, right?

417
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:20,754
(Echoing) Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

418
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:24,093
(Thrilled) THIS IS SO FUN!

419
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:27,737
(Despondent) I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.

420
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,388
(Excited) I am never going
baaaccckkk!

421
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:34,380
(Dejected) I am a despicable human being.

422
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,440
WAHHOOOOO!

423
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,047
Best day, ever!

424
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,444

425
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:46,142
(Clears throat)

426
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,674
You know, I can't help but notice,

427
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:53,963
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

428
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,415
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up
bits and pieces,

429
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,827
of course, over protective mother,
forbidden road trip.

430
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,412
I mean, this is serious stuff.

431
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,327
But let me ease your conscious.

432
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,059
This is part of growing up.

433
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,178
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

434
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,116
That's good, healthy even.

435
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,112
(Laughs) You think?

436
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:15,091
I know. You're way over thinking
this, trust me.

437
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,257
Does your mother deserve it?
No.

438
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,758
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

439
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,760
Of course.
But you just got to do it.

440
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,166
Break her heart?

441
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,364
-In half.
-Crush her soul?

442
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,263
((Squish))
Like a grape.

443
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:33,055
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

444
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,966
I am, aren't I, oh bother.

445
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,565
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

446
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:42,212
I'm letting you out of the deal.

447
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,040
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.

448
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,634
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's
just turn around,

449
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,386
and get you home, here's
your pan, here's your frog.

450
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,142
I get back my satchel.

451
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:52,246
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

452
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,392
based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.

453
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,897
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!

454
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:02,775
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

455
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,684
I will use this.

456
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:06,026
(Branches snap)

457
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,227
(Leaves rustle)

458
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,258
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?

459
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,188
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

460
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,885
Oh, sorry.

461
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,944
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

462
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,880
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

463
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:32,334
(Laughs)
Yeah, that probably be best.

464
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,317
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

465
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,663
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.

466
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,182
You'll know it when you smell it.

467
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:42,952
(Sniffing, snorting)

468
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:00,043

(Gasp)

472
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,276
Oh, a Palace horse.

473
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,465
Where's your rider?

474
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,550
Rapunzel.

475
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:27,905
RAPUNZEL!

476
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,457
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

477
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:42,918
Rapunzel?

478
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:50,536
((ripping...tearing))

479
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:56,857
((banging))

480
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,418
Rapunzel!

481
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,170
Frantically: RAPUNZEL!

482
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,409
(Gasps in fear)

483
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:34,976
(Metallic Clang on floor)

484
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,839
Flynn: I know it's around here, somewhere.

485
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,516
Ah, there it is.

486
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,438
Flynn: The Snuggly duckling.

487
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:03,189
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.

488
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,594
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this whole endeavor now do we?

489
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:09,996
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!

490
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,270
Garcon, your finest table, please.

491
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,387
(Gasps)

492
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,519

493

(Hook rings)

494
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,844
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

495
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,938
(Breathes in)
Flynn: Really let that seep in.

496
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,953
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell.

497
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,836
and the other part is
really bad man smell.

498
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:33,272
I don't know why, but overall,
it just smells like the color brown.

499
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:34,290
Your thoughts?

500
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,964
That's a lot of hair.

501
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,921
She's growing it out, is that blood
on your moustache?

502
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:42,517
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.

503
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:44,676
Flynn: Look sir, that's a lot of blood.

504
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:45,676
(Thug growls)

505
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,838
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

506
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,214
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.

507
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,423
Probably be better off. This is a five
star joint after all.

508
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:56,891
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.

509
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:59,582
(Door slams)
Is this you?

510
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:04,575
Flynn: No, no this is being mean.

511
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,827
Oh, it's him all right.

512
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,036
Gretel, go find some guards.

513
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:12,210
That reward's going to
buy me a new hook.

514
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,654
I can use the money.

515
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:15,684
What about me?
I'm broke.

516
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:19,608
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.

517
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,708
Hey, leave him alone.

518
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:26,109
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide...ruffians.

519
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,511
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!

520
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,230
Flynn: Whoaa!

521
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,808
Flynn: Not the nose, not the nose,
not the nose!

522
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,788
Put him down!

523
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,508
Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

524
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,825
because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.

525
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,527
Find your humanity.

526
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,630
Havent any of you ever had a dream?

527
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:09,035
I, had a dream.

528
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,132
Once.

529
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:12,364
(Axe slams into wall)

530
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:13,585
(Plays concertina)

531
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,297
<i>(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*</i>

532
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:23,366
<i>*My sneer could curdle dairy.*</i>

533
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:26,669
<i>*And violence-wise my hands
are not the cleanest.*</i>

534
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,310
<i>*But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.*</i>

535
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,819
<i>*I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.*</i>

536
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:38,570

performing Mozart.*</i>

537

<i>*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*</i>

539
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:48,350
<i>*For my killer show-tune medley.

540
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:51,210

I've got a dream.*</i>

<i>*He's got a dream,
he's got a dream.*</i>

542
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:58,060
<i>*See, I ain't as cruel and
vicious as I seem.*</i>

543
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,694
<i>*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*</i>

544
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,781
<i>*You can count me with the dreamers.*</i>

545
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,421
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

546

my complexion.*</i>

<i>Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*</i>

551
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,931
<i>*And my goiter and my nose.*</i>

00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:25,034
<i>*I really want to make a love
connection.*</i>

553
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:29,063
<i>*Can't you see me with a special
little lady.*</i>

554
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:32,326
<i>*Rowing in a row boat,
down the stream.*</i>

<i>*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*</i>

557
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:39,457

What about you?

570
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,299
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?

571
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,507
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
(Whispers) I don't sing.

<i>*They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny.*</i>

576

<i>*On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.*</i>

Yeah!

592
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,681
I found the guards.

593
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:36,751
Where's Ryder,
where is he?

594
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:38,909
I know he's in here somewhere.

595
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:42,024
Find him, turn the place
upside down if you have to!
(Slams fist)

(Gears winding)

598
00:42:58,023 --> 00:43:00,817
Go, live your dream.

599
00:43:00,818 --> 00:43:02,162
I will.

600
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,706
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.

601
00:43:06,906 --> 00:43:08,391
Thanks for everything.

602
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:15,119
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.

603
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,937
You got me.

604
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,407
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

605
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,972
(Horse whinnies)

606
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:24,933

((sniffing))

608
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,799
What's he doing?

609
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:39,069
((Snorts))

610
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:42,182
(gears winding)

611
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:46,581
A passage, come on men,
let's go.

612
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,634
Captain: Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

613
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:53,586
Uhhh!

614
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:55,573
Play it safe.

615
00:43:57,871 --> 00:43:59,296
We'll go get the crown.

616
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:10,882
Small thug: I gotta dream,
I got some dream.

617
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,851
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

618
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:20,082
Because I just found me a
tall drink of water.

619
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:24,170
Oh stop it, you big lug.

620
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,649
Where does that tunnel led out?

621
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,726
Knife!

622
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:28,959
(Rats squeaking)

623
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,624
Flynn: Well, that got us safe.

624
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,964
Didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty, impressive.

625
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,307
Excitedly: I KNOW!

626
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:40,083
Subdued: I know...

627
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,327
Sooo, Flynn.

628
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,528
Where are you from?

629
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,714
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

630
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:51,611
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

631
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:54,087
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

632
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,901
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.

633
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,745
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

634
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:00,102
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.

635
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:04,056
Here's my question though, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

636
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:06,414
why haven't you gone before?

637
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,277
Uhh, heh, well...

638
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:11,609
(Rocks clattering)

639
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:16,787
((Deep rumbling))
Uh, Flynn...

640
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,675
Flynn!

(Horse neighs)

642
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,632
Run,
RUN!

643
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,694
(Wood breaking)

644
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:42,171
Who's that?

645
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,375
They don't like me.

646
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,804
-Rapunzel: Who's that?
-Flynn: They don't like me either.

647
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:49,107
-Rapunzel: Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,

648
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,624
that everyone here doesn't like me.

649
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,124
Here.

650
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,190
(Captain laughs)

651
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:03,062
I've waited a long time for this.

652
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,063
(Whimpers)

653
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:05,967
((Clang))

654
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:16,072
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

655
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:17,513
HAH!

656
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,576
(Neighs challenge)

657
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:29,207
You should know that this is
the strangest thing I've ever done.

658
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:35,643
How 'bout two out of three?

659
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,026
Flynn!

660
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:44,427
Flynn, look out.

661
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,765
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.

662
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:51,705
You should see your faces.
Because you look...

663
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,000
(Grunts) Ridiculous

664
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:56,200
((Pounding))

665
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:02,572
Flynn: Come on, Blondie.

666
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:03,866
Jump.

667
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:17,851
((Splash))

668
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:28,026
(Wood groaning and breaking)

669
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:34,550
(Dam exploding, water rushing over)

670

(Flynn and Rapunzel panting)

672
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:54,606
Rapunzel: Aaaah!

673
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,559
(Sound of water rushing in)

674
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
(Flynn takes in breath)

675
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:17,109
(Bang...bang...bang)

676
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:23,796
(Grunts in pain)

677
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:26,885
(Takes in breath)

678
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:36,452
It's no use,
I can't see anything.

679
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:38,872
(Holds breath)

680
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,167
Hey, there's no point.

681
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,011
It's pitch black down there.

682
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:50,687
(Both panting)

683
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,240
(Whispers) This is all my fault.

684
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:59,027
She was right, I never
should have done this.

685
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:00,213
((sniffles))

686
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:04,837
I'm so...

687
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,128
(Sobs) I'm so sorry, Flynn.

688
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:10,965
(Cries)

689
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,346
Eugene.

690
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,669
What?

691
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:22,500
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

692
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:26,075
Someone might as well know.

693
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:32,532
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

694
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:33,593
What?

695
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:39,896
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

696
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,835
<i>*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*</i>

697
00:49:43,836 --> 00:49:45,007
(Both take in deep breath)

698
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:52,277
(Burbles) Whoa!

699
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:27,838
(Gasping for breath)

700
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:30,121
(Coughing)

701
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:35,413
We made it.

702
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:37,277
Her hair glows.

703
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,002
We're alive.
I'm alive!

704
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,834
-I didn't see that coming.
-Rapunzel: Eugene.
-You're hair actually glows.

705
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,724
-Rapunzel: Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?

706
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:46,043
-Rapunzel: EUGENE!
-What?

707
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:49,874
It doesn't just glow.

708
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,934
Why is he smiling at me?

709
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:06,880
(Sound of climbing and coughing)

710
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,881
(Coughing, trying to catch breath)

711
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:19,629
I'll kill him.

712
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,358
I'll kill that, Ryder.

713
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,851
Stabbington brother 1: We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

714
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:27,079
And get back the crown, come on.

715
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:29,668
Gothel: Boys.

716
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:35,750
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

717
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,857
and think for a moment.

718
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:39,900
((Blades ring))

719
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,258
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

720
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:51,540
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

721
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,472
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

722
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:56,485
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

723
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:58,483
And that wasn't even the best part.

724
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,070
Oh well, C'est la vie.

725
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,324
Enjoy  your crown.

726
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,565
What's the best part?

727
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:10,918
It comes with revenge
on Flynn Ryder.

728
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:16,896
(fire crackles)

729
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:22,285
So you're being strangely cryptic as you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

730
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:24,689
-Aaah!
-Sorry.

731
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,261
Just don't, don't freak out.

-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.

743
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,520
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

744
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:38,984
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
and the magical qualities that it possesses.

745
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,783
How long has it been
doing that, exactly?

746
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,575
Forever, I guess.

747
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:49,109
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

748
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,504
They wanted to take it for themselves.

749
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:53,811
But, once it's cut.

750
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:56,500
It turns brown, and looses its power.

751
00:53:57,194 --> 00:54:00,837
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

752
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,080
That's why Mother never let me...

753
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,742
(Sighs)

754
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:12,027
That's why...I never left the...

755
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,928
You never left that tower.

756
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:21,945
And you're still gonna go back?

757
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,686
No...yes?

758
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:28,433
It's complicated.

759
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,153
Aaaah.

760
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:42,318
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

761
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,072
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of

762
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:49,160
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit of a...

763
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,873
It's a little bit of a downer.

764
00:54:53,554 --> 00:54:54,554
Heh.

765
00:54:57,146 --> 00:54:58,741
There was this book.

766
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:01,342
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

767
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,160
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

768
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:05,960
Swashbuckling rogue,
richest man alive.

769
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:09,943
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing
to ever brag about, of course.

770
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,461
Was he a thief too?

771
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:16,099
Ahh, well no.

772
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,645
Actually, he had enough
money to do anything that he wanted to do.

773
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:21,378
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

774
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:24,568
And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.

775
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:26,582
I don't know, I...

776
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:29,065
It just seemed like a better option.

777
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:32,561
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

778
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,127
It could ruin my whole reputation.

779
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:38,034
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

780
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:40,806
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

781
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:42,243
(Laughs)

782
00:55:48,113 --> 00:55:51,126
Um, well I should uh...

783
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,572
I, I should get some
more firewood.

784
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:56,203
Rapunzel: Hey.

785
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:02,605
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

786
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:07,394
Well, then you'd be the first.

787
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:09,379
But, thank you.

788
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:21,523
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

789
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:22,822
Mother?

790
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:24,827
Hello, dear.

791
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,943
Rapunzel: But I...I..., don't we...

792
00:56:27,157 --> 00:56:28,965
How did you find me?

793
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:30,901
Oh, it was easy really.

794
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:35,381
I just listened for the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

795
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,963
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.

796
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:42,390
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.

797
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:44,226
I've been on this incredible journey.

798
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,437
And I've seen and learned so much.

799
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,231
I even met someone.

800
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:51,573
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

801
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,691
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.

802
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,231
I think

803
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:58,715
I think he likes me.

804
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:01,334
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

805
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,375
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.

806
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:08,581
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

807
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:13,355
just proves you're to naive to be here.

808
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:16,633
Why would he like you?
Come on now, really.

809
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,918
Look at you, you think
that he's impressed?

810
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:24,270

Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.

838

I mean because here's the thing.

Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

840

01:00:04,402 --> 01:00:05,623
Easy.

856
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:09,085
That's it.

857
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,386
Now sit.

858
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:17,218
-Sit.
-Flynn: What?

859
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,130
Now drop the boot.

860
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:20,676
Drop it.

861
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,569
((Spit...plop))

862
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,836
Oh, you are such a good boy.

863
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:28,323
Yes you are.

864
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:33,356
You all tired, from chasing the bad
man all over the place?

865
01:00:33,357 --> 01:00:34,499
Flynn: Excuse me?

866
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,397
Nobody appreciates
you, do they?

867
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:38,428
Do they?

868
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:41,014
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

869
01:00:41,015 --> 01:00:43,517
Oh, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.

870
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:45,336
Isn't that right?

871
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:47,599
Rapunzel: Maximus.

872
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:50,308
You've got to be
kidding me.

873
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:55,250
Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.

874
01:00:55,828 --> 01:01:00,290
And the thing is, I need you
'not' to get him arrested.

875
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:03,004
Just for twenty four hours and then,

876
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,264
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.

877
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:06,318
Okay?

878
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,350
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

879
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:27,999
OOMPH!!

880
01:01:33,392 --> 01:01:34,471
(Mouths) WOW

881

885
01:02:04,149 --> 01:02:05,166
Ahh!

886
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:07,866
Sorry.

887
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:16,938

888
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:19,916
(Gasps in joy)

889
01:02:30,587 --> 01:02:31,686
Thank you.

890
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:49,832
It's for the lost Princess.

891

Man: To the boats

898
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:22,154
Hey, Max.

899
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:23,767
((Thunk))

900
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:27,901
What? I brought them.

901
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,953
Most of them.

902
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,706
Where are we going?

903
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,960
Well, best day of your life.

904
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,962
I figured you should have
a decent seat.

905
01:04:57,899 --> 01:04:59,494
You okay?

906
01:05:00,632 --> 01:05:02,164
I'm terrified.

907
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,511
Why?

908
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:09,130
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

909
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:13,980
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

910
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:19,177
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

911
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,167
It will be.

912
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:26,507
And what if it is?

913
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,612
What will I do then?

914
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:31,374
Well that's the good part,
I guess.

915
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:34,346
You get to go find a new dream.

I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.

you guys. Since we got separated.

Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

You gotta be excited about that.

Anyhow, just wanted to say,

964
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:42,569
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

965
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:46,781
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

967
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:54,697
-What?
-We heard you found something.

968
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:57,843
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

969
01:11:58,323 --> 01:12:01,642
We want her, instead.

01:12:08,986 --> 01:12:09,986

971
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:15,304

ran off with the crown and left me.

01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:23,427
He did.

973
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:26,413
What?
No.

974
01:12:26,414 --> 01:12:27,437

-I was so worried about
you dear.

So I followed you.

994

And I saw them attack you.

before they come to.

Gothel: There,
it never happened.

1013
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,997
Now, wash up for dinner.

1014
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:23,700
I'm making hazel nut soup.

1015
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,207
I really did try, Rapunzel.

1016
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,437
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.

1017
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:37,359
The world is dark, and selfish,

1018
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,598
and cruel.

1019
01:15:38,598 --> 01:15:41,818
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.

1020
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:44,750
It destroys it.

How did you know about her?

1027
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:29,633
Tell me, now!

1028
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:30,884
It wasn't us.

1029
01:17:30,884 --> 01:17:32,355
It was the old lady.

1030
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,985
Old lady?

1031
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,478
Wait, no, wait!

Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

Are you all right?

1038

I'm the lost princess.

1039
01:17:54,556 --> 01:17:58,179
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

1040
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,065
I am the lost Princess.

1041
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:02,106
Aren't I?

1042
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,787
Did I mumble, Mother?

1043
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:10,730
Or should I even call you that?

1044
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:15,248
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

1045
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,846
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

1046
01:18:17,847 --> 01:18:21,054
It was you!
It was all, you.

1047
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:26,933
Everything I did, was to protect you.

1048

-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,

1049
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:34,670
...hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

1050
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:37,151
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.

1051
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:38,195
From you.

1052
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:39,407
Where will you go?

1053
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:41,394
Gothel: He won't be there for you.

1054
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:43,221
Rapunzel: What did you do to him?

1055
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:47,207
Gothel: That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

1056

-(Gasps) No.
-Now, now. It's all right.

1057

Listen to me.

1058
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,471
All of this is as
it should be.

1059
01:18:55,472 --> 01:18:56,578
Rapunzel: NO!

1060
01:18:57,295 --> 01:18:59,903
You were wrong about the world.

1061
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,149
And you were wrong about me.

1062
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,655
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

Fine.

1066
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:22,103

1073

-What?
-Nope.

1074
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:45,617
Open this door.

1075

Thank you.

No really, thank you.

1097

Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.

1098

your right. We should go.

see you again.

Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.

Oh don't worry, dear.

Gothel: Our secret will die with him.
(Flynn moans in pain)

Gothel: And as for us?

1119

We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

1124
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:55,176
NO! I won't stop.

1125

For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.

I will go with you.

I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.

1132

Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

Forever, just like you want.

1134

the way it was.

-No..

-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.

And I can't let you die.

-But if you do this.
-Shhh.

1147

-Then you...will die.
-Hey.

1148

01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:50,084
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

1209
01:30:50,717 --> 01:30:51,750
<i>Well I'm pleased to tell you.</i>

1210
01:30:51,753 --> 01:30:54,517
<i>That after years, and years of asking,</i>

1211
01:30:54,518 --> 01:30:56,518
<i>and asking, and asking.</i>

1212
01:30:58,215 --> 01:31:00,139
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

1213
01:31:00,352 --> 01:31:01,903
Rapunzel: *Eugene*

1214
01:31:01,905 --> 01:31:04,685
<i>All right, I asked her.</i>

1215
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:06,758
Rapunzel: And we're living happily ever after.

1216
01:31:08,025 --> 01:31:09,428
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

1217
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:22,314
<i>*Grace Potter: Something that I want*</i>

1218
01:31:25,075 --> 01:31:26,075
<i>*Come on*</i>

1219
01:31:31,421 --> 01:31:34,818
<i>*She's a girl with the best intentions*</i>

1220
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:40,173
<i>*He's a man of his own invention*</i>

1221
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:45,794
<i>*She looked out of the window
He walked out the door*</i>

1222
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:53,273
<i>*But she followed him
And he said, "What'cha lookin' for?"*</i>

1223
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:56,039
<i>*She said, "I want something that I want*</i>

1224
01:31:56,821 --> 01:32:00,132
<i>*Something that I tell myself I need*</i>

1225

1232
01:32:27,905 --> 01:32:31,565
<i>*She's gonna come to her own conclusion*</i>

1233
01:32:33,473 --> 01:32:37,197
<i>*Right when you think you know what to say*</i>

1234
01:32:39,143 --> 01:32:44,581
<i>*Someone comes along and
shows you a brand new waaaay*</i>

1235
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:47,539
