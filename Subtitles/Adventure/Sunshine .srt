1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,595
<i>Our sun is dying.</i>

2
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:43,170
<i>Mankind faces extinction.</i>

3
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:49,840
<i>Seven years ago, the Icarus Project
sent a mission to restart the sun.</i>

4
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,813
<i>But that mission was lost
before it reached the star.</i>

5
00:00:55,885 --> 00:01:00,151
<i>Sixteen months ago, I, Robert Capa,
and a crew of seven...</i>

6
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:03,622
<i>...left Earth frozen in a solar winter.</i>

7
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,518
<i>Our payload...</i>

8
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:11,633
<i>...a stellar bomb with the mass
equivalent to Manhattan Island.</i>

9
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:14,470
<i>Our purpose...</i>

10
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:18,699
<i>...to create a star within a star.</i>

11
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,732
<i>Eight astronauts strapped
to the back of a bomb.</i>

12
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,695
<i>My bomb.</i>

13
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:53,468
<i>Welcome to Icarus II.</i>

14
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,202
<i>Icarus.</i>

15
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:29,769
<i>Yes, Dr. Searle?</i>

16
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:33,437
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

17
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:37,245
<i>Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?</i>

18
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:39,549
Down.

19
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:45,558
Oh, my.

20
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:53,197
<i>Icarus, how close is this
to full brightness?</i>

21
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:57,697
<i>At this distance of 36 million miles...</i>

22
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:02,607
<i>...you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.</i>

23
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:04,004
Two percent?

24
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,143
Can you show me 4 percent?

25
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:11,754
<i>Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.</i>

26
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:21,994
<i>However, you could observe
3. 1 percent...</i>

27
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:25,157
<i>...for a period of not longer than
30 seconds.</i>

28
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:28,336
<i>All right. Icarus, I'm gonna reset...</i>

29
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:32,634
...the filter to 3.1 percent.

30
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,638
Well, it's invigorating.

31
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,647
It's like taking a shower in light.

32
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,877
- You lose yourself a little.
- Like a flotation tank.

33
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,111
Actually, no.

34
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,992
Look, what is it, beef?

35
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:27,527
Chicken.

36
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,063
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

37
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,396
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

38
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:36,037
Testing total darkness
on flotation tanks.

39
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:40,073
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

40
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:43,076
You and the darkness are distinct
from each other...

41
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:47,342
...because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

42
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:50,543
But total light, it envelops you.

43
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,347
It becomes you.

44
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,859
It's very strange. I don't...

45
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,152
I recommend it.

46
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,162
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer...

47
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,664
...and I'm clearly a lot saner
than you are.

48
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:08,561
Good.

49
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,585
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

50
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:30,089
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

51
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,456
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

52
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:36,131
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference...

53
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:39,200
...and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

54
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:44,602
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

55
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,264
Possible?

56
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,071
Probable.

57
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,145
We'll finally be on our own.

58
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:56,581
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

59
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,919
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

60
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,148
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone...

61
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,725
...seven days sooner
than we thought.

62
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:09,096
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

63
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:11,395
...you should do it now.

64
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:24,507
Well, Mom and Dad.

65
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,814
I hope you're proud of your son...

66
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,818
...saving mankind and so on.

67
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:04,985
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

68
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,851
It came a little sooner
than we thought.

69
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:13,251
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

70
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:19,161
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

71
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:23,828
Because I know everything
you wanna say.

72
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:37,680
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

73
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,913
Which means you'll know
we've succeeded...

74
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,354
...about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

75
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:48,054
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

76
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:52,565
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day...

77
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,726
...you'll know we made it.

78
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,598
Okay.

79
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,706
I'm signing out.

80
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:04,042
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

81
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:54,619
<i>Icarus, dial it down a little, will you?</i>

82
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:57,061
<i>Yes, Corazon.</i>

83
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,871
Captain?

84
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,303
Captain?

85
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,611
I'm guessing you've been
talking to Searle.

86
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,145
- So, do you have that report for me?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:19,618
Right here.

88
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:25,125
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

89
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:27,990
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

90
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:32,897
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

91
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,696
<i>You're thinking about Icarus I.</i>

92
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:42,534
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up...

93
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:45,681
...I don't think
it was a lack of oxygen.

94
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:48,845
Not on the outward journey,
at any rate.

95
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:51,981
Fuck.

96
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:56,524
Fuck.

97
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:01,922
- Mace.
- Mace.

98
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,060
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

99
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,133
- Fuck.
- Relax. Put it down.

100
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:07,360
You son of a bitch.

101
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,331
<i>- Fucker took an hour in there.
- Stop.</i>

102
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,839
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

103
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,411
<i>- Calm down.
- I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.</i>

104
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,413
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

105
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,346
<i>What's up?</i>

106
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:26,644
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

107
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,684
So how does this work?

108
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:34,089
<i>Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?</i>

109
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,391
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

110
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:44,598
It's the time.

111
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,770
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

112
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,747
You just...

113
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:55,011
...lose track.

114
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:01,583
I know I fucked up.

115
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,560
From now on...

116
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:12,428
<i>...I'm not gonna lose track again.</i>

117
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,002
Prescription...

118
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,467
...Earth Room.

119
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,041
Two hours?

120
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,943
- And get a haircut, Mace.
- Yeah.

121
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:40,822
Bring back the waves.

122
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,898
<i>Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.</i>

123
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,728
The waves make me feel peaceful.

124
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,242
Again.

125
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,961
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

126
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:22,468
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

127
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,430
All right.

128
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,708
- Was that the apology?
- Yeah.

129
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,315
- Consider it accepted.
- Okay.

130
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:03,137
<i>It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant...</i>

131
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,475
<i>...which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.</i>

132
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,676
<i>None bigger than a raindrop...</i>

133
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:12,411
<i>...but we had 19 punctures...</i>

134
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:15,920
<i>...and a secondary contact
to the engine compartment.</i>

135
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,821
<i>Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.</i>

136
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:21,827
<i>Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.</i>

137
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,061
<i>I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.</i>

138
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,128
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

139
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,667
<i>It was...</i>

140
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,767
<i>...beautiful.</i>

141
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,836
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

142
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,374
<i>It was...</i>

143
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,680
<i>...beautiful.</i>

144
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,925
<i>- Mace?
- Yeah.</i>

145
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:03,071
<i>Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes...</i>

146
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,675
<i>...for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.</i>

147
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,768
Shit.

148
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:35,963
Guys...

149
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,003
...you wanna see something?

150
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:44,136
Well, I should have
a few words to say...

151
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,178
...but on reflection...

152
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:47,838
...what can one say?

153
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,212
Ladies and gentlemen.

154
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,244
Mercury.

155
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,882
Twenty-three hours ago,
on the comms systems...

156
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,750
While listening to your space music?

157
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:38,359
- While scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

158
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,557
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

159
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,392
The iron content of the planet...

160
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:45,931
...is acting as an antenna.

161
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:49,593
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

162
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:53,572
<i>Icarus, please play audio file 7-5/B.</i>

163
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,835
<i>Yes, Harvey.</i>

164
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:13,452
End file.

165
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:16,057
What is it?

166
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,428
<i>It's the Icarus I.</i>

167
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,137
That signal is their distress beacon.

168
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:23,601
Jesus.

169
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,831
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

170
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,602
Clearly it's not impossible
because you can hear it.

171
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,802
- They're still alive?
- We don't know.

172
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,174
But they could be.
Oxygen is self-replenishing.

173
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,940
Water is recycled.

174
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,914
They have the solar power
they need.

175
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,782
What about food?
Their supplies couldn't last.

176
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,320
That depends.

177
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,118
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

178
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,193
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

179
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,363
<i>We don't know what happened
to Icarus I.</i>

180
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,657
There might have been an accident.

181
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,028
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

182
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:57,161
- Captain, do we know where they are?
- Well done, Capa. That is the question.

183
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,938
<i>Icarus.</i>

184
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,970
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

185
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,114
<i>Yes, captain.</i>

186
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:12,112
<i>Now plot the source
of the Icarus I beacon.</i>

187
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,294
Jesus. They almost made it.

188
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,929
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

189
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,226
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

190
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:26,901
We're gonna pass right by them.

191
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:30,402
Within 1 o or 15 thousand miles.

192
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,563
Can anyone survive?

193
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,301
If the shield is intact.

194
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:37,737
We'll be able to see them?

195
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,079
Yes.

196
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,185
I'd need to look at all of this
pretty carefully. Very carefully.

197
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:49,586
But if I had to make a guess right now,
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

198
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,482
We could fly straight to them.

199
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,218
But we're not gonna do that.

200
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:00,668
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

201
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,264
Do I have to spell it out for you?

202
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:09,410
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

203
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,012
We're doing it
because that star is dying.

204
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,046
And if it dies, we die.

205
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:15,547
Everything dies.

206
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,514
So that is our mission.
There is nothing...

207
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:21,452
...literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

208
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,091
- He's right.
- He's right. Of course I'm right.

209
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,557
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

210
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:28,423
- May I put a counter argument?
- No.

211
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:29,962
Captain?

212
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,258
Go ahead.

213
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,127
It would, of course...

214
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:38,740
<i>...be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the Icarus I.</i>

215
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:42,274
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive...

216
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:47,806
...their lives are expendable
when seen in the context of our mission.

217
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:49,975
As are our own lives.

218
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,744
- Exactly.
- However...

219
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:56,146
<i>...there is something onboard the
Icarus I that may be worth the detour.</i>

220
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,953
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

221
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,151
A payload. Singular.

222
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,890
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload...

223
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,624
...is entirely theoretical.

224
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,463
Simply put...

225
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,003
...we don't know if it's gonna work.

226
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,404
But what we do know is this...

227
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:17,940
...if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

228
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,980
<i>You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.</i>

229
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:22,173
- Yes.
- Which is assuming...

230
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,811
...that whatever stopped them wasn't
a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.

231
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,957
- Yes.
- It's a lot of assumptions.

232
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,148
It is.

233
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,622
It's a risk assessment.

234
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:32,817
The question is:

235
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:36,931
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

236
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:47,472
- We'll have a vote.
- No, no.

237
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:49,307
No, we won't.

238
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,139
We are not a democracy.

239
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:56,683
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

240
00:20:56,852 --> 00:21:00,310
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

241
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,786
Made by you, by any chance?

242
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:05,154
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities...

243
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,295
...of a payload delivery.

244
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,196
Our physicist.

245
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,866
Shit.

246
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:28,249
<i>Okay, Icarus, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.</i>

247
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,749
<i>Okay, payload delivery point reached.</i>

248
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,045
Detach the payload.

249
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:35,647
<i>Stellar bomb initiated and detached.</i>

250
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:38,258
<i>Crew and living section
have four minutes...</i>

251
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:41,260
<i>...to clear and commence
homeward journey.</i>

252
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:46,259
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

253
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:51,202
<i>Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.</i>

254
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:53,864
<i>Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.</i>

255
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,703
<i>Magnetic field structure open.</i>

256
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:58,437
<i>Temperature, 37,000.</i>

257
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,344
<i>Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.</i>

258
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:06,044
<i>Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.</i>

259
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,779
<i>Variables infinite.</i>

260
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,287
<i>Accuracy unknown.</i>

261
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,085
That's the problem right there.

262
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,625
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun...

263
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:15,626
...the velocity will be so great...

264
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:18,129
...space and time
will become smeared together.

265
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,428
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

266
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:24,401
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

267
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:28,574
- I need a decision.
- It's not a decision, it's a guess.

268
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,108
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

269
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:35,607
And?

270
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:38,083
Heads.

271
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:46,549
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

272
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:49,590
There's not gonna be
another payload.

273
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,997
The one we carry is our last chance.

274
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:57,933
Our last best hope.

275
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,901
Searle's argument is sound.

276
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:06,214
Two last hopes are better than one.

277
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,717
That's it.

278
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,327
<i>Slingshot complete.</i>

279
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:31,631
<i>Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.</i>

280
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:01,026
Hey.

281
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:03,034
Hey.

282
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,073
Good dream?

283
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:12,544
Let me guess.

284
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,849
The surface of the sun?

285
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:18,786
Only dream I ever have.

286
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:22,720
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

287
00:24:24,392 --> 00:24:27,020
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

288
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:30,290
See if he can help you out.

289
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:34,530
Maybe.

290
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,439
I just wanted to let you know...

291
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,567
...I think you made the right decision.

292
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,213
Well.

293
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,251
Mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

294
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:54,888
Yeah...

295
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:57,052
...but I do.

296
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:25,819
- Get the alarm. What's going on?
- I screwed up.

297
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,921
It's not you. It's my responsibility.

298
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:30,319
- We shouldn't be straying.
- Trey, cut to it.

299
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,928
<i>In order to change the route,
I had to manually override Icarus.</i>

300
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:37,758
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double- and triple-checked them.

301
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,127
They all worked out.

302
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:42,270
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

303
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:44,632
What's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

304
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,068
The trajectory is good.

305
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:50,907
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1.1 degrees.

306
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,877
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

307
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:59,450
Jesus Christ, Trey.

308
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:01,786
I forgot.

309
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:09,791
My head was full of velocities and fuel
calculations and a million different...

310
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:12,763
I fucked up, all right?

311
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,265
People do shit.

312
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:18,167
They get stressed...

313
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,974
...and fuck up.

314
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:23,004
I fucked up.

315
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:25,009
Trey.

316
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,843
The fact is, we're still alive.

317
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:36,514
A hole hasn't burnt
in the side of the ship.

318
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,818
We don't have
a 1 o, ooo-degree climate.

319
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:41,861
- So, what's the actual damage?
- We don't know.

320
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,557
<i>Icarus tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.</i>

321
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,827
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

322
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:50,563
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

323
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:54,134
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

324
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,334
Okay.

325
00:26:57,512 --> 00:26:59,343
I'll get suited up.

326
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:01,414
It's a two-man job.

327
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,177
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

328
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:06,343
- I volunteer.
- No, I volunteer.

329
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:08,247
Fine.

330
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,583
I volunteer Capa.

331
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,261
Sure.

332
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:17,829
I'll do it.

333
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:21,459
Okay.

334
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:48,427
Okay.

335
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,795
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

336
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:33,073
Yeah.

337
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,970
You're gonna be fine.

338
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,167
Okay?

339
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:49,781
<i>Okay, Icarus.</i>

340
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,949
I'm gonna be taking
control for a while.

341
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:54,425
<i>- Okay, Cassie.
- I'm gonna be cutting speed.</i>

342
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:57,588
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

343
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,098
<i>- Do we understand each other?
- Yes, Cassie.</i>

344
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:03,431
Rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose comm towers three and four.

345
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,096
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

346
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:08,970
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

347
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,169
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

348
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:14,975
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

349
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,310
All right, guys.

350
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:18,213
I'm opening up.

351
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:52,419
Okay.

352
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,483
<i>Helmet-cam operational.</i>

353
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:02,425
<i>Affirmative. Good image.</i>

354
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,857
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

355
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,696
<i>Affirmative.</i>

356
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,907
<i>Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.</i>

357
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:33,459
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

358
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,195
Okay, guys.

359
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:38,059
Nice and easy.

360
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,796
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

361
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,732
<i>Copy.</i>

362
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:58,242
<i>Icarus, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.</i>

363
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:00,580
<i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

364
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:31,217
<i>Establishing new alignment to sun.</i>

365
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,448
Jesus.

366
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,750
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

367
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,451
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

368
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:43,290
I know what it is, flyboy.

369
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:54,472
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

370
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:19,497
<i>Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.</i>

371
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:23,000
<i>Copy, Icarus. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.</i>

372
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:26,334
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

373
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,076
<i>You should see it up here, guys.</i>

374
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:42,183
<i>It's pretty impressive.</i>

375
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,402
<i>Okay.</i>

376
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,539
<i>There are four damaged panels.</i>

377
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,444
<i>They're about 300 meters out.</i>

378
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:20,456
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

379
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:24,356
Copy that, Cory.

380
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,700
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

381
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:33,864
Relaxed movement.

382
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,127
<i>Approaching the first panel.</i>

383
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,148
<i>We were lucky.</i>

384
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,619
<i>Can you guys see this?</i>

385
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,848
<i>We can see it.</i>

386
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,425
The hydraulics are burnt out.

387
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,892
<i>Let's get this closed.</i>

388
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:52,409
Okay, Mace.

389
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:53,913
That's it.

390
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,120
That's the first one closed.

391
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:01,886
You can do it?

392
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,360
<i>It'll take a while, but...</i>

393
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,293
Yeah.

394
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:08,126
We can do it.

395
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:11,936
Great job.

396
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,538
<i>Lots of smiling faces
in this room, guys.</i>

397
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,717
<i>- Great job.
- I love you, captain.</i>

398
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,591
<i>Moving to next panel.</i>

399
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>Three to go.</i>

400
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,776
Hey.

401
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,414
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

402
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:07,689
What's going on, guys?

403
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:09,356
<i>The ship's moving.</i>

404
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,259
We're venting O2. Shit.

405
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:12,865
I think we're venting O2.

406
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:14,899
<i>Resuming computer control
of Icarus II.</i>

407
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:16,696
<i>Negative, Icarus. Manual control.</i>

408
00:36:16,871 --> 00:36:18,702
<i>Negative, Cassie. Computer control.</i>

409
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:21,364
<i>- Returning vessel to original rotation.
- What?</i>

410
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,635
<i>Icarus, override computer
to manual control.</i>

411
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,472
<i>Negative. Mission in jeopardy.</i>

412
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:28,615
<i>Override command statement to
manual flight controls removed.</i>

413
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,114
<i>- Why?
- Negative, Icarus.</i>

414
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:31,945
Negative. State reason immediately.

415
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,553
<i>Fire in oxygen garden.</i>

416
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:40,789
No.

417
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:44,655
Seal oxygen feed.

418
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:47,801
- Fireguard perimeter.
- Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

419
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:53,273
- Seal sections five through nine.
- Sealing five through nine.

420
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,469
Kaneda, Capa,
get back to the airlock now.

421
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,045
Can't.

422
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,749
<i>Can't leave upright panels.</i>

423
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:07,152
<i>The ship will burn up if the shields
are not repaired.</i>

424
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,652
- They're gonna die.
- Don't.

425
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:10,518
- They're gonna burn.
- They are not.

426
00:37:10,691 --> 00:37:12,283
<i>Override Icarus. Cassie, pilot...</i>

<i>- Second human confirmation required.

430
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,491
Mace?

431
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:22,362
Mace?

432
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,594
Wait, Cassie.

433
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,638
Jesus Christ, Harvey.

434
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:31,343
Harvey, comms officer,
confirm back-up o-o-o.

435
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,979
<i>Override command confirmed.</i>

436

<i>Manual control returned.</i>

437
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,210
No.

438
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:38,183
<i>Icarus, continue procedure.</i>

439
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,078
<i>What?</i>

440
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:41,815
<i>Captain.</i>

441
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,989
<i>- Back me up.
- Copy, Mace.</i>

442
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,525
<i>Crew priority
is to protect the payload.</i>

443
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,562
<i>Get the fire out.</i>

444
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,130
<i>Icarus, take control of the ship.</i>

445
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,463
<i>- Affirmative, captain.
- Damn it.</i>

446
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:01,304
<i>Returning vessel to original rotation.</i>

447
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:18,522
<i>- Let me in. Please.
- Negative.</i>

448
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:21,127
<i>Door sealed by operating superior
comms officer.</i>

449
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:22,894
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

450
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,190
Let me in.

451
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,861
<i>Hazard diagnostic complete.</i>

452
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:30,765
<i>Sprinkler system failing.</i>

453
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:33,236
<i>Fire will burn for six hours.</i>

454
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:35,705
<i>Sixty percent chance
of containment failure.</i>

455
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:39,937
<i>Seventy-five percent chance of collateral
damage to life-support systems.</i>

456
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:42,138
What are we gonna do?

457
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:45,049
- Flood it with O2.
- What?

458
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,585
Lt'll cause a flashover.
Make it burn itself out.

459
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:49,347
We'll lose the whole garden.

460
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:50,547
We already lost it.

461
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,087
<i>Jesus, Mace, I don't know.</i>

462
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,461
<i>Icarus, open the O2 tanks.</i>

463
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:57,255
<i>Cory, get the hell out of there.</i>

464
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:59,058
<i>Opening O2 tanks.</i>

465
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:04,966
No.

466
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:24,951
<i>Eighty-nine percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

467
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:46,140
<i>Capa, go back.</i>

468
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:48,314
<i>I'll finish this.</i>

469
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:49,506
Please, I can do this.

470
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,811
Go.

471
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:04,331
Capa returning to airlock.

472
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:05,863
Do you copy?

473
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:11,163
<i>Capa returning to airlock.
Do you copy?</i>

474
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:14,102
<i>Copy, Capa. Hurry.</i>

475
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:19,004
<i>Ninety-one percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

476
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:47,135
<i>Ninety-four percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

477
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,682
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

478
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:58,776
<i>Do you copy?</i>

479
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,688
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

480
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:05,155
<i>Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

481
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:08,386
Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.

482
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:09,893
You have to move now.

483
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:12,555
<i>Captain, it's right on you.</i>

484
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,258
<i>- Kaneda's not gonna make it.
- You have to move.</i>

485
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,404
<i>You have to move now.</i>

486
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:18,663
It's too far.

487
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:22,301
<i>Captain, move.</i>

488
00:41:23,878 --> 00:41:25,402
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

489
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,540
<i>Kaneda.</i>

490
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:29,273
What do you see?

491
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,782
<i>Searle, tell our captain to move.</i>

492
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:35,046
Kaneda, what can you see?

493
00:41:35,222 --> 00:41:37,019
<i>Searle, do you copy?</i>

494
00:41:53,073 --> 00:41:54,335
Kaneda?

495
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,272
<i>Shield rotation complete.</i>

496
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,303
The breakdown is as follows.

497
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,301
Trey is sedated in the Med Centre.

498
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:01,134
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

499
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:05,611
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

500
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:09,545
<i>As second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.</i>

501
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:12,049
Thanks both to Kaneda...

502
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:15,279
...and Capa, our shields are intact.

503
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:17,720
As is the payload.

504
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:21,661
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

505
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:25,997
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

506
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,733
As it stands now...

507
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:33,499
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

508
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:37,507
Let alone to survive
the return journey.

509
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:40,511
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

510
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:47,947
<i>We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with Icarus I.</i>

511
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,323
If we're gonna complete
the mission...

512
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,188
<i>...the Icarus I is our only hope.</i>

513
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:08,901
Technically, he made a mistake.

514
00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:10,668
What are you trying to say, Cory?

515
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:14,507
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

516
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:16,707
But there is.

517
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:21,613
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

518
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:25,185
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

519
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,917
No.

520
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:30,122
And in any case...

521
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:33,122
...Trey wouldn't be enough.

522
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:36,532
We need to lose two more.

523
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:45,103
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

524
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:28,751
<i>Capa, it's me.</i>

525
00:45:34,328 --> 00:45:35,920
It's different.

526
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:39,259
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

527
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:43,630
And then knowing that you won't.

528
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:48,297
<i>Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from Icarus I.</i>

529
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:49,999
No.

530
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:52,606
We're gonna die out here.

531
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,707
Like the other crew.

532
00:45:56,116 --> 00:45:57,845
I know it.

533
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,582
So do you.

534
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:06,284
Are you scared?

535
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:17,394
When the stellar bomb is triggered...

536
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:21,199
...very little will happen at first.

537
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:24,568
<i>And then a spark
will pop into existence...</i>

538
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:28,613
<i>...and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...</i>

539
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,041
...it will split into two.

540
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:33,914
And those will split again...

541
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:35,986
...and again and again.

542
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,353
Detonation beyond all imagining.

543
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,991
A big bang on a small scale.

544
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,134
A new star born out of a dying one.

545
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,497
I think it'll be beautiful.

546
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:55,633
No. I'm not scared.

547
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:02,339
I am.

548
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:53,558
<i>Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.</i>

549
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:55,759
Okay, let's go.

550
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:44,901
Be careful, watch your step.

551
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:51,341
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

552
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:53,008
<i>Getting what?</i>

553
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:56,852
The air. It's full of dust.

554
00:49:57,024 --> 00:49:58,685
Human skin.

555
00:49:58,859 --> 00:49:59,951
What?

556
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:03,392
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

557
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,030
Sorry.

558
00:50:14,641 --> 00:50:16,074
- No lights?
- No.

559
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:17,471
No surprise.

560
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:21,447
Anyone afraid of the dark?

561
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:23,373
We should split up.

562
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,144
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

563
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:27,984
Yeah, probably right.

564
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:31,318
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

565
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,927
<i>Icarus I is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.</i>

566
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,495
Okay. You're right.

567
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:42,062
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

568
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,734
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

569
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,772
Capa, aim for the payload.

570
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,505
I'll check the garden.

571
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:55,407
Let's keep in contact, guys.

572
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:35,552
Listen up, everybody.

573
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:39,785
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

574
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:43,352
<i>Can you see this?</i>

575
00:51:43,663 --> 00:51:46,791
<i>It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.</i>

576
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,197
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

577
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:51,161
It's wonderful.

578
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:52,662
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

579
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,739
<i>Cory, look at the ferns.</i>

580
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:13,018
That's strange.

581
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,020
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

582
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:20,098
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

583
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:28,165
Got water.

584
00:52:32,112 --> 00:52:33,602
Food.

585
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:41,515
No crew.

586
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:43,248
No bodies.

587
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:52,695
My God.

588
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:56,201
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

589
00:52:59,873 --> 00:53:02,865
<i>I am Pinbacker.</i>

590
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:07,076
<i>Commander of the Icarus I.</i>

591
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:13,581
<i>We have abandoned our mission.</i>

592
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:17,552
<i>Our star is dying.</i>

593
00:53:19,092 --> 00:53:21,583
<i>All our science...</i>

594
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:25,393
<i>...all our hopes...</i>

595
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,395
<i>...our dreams, are foolish.</i>

596
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:33,435
<i>In the face of this...</i>

597
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:35,969
<i>...we are...</i>

598
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:40,440
<i>...dust. Nothing more.</i>

599
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:45,817
<i>And to this dust, we will return.</i>

600
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:54,959
<i>When he chooses for us to die.</i>

601
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:57,358
<i>It is not our place...</i>

602
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:01,129
<i>...to challenge God.</i>

603
00:54:05,105 --> 00:54:07,005
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

604
00:54:07,173 --> 00:54:10,631
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

605
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:15,112
<i>That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.</i>

606
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:19,279
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

607
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:38,662
<i>Payload is fully operational.</i>

608
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:40,032
Say again, Capa?

609
00:54:40,206 --> 00:54:42,902
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

610
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:47,880
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

611
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:49,675
No, we don't.

612
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:51,407
<i>Go ahead, Mace?</i>

613
00:54:51,618 --> 00:54:54,052
I know what caused
the distress signal.

614
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:57,752
<i>There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...</i>

615
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:00,825
<i>...it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.</i>

616
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:03,428
<i>Without the mainframe, we can't fly.</i>

617
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:07,026
<i>It's been sabotaged.</i>

618
00:55:10,437 --> 00:55:12,667
We should never have
gone off the mission.

619
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:32,885
I have something to say.

620
00:55:34,694 --> 00:55:35,752
Found the crew.

621
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:59,080
What happened?

622
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:02,546
They had an epiphany.

623
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:04,614
They saw the light.

624
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:07,716
They burned themselves.

625
00:56:07,894 --> 00:56:09,225
No shit.

626
00:56:09,396 --> 00:56:12,763
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

627
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:18,234
<i>If we weren't behind the screen
of Icarus II, we'd join them.</i>

628
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:20,204
Ashes to ashes.

629
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:24,568
Stardust to stardust.

630
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,570
<i>Icarus!</i>

631
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:33,442
<i>Icarus. Stabilizers.</i>

632
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:42,760
- What was that?
- Guys, get back to the airlock, now.

633
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:49,795
<i>We have a major incident.</i>

634
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:51,766
<i>We are floating free from you.</i>

635
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:53,667
<i>Repeat, we are floating free.</i>

636
00:56:54,374 --> 00:56:55,773
<i>All crew back to the airlock.</i>

637
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:09,881
<i>- Cassie.
- The airlock has decoupled.</i>

638
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:11,614
<i>We don't know why.</i>

639
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,453
<i>The locking system on Icarus I
is totally ripped open.</i>

640
00:57:14,627 --> 00:57:17,824
I can hold our position but we aren't
gonna be able to dock again.

641
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:19,328
<i>There's another thing, guys.</i>

642
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:22,366
<i>You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.</i>

643
00:57:23,136 --> 00:57:24,160
We're screwed.

644
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:26,195
No, we're not.

645
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:34,270
One of us isn't, anyway.

646
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:53,523
What happened?

647
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,692
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

648
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:07,679
- Why Capa?
- The rest of us are lower priority.

649
00:58:07,847 --> 00:58:09,246
I'm not a low priority.

650
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:12,248
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

651
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:13,578
I am the captain.

652
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:16,818
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

653
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:21,925
<i>Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of Icarus who can operate the payload.</i>

654
00:58:22,428 --> 00:58:23,520
There is no choice.

655
00:58:23,696 --> 00:58:25,220
No, there's no choice for you.

656
00:58:25,398 --> 00:58:28,231
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

657
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:33,436
Get out of the suit.

658
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:39,768
That is a direct order.

659
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:47,249
<i>I assure you, when I'm onboard Icarus II
that I'll do everything within my power...</i>

660
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,980
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

661
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:51,714
The airlock is ripped in half.

662
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:55,588
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

663
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:03,735
Cassie.

664
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,903
Go.

665
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:09,064
<i>Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.</i>

666
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:12,109
<i>So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?</i>

667
00:59:12,645 --> 00:59:13,669
Right.

668
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,179
<i>If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.</i>

669
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:20,142
And so will we.

670
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:24,513
Without suits?

671
00:59:26,092 --> 00:59:28,822
- Get as close as you can.
- You'll have 2o meters to cover.

672
00:59:28,995 --> 00:59:31,623
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

673
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:35,597
It's gonna be cold.

674
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:37,935
But we'll make it.

675
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,135
Anyone got any better ideas?

676
00:59:47,347 --> 00:59:48,678
Copy that.

677
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,859
Mace.

678
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:09,298
One problem.

679
01:00:09,836 --> 01:00:11,804
The computer's down.

680
01:00:11,971 --> 01:00:15,532
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

681
01:00:15,842 --> 01:00:17,707
From inside.

682
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:20,872
Shit.

683
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:24,879
You're right.

684
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:29,078
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

685
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,216
I see. I get it.

686
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:37,727
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

687
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,890
No, Harvey.

688
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:43,092
It's me.

689
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:05,547
You okay?

690
01:01:07,026 --> 01:01:08,618
Hey, Capa.

691
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:10,620
We're only stardust.

692
01:01:24,143 --> 01:01:25,770
<i>Mace, we're lined up.</i>

693
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:28,072
<i>Everything's set.</i>

694
01:01:33,052 --> 01:01:34,644
Searle, are you ready?

695
01:01:37,623 --> 01:01:40,717
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

696
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:41,917
Cassie.

697
01:01:42,528 --> 01:01:44,325
<i>- Are you ready?
- Ready.</i>

698
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:48,227
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

699
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:49,527
Copy.

700
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:55,140
Let's do it.

701
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:43,615
<i>Crew detected in airlock.</i>

702
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,320
<i>Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.</i>

703
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:49,052
<i>I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.</i>

704
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:51,719
<i>- Harvey's gone.
- Crew detected in airlock.</i>

705
01:02:52,465 --> 01:02:54,660
<i>Sealing outer airlock door.</i>

706
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:32,236
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

707
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,565
Get my hand. Get my hand.

708
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:35,172
- Breathe, Mace.
- Capa?

709
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,174
You're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

710
01:03:56,529 --> 01:03:59,896
- Capa, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

711
01:04:01,467 --> 01:04:03,367
Let's get you out of here.

712
01:04:45,745 --> 01:04:47,440
<i>Searle?</i>

713
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:50,078
<i>We're leaving now.</i>

714
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,615
<i>We're gonna complete the mission.</i>

715
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:00,619
<i>We're all thinking of you, Searle.</i>

716
01:05:01,961 --> 01:05:03,019
<i>Searle?</i>

717
01:05:04,096 --> 01:05:05,996
<i>We're gonna go now.</i>

718
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:12,865
<i>We love you.</i>

719
01:05:41,133 --> 01:05:43,693
<i>I've been through Icarus's activity file
and I checked it.</i>

720
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:46,030
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

721
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:48,571
And it's the same results.

722
01:05:49,642 --> 01:05:53,339
<i>In other words, unless Icarus is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.</i>

723
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:56,640
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

724
01:05:56,816 --> 01:06:00,274
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

725
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:03,549
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

726
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:05,714
And I was with Capa and Searle.

727
01:06:06,192 --> 01:06:09,719
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

728
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:12,528
Which leaves one possibility.

729
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,158
Trey.

730
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,996
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

731
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,867
He sleeps for 23 hours a day.
And he blames himself for everything.

732
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,599
- Why would he do it?
- We don't know.

733
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:27,540
The possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

734
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:29,044
By doping him up more?

735
01:06:29,715 --> 01:06:34,277
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock.

736
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,717
There is something else too.

737
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:44,420
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

738
01:06:45,197 --> 01:06:47,188
If Trey dies...

739
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:51,635
...we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

740
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:54,032
<i>At least now we know what happened
on Icarus I.</i>

741
01:06:54,206 --> 01:06:57,471
- The same thing that's happening here.
- Fuck you, Capa.

742
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,840
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

743
01:07:06,218 --> 01:07:07,242
I'll do it.

744
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:10,989
I'm not passing any bucks.

745
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:13,487
Do it how?

746
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:17,222
That's between me and Trey.

747
01:07:20,066 --> 01:07:22,899
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

748
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:26,565
So you know where I stand.

749
01:07:33,779 --> 01:07:34,803
And me.

750
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,150
What are you asking?

751
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,983
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

752
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:50,023
Kill him.

753
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:52,321
Cassie?

754
01:07:56,335 --> 01:07:57,825
No.

755
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:04,470
- Cassie.
- I know the argument.

756
01:08:04,643 --> 01:08:06,702
I know the logic.

757
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:09,637
You're saying you need my vote.

758
01:08:09,815 --> 01:08:12,306
I'm saying you can't have it.

759
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,791
What do we do?

760
01:08:29,068 --> 01:08:31,195
Oh, God.

761
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:34,734
I'm sorry, Cassie.

762
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:43,070
You make it easy for him.

763
01:08:44,517 --> 01:08:46,246
Somehow.

764
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:49,150
Find a kindness.

765
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:55,014
Trey.

766
01:09:58,724 --> 01:10:01,386
<i>Everybody get here now.</i>

767
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:18,734
He cut his wrists.

768
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:21,106
He took responsibility.

769
01:10:24,617 --> 01:10:26,585
All these deaths.

770
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:28,185
Kaneda.

771
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,822
Searle. Harvey.

772
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,457
Trey.

773
01:10:33,259 --> 01:10:36,751
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

774
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:41,362
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say shit.

775
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,695
I just want you to know that this...

776
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,861
...belongs here.

777
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,002
Fuck you.

778
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:14,460
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

779
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:50,394
<i>- Icarus?
- Yes, Capa?</i>

780
01:11:50,569 --> 01:11:53,197
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

781
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:55,863
Check oxygen consumption.

782
01:11:56,508 --> 01:11:58,169
<i>Checking.</i>

783
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:00,439
Thank you.

784
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:03,576
<i>Capa.</i>

785
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:05,546
<i>- Yes?
- You are dying.</i>

786
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:07,777
<i>All crew are dying.</i>

787
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:09,784
We know we're dying.

788
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:13,716
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

789
01:12:13,892 --> 01:12:15,086
...we're okay with it.

790
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,854
<i>Capa, warning.</i>

791
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,965
<i>You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.</i>

792
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:25,794
Please clarify.

793
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:29,737
<i>Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.</i>

794
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:33,571
<i>Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.</i>

795
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,543
<i>Sixteen hours until death.</i>

796
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:37,204
<i>Journey time to delivery point:</i>

797
01:12:37,383 --> 01:12:39,783
<i>- Nineteen hours.
- Impossible. Corazon was certain.</i>

798
01:12:39,952 --> 01:12:42,284
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

799
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:45,389
<i>Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves...</i>

800
01:12:45,557 --> 01:12:47,923
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

801
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:49,117
<i>Negative.</i>

802
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:52,229
<i>Affirmative, Icarus. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.</i>

803
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:54,423
<i>Five crew members.</i>

804
01:12:59,905 --> 01:13:01,429
<i>Icarus?</i>

805
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:03,199
<i>Yes?</i>

806
01:13:05,711 --> 01:13:07,008
Who's the fifth crew member?

807
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,009
<i>Unknown.</i>

808
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,683
Where is the fifth crew member?

809
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:17,651
<i>In the Observation Room.</i>

810
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:58,860
Are you an angel?

811
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:03,391
Has the time come?

812
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:09,870
I've been waiting so long.

813
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:18,544
Who are you?

814
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:21,877
Who am I?

815
01:14:28,393 --> 01:14:30,793
At the end of time...

816
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:35,557
...a moment will come
when just one man remains.

817
01:14:37,236 --> 01:14:39,101
Then the moment will pass.

818
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:43,941
The man will be gone.

819
01:14:46,845 --> 01:14:50,611
There will be nothing to show
as if we were ever here...

820
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,017
...but stardust.

821
01:14:56,054 --> 01:15:00,718
The last man, alone with God.

822
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:06,186
Am I that man?

823
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:22,072
My God.

824
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:28,109
My God, Pinbacker?

825
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:31,249
Not your God.

826
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:33,084
Mine.

827
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:48,603
<i>Icarus. Full sunlight.</i>

828
01:16:05,824 --> 01:16:06,882
Anyone.

829
01:17:02,547 --> 01:17:04,071
Oh, my God.

830
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:05,540
<i>Icarus?</i>

831
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:15,255
<i>Warning, you do not have
authority to remove...</i>

832
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,724
<i>...the mainframe panels
from the coolant.</i>

833
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:20,660
<i>Please return the panels
to the coolant.</i>

834
01:17:20,832 --> 01:17:24,563
<i>I cannot locate
your biometric signs.</i>

835
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:28,035
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

836
01:17:50,696 --> 01:17:53,426
You gotta be kidding.

837
01:18:10,282 --> 01:18:12,375
My God.

838
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:22,627
A baby.

839
01:18:24,596 --> 01:18:26,223
A beautiful baby.

840
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:28,889
<i>Icarus, patch me through to Mace.
I have something...</i>

841
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:30,591
...wonderful to show him.

842
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:33,260
Or Cassie or Capa.

843
01:18:34,072 --> 01:18:35,733
<i>Icarus?</i>

844
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:42,545
Don't fight.

845
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,749
Don't fight.

846
01:19:17,949 --> 01:19:19,678
Mace?

847
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:56,313
Capa?

848
01:19:57,656 --> 01:20:00,352
<i>Is anyone else getting silence
from Icarus?</i>

849
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:04,829
Anybody?

850
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,708
Capa?

851
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:53,769
<i>Icarus, why are we in orbit?</i>

852
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:57,676
Respond.

853
01:21:00,986 --> 01:21:02,044
What?

854
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,380
Jesus Christ.

855
01:21:04,122 --> 01:21:05,783
Capa? Capa?

856
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:10,756
<i>In the suit.</i>

857
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:12,396
<i>Use the hard link.</i>

858
01:21:12,564 --> 01:21:13,656
<i>In the helmet.</i>

859
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,424
Mace?

860
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:20,933
<i>- What the hell is going on?
- Mace?</i>

861
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:22,801
<i>I can't talk to Icarus.</i>

862
01:21:22,974 --> 01:21:26,307
<i>Pinbacker is onboard.
He's trying to stop the mission.</i>

863
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:29,311
<i>He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.</i>

864
01:21:41,526 --> 01:21:43,494
<i>Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.</i>

865
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:46,597
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

866
01:21:52,304 --> 01:21:53,862
The mechanism is disabled.

867
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:55,802
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

868
01:21:55,974 --> 01:21:57,839
Mace, repeat, please.

869
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:01,370
<i>Icarus is gonna burn out.</i>

870
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:05,440
Mace.

871
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:07,345
<i>Mace, come in.</i>

872
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,990
Come on.

873
01:24:40,839 --> 01:24:42,329
<i>Capa.</i>

874
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:43,531
<i>- Capa.
- Mace?</i>

875
01:24:44,275 --> 01:24:46,766
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

876
01:24:47,645 --> 01:24:50,808
<i>I don't know if I can get her
back online.</i>

877
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:54,782
<i>You have to break us out
of orbit manually.</i>

878
01:24:54,953 --> 01:24:56,511
<i>The only way to do that...</i>

879
01:24:56,688 --> 01:24:59,657
...is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

880
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:02,622
<i>Force the bomb into the sun.</i>

881
01:25:03,428 --> 01:25:04,861
Separate the payload.

882
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:09,891
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

883
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:12,559
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

884
01:25:13,138 --> 01:25:16,835
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

885
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:19,669
<i>Okay.</i>

886
01:25:20,044 --> 01:25:22,376
<i>I'm gonna do this.</i>

887
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:24,840
Copy, Mace.

888
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:28,012
Copy.

889
01:26:24,876 --> 01:26:26,241
Capa.

890
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:28,436
My leg.

891
01:26:42,594 --> 01:26:44,289
Oh, God.

892
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:53,933
Do it, Capa.

893
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,634
Do it.

894
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:07,909
Mace.

895
01:31:49,901 --> 01:31:51,425
Come on.

896
01:32:49,126 --> 01:32:51,151
<i>Only dream I ever have.</i>

897
01:32:51,462 --> 01:32:52,929
<i>Is it the surface of the sun?</i>

898
01:32:54,332 --> 01:32:57,665
<i>Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.</i>

899
01:34:59,757 --> 01:35:01,384
Cassie?

900
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,492
Cassie?

901
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:12,931
We're flying into the sun.

902
01:35:16,774 --> 01:35:18,935
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

903
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,577
Where is he? Is he here?

904
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:30,918
For seven years I spoke with God.

905
01:35:38,329 --> 01:35:41,856
He told me to take us all to heaven.

906
01:35:48,572 --> 01:35:50,130
No.

907
01:36:33,717 --> 01:36:35,378
Finish it.

908
01:37:54,398 --> 01:37:55,695
Let's say 25. Set at 25.

909
01:38:08,145 --> 01:38:09,339
Please.

910
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:10,980
Please.

911
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:04,723
<i>Hi, sis.</i>

912
01:40:05,696 --> 01:40:07,755
<i>Kiss the kids.</i>

913
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,766
You guys, come on.

914
01:40:18,475 --> 01:40:20,272
It's time.

915
01:40:25,716 --> 01:40:27,581
<i>So if you wake up one morning...</i>

916
01:40:27,751 --> 01:40:32,154
<i>...and it's a particularly beautiful day,
you'll know we made it.</i>

917
01:40:34,725 --> 01:40:36,283
<i>Okay.</i>

918
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,460
<i>I'm signing out.</i>
