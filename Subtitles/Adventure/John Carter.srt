like he was looking for something.

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,136
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

It was his private journal.

00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:28,636
Now all I need to do
is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas.

698
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,764
Dotar Sojat?

706
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:50,408
What in the name of Issus is going on?

707
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,993
Issus has been profaned.

708
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,829
We found this one and the red wench
plotting in the temple.

709
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,915
In the temple? How did they get...

710
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,875
Sola led them there.

711
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,044
Sola tried to stop us.

712
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,588
I meant no disrespect
to your goddess, Tars.

713
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,006
I'm just trying to get home.

714
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,342
Your right arms were planning
to rob you of the medallion

715
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:11,346
and use it to commit greater blasphemy
down the River Iss.

716
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,431
They must all die in the arena.

717
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,518
How could you do this?
I spared your life.

718
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:22,023
I made you Dotar Sojat
yet her life means nothing to you.

719
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:26,235
You knew... You knew
she had no room for another mark.

720
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,530
Now Sola will die because of you.

721
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,077
She's your daughter, isn't she?

722

<font color="#D900D9">(GRUNTS)</font>

723
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,169
Who told you that?

724
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,129
Call it a father's intuition.

725
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,215
A Thark has no parent but the horde.

726
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,883
But how do you know?

727
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,137
Her mother kept her egg

728
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:56,182
and Sola's the last flicker
of her ancient greatness.

729
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,892
You can't just stand here
and let her be killed.

730
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,269
Argh!

731
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:03,106
My right arms offend me.

732
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,857
I Will cut them Off.

733
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,654
No.

734
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:14,993
You must hurry. I mean to release you.

735
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,246
I make one condition.

736
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,624
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

737
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,917
My Jeddak.

738
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,295
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess

739
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,965
than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

740
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:31,926
Where you go, she goes.

741
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,511
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?

742
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:37,098
Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

743
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,980
Is it done, my Jeddak?

744
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,611
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

Sab Than.

757
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:53,067
To truly demoralize a nation requires a
public spectacle on the grandest scale.

758
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:56,237
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

If you insist.

760
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:02,326

then we will find another who can.

I do not think she leads us to the Iss.

01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:33,232

- Cluros and Thuria.

They should be at our backs by now.

770
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,246
You lead us toward Helium!

771

Once we reach there,

772
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,380

I cannot marry him!

789
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,713
Can't marry who?

790
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,343
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

791
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,428
Sab Than.

792
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:47,932
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

793
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:49,976
Your father?

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,103
Tardos Mors.

795
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,356
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

796
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,776
A princess of Mars.

797
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,362
How about that?

798
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:06,450
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

799
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,035
No.

800
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,871
Is that all there is to the story?

801
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,833
No, I didn't run away!

802
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,253
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

803
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,547
So marry the guy and save your people.

804
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,216
A life of oppression! That's not living!

805
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,478
If you had the means to save others,

806
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,231
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

807
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,027
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

808
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,740
I would lay down my life for Helium.

809
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:53,247
Yes, I ran away.

810
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,708
I was afraid,

811
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,085
weak.

812
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,923
Maybe I should have married.

813
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,765
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

814
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:18,064
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

815
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,609
there are no Gates of Iss.

816
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,903
They are not real.

817
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,287
I'm sorry, Princess.

818
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,126
But this, this is real.

819
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,466
And so is my cave of gold.

820
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,688
Prudence demands you take an escort.

821
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:01,065
No.

822
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,150
I go alone, General.

823
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,569
But, Jeddak...

824
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,948
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

825
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,158
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

826
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:16,372
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

827
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,711

This glyph here,

901
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,350
it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy,

sent along these lines here,

A telegram.

905
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,151
You're saying I was telegraphed here.

906
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,405
I'm a copy of myself.

907
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:50,367
Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

908
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,666
I don't like guessing.

909
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,836
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

910
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,505
Right.

911
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:05,591
And where might we find those?

912
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,428
In the Hall of Science.

913
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,181
And where's that?

914
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:15,392

915
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:19,479
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

916

917
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,400
I take you for a man who's lost.

918
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,028
I won't be lost if you just tell me
how to work this thing!

919
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,154
I will!

920
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:29,990
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

921
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,993
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

922
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,620
Isn't that what you want?

923
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:36,038
Yes.

924
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,542
No.

From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

929
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:02,898
I felt the heart of a man
willing to lay down his life for others,

930
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,819

- What other choice do I have?
- Don't marry him.

A warrior may change his metal,

You were right.

No apparent increase in intelligence.

Still, this Will not do at all.

the course we have set, Earthman.

And we've chosen

And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

1141
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,890
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

1142
01:31:18,057 --> 01:31:21,310
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

plays out exactly the same way.
