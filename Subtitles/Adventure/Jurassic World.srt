Welcome to Jurassic World.

operating costs

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,121
Our shareholders have been patient,
but let's be honest,

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,283
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,489
Twenty years ago,
de-extinction was right up there with magic.

These days, kids
look at a <i>Stegosaurus</i>

That doesn't mean
asset development is falling behind.

discover new species every year.

louder, more teeth.

Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

We've learned more from
genetics in the past decade

94
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,642
than a century of
digging up bones.

How did you get two different
kinds of dinosaurs to, you know...

103
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,167
Oh, <i>Indominus</i> wasn't bred.
She was designed.

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,487
She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown.

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,764
They didn't need
these genetic hybrids.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,729
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

176
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,922
Okay, please don't wear it again.
That's kind of enough.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,126
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you close the deal?
CLAIRE: Looks like it.

179
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,965
Verizon Wireless
presents the <i>Indominus rex.</i>

180
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,485
Ugh, that is so terrible.

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,724
Why not just go
the distance, Claire,

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,531
and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs?

183
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,846
They've got all the ballparks.

184
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,327
Why stop there?
Why are the West Plains closed?

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,767
Another Pachy roaming
outside his zone.

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,922
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,804
Pepsi-saurus
or Tostito-don.

188
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,962
Security said
the invisible fences were a no-fail.

189
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,644
That is the second
time this month.

190
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,042
VIVIAN: Well, the Pachys short out
their implants when they butt heads.

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,208
How much longer
until they get it out of there?

192
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,567
He just got five
milligrams of carfentanil.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,043
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?

194
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,403
I mean, you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,244
Clean up your workspace.
It's chaotic.

196
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,483
I like to think of
it as a living system.

197
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,009
Just enough stability
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,366
MAN ON RADIO:
<i>Inbound chopper,
Jurassic 1. ETA, 5 minutes.</i>

199
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,881
Claire.

200
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,803
Mr. Masrani.
You are flying.

201
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,405
I got my license.

202
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,727
Two more.
Well, two more days.

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,926
Okay.
So,

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,042
how's my park doing?
CLAIRE: Great.

205
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,128
We're up 2.5% over last year.

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,288
A bit lower than our
initial projection.

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,811
No, no, no, how's it doing?

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,043
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

209
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,681
Well, guest
satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,322
We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

211
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,006
Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes.

212
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
Right?

213
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,811
Of course. (CHUCKLES)

214
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,925
Okay. Now show me
my new dinosaur.

215
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,244
(GASPS)
MASRANI: Oh...

216
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,404
Got it.

217
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,410
Got it.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, my!

219
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,046
You look tense, Claire.

220
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,608
Maybe you should just
focus on the controls.

221
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,967
The key to a happy
life is to accept

222
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,725
you are never
actually in control.

223
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,887
Bird!

224
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,442
You should spend a day at the beach.
Get some sun.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,045
Uh, right, so...

226
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,806
Marketing thought
we could offset some of the costs by...

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,968
Enough about cost.

228
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,168
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,

229
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,408
and not once did
he mention profits.

230
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,608
"Spare no expense,"
he used to say.

231
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,681
I appreciate that,

232
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,207
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires...

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,322
Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,722
Jurassic World exists to
remind us how very small we are.

235
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,844
How new. You can't
put a price on that.

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,328
Now, please, we're flying.

237
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,203
Breathe.

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,489
Is he okay?
Are you okay?

240
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,927
He's just being dramatic.

241
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,809
Are you still building?

242
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,363
We planned to open in May,

243
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,206
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

244
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,362
It's bigger than expected.

245
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,925
It's a good sign.

246
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,684
We hit a few
speed bumps early on.

247
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,889
It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,889
One of the handlers
nearly lost an arm.

249
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,885
The others threatened to quit if
I couldn't guarantee their safety.

250
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,209
She's intelligent then?

251
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,409
For a dinosaur.

252
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,568
And that?

253
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,804
It tried to break the glass.

254
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,928
I like her spirit.

255
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,610
(GROWLING)

256
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,841
It's white. You never
told me it was white.

257
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,442
Think it will scare the kids?

258
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,204
The kids?

259
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,368
This will give the
parents nightmares.

260
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,484
Is that good?

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,607
It's fantastic.

262
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,404
Can she see us?

263
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,208
They say it can
sense thermal radiation.

264
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,611
Like snakes.

265
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,688
I thought there
were two of them.

266
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,247
There was a sibling
in case this one didn't survive infancy.

267
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,322
Where's the sibling?

268
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,487
She ate it.

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,326
So, the paddock is
quite safe, then?

271
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,002
We have the best
structural engineers in the world.

272
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah, so did Hammond.

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,327
There's an American
Navy man here.

274
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,370
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

275
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,130
Owen Grady.

276
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,401
I know who he is.

277
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,443
MASRANI: His animals
often try to escape.

278
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,444
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

279
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,249
He only thinks he's smarter.

280
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,689
I want you to bring him in.

281
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,765
Let him inspect the paddock.

282
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,326
Maybe he sees
something we can't.

respond to commands.

and get it on its feet.

want them in the field.

Look at these creatures.

343
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,444
They've got millions
of years of instinct in their cells,

344
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
instinct that we can program.

in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

Corporate felt genetic modification

544
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,288
They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough.

548
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,329
We needed something scary

549
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,771
You should hear
a four-year-old

<i>"Archaeornithomimus."</i>

551

So what's this thing made of?

553
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,967
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

554
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,771
You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't even know what it is?

555
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,808
The lab delivers
us finished assets,

556
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,245

them to the public.

We can't exactly walk it.

562

Is there a problem?

564
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,283
Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional.

565
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,890
Your Raptors are
born in captivity.

566
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,442
With siblings.
They learn social skills.

567
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
And I imprint on
them when they're born.

568
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,606
There's trust.

569
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,810
The only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane.

570
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,285
At least she
knows that means food.

571
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,330
So, she needs a friend.

572
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,808
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

573
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,724
Probably not a good idea.
