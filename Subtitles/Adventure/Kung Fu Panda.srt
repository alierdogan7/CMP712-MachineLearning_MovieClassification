I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200

Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

177
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,800
Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!

178
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Ah! Oh, no! No, no, no, wait!

179
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,600

Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

185
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,520
But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!

186
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,320
I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.

What are you pointing...?

203
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,120
Oh! OK, sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.

204
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
How interesting.

205
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,840

- Him. 
- Who?

206

- Me?

That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.

216
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,400
You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!

Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

- Uh, I guess so. 
- Wrong!

You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be until

you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.

293
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,160

- CHUCKLES: 
- You think it's that easy?

295
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,280
That I'm just gonna hand you the secret to limitless power?

296
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,080
- No, I - 
- One must first master the highest level of kung fu

297
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,040
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.

298
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,840
- Someone like me? 
- Yes! Look at you!

299
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,560

- Agh! 
- Flabby arms! 
- Ow!

300
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,640
- Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. 
- And this ridiculous belly.

301
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,040
- Hey! 
- And utter disregard for personal hygiene.

302
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,280
- Wait a minute. That's uncalled for. 
- Don't stand that close.

303
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,520
- I can smell your breath. 
- Listen, Oogway said I was -

304
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,200
The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

305
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,880
Oh-haw-haw, you know this hold?

306
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty, yes.

307
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,600
- Oh, then you know what happens when I flex my pinkie? 
- No, no!

308
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,880
You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part

309
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,600
- is cleaning up afterwards. 
- OK, OK, take it easy.

310
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,960
Now, listen closely, panda.

311
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Oogway may have picked you but when I'm through with you,

312
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,400
I promise you you're going to wish he hadn't!

313
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,920
- Are we clear? 
- Oh, yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We're so clear.

314
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,640
Good. I can't wait to get started.

315
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,920

- Wa-ka!

316

324
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,040
- Ow. 
- Let's begin. 
- Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,280
Wh-What... now?

326
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,040
Yes, now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong

327
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,760
- and you are not the Dragon Warrior? 
- Oh, OK, well... 

328
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,800
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.

329
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,320
If we don't try, we'll never know, will we?

330
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Yeah, it's just maybe we can find something more suited to my level.

331
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,920
- And what level is that? 
- Well, I'm not a master

332
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,040
but, uh, let's just start at zero. Level zero.

333
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,400
- CHUCKLES: 
- No. There is no such thing as level zero.

334
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
- Hey! Maybe I can start with that. 
- That?

335
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,400
We use that for training children and propping the door open

336
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,480
when it's hot, but if you insist...

337
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,000
Whoa, the Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures.

338
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,080
Except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.

339
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,080
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.

340
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,000
Um, are they gonna watch or should I wait till they get back to work?

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
- Hit it. 
- OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate,

342
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,920
um, so I'm still digesting, so my kung fu might not be as good as

343
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,400
- later on. 
- Just hit it.

344
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
All right.

345
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,440
What you got? You got nothing cos I got it right here.

346
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,560
You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder.

347
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,640
What you gonna do about crazy feet?

348
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,560
Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.

349
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,280
You've only seen praying Mantis or Monkey style.

350
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,480
- Ooh-ooh-aaa-aaa. Or I could come at you snickety-snake. 
- Would you hit it!

351
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,600
All right. All right.

352
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,200
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

353
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,200
How's that? Oooh!

354
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,000
ALL GASP, PO SHOUTING

355
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,840
Ooh, ooh, ah, ooh, ah! ALL GASP

356
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
GRUNTS IN PAIN

357
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,800
Woo, woo, woo! Aw! Oh, that hurts.

358
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Ooh! Aw!

359
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,760
HE GRUNTS

360
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,560
- PO SHOUTING 
- This will be easier than I thought.

361
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm feeling a little nauseous! Ow! Ow! Ow!

362
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,280
Ow, those are hard! Ah! Ooh!

363
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,040
Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

364
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,640
My tenders. IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Oh, God.

365
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,680
Ooh!

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,080

HE EXHALES

371
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,880
- How did I do? 
- There is now a level zero.

372
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,000
- DISTANT VOICES 
- There's no words. 
- No denying that.

373
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,960
What was Master Oogway thinking? The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

374
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,200
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky

375
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,600
- on a ball of fire! 
- When he walks, the very ground shakes! 
- ALL LAUGH

376
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,920
One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.

377
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,400
- Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. 
- Or even see his toes.

378
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,440
ALL GIGGLE

379
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
Hm.

380
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
Hm! Ow!

381
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,040
HE SIGHS

382
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
OK.

383
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,600
FLOORBOARDS CREAK QUIETLY

384
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,960
FLOORBOARDS CREAK LOUDLY Great(!)

385
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,400
FLOORBOARDS CREAK Ooh!

386
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
Uh... Uh...

387
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,240
FLOORBOARDS CREAK LOUDLY

388
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,520
Oh. Hi. You're up.

389
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,440
- I am now. 
- I was just, uh...

390
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,600
Some day, huh? CHUCKLES: That kung fu stuff

391
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,440
- is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore? 
- Um...

392
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,080
I've had a long and rather disappointing day,

393
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,120
so, uh... yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.

394
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. 
- OK, thanks.

395
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,560
It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!

396
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,800
You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.

397
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,280
Outnumbered 1,000 to one but you didn't stop.

398
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,160
You just...

399
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,840
- Ooh, sorry about that. 
- Uh, look, you don't belong here.

400
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
SIGHS: I know.

401
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,200
I know. You're right. I don't have... I just...

402
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,320
- My whole life I've dreamed of... 
- No, I meant you don't belong here

403
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,920
in this room. This is my room.

404
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,720
Property of Crane.

405
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,560
Oh, OK. Right, right. So, you want to get to sleep?

406
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,480
- Yeah. 
- I'm keeping you up? We got big things tomorrow.

407
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. OK, bye-bye.

408
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,360
HE SIGHS What was that?

409
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,960
- I didn't say anything. 
- OK. All right. Good night.

410
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,800
Sleep well.

411
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,880
That seemed a little bit awkward. FLOORBOARDS CREAK

412
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,040
Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you. Just, um...

413
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,920
- You don't belong here. 
- Yeah, yeah, of course. This is your room.

414
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,280
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.

415
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,560
You're a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect

416
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
for who we are and what we do,

417
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,920
you will be gone by morning.

418
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,560
Big fan!

420
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

421
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,240
MUFFLED: Hm. Is that what this is?

422
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,760
I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.

423
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,560
I understand. You eat when you are upset.

424
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Upset? I'm not upset. Wh-What makes you think I'm upset?

425
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,160
So why are you upset?

426
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,760
SIGHS: I probably sucked more today than anyone

427
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
in the history of kung fu, in the history of China,

428
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,760
- in the history of sucking! 
- Probably.

429
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,320
And the Five! Man, you should've seen 'em!

430
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,600
- They totally hate me. 
- Totally.

431
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,120
How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?

432
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,400
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

433
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,000
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

434
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,920
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

435
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,960
Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.

436
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,280
Quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles.

437
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,160
You are too concerned with what was and what will be.

438
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,480
There's a saying. Yesterday is history,

439
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,920
tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift.

440
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,760
That is why it is called "the present".

I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.

490
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,800
Fly back there and tell them the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

491

Wake up!

498
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,800
He's quit.

499
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,600
What do we do now, Master, with the panda gone?

500
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,200
- Who will be the Dragon Warrior? 
- All we can do is resume our training

501
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,200
and trust that, in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.

502
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,120
- HE GROANS 
- What are you doing here?!

503
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,280
Ah, hi! Good morning, Master. I thought I'd warm up a little.

504
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
HE GROANS

505
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,600

508
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
One, two... three!

509
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,520
- SIGHS: Ah! Thank you. 
- Don't mention it.

510
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,520
- No, really, I appreciate - 
- Ever.

511
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,720
You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?

512
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,000
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

513
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,840
And years longer to apply it in combat.

514
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Aw.

515
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,480
Hm.

516
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,880
Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here

517
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,680
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

518
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,440
- Yeah! Excellent. 
- Let's get started.

519
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,480
- Are you ready? 
- I was born re... Ow! Agh!

520
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,160
- Ow! 
- I'm sorry, brother, I thought you said you were ready.

521
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,560
That was awesome! Let's go again!

522
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,080
HE GRUNTS Ow!

523
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,120
Oh! Agh!

524
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,160
HE GROWLS

525
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,280
Whoa!

526
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,320
HE GRUNTS

527
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,520
Ow! HE CHUCKLES EVILLY

528
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,560
I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more.

529
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,600
- Your next opponent will be me. 
- All right! Yeah, let's go!

530
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,400
- Step forth. 
- Agh! 
- The true path to victory

531
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,960
is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it.

532
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,880
- Oh, yeah! 
- To take his strength and use it against him

533
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,760
until he finally falls...or quits.

534
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,360
But a real warrior never quits.

535
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,440
Don't worry, Master, I will never quit!

536
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,960
Agh! Ooh!

537
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,920
YELLS AND SCREAMS

538
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,720
Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ugh!

539
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,440
If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.

540
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,080
- But he will. 
- He's not going to quit, is he?

541
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,320
He's not gonna quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.

542
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,880
PO GRUNTING IN DISTANCE

543
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Agh! Ow!

544
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,600
STRAINS: Ow!

545
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,080
- You said acupuncture would make me feel better. 
- Trust me, it will.

546
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,560
It's not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...

547
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,360
- Fat? 
- ..fur. I was going to say fur. 
- Sure you were.

548
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,320
Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean, look at me.

549
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,560
I'm over here.

550
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,680
- Agh-ha! 
- Maybe you should look at this again.

551
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,760
Oh, OK.

552
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,880
- Ow! Stop it. Stop! That's... Agh! 
- Oh!

553
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,800
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all,

554
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,600
but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

555
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,160
HE CHUCKLES

556
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,320
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

557
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,200
- Agh! 
- ..but he wasn't always like that.

558
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,960
According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu

559
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,560
- actually used to smile. 
- No!

560
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,080
- Yes. 
- But that was before.

561
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,440
- Before what? 
- Before Tai Lung.

562
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,960
We're not really supposed to talk about him.

563
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,920
Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.

564
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,120
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung. He was a student.

565
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,160
The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

566
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,200
And then he turned bad and now he's in jail and...

567
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,280
He wasn't just a student.

568
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,120
- 'Shifu found him as a cub.' 
- HE BABBLES

569
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,040
- 'And he raised him as his son.' 
- Ow! Oh.

570
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,800
'And when the boy showed talent in kung fu,

571
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,000
'Shifu trained him.'

572
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
'He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.'

573
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,400
- Ya! 
- 'It was never enough for Tai Lung.'

574
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,520
'He wanted the Dragon Scroll,

575
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,720
'but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.'

576
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,360
'Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.'

577
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,920
'He tried to take the scroll by force

578
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,480
'and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.'

579
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,400
'But how could he?'

580
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
SHIFU PANTS

581
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,840
'Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before...'

582
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,000
Hi-ha-hoo! Huh!

583
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,440
- A-ha. 
- Hm.

584
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
'..or since.'

585
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,600
SHE SIGHS

586
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,360
And now he has a chance to make things right,

587
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,560
to train the true Dragon Warrior,

588
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,680
and he's stuck with you, a big fat panda

589
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,120
- who treats it like a joke. 
- Doing!

590
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,280
- Oh, that is it! 
- Wait! My fault!

591
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,200
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

592
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,800
And may have also stopped his heart.

593
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,080
- GONG ECHOING IN DISTANCE SHIFU: 
- Inner peace.

594
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,120
Inner peace.

595
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,240
Inner... In... In... In... Inner peace.

596
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,520
- FLAPPING 
- Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!

597
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,200
- Inner... 
- FLAPPING, GRUNTING, HE SIGHS

598
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,840
- HE SIGHS 
- Oh, Zeng.

599
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,400
Excellent. I could use some good news right now.

600
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,440
- PANTS: 
- Uh...

601
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,880
Uh...

602
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,880
- Master! Master! 
- Hm?

603
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,840
I have... It's... It's very bad news.

604
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,520
Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.

605
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,920
Master, your vision. Your vision was right.

606
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,480
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way!

607
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,400
That is bad news...

608
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,200
..if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

609
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,920
The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

610
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,080
He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.

611
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,360
There are no accidents.

612
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,880
- SIGHS: 
- Yes, I know. You've said that already.

613
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,560
- Twice. 
- Well, that was no accident either.

614
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,480
- Thrice. 
- My old friend,

615
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,880
the panda will never fulfil his destiny nor you yours

616
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,280
until you let go of the illusion of control.

617
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,680
- Illusion? 
- Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

618
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,600
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,

619
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,840
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

620
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,600
- But there are things we can control. 
- HE GRUNTS

621
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,360
I can control when the fruit will fall.

622
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,080
- HE CHUCKLES 
- And I can control...

623
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,200
Ya! ..where to plant the seed. Ha-ya!

624
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,800
That is no illusion, Master.

625
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,760
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,

626
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,200
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

627
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,080
You may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach.

628
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,600
- But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! 
- Maybe it can

629
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,840
if you are willing to guide it,

630
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,120
to nurture it, to believe in it.

631
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,560
But how? How?

632
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,720
- I need your help, Master. 
- No, you just need to believe.

633
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,600
Promise me, Shifu.

634
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,160
Promise me you will believe.

635
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,640
I... I will try.

636
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,680
Hm, good.

637
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,080
My time has come.

638
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,800
You must continue your journey without me.

639
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Wh-Wh-What are you... Wh...

640
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,000
Master! You can't leave me!

641
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,360
You must believe.

642
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,720
Master!

643
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,880
- Were you scared? 
- Yeah, so I'm like, "Fine, you may be a wolf,

644
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,080
"you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province,

645
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,480
- "but you're a lousy tipper." 
- Really?

646
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,600
- So how did you get out of there alive? 
- I didn't actually say that,

647
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,240
but I thought it in... In my mind.

648
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,240
If he could read my mind, he'd have been like, "What?"

649
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,640
Order up! Hope you like it. SLURPING

650
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,600
- This is really good! 
- No, come on. Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.

651
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,000
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

652
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,800
- What are you talking about? This is amazing! 
- You're a really good cook.

653
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,120
- I wish my mouth was bigger. 
- Tigress, you've got to try this. 
- Hm.

654
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,720
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time

655
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,520
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.

656
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,080
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

657
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and, uh, universe juice.

658
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,880
HE SLURPS

659
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,360
SIGHS, ALL LAUGH

660
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,360
- What? 
- Oh, nothing, Master Shifu. 
- LAUGHING

661
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,120
"You'll never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds

662
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,040
"and brush your teeth!" "What is that noise? Laughter?"

663
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,240
"I've never heard of it! Work hard, panda, and maybe some day

664
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,040
- "you will have ears like mine." 
- That's good. 
- Oh.

665
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,120
Ears? It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.

666
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,080
- It's Shifu! 
- Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?

667
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,720
Oooh, Master Shifu!

668
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,880
- Uh... 
- You think this is funny?

669
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!

670
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,040
- What? 
- He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and you are the only one

671
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,080
who can stop him.

672
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,960
LAUGHS: And here I am saying you got no sense of humour. I'm gonna...

673
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,720
stop Tai Lung... What? You're serious? And I have to...

674
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,120
Uh, M-Master Oogway will stop him. He did it before, he'll do it again.

675
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,520
Oogway cannot! Not any more.

676
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
- ALL GASP 
- Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

677
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,360
- The panda? 
- Yes, the panda! 
- Master, please let us stop Tai Lung.

678
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,560
- This is what you've trained us for. 
- No! It is not your destiny

680
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,280
HE SCREAMS

681
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,560
HE SCREAMS AND PANTS

682
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,240
- Oh! 
- You cannot leave!

683
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,360
- A real warrior never quits. 
- Watch me.

684
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,960
Come on. How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?

685
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,000
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

686
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,960
You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.

687
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,720
Ow! You don't believe that. Ooh! You never believed that.

688
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,440
- From the moment I got here, you've tried to get rid of me. 
- Yes!

689
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,560
- Agh! 
- I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master

690
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,080
as I have come to trust in mine.

691
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,680
You're not my master and I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

692
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,960
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted to get rid of you,

693
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,960
- yet you stayed. 
- Yeah, I stayed.

694
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,400
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head

695
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,840
or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more

696
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,800
than it did every day of my life just being me.

697
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,360
I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me,

698
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,440
could make me not me,

699
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,680
it was you, the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!

700
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,920
But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior and I will!

701
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,640
Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.

702
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,160
Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you

703
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,360
gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior? Huh?

704
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,000
How? How?

705
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,960

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,160
This is what you trained me for.

Tigress!

710
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,240

- No, no, I mean how did you get up there?

725
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,520
I don't know. I... guess... I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

726

- Uh, it might.

I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared.

They're five masters. I'm just one me.

01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,720
- a butterfly's wing beat. 
- Whoa, really? That's cool.

855
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,560
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

856
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,320
You will feel the universe in motion around you.

857
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,440
Wow! Can I punch through walls? C-C-Can I do a quadruple back flip?

858
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,640
- Focus. 
- Will I have invisibility? 
- Focus. 
- Huh? 
- Focus. 
- Oh, yeah.

859
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,360
Read it, Po, and fulfil your destiny.

860
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,400
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.

861
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,440
Whoa!

862
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,400
HE GRUNTS It's impossible to open.

863
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,840
PO GRUNTS: OK. Come on, baby.

864
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,520
Come on, now.

865
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,000
POPPING Thank you.

866
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,560
I probably loosened it up for you, though.

867
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,440
CLEARS THROAT OK, here goes.

868
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,680
HE SCREAMS

869
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,040
ALL GASP

870
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,480
- It's blank. 
- What?! 
- Here, look. 
- No! I am forbidden to look upon...

871
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,120
Blank. I don't...

872
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,280
I don't understand.

873
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:03,360
OK. So, like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.

874
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,800
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

875
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,680
Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.

876
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,840
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?

877
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,480
But who will stop Tai Lung?

878
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,920
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

879
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,760
No. Evacuate the valley.

880
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,200
You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

881
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,440
- What about you, Master? 
- I will fight him.

882
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,760
- What? 
- I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.

883
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,080
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

884
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,880
Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.

885
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,800
Listen to me, all of you.

886
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,280
It is time for you to continue your journey without me.

887
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,000
I am very proud to have been your master.

888
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,600
- We've got to get them out safely. 
- Come, little one.

889
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,840
- Let's find your mama. 
- Viper, gather the southern farmers,

890
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,520
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way.

891
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,960
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior(!)

892
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,120
- Hey, Dad. 
- Po!

893
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,400
Good to have you back, son.

894
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,240
- Good to be back. 
- Let's go, Po.

895
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,080
CREAKING

896
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,960
So, for our next shop it's time to face it.

897
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:13,800
The future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices.

898
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,560
Also, I was thinking maybe this time

899
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,280
we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.

900
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,720
Hm? You like that?

901
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:32,160
Uh, Po, I-I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

902
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,800
I-I-It just wasn't meant to be.

903
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,640
Po, forget everything else.

904
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,880
Your destiny still awaits.

905
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,520
We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.

906
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,800
I don't know, Dad.

907
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,760
Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.

908
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,200
Oh! Po, I think it's time

909
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,240
I told you something I should have told you

910
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,040
- a long time ago. 
- OK.

911
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,320
The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

912
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,880
Oh!

913
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,080
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

914
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,840
- ..nothing! 
- Huh?!

915
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,400
You heard me. Nothing! There is no secret ingredient!

916
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,720
Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?

917
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,440
- You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? 
- Don't have to.

918
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,720
To make something special, you have to believe it's special.

919
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,560
THUNDER

920
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,360
There is no secret ingredient.

921
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,960
LIGHTNING

922
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,000
THUNDER RUMBLING

923
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,400
LIGHTNING BOOMS

924
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,720
- LIGHTNING BOOMS 
- I have come home, Master.

925
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,920
This is no longer your home and I am no longer your master.

926
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,760
Oh, yes. You have a new favourite.

927
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,360
So where is this "Po"? Did I scare him off?

928
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,760
This battle is between you and me.

929
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,400
- So, that is how it's going to be. 
- That is how it must be.

930
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,520
HE GROWLS AND SNARLS

931
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,000
HE SCREAMS

932
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,960
- HE GRUNTS 
- Hya!

933
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,560
I rotted in jail for 20 years

934
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:55,080
- because of your weakness! 
- Obeying your master is not weakness!

935
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,360
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

936
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,480
'You always knew.'

937
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,480
'But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?'

938
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,160
'What did you do?!'

939
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,960
- Nothing! 
- You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior!

940
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,560
- That was not my fault! 
- Not your fault?!

941
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,120
Who filled my head with dreams?!

942
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,800
Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!

943
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,640
Who denied me my destiny?!

944
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,760
Hya!

945
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,640
GLASS RINGS

946
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,520
It was never my decision to make!

947
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,960
TAI LUNG PANTS

948
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,960
It is now.

949
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,000
Hya!

950
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,720
- Give me the scroll! 
- I would rather die.

951
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,960
HE SNARLS

952
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,520
EXPLOSION

953
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,240
BOTH GRUNT AND SCREAM

954
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,960
GRUNTING

955
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,760
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

956
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,080
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

957
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,880
- Tell me! Tell me! 
- THUD!

958
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,840
SHIFU GRUNTS AND PANTS

959
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,360
I... I have always been proud of you.

960
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,200
From the first moment, I've been... proud of you.

961
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:13,680
And it was my pride that blinded me.

962
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,760
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...

963
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,000
..what I... was turning you into.

964
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,080
I'm s... I'm sorry.

965
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,880
- HE GROWLS: 
- I don't want your apology,

966
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,360
I want my scroll!

967
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,040
What?! Where is it?!

968
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:49,480
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.

969
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,400
- HE CHOKES: 
- You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.

970
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
- Never. 
- RUSTLING

971
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,920
- N... Never. 
- Hey!

972
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,080
PANTS AND SIGHS

973
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,760
Stairs.

974
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,000
- Who are you? 
- Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

975
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,200
PO SIGHS

976
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,360
You? Him? He's a panda.

977
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,200
You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

978
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,160
Don't tempt me. LAUGHS: No.

979
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,840
I'm gonna use this. Ha-ha! You want it? Come and get it.

980
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,400
- HE GRUNTS 
- Finally!

981
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,440
Ha! Oooar!

982
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,760
HE GROWLS

983
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,640
Ooh! Waa!

984
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,800

Oh!

992
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,960
HE LAUGHS

993
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,040
Whoa!

994
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,120
Oh!

The scroll has given him power! No!

Oh! CRASHING AND RUMBLING

1003

- CHUCKLES: 
- The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

1011
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,960
It's nothing!

1012
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,200
GROANS: It's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either.

1013
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:29,960
- What? 
- There is no secret ingredient.

1014
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,320
It's just you.
