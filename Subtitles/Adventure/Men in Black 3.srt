When you're moving fast enough,

601
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,876
that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green lime-travel liquid

602
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,783
and it's gonna glow
really bright.

603
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,584

break that blue laser line

Let's see, mass of Earth and
30-something feet per minute...

609
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,272

about two feet off the ground.
