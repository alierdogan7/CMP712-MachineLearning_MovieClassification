MUSGRAVE: Ethan.
Three days ago,

179
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,061
Agent Lindsey Farris
was captured while on
a surveillance operation.

180
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,064
This is the man
she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.

181
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,816
Details are eyes-only,

182
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,985
but I can tell you
that Davian's
a black-market trafficker.

183
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,655
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.

00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,156
At 1400 hours today,

185
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,659

a caravan of vehicles

186
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,162
with plates matching those
known to have been used
by Davian's operatives.

187
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,915
They stopped at a derelict
factory outside Berlin.

188
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,717
It appears
they have a hostage.

189
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,218
We believe it's Agent Farris.

190
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,671
Normally we would disavow,

191
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,640
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer
to Davian,

192
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,391
and that's a risk
we need to take.

Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

194

and bring her home.

herself to be captured.

Because your operation
was poorly conceived

about Owen Davian?

to Korea from Pakistan.

421
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,462
He was also the man
who sold Toxin Five

422
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,464
to the Armahad
Republic Jihad.

423

that he is winning.

Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

Your Mr. Davian is
going to arrive in Rome
the day after tomorrow

516
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,563
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

517
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,699
What the hell is Davian 
doing at the Vatican?

518
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,984
It's all got to do
with the "Rabbit's Foot."

519
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,069
Rabbit's Foot?

520
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,620
Yeah, well, I'm assuming
it's like a code word

521
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,240
for something
he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

522
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,625
for $850 million, by the way.

523
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,077
Or maybe
it's not a code word.

524
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,463
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive
bunny appendage.

525
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,381
You have no idea
what it is?

526
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,217
It's interesting.
I used to have this
professor at Oxford, okay?

527
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,220
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like
this massive, fat guy.

528
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,723
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

529
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,591
You know...
Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

530
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,594
He taught
bimolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

531
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,596
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

532
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,933
with this story about
how the world would
eventually be eviscerated

533
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,435
by technology.

534
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,938
You see, it was inevitable
that a--a--a compound
would be created,

535
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,441
which he referred to
as the "Anti-God."

536
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,910
It was like
an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

537
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,913
like a-a-a-an unstoppable
force of--of--of
destructive power

538
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,031
that would just lay waste
to everything.

539
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,033
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

540
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,753
and ice cream parlors,
you know?

541
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,923
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

542
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,927
willing to spend
this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

543
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,930
I always assume
it's the Anti-God.

544
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:05,136
End-of-the-world
kind of stuff,
you know?

545
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,306
But, no, I don't have
any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

546
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,641
Did you brief Musgrave
on this?
Who, me? No, not yet.

it's in a laboratory

whatever it is,

to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

in your head.

01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:11,961

(COCKING GUN)

1201
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:15,848
The Rabbit's Foot.
Where is it?

1202
01:36:16,348 --> 01:36:18,467
I gave it to you.

1203
01:36:18,968 --> 01:36:20,936
Now, I'm going to count to 10

1204
01:36:21,303 --> 01:36:24,974
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

1205
01:36:26,308 --> 01:36:27,559
or she dies.

1206
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:56,255

to talk about. Don't we?

01:37:01,143 --> 01:37:03,729
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

1210
01:37:03,729 --> 01:37:04,930
Where is it?

1211
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,315
Look at me.
Where the hell is it?

1212
01:37:06,315 --> 01:37:07,850
Look at me. Stay with me.
Seven!

1213
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,818
I am going to kill you. I swear to God
I'm going to...

Eight!
No, please.

1215
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:17,743
Please. Don't do this.
Just let her go.

1216
01:37:17,743 --> 01:37:21,246
I promise you.
I promise you.

1217
01:37:21,246 --> 01:37:25,117
I can figure out
how to get whatever...
Nine.

1218
01:37:25,117 --> 01:37:28,170
Listen to me.
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

1219
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:30,339
But you got to do
what's right.

1220

I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.

1229
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:33,018
It's complicated.

1230
01:38:40,192 --> 01:38:42,194
You can't just
open the canister.

1231
01:38:42,694 --> 01:38:45,197
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1232

The Rabbit's Foot.
Now we know.

1233
01:38:57,509 --> 01:39:00,596
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1234
01:39:09,938 --> 01:39:13,442
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

1235
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,361
Remember?

1236
01:39:16,361 --> 01:39:17,863

she failed him.

1237
01:39:20,065 --> 01:39:24,987
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1238
01:39:25,487 --> 01:39:26,488
Davian wanted
to kill you both,

1239
01:39:26,488 --> 01:39:28,991
but I convinced him otherwise.

1240
01:39:28,991 --> 01:39:33,212
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything.
She's clean.

1241
01:39:33,212 --> 01:39:35,714
She can go on to have a life.

1242
01:39:35,714 --> 01:39:41,303
As long as you tell me, 
what was in Lindsey's message?

1243
01:39:41,303 --> 01:39:44,306
I know she sent you
a microdot from Berlin.

1244
01:39:45,757 --> 01:39:48,260
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1245
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,263
Is that why she
sent the message to you?
Did you read it?

1246
01:39:51,263 --> 01:39:52,898
Did anyone else see it?

1247
01:39:52,898 --> 01:39:55,400
Did she know about
the work I was doing?

1248
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,686
Could I be
compromised at IMF?

1249
01:39:57,686 --> 01:40:00,572
(SNAPPING FINGERS)
Ethan. Ethan.

1250
01:40:00,572 --> 01:40:03,192
Did she buy
that Brassel set her up?

1251
01:40:03,192 --> 01:40:04,993
Did she buy that?

1252
01:40:06,328 --> 01:40:07,329
You told him.

1253
01:40:08,831 --> 01:40:11,333
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1254
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,168
You told him.

1255
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:17,289
I thought you could 
get her back.

1256
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:21,293
But I wasn't gonna
let Brassel, of all people,
undo the work I'd done.

1257
01:40:21,293 --> 01:40:25,681
I took action, Ethan,
on behalf of the working
families of our country.

1258
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:27,132
The Armed Forces,
the White House.

1259
01:40:27,132 --> 01:40:29,134
I'd had enough of Brassel
and his sanctimony.

1260
01:40:29,134 --> 01:40:32,604
IMF Executive Director. 
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1261
01:40:32,604 --> 01:40:36,358
You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?

1262
01:40:36,642 --> 01:40:38,143
Davian's a weed.

1263
01:40:40,145 --> 01:40:44,149
You cut him out,
two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1264
01:40:44,149 --> 01:40:46,151
Arrest him? Then what?

1265
01:40:47,653 --> 01:40:49,154
You use him.

1266
01:40:50,656 --> 01:40:53,158
Collaborate with him.

1267
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,662
And it's Christmas.

the Rabbit's Foot
will be delivered

1269
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,970
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel
to prove it.

1270
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:07,973
US Security Council
will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1271
01:41:07,973 --> 01:41:11,226
We're talking a military
strike within a week.

1272
01:41:11,226 --> 01:41:13,729
And when the sand settles,

1273
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:16,315
our country will do
what it does best.

you have left.

know she's alive.

01:42:11,653 --> 01:42:15,157

there was a lake
near the mountain.

the other one in,
