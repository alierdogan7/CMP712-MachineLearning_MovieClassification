A constellation
of dark new worlds.

6

cannot convert you,
they will kill you.

evil would be fought by good.

But in times like these,

well, it should be fought
by another kind of evil.

If you cut my throat,

129
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,219
I'll not be able to rescind
the offer that
brought you here.

130
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,638
Nor tell you
why it's so vital
that you did come.

131
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,015
The blade comes off
when the bounty comes off.

132
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,767
This is Aereon.

She means you no harm.

135

There are very few of us

136

and lived to speak of it.

137
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,034
So when I choose
to speak of it,
you should choose to listen.

138
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,786
Necromonger.

139
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,790
It is the name
that will convert
or kill

140
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,667
every last human life.

141
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,419
Unless Furyan
warriors are found.

142
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,839
They were the one race
that would not bow,

143
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,591
the only race
the Necromongers still fear.

144
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,343
Maybe you should pretend
like you're talking

145
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,221
to someone educated
in the penal system.

146
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,723
In fact, don't pretend.

147

Furyans

148

strangled at birth.

149
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,232
Strangled with
their own cords.

150
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,946
When Aereon told this story
to the Helion leaders,

151
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,447
I told her of you.

152
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,157
What do you know
of your early years?

153
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,119
Do you remember
your homeworld?
Where it was?

154
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,704
Have you met any others?

155
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,289
Others like yourself.

156
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,627
Sister, they don't know
what to do with
just one of me.

157
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,796
Spoken like a true Furyan.

158
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,592
I don't care where I'm from.
I want the bounty
off my head.

searching houses.

They look for a man
who came here today.

163
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,020
They think he might be a spy.
A spy.

164
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,647
Did someone see
him come here today?
Did they?

But wait one minute, please.

Will you wait one
minute to save worlds?

168
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,743
Not my fight.

169
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,330
So you will
leave us to our fate?

170
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,749

355
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,307
In and out,
unsuspected and undetected.

356
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,725

357
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,102

358

your merc-killing ass?

361

362
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,035
Ten minutes every other day
on the dog-run.

363
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,371

364
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,959

Nice little double-max prison.

365
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:25,088

just in case I drop in.

with these joints now?

367

waffle-eating pussies.

368
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,846
Maybe we should think about
upping our game
here a little bit.

369
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,348

372

Only three of them
left in this system,

373
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,816
two of them out of range

374
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,944

little undercutter
like this one with no legs.

375

where we're going,
and we don't?

379

happened to the last crew.

390

nothing more, I swear it.
While I do prize brute force

391
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,081
this approach is,
perhaps, more artful.

392
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,627
Start at the end.
Go straight to Helion Five,

393
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,879

in the system.

Remove these cannon first,

396
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,012
then attack
the larger placements
at speed.

397
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,348
We'll catch them
on their rear flank.

398

And in 10 days' time

399

will tumble before us.

400

401
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,442
their blind spot
is right behind them.

402
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,364
I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

403
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,908

and cleanse him. You.

412
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,900
Perhaps because
he knows he's half
the warrior you are.

413
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,237

for the job.

like conspiracy?

about the demise

420

assumes a conspiracy?

just prudent planning?

422

he will name a successor.

bring himself to kill
one stranded Elemental.

first things first.

537

where he went.

538
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,755

I'm more interested in
where he came from.

540
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,764

does an air Elemental fly?

getting off this planet alive

No, we can't fly.
But we glide very well.

I would have told
you about Riddick
for the asking.

once consulted
a seer, of sorts.

550
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,966
And was told
that he would die
at the hands of a Furyan.

551
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,929
So he waged a private war
on the planet Furya,

552
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,847
killing all he could find.

553
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,476
This was before
he became Lord Marshal,
of course.

554

ended the matter.

for escape.

880
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,368
(MARSHAL GROANS IN PAIN)

881
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:44,837
(GROANS)

882
01:45:48,633 --> 01:45:51,302
Now! Kill the beast
while he's wounded!

883
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,112
Help me, Vaako.

884
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,365
Kill him.

885
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,040
Vaako?

886
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,213
Forgive me.

887
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,382
Flawless.

888
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,163
No.

889
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,045
No!

890
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:26,397
I thought you were dead.

891
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:31,026
Are you with me, Kyra?

892
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:36,115
I was always with you.

893
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:39,869
I was.

894
01:49:05,288 --> 01:49:07,248
You keep what you kill.

895
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:15,214
Now, what would be
the odds of that?

896
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:19,510
This dark army at
the feet of a lone outlaw.

897
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:23,639
And the fate of
the rest of the universe?

898
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:28,978
Well, not even I dare
to calculate that.
