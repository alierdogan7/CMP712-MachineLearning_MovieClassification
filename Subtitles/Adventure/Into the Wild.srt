1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,560
<i>Mom!</i>

2
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,960
<i>Mom! Help me.</i>

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,960
What is it?

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,760
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,640
- I heard him!
- I know.

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,240
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
No, I did. He's... He's...

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,360
- I heard him!
- Billie.

10
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,280
That's about as far as I can get you.

11
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,920
All right. Thank you.

12
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
- You left all your shit on my dash.
- Keep it.

13
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
Suit yourself.

14
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,840
Thanks again.

15
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Hey, hold on a minute.

16
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.

17
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,480
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.

18
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
Thanks.

19
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,480
Hello?

20
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,880
Is there anybody here?

21
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,080
Guess not!

22
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,960
Two years he walks the earth.

23
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,160
No phone, no pool, no pets,

24
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,680
<i>no cigarettes.</i>

25
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Ultimate freedom.

26
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,720
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager

27
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,440
whose home is the road.

28
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
"Hey, listen, old man.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?

29
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,480
"Shut up.
I'm taking you out to where we're going."

30
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,080
"Where you going?"

31
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,760
"I told you. We're going nowhere!"

32
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,640
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.

33
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,280
The climactic battle to kill

34
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,440
the false being within

35
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.

36
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,200
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,

37
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,720
and walks alone
upon the land to become

38
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,560
lost in the wild.

39
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,680
<i>... hard work and manifold contributions
to our community during their time here,</i>

40
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,800

41
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,880

<i>Regina Victoria McNabb.</i>

46
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
<i>I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges.</i>

47
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,840
<i>I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch,</i>

48
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,160
<i>the red tiles glinting like bent plates
of blood behind his head.</i>

49
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,760
<i>I see my mother
with a few light books at her hip,</i>

50
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,320
<i>standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the wrought-iron gates</i>

51
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,320
<i>still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air.</i>

52
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,240
<i>They are about to graduate.</i>

53
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>They are about to get married.
They are kids. They are dumb.</i>

54
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,440
<i>All they know is they are innocent,
they would never hurt anybody.</i>

55
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,120
<i>I want to go up to them and say,
"Stop, don't do it.</i>

56
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,800
<i>"She's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man.</i>

57
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,000
<i>"You are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do.</i>

58
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,120
<i>"You are going to do bad things
to children.</i>

59
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,680
<i>"You are going to suffer
in ways you never heard of.</i>

60
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,680
<i>"You are going to want to die."</i>

61
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,960
<i>I want to go up to them there
in the late May sunlight and say it.</i>

62
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,200
<i>But I don't do it. I want to live.</i>

63
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>I take them up like the male and female
paper dolls, and bang them together</i>

64
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,880
<i>at the hips like chips of flint, as if
to strike sparks from them. I say,</i>

65
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
"Do what you are going to do
and I will tell about it."

66
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Here they are, Walt. Okay?

67
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,760
Who wrote that?

68
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,600
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?

69
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,280
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?

70
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,520
There's a lot of great poems in here.

71
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
I have to speak to her about it.

72
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,400
Sit down.

73
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,080
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.

74
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,200
He just graduated today
from Emory College.

75
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
I'll get it. I'll get it.

76
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.

77
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,320
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.

78
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,640
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations, Son.

79
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
- This is a big step.
- Thank you, Dad.

80
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,800
All right.

81
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.

82
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
Why? I have my permit.

83
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,280
'Cause it's against the law
for a learner's permit

84
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,640
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.

85
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,000
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.

86
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, let's...

87
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,240
- Are they going to continue?
- No.

88
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,960
I guess everybody's celebrating today.

89
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,880
- They're going to stay in the bar, right?
- That's right.

90
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,280
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.

91
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Chris, that's wonderful.

92
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
That is a big deal.

93
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,920
How much do you have left
in the college fund?

94
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,240
Exactly $24,500.68.

95
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,920
Well, that's specific.

96
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,640
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.

97
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.

98
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,720
That's right.

99
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.

100
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,680
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.

101
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,040
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.

102
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,360
We want to get you out of that junker.

103
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
What junker?

104
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
That.

105
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,360
- We want to buy you a new car.
- That's right.

106
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
A new car?

107
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Why would I want a new car?

108
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,680
Datsun runs great.

109
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,840
Do you think I want some fancy boat?

110
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,560
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?

111
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,400
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.

112
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,560
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.

113
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,040
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.

114
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,120
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.

115
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,680
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.

116
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,040
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

117
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,720
- These things, things, things, things.
- Okay.

118
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
- Everything has to be difficult.
- Thank you.

119
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,600
- Thank you.
- Maybe that's not what he means.

120
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,200
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.

121
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,920
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

122
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,240
<i>Chris measured himself
and those around him</i>

123
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
<i>by a fiercely rigorous moral code.</i>

124
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Bye, Chris!

125
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>He risked what could have been
a relentlessly lonely path</i>

126
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,880
<i>but found company
in the characters of the books he loved</i>

127
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,440
<i>from writers like Tolstoy,
Jack London and Thoreau.</i>

128
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
<i>He could summon their words
to suit any occasion,</i>

129
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,480
<i>and he often would.</i>

130
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,040
<i>I forgot to ask what quote he'd have
picked for his graduation dinner,</i>

131
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,560
<i>but I had a good idea
of who the primary target would be.</i>

132
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,120
<i>It was inevitable
that Chris would break away.</i>

133
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,480
<i>And when he did, he would do it
with characteristic immoderation.</i>

134
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,280
<i>"It should not be denied that being
footloose has always exhilarated us.</i>

135
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,040
<i>"It is associated in our minds
with escape</i>

136
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,840
<i>"from history and oppression and law
and irksome obligations.</i>

137
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,920
<i>"Absolute freedom.</i>

138
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,400
<i>"And the road has always led west."</i>

139
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,160
<i>I need a name.</i>

140
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,160
<i>Toward the end of June,</i>

141
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,120
<i>Emory had mailed our parents
Chris' final grade report.</i>

142
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
<i>Almost all A's.</i>

143
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
<i>A in Apartheid in South African Society.</i>

144
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,360
<i>A- minus in Contemporary African
Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.</i>

145
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,480
<i>And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.</i>

146
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,560
<i>But by the end of July,
we hadn't heard anything from him</i>

147
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>and my parents
were becoming unsettled.</i>

148
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,880
<i>Chris had never had a phone,</i>

149
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,320
<i>so they decided to drive down
to Atlanta and surprise him.</i>

150
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,440
<i>When they arrived at the apartment,
there was a "For Rent" sign up</i>

151
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,840
<i>and the manager said that Chris
had moved out at the end of May.</i>

152
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,920
Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

153
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,120
<i>So when they got home,</i>

154
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,160
<i>I had to hand them all the letters that
they had sent Chris that summer,</i>

155
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,360
<i>which had been returned in a bundle.</i>

156
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,800
<i>Chris had arranged for the post office
to hold them until August 1st,</i>

157
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,640
<i>to buy himself some time.</i>

158
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,560
Did you know about this?

159
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
He didn't say anything.

160
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,000
<i>I understood what he was doing.
That he had spent four years</i>

161
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,960
<i>fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty
of graduating from college,</i>

162
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,800
<i>and now he was emancipated
from that world of abstraction,</i>

163
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,200
<i>false security, parents
and material excess,</i>

164
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,840
<i>the things that cut Chris off
from the truth of his existence.</i>

165
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
Hey!

166
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,840
- Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.
- Okay, great.

167
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,520
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.

168
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,200
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.

169
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
That's Rainey.

170
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,560
- Hi, Rainey.
- Yeah, I'm Rainey.

171
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,200
- I'm Jan.
- Hi. I'm Alex.

172
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,600
Alex with the hat on.

173
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
- Yeah, I know. You said it, man.
- Yeah.

174
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,240
So you're a leather now.

175
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm a leather?

176
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,440
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.

177
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,400
Technically we're rubber tramps.

178
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Because we have a vehicle.

179
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,720
- You don't have to push me away.
- Come on, please?

180
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,080
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.

181
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,160
And why did you do that?

182
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.

183
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,720
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.

184
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,760
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,

185
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,000
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.

186
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,600
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.

187
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Where are your mom and dad?

188
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,440
Living their lies somewhere.

189
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,720
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.

190
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
Fair?

191
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
You know what I mean.

192
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,680
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

193
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,800
"Rather than love, than money,
than faith,

194
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,760
"than fame, than fairness,

195
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,600
"give me truth."

196
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,080
<i>From as long ago
as Chris and I could remember,</i>

197
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,280
<i>there have been
daily bouts of rage in our house.</i>

198
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,640
<i>Violence that we were forced
to witness. It was very real.</i>

199
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,960
<i>But it was also like theater.</i>

200
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,240
<i>They cast us as both judges
and the accused.</i>

201
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,960
And I got you this token,
this expensive token.

202
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,400
<i>Dad had been the young genius</i>

203
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,120
<i>that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs
for the American satellite radar systems</i>

204
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,520
<i>that would be our answer
to the Russian Sputnik.</i>

205
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,960
<i>And Mom and he later started up
a consulting firm</i>

206
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,360
<i>combining her
get-up-and-go resourcefulness</i>

207
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>with his wealth of knowledge.</i>

208
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,160
Look at this.

209
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,680
<i>But by the time the company
actually made its first million,</i>

210
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,560
<i>the careerism and money seemed
only to embolden their blindness.</i>

211
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,080
Thank you very, very much.

212
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
<i>I remember the first family meeting</i>

213
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,160
<i>to let us in on their plans
for getting a divorce.</i>

214
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,200
<i>They wanted us to choose
which of them we'd live with.</i>

215
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,880
<i>We cried our eyes out.</i>

216
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,120
<i>The divorce never happened,</i>

217
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,840
<i>but the battles and the meetings
never stopped.</i>

218
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,040
<i>It wasn't very long
before Chris and I shut off.</i>

219
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,480
<i>We'd say "Go ahead.</i>

220
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,600
<i>"Get the divorce."</i>

221
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,720
Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have
dinner and warmth at the same time.

222
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,320
Where's Jan going?

223
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,280
Well, my friend,

224
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,200
all is not well on the hippie front.

225
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,480
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?

226
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Little bit.

227
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,960
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.

228
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,200
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.

229
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,600
But, you know, she's got a story.

230
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,520
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.

231
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,000
So when we ran into you yesterday,

232
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,600
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,

233
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,440
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?

234
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,760
- I think I do.
- You think what?

235
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,480
Well...

236
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,240
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.

237
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,800
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,

238
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,360
trying to close the gaps to the past.

239
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,440
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!

240
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,200
- You're not Jesus, are you?
- Look who's talking.

241
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,760
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?

242
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,040
No. I'm afraid of water.

243
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,240
Always have been.

244
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,120
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it

245
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,120
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

246
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
- Shit, yeah.
- Yeah?

247
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,400
- Call it carried.
- All right.

248
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,360
<i>"The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,</i>

249
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,760
<i>"and, occasionally,
the chance to feel strong.</i>

250
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,960
<i>"Now, I don't know much about the sea,</i>

251
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,480
<i>"but I do know that
that's the way it is here.</i>

252
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,360
<i>"And I also know
how important it is in life</i>

253
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,320
<i>"not necessarily to be strong,
but to feel strong,</i>

254
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,880
<i>"to measure yourself at least once,</i>

255
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,760
<i>"to find yourself at least once in
the most ancient of human conditions,</i>

256
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,800
<i>"facing the blind, deaf stone alone</i>

257
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,360
<i>"with nothing to help you
but your hands and your own head."</i>

258
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,520
There's a big wave coming!

259
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,600
Rainey, I'm freezing!

260
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Could you put your arms around me?

261
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,720
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,

262
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:01,520
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.

263
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,840
- Man, you would dig the Slabs.
- You would like it. You would like it.

264
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,040
- If you're on the road still.
- You'd love it.

265
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
Fellow travelers.

266
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,080
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.

267
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,520
Sounds good.

268
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,240
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.

269
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

270
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,400
Oh, baby. Baby.

271
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,160
- Stop it. Wait.
- Yeah.

272
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,080
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

273
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,280
Let me turn off the light.

274
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,360
- He reminded me of...
- I know.

275
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,840
<i>Such is the way of the world</i>

276
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,280
<i>You can never know</i>

277
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,680
<i>Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?</i>

278
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,960
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

279
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,480
<i>Burning back holes in dark memories</i>

280
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,760
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

281
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,000
<i>Turning mistakes into gold</i>

282
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,600
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like

283
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,480
100,000 times better than, like,
any apple I've ever had.

284
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,520
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.

285
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,440
You're Superapple.

286
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,960
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.

287
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
You're the apple of my eye.

288
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,640
<i>Hey! Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold</i>

289
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,160
<i>And suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold</i>

290
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,120
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

291
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,600
<i>Find my direction magnetically</i>

292
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,720
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

293
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,080
<i>Throw down my ace in the hole</i>

294
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,440
<i>In early September, Mom and Dad
got a call from the Annandale police</i>

295
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
<i>notifying them that
Chris' abandoned car</i>

296
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,880
<i>had been identified
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.</i>

297
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,320
<i>A group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert.</i>

298
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,040
<i>There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it.</i>

299
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,160
<i>But there wasn't
any evidence of struggle, either.</i>

300
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,320
<i>The police thought
Chris had chosen to leave it behind</i>

301
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
<i>and not that it was taken from him.</i>

302
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,160
<i>The initial comfort
that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned</i>

303
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,800
<i>to the realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.</i>

304
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,560
Strong.

305
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,960
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.

306
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,480
<i>Money, power is an illusion.
It's up here.</i>

307
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,480
You can be here.

308
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
Me and you.

309
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,320
One, two. No, no, no.

310
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,160
Two,

311
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,760
three...

312
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,920
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.

313
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
- That's your speed right here.
- Right.

314
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,080
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.

315
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,080
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.

316
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,360
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.

317
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Wow, look at this view!

318
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,080
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.

319
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,240
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.

320
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

321
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,880
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.

322
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.

323
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,280
Okay.

324
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,440
Wayne. Where you going?

325
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,680
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.

326
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,960
- I'm joking with you.
- Mind your own business, Wayne!

327
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,120
- What are you getting so hostile for?
- I don't know.

328
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,440
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.

329
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,440
- I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.
- Kevin, we're on the same side.

330
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,000
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.

331
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,480
- Whoa. He's serious about this.
- Let's just play cards.

332
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,080
- Can we just play cards?
- Let's go, then.

333
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,800
$2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.

334
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,680
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.

335
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,240
- You want to play?
- No.

336
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,320
- Kevin, what have you got for the week?
- I got 260.

337
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,040
We're at 260.

338
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,040
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.

339
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,880
We've got 20,000 pounds.

340
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,680
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.

341
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,240
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.

342
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,640
Can we do the $500 reserves...

343
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,600
What do you think about all this?

344
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,960
I like all this.

345
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,800
I don't think he can do it.

346
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Is there a library
or bookstore around here

347
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?

348
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,920
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,

349
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,960
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,

350
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,840
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.

351
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?

352
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,840
I'm going to Alaska.

353
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?

354
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,520
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.

355
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,640
The city of Alaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city of Alaska, they have markets.

356
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,840
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.

357
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.

358
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,880
Just on my own.

359
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,240
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.

360
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,880
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.

361
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,200
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.

362
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,000
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.

363
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,000
- In the wild.
- Just wild.

364
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,000
- Yeah.
- Just...

365
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
What are you doing when we're there?

366
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,320
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?

367
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,520
You're just living, man.

368
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,880
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.

369
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,120
Yeah.

370
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,680
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.

371
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,720
Why not?

372
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,800
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.

373
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,560
- Society!
- Society!

374
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,160
- Society, man!
- Society!

375
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,360
- Society! Society!
- Society!

376
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,040
Society, you know! Society!

377
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,400
'Cause you know
what I don't understand?

378
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,280
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person

379
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,600
is so bad to each other so fucking often.

380
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,600
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.

381
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,320
- Well, it just...
- What "people" we talking about?

382
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,440
You know, parents, hypocrites,

383
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,600
politicians, pricks.

384
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,520
This is a mistake.

385
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,120
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.

386
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.

387
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,160
But I promise you this.

388
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,720
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!

389
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,240
- You've got to just kind of...
- Wayne, what are you talking about?

390
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
- What?
- I mean...

391
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm talking about blood and fire.

392
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,040
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.

393
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,800
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?

394
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?

395
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,040
- Yes.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

396
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,840
- My name is Mr. Happy.
- Mr. Happy.

397
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,080
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.

398
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,120
- Alex, please.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,720
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.

400
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,200
But you know when he's happiest?

401
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,600
- He's not always happy.
- When is he happy?

402
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,120
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.

403
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,040
I am going to say that to you.

404
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,160
- Now...
- Sit down before you hurt yourself.

405
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,280
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on

406
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,880
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.

407
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,400
<i>When a search of tax records
revealed that</i>

408
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,920
<i>Chris had given
his life savings to charity,</i>

409
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,440
<i>Mom and Dad became
what Dad called "mobilized."</i>

410
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,800
<i>They hired a private investigator and
notified law enforcement nationwide,</i>

411
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,400
<i>determined to track him down.</i>

412
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,040
<i>I just figured he'd be with gypsies,
far from the eyes of the law.</i>

413
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,280
These are those free satellite TV deals.

414
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,160
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.

415
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,640
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?

416
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,840
I'm probably gonna get like a.22,
I think. A.22 caliber rifle.

417
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,360
All right, then.

418
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,480
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.

419
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,560
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure

420
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,560
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.

421
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,120
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.

422
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,960
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.

423
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,040
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.

424
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,800
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,

425
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,360
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.

426
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,400
You got me. You got me.

427
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,400
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.

428
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,040
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.

429
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,240
- Impressive turn-out.
- Yeah.

430
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,280
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.

431
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,040
- Let's go.
- Sorry, boys.

432
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,280
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.

433
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,000
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.

434
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,640
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.

435
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,440
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.

436
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,240
<i>The year Chris graduated high school,</i>

437
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,560
<i>he bought the Datsun used
and drove it cross-country.</i>

438
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,920
<i>He stayed away most of the summer.</i>

439
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,920
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.

440
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,280
Can you spray it?

441
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,360
<i>As soon as I heard he was home,
I ran into his room to talk to him.</i>

442
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,440
<i>In California,
he'd looked up some old family friends.</i>

443
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,840
<i>He discovered that our parents' stories
of how they fell in love and got married</i>

444
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,640
<i>were calculated lies
masking an ugly truth.</i>

445
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,400
<i>When they met,
Dad was already married.</i>

446
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,520
<i>And even after Chris was born,</i>

447
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,360
<i>Dad had had another son
with his first wife, Marcia,</i>

448
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,160
<i>to whom he was still legally married.</i>

449
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,040
<i>This fact suddenly re-defined
Chris and me as bastard children.</i>

450
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,040
<i>Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused.</i>

451
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,600
<i>And Mom, in the shame and
embarrassment of a young mistress,</i>

452
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,560
<i>became his accomplice in deceit.</i>

453
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,360
<i>The fragility of crystal is not
a weakness but a fineness.</i>

454
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,520
<i>My parents understood that
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for</i>

455
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,920
<i>or it may be shattered.</i>

456
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,080
<i>But when it came to my brother,
they did not seem to know or care</i>

457
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,320
<i>that their course of secret action</i>

458
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,280
<i>brought the kind of devastation
that could cut them.</i>

459
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,360
<i>Their fraudulent marriage
and our father's denial of this other son</i>

460
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,640
<i>was, for Chris,
a murder of every day's truth.</i>

461
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,400
<i>He felt his whole life turn,
like a river suddenly reversing</i>

462
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,360
<i>the direction of its flow,
suddenly running uphill.</i>

463
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,240
<i>These revelations struck at the core
of Chris' sense of identity.</i>

464
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,200
<i>They made his entire childhood
seem like fiction.</i>

465
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,840
<i>Chris never told them he knew</i>

466
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,480
<i>and made me promise silence, as well.</i>

467
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,360
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?

468
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?

469
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,800
Can I help you?

470
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,240
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,

471
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,400
where's the best place to launch out of?

472
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,560
Hang on a second.

473
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,760
"To launch out of?"
What's your experience level?

474
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,000
- Not much.
- Any? Do you have a permit?

475
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,000
A permit? Permit for what?

476
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,800
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.

477
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,160
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,

478
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,080
and I'll put you on the wait-list.

479
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,720
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.

480
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,280
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?

481
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,680
That's right.

482
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,160
- Yeah, it's gonna be...
- Well, how long do I have to wait?

483
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,640
Yeah, hang on a second.

484
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,600
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you

485
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,880
or it's gonna be me, you and her.

486
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,320
Next available is May 17th, 2003.

487
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,040
Great. Done. The three of us, then.

488
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,640
Twelve years?

489
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,960
- What's that?
- Twelve years?

490
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,640
To paddle down a river.

491
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,440
Let me call you back.

492
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,840
You can do that,

493
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,880
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.

494
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,680
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,

495
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,200
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.

496
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,560
Thank you very much.

497
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,440
Helmet, man!

498
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,440
I'm Supertramp!

499
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,240
<i>"If we admit that human life
can be ruled by reason,</i>

500
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
<i>"the possibility of life is destroyed."</i>

501
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,120
Hello!

502
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,600
Hello.

503
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,640
Come. Join us.

504
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,280
We have hot dogs.

505
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,520
- I'm Mads.
- Mads?

506
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,160
- Mads. Hi.
- Mads.

507
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,960
- Alex.
- Hi, Alex.

508
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,000
Hey. I'm Sonja.

509
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,280
Hey, Alex.

510
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,680
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.

511
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,600
I am.

512
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,560
- You're crazy! You're crazy, man.
- My God!

513
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,520
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.

514
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,680
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.

515
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,720
I love this. Don't you love this?

516
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,160
You know, this is nature.

517
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,720
So where are you going?

518
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,800
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

519
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,120
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.

520
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,240
So good to meet you.

521
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,200
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.

522
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,960
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.

523
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,360
- The universe is very good.
- You know what I mean?

524
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,600
- Yeah.
- The whole universe.

525
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,880
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.

526
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,760
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.

527
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,400
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.

528
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

529
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,880
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around

530
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,280
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,

531
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,600
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!

532
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

533
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,160
Come on, come on!

534
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,880
She's so slow sometimes.

535
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,240
- Here's the map.
- But I like her.

536
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,800
- Here. Hoover Dam.
- Okay.

537
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,200
About 330 kilometers, I think.

538
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,080
- Miles?
- Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.

539
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,040
- Two hundred miles.
- Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.

540
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,920
You know, I wonder if I could paddle

541
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,040
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.

542
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.

543
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,720
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.

544
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,960
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.

545
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,600
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.

546
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,280
Oh, man.

547
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,000
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

548
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,880
- What's going on?
- Why?

549
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,440
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.

550
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,040
You have to have, like, a permit,

551
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,640
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.

552
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,520
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,

553
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,440
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?

554
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,520
Okay.

555
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,960
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.

556
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,000
Take care, man.

557
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,080
- All right. Take care, Mads.
- Nice to meet you.

558
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,000
- Bye, Alex.
- I wish... I wish I could stay.

559
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,240
Say hello to Mexico from me.

560
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,680
Bye, Alex!

561
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,440
<i>It would be Christmas
in a couple of months,</i>

562
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,240
<i>and the last news we'd had
was about his car being found.</i>

563
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,080
<i>I woke up a couple of days ago,
and for the first time, it bothered me</i>

564
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,440
<i>that it wasn't only my parents
who hadn't heard from Chris.</i>

565
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,600
Honey?

566
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,040
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.

567
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,400
Give me another chance.

568
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,520
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.

569
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,640
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,

570
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,200
and I ain't got it, so will you hurry it up?

571
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,520
Come on now, don't hang up on me.

572
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,280
Hey, here's a quarter.

573
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,600
Thank you.

574
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,480
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,

575
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,800
so I'm on here talking to you again.

576
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,320
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!

577
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,640
<i>I wondered why he hadn't tried to call
in case I might answer.</i>

578
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,360
<i>He could've hung up if it wasn't me.</i>

579
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,960
<i>Why wouldn't he send a letter,
maybe through a friend?</i>

580
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,600
<i>It hurt a little,</i>

581
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,440
<i>but I told myself it was good.</i>

582
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,080
<i>He knew I loved him enough
to bear with the not knowing.</i>

583
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,280
<i>And it helped me remember that there
was something more than rebellion,</i>

584
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,080
<i>more than anger that was driving him.</i>

585
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,920
<i>Chris had always been driven,
had always been an adventurer.</i>

586
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,360
<i>When he was four years old,</i>

587
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,240
<i>he once wandered six blocks away
from home at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

588
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,920
<i>He was found in a neighbor's kitchen</i>

589
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,080
<i>up on a chair,
digging through their candy drawer.</i>

590
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:31,160
<i>Whatever drawer he was opening now
must have something pretty sweet in it.</i>

591
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,360
<i>- You lived in a cave for 36 days?
- Yes, sir.</i>

592
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,400
<i>And how did you get into Mexico
in the first place?</i>

593
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,920
<i>Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.</i>

594
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,320
<i>River dries out pretty quickly
beyond there, doesn't it?</i>

595
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,960
<i>Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation
canals, thanks to our dams up north.</i>

596
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,120
<i>So I ported my kayak over the desert,
and I hitched down to Golfo.</i>

597
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,240
<i>But after a few weeks, a sandstorm
came up and blew the kayak away.</i>

598
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,840
<i>So I walked back north. Here I am.</i>

599
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,480
<i>Well, you just can't be crossing
the borders without any identification.</i>

600
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,400
- Are we understood?
- Yes, sir.

601
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,800
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.

602
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,480
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.

603
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,720
<i>Some may ask,
"Why act now? Why not wait?"</i>

604
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,080
<i>The answer is clear.
The world could wait no longer.</i>

605
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,320
Hi. Do you have the time?

606
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,200
- Time?
- Time?

607
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,440
Yeah.

608
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,080
Okay.

609
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,600
Front and back.

610
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,560
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.

611
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,200
- Next.
- Hi.

612
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,760
Can you tell me how to get an ID?

613
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,560
- Did you lose your identification, sir?
- Yeah.

614
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,080
No birth certificate? Nothing?

615
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,640
Ouch.

616
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,280
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.

617
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:43,480
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,

618
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,400
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.

619
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,480
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.

620
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,120
- Okay.
- What's your name?

621
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,680
- Alexander Supertramp.
- What's that?

622
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,440
- Alexander Supertramp.
- Supertramp. Really?

623
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,600
Yeah.

624
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,280
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.

625
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,040
- Here you go, Supertramp.
- Thank you very much.

626
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,320
Okay, baby.

627
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,320
- And one last thing.
- Yeah.

628
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,520
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...

629
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,240
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.

630
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:27,280
You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.
Now, I'm out of...

631
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,120
- What's going on back there?
- I got it. I'm sorry.

632
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,440
- Come on, now. Work with me.
- All right. Thanks, ma'am.

633
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,720
Supertramp, huh?

634
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,400
You know the drill.

635
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,720
Move it!

636
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,920
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.

637
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,080
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!

638
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,360
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.

639
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,600
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.

640
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,480
This is the goddamned railroad,

641
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,160
and we will do whatever we have to do

642
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,560
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.

643
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,840
Yes, sir.

644
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,000
You got any ID?

645
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,360
- No, sir.
- Of course you don't.

646
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,920
Last time, my friend.

647
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,280
All clear.

648
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,320
Good boy!

649
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,640
<i>Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Finally!</i>

650
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,680
<i>It's a mystery to me</i>

651
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,640
<i>We have a greed
With which we have agreed</i>

652
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:21,680
<i>You think you have to want more
than you need</i>

653
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,320
<i>Until you have it all you won't be freed</i>

654
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,320
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

655
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,560
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

656
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,680
<i>When you want more than you have
You think you need</i>

657
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,400
<i>And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed</i>

658
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,040
<i>I think I need to find a bigger place</i>

659
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,440
<i>'Cause when you have
more than you think</i>

660
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,640
<i>You need more space</i>

661
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,080
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

662
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,320
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

663
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,040
<i>Society, crazy indeed</i>

664
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:32,840
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

665
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,760
Thanks a lot.

666
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,440
<i>In the letters
Chris wrote me from college,</i>

667
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
<i>it was clear his anguish and problems
with Mom and Dad had continued.</i>

668
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,880
<i>He said I was
the only person in the world</i>

669
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,520
<i>who could possibly understand
what he had to say.</i>

670
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,480
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?

671
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,880
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because

672
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,520
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.

673
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,000
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!

674
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,040
You don't care at all about what I do!

675
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,880
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!

676
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,880
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!

677
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,760
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!

678
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,160
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!

679
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,160
Fuck you! I hate you!

680
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,440
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.

681
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,720
<i>Cancel Christmas?
Who do you think you are? God?</i>

682
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,520
<i>That's right! I'm God!</i>

683
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,320
<i>Well, you're not God.
You can't cancel Christmas.</i>

684
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,880
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

685
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,640
We're 10 deep!

686
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,840
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.

687
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,560
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,

688
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,720
but you've got to start wearing socks.

689
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,920
<i>With almost a year having passed
since Chris' disappearance,</i>

690
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,680
<i>my parents' anger, their desperation,</i>

691
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,960
<i>their guilt was giving way to pain.</i>

692
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,360
<i>And pain seemed to bring them closer.</i>

693
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,720
<i>Even their faces had changed.</i>

694
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,200
<i>She convinces herself it's Chris,</i>

695
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,920
<i>that it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.</i>

696
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,760
<i>That it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.</i>

697
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,760
<i>And I fear for the mother in her.</i>

698
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:56,040
<i>Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge</i>

699
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,640
<i>and irrevocable that the mind balks
at taking its measure.</i>

700
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,160
<i>I'd begin to wonder if I can understand
all that Chris is saying any longer,</i>

701
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,080
<i>but I catch myself and remember that</i>

702
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,440
<i>these are not the parents
he grew up with,</i>

703
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,080
<i>but people softened by the forced
reflection that comes with loss.</i>

704
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,360
<i>Still, everything Chris is saying
has to be said.</i>

705
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,760
<i>And I trust for him that
everything he is doing has to be done.</i>

706
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,040
<i>This is our life.</i>

707
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,440
Big game. Very big game.

708
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,040
Got it.

709
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,720
Damn it!

710
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,160
Get off!

711
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,640
"Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,
please, Dad, this time?"

712
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,640
"Well, Son,
you can go get the lighter fluid."

713
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,080
"Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"

714
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,240
"Well, why not, Walt?
That sounds like a good idea..."

715
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,120
"Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!

716
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,520
"No, Billie. I told you once.
Don't make me tell you again. Okay?

717
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,440
"Okay?

718
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,320
"You hear me? You hear me, woman?

719
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,240
<i>"You hear me, woman? Huh?
You hear me, woman?"</i>

720
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:54,680
<i>"Sorry. Sorry, Walt. I'm sorry."</i>

721
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,520
Shit.

722
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:21,160
No! No! Damn it!

723
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,240
<i>God damn it! Fuck!</i>

724
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,680
<i>"There was clearly felt the presence of
a force not bound to be kind to man.</i>

725
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,280
<i>"It was a place of heathenism
and superstitious rites,</i>

726
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,840
<i>"to be inhabited by men
nearer of kin to the rocks</i>

727
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,480
<i>"and to the wild animals than we."</i>

728
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,400
Sunni.

729
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,800
Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.

730
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,640
No. No!

731
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,080
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.

732
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,680
- Yeah.
- Alaska.

733
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,440
<i>All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!</i>

734
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,080
<i>Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>

735
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,760
<i>Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>

736
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,000
<i>Hey. My name's Tracy.</i>

737
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,760
- Tracy!
- Yeah!

738
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,120
Jack London is king.

739
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,280
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?

740
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,120
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job

741
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,440
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.

742
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,240
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.

743
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,680
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.

744
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,640
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find

745
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,920
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.

746
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,080
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.

747
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,560
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.

748
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,720
So, I might get another job
or I might be okay.

749
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the days you spend in the booth here.

750
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,720
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.

751
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,000
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.

752
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,160
You two look like you're doing good.

753
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,360
- We are doing good.
- Yeah?

754
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,560
We're doing real good.

755
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,120
Speaking of which, don't you think

756
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:24,360
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?

757
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,560
I...

758
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,720
You selling these books?

760
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,680
I am. We are.

761
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,160
He was.

762
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,240
I like to read.

763
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,440
- Do you?
- Yeah.

764
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,840
That's good.

765
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:33,520
I heard you play your song last night.

766
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:39,240
- I'm terrible.
- You are not terrible. You sing sweet.

767
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,320
Thank you.

768
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,600
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.

769
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,920
- You wanna go?
- Okay.

770
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,320
- Hi.
- Hi. Alex.

771
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:07,600
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.

772
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,960
A lot of tourists come in here

773
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,680
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.

774
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,360
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.

775
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,880
Where did you get the telephone poles?

776
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,720
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.

777
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,240
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.

778
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,440
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.

779
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,960
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.

780
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,640
You really believe in love, then.

781
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah. Totally.

782
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:43,320
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.

783
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,160
That God really loves us a lot.

784
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,600
Does that answer that?

785
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,200
- Yeah.
- Good.

786
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:56,200
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.

787
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,040
To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,
unless I had to.

788
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,320
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.

789
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,840
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there

790
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,400
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War II.

791
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,480
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.

792
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,640
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.

793
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,080
You're doing real good.

794
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,600
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.

795
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,480
This is starting to make me hungry.

796
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,160
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.

797
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,360
- Wow.
- Yeah.

798
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,040
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth

799
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,480
and babies and love
and stay together forever,

800
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,680
and that didn't quite work out that way.

801
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,240
He left me.

802
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,840
So, I...

803
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,720
Anyway, whatever,

804
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,640
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.

805
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,840
Then I met Rainey.

806
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,880
That was sweet.
It was really good for a while. It's just...

807
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,160
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,

808
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,360
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.

809
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,040
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.

810
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,760
I don't even know where he is.

811
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,600
I hope I get to meet him sometime.

812
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,240
Do your folks know where you are?

813
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,920
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.

814
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,600
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.

815
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,560
I'll be all right.

816
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,560
You want to come and eat?

817
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,400
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.

818
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,920
Let's go. Let's go.

819
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,440
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.

820
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,880
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.

821
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,280
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.

822
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:45,240
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.

823
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,520
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

824
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,720
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

825
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,160
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.

826
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,800
You planning on seeing yours?

827
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,200
I've only got one plan, Rainey.

828
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,800
That would be Alaska?

829
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,360
Alaska.

830
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,520
Hello?

831
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,040
- Merry Christmas.
- Come in here.

832
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,800
My parents went into town.

833
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,360
No.

834
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,720
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.

835
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,440
No, I mean we can't do that.

836
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,800
Why not?

837
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,240
How old are you?

838
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,360
Eighteen.

839
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,800
Seventeen.

840
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,440
What year were you born?

841
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,560
So I'm 16.

842
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,440
You want to do something together?

843
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,840
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.

844
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:56,600
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.

845
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,440
You're pretty magic.

846
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

847
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,560
And just remember

848
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,200
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.

849
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,600
- You take care, kiddo.
- You, too.

850
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,760
- New Year's resolution?
- We'll work on it.

851
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,520
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?

852
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,920
I don't think I could take a hug.

853
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:06,960
Hey.

854
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,040
Bye!

855
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,680
<i>A year and a half had passed in what
Dad called "suspended animation."</i>

856
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,600
<i>The weight of Chris' disappearance had
begun to lay down on me full-length.</i>

857
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,640
"I have lived through much,

858
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:09,240
"and now I think I have found what is
needed for happiness.

859
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,520
"A quiet secluded life in the country,

860
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,880
"with the possibility of being useful to
people to whom it is easy to do good,

861
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,920
"and who are not accustomed
to have it done to them.

862
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,680
<i>"And work which one hopes
may be of some use.</i>

863
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,400
"Then rest, nature, books, music,

864
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,040
"love for one's neighbor.

865
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,160
"Such is my idea of happiness.

866
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:55,280
<i>"And then, on top of all that,
you for a mate,</i>

867
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,320
<i>"and children perhaps.</i>

868
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:02,800
<i>"What more
can the heart of a man desire?"</i>

869
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:15,040
<i>Comes the morning when I can feel</i>

870
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:19,280
<i>That there's nothing
left to be concealed</i>

871
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,640
<i>Moving on
a scene surreal</i>

872
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:29,560
<i>But my heart will never
Never be far from here</i>

873
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,800
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

874
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,400
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

875
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,160
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

876
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:42,720
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

877
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:46,320
<i>And there's a reason I will</i>

878
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,400
<i>A reason I'll be back</i>

879
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:58,080
<i>As I walk the hemisphere</i>

880
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,320
<i>I got my wish to up and disappear</i>

881
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:06,600
<i>I've been wounded
I've been healed</i>

882
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,680
<i>Now for landing I've been</i>

883
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,560
<i>Landing I've been cleared</i>

884
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:17,000
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

885
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,240
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

886
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:25,600
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

887
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:29,520
<i>This love has got no ceiling</i>

888
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,120
Where's your camp?

889
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,320
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

890
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,080
I've lived in and around here
for six years now

891
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,600
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.

892
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,520
- Show me how to get there.
- Yeah.

893
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,520
- Ron Franz.
- Alex.

894
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,440
Alex? Where you from, Alex?

895
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,120
- West Virginia.
- Okay, Alex from West Virginia.

896
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,880
Well, this is something out here.

897
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,760
Don't you...

898
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:55,280
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?

899
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:59,000
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.

900
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,240
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?

901
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,760
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.

902
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,480
Well, that's what I mean.

903
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,960
How long you been out here?

904
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,640
- Couple of weeks.
- And before that?

905
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:22,120
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.

906
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:26,280
- Well, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

907
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,400
Twenty-three years old!

908
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,360
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?

909
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:34,280
And a job?
And making something of this life?

910
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,920
Look, Mr. Franz,

911
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,760
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.

912
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,360
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.

913
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:52,600
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.

914
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:58,400
- In the dirt?
- Yeah, in the dirt.

915
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,080
- Where's your family?
- Don't have one anymore.

916
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,760
That's a shame.

917
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,560
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.

918
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,440
Come on.

919
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,280
Come on.

920
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:52,040
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.

921
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,920
All right,

922
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,280
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?

923
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,880
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.

924
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,880
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?

925
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,360
Yes, sir.

926
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,480
My goodness.

927
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:18,160
- You don't want to go up?
- Nope. I don't do these kind of things.

928
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,920
I spent most of my life in the Army.

929
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:31,200
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.

930
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:36,520
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,

931
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,960
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.

932
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,440
Killed them both.

933
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:51,560
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world

934
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:55,960
is go to the whiskey.

935
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:01,680
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.

936
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,240
And I did it hard!

937
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,520
But pretty soon I realized

938
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:14,320
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.

939
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:18,600
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,

940
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,560
cold turkey.

941
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:26,000
So since all that, this is pretty much me.

942
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,360
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

943
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,320
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.

944
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,360
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.

945
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,840
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.

946
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,360
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,

947
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,920
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.

948
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,320
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.

949
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,760
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah.

950
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,560
I was hoping you'd say that.

951
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,480
- It's amazing how malleable this is.
- Yeah, it is.

952
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,200
When the leather is wet you can really...

953
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,560
- It's like butter.
- Yeah.

954
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:04,000
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.

955
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:52,640
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.

956
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,080
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator

957
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,560
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.

958
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,200
So I took the Colorado River

959
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:01,440
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,

960
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:05,000
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.

961
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:10,240
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.

962
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,360
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.

963
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
What's the "N" stand for?

964
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,680
North.

965
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,520
Alaska?

966
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,800
Son, what the hell
are you running from?

967
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,280
You know, I can ask you
the same question!

968
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:34,560
Except I already know the answer!

969
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,840
You do, do you?

970
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,600
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!

971
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,480
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.

972
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:49,400
Get back out on the road! Really!

973
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,800
You're going to live a long time, Ron!

974
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,000
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!

975
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:00,400
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

976
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,960
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.

977
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,760
- Sitting on my butt?
- Yeah.

978
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:14,480
I'll show you sitting on my butt!

979
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,520
"Stubborn old man."

980
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,520
I'll show you!

981
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,160
Come on, then! Come on.

982
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,960
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.

983
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,080
Come on, old man. Come climbing.

984
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,800
Sitting on my butt.

985
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,560
Come on. Keep going!

986
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,880
You're doing great!

987
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,040
- Keep going. Keep going, Ron!
- Yeah!

988
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,360
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?

989
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:02,240
Yeah.

990
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:09,320
- You all right?
- You little pinhead!

991
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,360
I'm gonna miss you when you go.

992
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,480
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think

993
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:37,360
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.

994
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,560
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.

995
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,880
It's in anything we can experience.

996
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,080
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.

997
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,280
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.

998
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:52,320
No, I am.

999
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:56,720
I am.

1000
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,400
I am.

1001
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,800
But I wanted to tell you something.

1002
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,040
From the bits and pieces I put together,

1003
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:12,040
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.

1004
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,200
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.

1005
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,600
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,

1006
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,640
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.

1007
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,280
But when you forgive,

1008
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:38,640
you love.

1009
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,160
And when you love,

1010
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,440
God's light shines on you.

1011
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,520
- Holy shit.
- I told you about that language.

1012
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,720
I told you so!

1013
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:13,880
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

1014
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:18,040
I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!

1015
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,000
<i>"For a moment she rediscovered
the purpose of her life.</i>

1016
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,440
<i>"She was here on earth to grasp
the meaning of its wild enchantment,</i>

1017
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:45,200
<i>"and to call each thing
by its right name."</i>

1018
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:50,000
"By its right name."

1019
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:52,960
What is this? What is this one?

1020
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:00,640
<i>This is Viburnum edule.
Viburnum edule.</i>

1021
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:08,160
<i>Hedysarum alpinum.</i>

1022
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:14,680
<i>Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.
Wild potato root.</i>

1023
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:20,360
<i>Epilobium angustifolium. Fireweed.</i>

1024
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,360
Fuck it all. Fuck it all!

1025
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,280
Hi.

1026
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,400
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1027
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:50,800
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.

1028
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:55,600
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.

1029
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:04,360
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,

1030
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:09,600
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.

1031
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:14,600
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.

1032
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:18,200
- Ron, you don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

1033
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,920
Get you started on this thing of yours.

1034
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,320
- On my great...
- I know.

1035
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,400
On your great Alaskan adventure.

1036
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,800
Here. Here's a machete.

1037
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:37,640
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.

1038
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,280
- Ron...
- Just take it.

1039
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:47,320
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.

1040
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,840
Well, my friend.

1041
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:46,240
Yep.

1042
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,880
I had an idea.

1043
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:58,400
You know, my mother was an only child

1044
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:01,000
and so was my father,

1045
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:05,720
and I was their only child,

1046
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,560
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.

1047
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,600
My family will be finished.

1048
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:23,240
What do you say you let me adopt you?

1049
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:31,360
I can be, say, your grandfather.

1050
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:37,120
Ron,

1051
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:42,320
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?

1052
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,360
Would that be okay?

1053
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:54,480
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.

1054
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,480
All right, Ron.

1055
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,040
Thank you.

1056
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,280
<i>What did his voice sound like now?</i>

1057
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,600
<i>What would he tell about now?</i>

1058
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:00,040
...nine, ten.

1059
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:52,400
<i>I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning.</i>

1060
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,520
<i>Chris was writing his story,</i>

1061
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:58,800
<i>and it had to be Chris who would tell it.</i>

1062
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:16,160
<i>"To call each thing by its right name.</i>

1063
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,480
<i>"By its right name."</i>

1064
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:13,520
<i>What if I were smiling</i>

1065
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,160
<i>and running into your arms?</i>

1066
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,520
<i>Would you see then</i>
