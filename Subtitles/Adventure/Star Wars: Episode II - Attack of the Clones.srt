00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,575
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,701
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,888
[ Droid Beeping ]

4
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,270
[ Grunts ]
We made it.

5
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,445
[ Man ]
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,777
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,528
Cordé.

8
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:48,573
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,801
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:53,869
No.

11
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:58,173
Milady, you're still
in danger here.

12
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,482
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:12,155
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,226
Senator Amidala,
please.

15
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:31,540
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,710
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,221
- If they do break away--
- I will not let this Republic...

18
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:41,919
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

19
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:45,224
My negotiations
will not fail.

20
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:49,859
If they do,you must realize
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

21
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,495
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

23
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:00,305
Do you think it will
really come to war?

24
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,110
Hmm, the dark side
clouds everything.

25
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:11,178
Impossible to see

26
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:16,188
[ Speaking Huttese ]
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

27
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,025
- Good.
- [ Huttese ]

28
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:22,032
Send them in.

29
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,602
We will discuss
this matter later.

30
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:33,076
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform--

31
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,203
terrible.

32
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,977
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

33
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,814
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

34
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,516
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

35
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,492
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

36
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,497
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

37
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,693
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

38
00:05:56,802 --> 00:06:00,169
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

39
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,832
But for certain,
Senator...

40
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,775
in grave danger you are.

41
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,847
Master Jedi,
may I suggest...

42
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,849
the senator
be placed...

43
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,044
under the protection
of your graces.

44
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:18,419
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,424
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

46
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:23,359
The situation
is that serious?

47
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,430
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,898
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,231
might be
disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:35,466
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

51
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:39,408
An old friend,
like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,775
That's possible.

53
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,644
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,944
Do it for me, milady.
Please?

55
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,453
The thought
of losing you...

56
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,258
is unbearable.

57
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:57,157
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,598
[ Senator Amidala ]
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,502
You seem
a little on edge.

60
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,602
- Not at all.
- I haven't felt you this tense...

61
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,943
since we fell into
that nest of gundarks.

62

[ Scoffs ] You fell into
that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:22,983
and I rescued you,
remember?

64
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:26,114
Oh...yes.

You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

68

I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

76

Ani? My goodness,
you've grown.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,510
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

78
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,313
Well, f-for a senator,
I mean.

79
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,819
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

80
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:38,852
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

81
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:41,398
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,593
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

83
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,829
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

84
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,702
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

85
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,503
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

86
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,840
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

87
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:57,746
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

88
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,249
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

89
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:03,446
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate...

90
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,455
my young Padawan learner.

91
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,082
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.

92
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,718
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

93
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,627
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

94
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:16,724
What?

95
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:20,566
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

96
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,937
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

97
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,909
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

98
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:30,277
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

99
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,777
And you will learn
your place, young one.

100
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:41,282
Perhaps with
merely your presence...

101
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,328
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

102
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:47,193
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

103
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,267
I will retire.

104
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:52,604
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

105
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:56,663
I'll have an officer stationed
on every foor, and I'll be in
the control center downstairs.

seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:04,841
She hardly even
recognized me,Jar Jar.

108
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,386
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

109
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,747
she's forgotten me completely.

You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,667
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,760
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:36,840
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:39,508
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,348
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

117
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,319
Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,517
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:55,129
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.

120
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,759
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

121
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,806
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

122

- [ Beeping ]
- What's going on?

123
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,376
Ah, she covered
the cameras.

124
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,538
I don't think
she liked me watching her.

125
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:11,548
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,676
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

[ Obi-Wan ] There are many
other ways to kill a senator.

128

[ Anakin ] I know, but we also want to
catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,054
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,257
It was her idea.

131
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,891
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,994
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133

Trust me.

134
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,739
It's too risky.

that attuned, my young apprentice.

about Padmé.

Just being around her again
is... intoxicating.

with the open cockpit and
the right speed capabilities.

173
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:35,368
If you spent as much time
practicing your saber techniques
as you do your wit...

174
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:37,498
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

175
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:41,409
- I thought I already did.
- Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

I forgot you
don't like fying.

I don't mind fying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

have I told you-- Ah!--

- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- stay away from power couplings!

He went that way.

184
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,639
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

185

that creep is gonna
end up deep-fried...

186

like to find out who he is
and who he's working for.

This is a shortcut.
I think.

That was some shortcut,
Anakin.

191
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,728
He went completely
the other way.

- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.

- It's worse.

consulting either myself or the council.

your speed, Master Jedi.

00:31:57,528 --> 00:32:00,497
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

339
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,562
Hey, old buddy!

340
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:10,799
[ Both Laughing ]

341
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:16,604
Ohhh.
[ Coughs ]

342
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:20,047
So, my friend,
what can I do for ya?

343
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,983
You can tell me
what this is.

344
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:26,352
Well, whattaya know!

345
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,823
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

346
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:32,157
on Subterrel,
beyond the outer rim.

347
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:34,730
[ Obi-Wan ] Can you tell me
where it came from? Thank you.

348
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:37,801
[ Dex ] This baby
belongs to them cloners.

349
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:42,201
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

350
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:45,298
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

351
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:48,708
It's these funny little cuts
on the side that give it away.

352
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:52,748
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!

353
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,114
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

354
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:57,414
for the difference
between knowledge and...

355
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:00,354
[ Laughing ]
wisdom.

356
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:03,824
Well, if droids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?

357
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,591
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

358
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,666
No, no. It's beyond
the outer rim.

359
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:13,362
I'd say about,
uh, 12 parsecs...

360
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,370
outside the Rishi Maze.

361
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,407
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

362
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,875
[ Chuckles ]

363
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:25,745
These, uh, Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

364
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,716
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

365
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:33,288
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.

366
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,324
Depends on what, Dex?

367
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:38,293
On how good
your manners are...

368
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:40,659
and how big your, uh...

369
00:33:40,764 --> 00:33:43,733
pocketbook is.

370
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,166
[ Chuckling ]

371
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:49,104
Hmm.

372
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:54,603
Did you call
for assistance?

373
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:58,374
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having
a problem, Master Kenobi?

374
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,781
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

375
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:04,149
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

376
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:08,554
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

377
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,025
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

378
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:14,120
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

379
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:16,290
just south
of the Rishi Maze.

380
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:20,867
[ Beeping ]

381
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,573
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

382
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:28,577
doesn't exist.

383
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,944
Impossible. Perhaps the archives
are incomplete.

384
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,109
If an item does not appear
in our records...

385
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,312
it does not exist.

386
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:01,601
- Hey, you! No droids!
- [ Beeping ]

387
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:04,909
- Get outta here!
- [ Raspberries ]

388
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:11,414
- [ Beeping ]
- Thank you, R2.

389
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:16,016
- [ Chirping ]
- Must be difficult, having
sworn your life to the Jedi...

390
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:20,028
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

391
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,257
Or be with the people
that I love.

392
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:24,994
Are you allowed to love?

393
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:27,161
I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.

394
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,005
Attachment is forbidden.

395
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,711
Possession is forbidden.

396
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:40,374
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

397
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:42,952
is central
to a Jedi's life.

398
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:49,791
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

399
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:54,489
- You've changed so much.
- Ah, you haven't changed a bit.

400
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,431
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

we have.

Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

406

Hello. I'm sorry
to disturb you, Master.

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,566
What help can I be,
Obi-Wan? Hmm?

408
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,574
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

409
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:42,839
I trust him, but the systems
don't show on the archive maps.

410
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:47,246
Mmm. Lost a planet
Master Obi-Wan has.

411
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,251
- How embarrassing.
-[ Children Giggling ]

412
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:51,981
How embarrassing.

413
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:54,785
Hmm?
Liam, the shades.

414
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,627
Gather round
the map reader.

415
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,890
Clear your minds...

416
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:04,456
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

417
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,832
It ought to be... here...

418
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,839
but it isn't.

419
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:14,377
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

420
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:18,073
Hmm. Gravity's
silhouette remains...

421
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,150
but the star
and all the planets...

422
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,242
disappeared they have.

423
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,378
How can this be?

424
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,650
Hmm? A thought?

425
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:32,992
-[ Yoda ] Anyone.
-[ Boy ] Master?

426
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,997
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

427
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,234
[ Yoda Chuckles ]

428
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:43,466
Truly wonderful
the mind of a child is.

429
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:46,041
[ Chuckling ]

430
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:48,338
The Padawan is right.

431
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:51,505
Go to the center
of gravity's pull...

432
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:55,107
and find your planet
you will.

433
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:03,826
Hmm. The data
must have been erased.

434
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,691
But, Master Yoda, who could
empty information from the archives?

435
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,697
That's impossible, isn't it?

436
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,200
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

437
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:16,671
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

438
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:20,209
But who and why,
harder to answer.

439
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:24,838
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.

440
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,304
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

441
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:55,003
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

442
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm not sure
I was ready.

443
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,377
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

444
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:04,147
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution
so you could stay in office.

445
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,916
I was relieved when
my two terms were up.

446
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:10,720
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

447
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:13,022
I couldn't refuse her.

448
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,463
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

449
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:20,729
I'm glad that you
chose to serve.

450
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,678
[ Padmé ] If the senate
votes to create an army...

451
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,238
- I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.
- [ Man ] It's unthinkable.

452
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,751
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

453
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,344
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

454
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:41,549
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

455
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:43,853
Not if they feel threatened.

456
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,327
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

457
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:51,800
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

458
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:55,702
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

459
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:59,799
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

460
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,106
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

461
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:15,056
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

462
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:17,854
Let's pray that day
never comes.

463
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,623
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

464
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,722
What is your suggestion,
Master Jedi?

465
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,734
Oh, Anakin's
not a Jedi yet.

466
00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:27,861
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking--

467
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:30,531
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

468
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,074
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

469
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,406
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

470
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,572
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

471
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:42,311
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

472
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:46,913
I think it would be wise
if you took advantage of
my knowledge in this instance.

473
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,192
Sorry, milady.

474
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,523
[ Queen Jamillia ]
Perfect. It's settled, then.

475
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:14,177
There it is, R4, right where it
should be. Our missing planet Kamino.

476
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:16,115
[Whistling, Beeping ]

477
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:47,481
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

478
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:55,222
Master Jedi.

479
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,691
The prime minister
is expecting you.

480
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:01,329
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

481
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:04,492
He is anxious
to meet you.

482
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:06,762
After all these years...

483
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,499
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

484
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:12,802
Now, please, this way.

485
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:28,090
May I present Lama Su...

00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,250
prime minister of Kamino.

487
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:34,190
And this is Master Jedi--

488
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:36,197
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

489
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,598
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

490
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:43,005
Please.

491
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,869
And now to business.

492
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:50,913
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

493
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:53,915
200,000 units
are ready...

494
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:56,383
with a million more
well on the way.

495
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,454
That's good news.

496
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:02,719
Please tell
your Master Sifo-Dyas...

497
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:06,159
that his order
will be met on time.

498
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,253
I'm sorry. Master--

499
00:43:08,365 --> 00:43:13,234
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council...

500
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,236
is he not?

501
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:19,138
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

502
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:23,110
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

503
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:27,479
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

504
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:31,247
- The army?
- Yes.

505
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:36,018
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

506
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,117
Tell me, Prime Minister...

507
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,719
when my master
first contacted you about the army...

508
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,957
did-- did he say
who it was for?

509
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:45,091
Of course he did.

510
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:47,863
This army
is for the Republic.

511
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:52,340
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

512
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,969
That's why I'm here.

513
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,926
We used to come here
for school retreat.

514
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:22,797
We would swim
to that island every day.

515
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:26,075
I love the water.

516
00:44:30,814 --> 00:44:34,841
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

517
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:37,920
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

518
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,486
I don't like sand.

519
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:47,552
It's coarse and rough
and irritating...

520
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:49,632
and it gets everywhere.

521
00:44:51,835 --> 00:44:54,429
Not like here.

522
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:56,505
Here, everything is soft...

523
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,802
and smooth.

524
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,643
No.
[ Gasps ]

525
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,774
I shouldn't have done that.

526
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,488
I'm sorry.

527
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:02,964
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

528
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:08,600
[ Lama Su ]
Clones can think creatively.

529
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:12,613
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

530
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:21,785
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

531
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:25,258
This group was created
about five years ago.

532
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:27,420
[ Obi-Wan ] You mentioned
growth acceleration.

533
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,464
[ Lama Su ]
Oh,yes, it's essential.

534
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:32,592
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

535
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:35,296
Now we can do it
in half the time.

536
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,067
[ Obi-Wan ]
I see.

537
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:40,074
[ Lama Su ]
They are totally obedient...

538
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,872
taking any order
without question.

539
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:45,038
We modified
their genetic structure...

540
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:48,345
to make them less independent
than the original host.

541
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:51,011
And who was
the original host?

542
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,213
A bounty hunter
called Jango Fett.

543
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,918
And where is
this bounty hunter now?

544
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:59,153
Oh, we keep him here.

545
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,664
[ Lama Su ] Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

546
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:07,258
Fett demanded
only one thing:

547
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,964
an unaltered clone
for himself.

548
00:47:10,073 --> 00:47:12,507
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

549
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,134
[ Lama Su ]
Pure genetic replication.

550
00:47:15,245 --> 00:47:18,408
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

551
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:21,039
and no growth acceleration.

552
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,449
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

553
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:27,785
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

554
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:48,208
Magnificent, aren't they?

- I don't know.

Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

557
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:02,022
You gonna use one of
your Jedi mind tricks on me?

558
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,218
They only work
on the weak-minded.

559
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:08,821
All right.
I was 12.

560
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:12,163
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

561
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:15,328
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

562
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,804
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

563
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:20,171
All right, I get the picture.

564
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:22,176
Whatever happened to him?

565
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:25,247
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.

566
00:48:25,348 --> 00:48:29,546
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don't like politicians,
do you?

567
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:31,813
I like two or three...

about one of them.

I don't think
the system works.

How would you
have it work?

572
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:47,859
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

573
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:51,998
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

574
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,042
That's exactly
what we do.

575
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,134
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

576
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:58,145
Well, then they
should be made to.

577
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:02,149
- By whom? Who's gonna make them? You?
- I don't know. Someone.

578
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:04,583
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

579
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:06,587
Someone wise.

580
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:10,489
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:14,225
Well, if it works.

the creation of a clone army?

No. Whoever placed that order
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.
