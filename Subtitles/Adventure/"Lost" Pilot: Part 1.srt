[man] Help me!

11
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,406
Somebody, help me out.

12
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,272
Somebody, help me over here!

13

[engine whirring continues]

14
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,984
Somebody, help me out!

15
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,087
Oh, my God!

[man screaming indistinctly]

00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,175
Walt! Walt!

00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,475
- Stay away from the gas! Stay there!
- [screaming]

19
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,591
[man] Help! Help!

20
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,854
Somebody, help me!

21
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,704
[groaning] Oh, my leg!

22
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,144
Hey, get over here.
Give me a hand.

23
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,704
You, come on!
Come over here! Give me a hand!

24
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,716
On the count of three.

25
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,550
One, two, three!

26
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,373
[woman] Help! Please, help me!

27
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,773
Help me! Please, help me!

28
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,579
Get him out of here.
Get him away from the engine.

29
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,810
Get him out of here.

30
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,980
Help me!

31
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,651
Please, help me.
l'm having contractions!

32
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,752
- How many months pregnant are you?
- Only eight months.

33
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,265
- How far apart are they coming?
- l don't know, a few just happened!

34
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,002
Hey! Get away from there!

35
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,418
Listen to me! Look at me!
You're gonna be okay.

36
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,388
Do you understand me?
But you have to sit absolutely still.

37
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,595
Hey! You! Come here!

38
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,155
l need you to get this woman away
from these fumes. Take her there.

39
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,192
Stay with her. lf her contractions occur
closer than three minutes, call me!

40
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,705
- You gotta be kidding me.
- l'll be right back.

41
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,866
Thank you.

42
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,467
Hey! What's your name?

43
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,175
Jack!

44
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,550
Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough.
You're blowing into her stomach.

45
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,181
You sure? That's exactly what l was
doing. l'm a lifeguard. l'm licensed.

46
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,283
You need to think about
giving that license back.

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,730
Maybe we should do one of those hole
things. Stick the pen in the throat?

48
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,995
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.

49
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,707
Does anyone have any pens?
Do you have a pen?

50
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,901
- Does anybody have a pen?
- Come on!

51
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,040
Come on!

52
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,574
Come on! Come on!

53
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,149
[gasping]

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,156
Big deep breaths.
Big breaths.

55
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,624
[creaking]

56
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,973
Move! Move! Move!

57
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,976
Get her up! Get her out of there!

58
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,458
[people screaming indistinctly]

59
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,630
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,764
You?

61
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,402
- Stay with her.
- Dude, l'm not going anywhere.

62
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,024
l didn't know
which one would work best.

63
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,707
They're all good. Thanks.

64
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,076
[breathing heavily]

65
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,288
[grunting]

66
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,904
Excuse me.

67
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,371
Did you ever use a needle?

68
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,410
- What?
- Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?

69
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,820
l, uh...

70
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,760
- l made the drapes in my apartment.
- That's fantastic. Listen...

71
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,230
Do you have a second?
l could use a little help here.

72
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,232
Help with what?

73
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,764
With this. l'd do it myself,
l'm a doctor, but l just can't reach it.

74
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,107
- You want me to sew that?
- Like the drapes.

75
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,171
- l used a sewing machine.
- No, you can do this, l'm telling you.

76
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,114
lf you wouldn't mind.

77
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,793
- Of course l will.
- Thank you.

78
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,465
lt's for your hand.

79
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,235
Save me some... for the wound.

80
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,110
Any color preference?

81
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,047
[chuckling]

82
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,518
No. Standard black.

83
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,587
[groaning]

84
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,384
[beeping]

85
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,548
Come on.

86
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,321
Hey, you!

87
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,424
- What's your name?
- Me? Charlie.

88
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,461
Charlie, we need help with the fire.
No one will see it if it isn't big.

89
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,269
- Okay, l'm on it. What's your name?
- Sayid.

90
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,140
Sayid. l'm on it, Sayid.

91
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,948
l might throw up on you.

92
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,451
You're doing fine.

93
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,989
You don't seem afraid at all.

94
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,028
l don't understand that.

95
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,667
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.

96
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,574
When l was in residency,
my first solo procedure

97
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,019
was a spinal surgery
on a 1 6-year-old kid. A girl.

98
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:48,353
And at the end, after 1 3 hours,
l was closing her up and l...

99
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,959
l accidentally ripped her dural sack.

100
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,432
lt's at the base of the spine
where all the nerves come together.

101
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,766
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...

102
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,568
So it ripped open.

103
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,240
Nerves just spilled
out of her like angel hair pasta,

104
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,339
spinal fluid flowing
out of her and l...

105
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,713
The terror was just so...

106
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,423
...crazy, so real...

107
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,766
...and l knew l had to deal with it.

108
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,062
So l just made a choice.

109
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:36,164
l'd let the fear in.
Let it take over. Let it do its thing.

110
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,042
But only for five seconds,
that's all l was gonna give it.

111
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,342
So l started to count.

112
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,406
One, two,

113
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:50,353
three, four, five.

114
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,417
And it was gone.

115
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,857
l went back to work,
sewed her up and she was fine.

116
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:06,099
lf that had been me, l think
l would've run for the door.

117
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,671
No, l don't think that's true.

118
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,840
You're not running now.

119
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,064
You think they
would have come by now.

120
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,395
Hmm?

121
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,630
- Who?
- Anyone.

122
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,522
As if l'm gonna start eating chocolate.

123
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,623
- Shannon, we may be here for a while.
- The plane had a black box, idiot.

124
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,603
They know exactly where we are,
they're coming.

125
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,433
l'll eat on the rescue boat.

126
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,275
l'll eat on the rescue boat.

127
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,922
- Hungry?
- Yeah. Thanks.

128
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,830
Any more...
you know, baby stuff?

129
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,859
No... l'm okay.

130
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,607
- Well, hang in there.
- Yeah, you too.

131
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,952
You sure you're warm enough?

132
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,562
[man speaking Korean]

133
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,535
Do you think he's gonna live?

134
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Do you know him?

135
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,735
He was sitting next to me.

136
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,080
We must've been at about
40,000 feet when it happened.

137
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,321
We hit an air pocket and dropped...

138
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,694
...maybe 200 feet.

139
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,991
The turbulence was...

140
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,803
l blacked out.

141
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,042
l didn't.

142
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,581
l saw the whole thing.

143
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,986
l knew that the tail was gone, but l...

144
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,287
...couldn't bring myself to look back.

145
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,252
And then the front end
of the plane broke off.

146
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,062
Well, it's not here on the beach.

147
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,502
Neither is the tail.

148
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,302
We need to figure out
which way we came in.

149
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,345
- Why?
- There's a chance we find the cockpit.

150
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,404
lf it's intact, we might be able
to find the transceiver.

151
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,542
We could send out a signal,
help the rescue party find us.

152
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,110
How do you know all that?

153
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,714
l took a couple of flying lessons.

154
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,561
Wasn't for me.

155
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,466
l saw some smoke...

156
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,867
...just through the valley.

157
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,069
lf you're thinking about going
for the cockpit, l'm going with you.

158
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,814
l don't know your name.

159
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,349
l'm Kate.

160
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,652
Jack.

161
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,056
[crashing, tumbling]

162
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,007
What was that?

163
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,083
[crashing continues]

164
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,121
- That was weird, right?
- ls that Vincent?

165
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,247
lt's not Vincent.

166
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,421
Did anybody see that?

167
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,594
Yeah.

168
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,829
- [loud knocking]
- Boone!

169
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,304
[whirring]

170
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,075
[crashing continues]

171
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,689
[whirring]

172
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,465
Terrific.

173
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,146
So, how's the drink?

174
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,427
- lt's good.
- That wasn't a very strong reaction.

175
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,362
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

176
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,393
Just don't tell anyone.

177
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,701
This, of course, breaks some
critical FAA regulations.

178
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,529
Excuse me.

179
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,974
- [woman] Sir, excuse me!
- Guess he really had to go.

180
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,274
[woman] Sir, excuse me!

181
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,378
[rumbling]

182
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,682
[bell rings]

183
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,388
[woman] <i>The pilot has switched on</i>
<i>the ''fasten seatbelts'' sign.</i>

184
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,024
<i>Please return to your seats</i>
<i>and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

185
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,901
lt's normal.

186
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:55,164
Oh, l know. l've just
never been a very good flier.

187
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,734
My husband keeps reminding me
that planes want to be in the air.

188
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,143
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

189
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,877
Be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

190
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,981
Well, l'll keep you company
until he does.

191
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,587
Don't worry. lt's gonna be over...

192
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,028
[people screaming]

193
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,365
[man 1] lt didn't sound like an animal,
not exactly.

194
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,771
[woman 1] l keep thinking there
was something familiar about it.

195
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,105
- [woman 2] Where you from?
- [woman 1] Bronx.

196
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,407
- [Charlie] Monkeys.
- [man 2] Monkey lsland.

197
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,606
[man 3] Don't know
if we're on an island...

198
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,740
You ready?

199
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,181
You showed me where the smoke was.
l can get there myself.

200
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,452
l'm coming.

201
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,664
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

202
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,390
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.

203
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,560
- Does anyone have any sunblock?
- Yeah, l do.

204
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:41,038
So l was just looking
inside the fuselage.

205
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,370
lt's pretty grim in there.

206
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,002
You think we should
do something about the...

207
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,538
...B-O-D-Y-S?

208
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,714
- What are you spelling, man, ''bodies''?
- B-O-D-l-E-S.

209
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,721
That sounds like a good idea.

210
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,587
No, they'll deal with it
when they get here.

211
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,854
l'm gonna go out
and look for the cockpit.

212
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,932
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

213
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,830
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

214
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,958
You need to keep an eye
on the wounded.

215
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,629
lf the guy in the suit wakes up,
keep him calm,

216
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,400
but don't let him remove
that shrapnel. Understand?

217
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,533
Got it. What about the guy
with the leg? The tourniquet...?

218
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,078
l stopped the bleeding.
l took it off last night.

219
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,549
- He should be all right.
- Yeah, cool. Good job.

220
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,814
- l'll come with. l wanna help.
- l don't need any more help.

221
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,220
No, it's cool. l don't really feel
like standing still, so...

222
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,624
Excellent.

223
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,265
Can l ask you something?

224
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,296
Me? l'd be thrilled. l've been waiting.

225
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,036
Have we ever met anywhere?

226
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,445
No. That would be unlikely.

227
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,176
- l look familiar though, right?
- Yeah.

228
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,878
- You can't quite place it?
- No, l can't.

229
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,186
- Yeah, l think l know.
- You do?

230
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:12,252
~ <i>You all, everybody</i>
<i>You all, everybody</i>

231
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,824
- Never heard that song?
- l've heard it.

232
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,629
- l don't know what that...
- That's us! Drive Shaft!

233
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,933
The ring. Second tour of Finland.
Never heard of Drive Shaft?

234
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,598
- The band?
- Yeah, the band.

235
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,939
- You were in Drive Shaft?
- l am in Drive Shaft. l play bass.

236
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,501
- Serious?
- Yeah. Charlie.

237
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,570
Track three. l do backing vocals.

238
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,913
- My friend Beth would freak.
- Give me Beth's number, l'll call.

239
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,782
- She live nearby?
- You ever heard of Drive Shaft?

240
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,515
~ <i>You all, everybody</i>

241
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,491
~ <i>You all, every... body</i>

242
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,418
We gotta keep moving.

243
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,389
- They were good.
- They are good. We're still together.

244
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,063
We're in the middle of a comeback.

245
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,583
[thunder]

246
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,727
You guys, is this normal?

247
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,528
This kind of day turning into night.

248
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,402
The-end-of-the-world type weather.
Guys?

249
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,137
[people chattering indistinctly]

250
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,073
[speaking Korean]

251
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,389
l'm telling you, you don't wanna go
in there! There's too many bodies!

252
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,667
[crashing, rumbling]

253
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,802
There it is again.

254
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,273
Oh, my God.

255
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,955
Well, let's do this.

256
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,027
- Let's get this trans...
- Transceiver.

257
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,732
Transceiver thing and get out of here.

258
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,903
[grunting]

259
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,051
[straining]

260
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,665
[creaking]

261
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,356
[pounding]

262
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,064
Come on!

263
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,264
[Kate shrieks]

264
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,544
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

265
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,514
Yeah.

266
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:04,220
l'm fine. Charlie's fine,
by the way. l'm okay.

267
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,592
- Hey, you don't have to come up here.
- No, l'm good.

268
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,550
- So, what does a transceiver look like?
- Like a complicated walkie-talkie.

269
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,146
- [gasping]
- [Jack and Kate shriek]

270
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,151
[man coughing]

271
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,453
Hey, can you hear me?

272
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,054
l need that water.

273
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,469
Here. Here you go.

274
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,835
[grunting, coughing]

275
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,267
- How many survived?
- At least 48.

276
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,005
- Does anything feel broken?
- No, no.

277
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,846
Just my head's a little dizzy,
that's all.

278
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,047
lt's probably a concussion.

279
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,792
- How long has it been?
- Sixteen hours.

280
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,885
Sixteen?

281
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,229
- Has anybody come?
- Not yet.

282
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,563
Six hours in...

283
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,777
...our radio went out.

284
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,606
No one could see us.

285
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,473
We turned back to land in Fiji.

286
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,952
By the time we hit turbulence...

287
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,416
...we were a thousand miles off course.

288
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,786
They're looking for us
in the wrong place.

289
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,164
- We have a transceiver.
- Good, good.

290
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,366
We were hoping.
You shouldn't move.

291
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,401
No, no. l'm okay.
Transceiver's right there.

292
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,071
lt's right there.

293
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,054
Where's Charlie?

294
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,831
lt's not working.

295
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,407
Charlie?

296
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,912
- What were you doing in the bathroom?
- What?

297
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,610
[whirring]

298
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,046
What the hell was that?

299
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,489
Kate.

300
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,192
[slamming, rumbling]

301
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,930
- lt's right outside.
- What? What's right out...?

302
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,304
- [trees crunching]
- [pounding]

303
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,916
- [man screaming]
- [shrieking]

304
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,585
[whirring]

305
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,686
What the hell just happened?

306
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,999
[all panting]

307
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,394
[crashing, pounding]

308
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,813
Jack, come on!

309
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,352
[Charlie] Just leave it!

310
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,491
- Hey!
- [whirring]

311
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,072
Okay, run!

312
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,550
- [pounding]
- Jack!

313
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,996
[pounding continues]

314
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,502
[blasting]

315
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,112
One.

316
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,056
Two.

317
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,595
Three.

318
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,528
Four.

319
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,068
Five.

320
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,742
[eerie howling]

321
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,842
- Kate!
- [both shouting]

322
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,015
- Where's Jack? Did you see him?
- l don't know. He pulled me up.

323
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,524
- Where is he?
- l don't know!

324
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,720
- How can you not know?
- l fell down. He came back.

325
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,956
- That thing was...
- Did you see it?

326
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,498
No. No.

327
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,330
But it was right there.
We were dead... l was.

328
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,429
And then Jack came back and he
pulled me up. l don't know where he is.

329
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,950
- We have to go back for him.
- Go back? There?

330
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,181
There's a certain
gargantuan quality about this thing.

331
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,250
Then don't come.

332
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,417
Kate.

333
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,956
l heard you shout.

334
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,288
l heard you shout ''Jack.''

335
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,263
l'm Charlie, by the way.

336
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,194
What is that?

337
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,154
- What is...?
- lt's the pilot.

338
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,798
Did you see it?

339
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,141
No. lt was right behind me,
but l dove into the bushes.

340
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,279
Guys...

341
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,476
...how does something
like that happen?
