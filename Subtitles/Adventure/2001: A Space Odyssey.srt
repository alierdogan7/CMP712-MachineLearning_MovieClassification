00:25:42.72,00:25:45.09
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

00:25:46.06,00:25:47.89
Right. See you on the way back.

00:25:47.96,00:25:49.19
-Bye.[br]-Bye.

00:25:50.69,00:25:52.22
-Good morning, sir.[br]-Good morning.

00:25:52.30,00:25:54.26
We haven't seen you up here[br]for a long time.

00:25:54.33,00:25:55.70
No. Very nice to see you again.

00:25:55.77,00:25:58.60
-Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?[br]-Yes, very nice, thanks.

00:25:58.67,00:26:01.87
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security[br]is supposed to be meeting me.

00:26:01.94,00:26:02.96
May I call him for you?

00:26:03.04,00:26:04.20
Would you, please? Here he is!

00:26:04.27,00:26:06.24
-Hello, Dr. Floyd.[br]-Hello, Miller! How are you?

00:26:06.31,00:26:08.54
-Sorry I'm late.[br]-That's all right. You look great.

00:26:08.61,00:26:10.44
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

00:26:10.51,00:26:12.88
-Did you have a good flight?[br]-Very nice indeed.

00:26:12.95,00:26:14.42
-Well, shall we go through?[br]-Okay.

00:26:14.48,00:26:15.95
Will you please use Number 17?

00:26:16.02,00:26:17.78
-Thank you, Miss Turner.[br]-Thank you.

00:26:17.85,00:26:18.91
This way.

00:26:24.26,00:26:26.53
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

00:26:26.76,00:26:28.70
When you see the red light go on...

00:26:28.77,00:26:31.23
...would you please state[br]in the following order:

00:26:31.30,00:26:35.14
your destination, your nationality[br]and your full name.

00:26:35.61,00:26:38.44
Surname first, Christian name and initial.

00:26:40.18,00:26:44.14
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

00:26:46.85,00:26:50.79
Thank you. You are cleared through[br]Voice Print Identification.

00:26:51.29,00:26:52.41
Thank you.

00:26:59.56,00:27:01.22
Have I got time for breakfast?

00:27:01.30,00:27:02.77
I think we can manage that.

00:27:02.83,00:27:04.06
How long have I got?

00:27:04.13,00:27:06.76
Your flight leaves[br]in an hour and ten minutes.

00:27:06.84,00:27:09.81
I've reserved a table for you[br]in the Earthlight Room.

00:27:10.47,00:27:14.00
It's been about seven or eight months[br]since you were here last, isn't it?

00:27:14.08,00:27:15.77
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

00:27:15.85,00:27:19.14
I suppose you saw the work on[br]the new section when you came in here?

00:27:19.22,00:27:21.55
-Yes, coming along great, huh?[br]-Yeah, it's fine.

00:27:21.62,00:27:22.71
Oh, wait a minute!

00:27:22.79,00:27:26.22
I've got a few calls to make.[br]I'll meet you in the restaurant.

00:27:44.37,00:27:47.21
Will Mr. Travers please contact[br]the Met Office?

00:27:48.48,00:27:51.38
Will Mr. Travers please contact[br]the Met Office?

00:27:56.52,00:27:57.35
Yes?

00:27:58.76,00:28:00.52
-How are you, squirt?[br]-All right.

00:28:00.59,00:28:02.06
What are you doin'?

00:28:03.66,00:28:04.63
Playing.

00:28:04.93,00:28:06.16
Where's Mommy?

00:28:06.66,00:28:08.06
Gone to shopping.

00:28:08.37,00:28:10.70
-Well, who's taking care of ya?[br]-Rachel.

00:28:11.03,00:28:12.70
May I speak to Rachel, please?

00:28:12.77,00:28:14.53
She's gone to the bathroom.

00:28:14.67,00:28:17.11
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

00:28:17.64,00:28:19.84
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

00:28:20.51,00:28:21.57
Why not?

00:28:21.91,00:28:24.35
Well, you know, Daddy's travelling.

00:28:24.65,00:28:27.01
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

00:28:28.45,00:28:31.25
I'm gonna send you[br]a very nice present, though.

00:28:32.96,00:28:33.98
All right.

00:28:34.06,00:28:36.39
-Anything special that you want?[br]- Yes.

00:28:36.56,00:28:37.58
What?

00:28:37.89,00:28:39.02
A telephone.

00:28:40.00,00:28:41.99
We've got lots of telephones already.

00:28:42.07,00:28:44.83
Can't you think of anything else[br]you want for your birthday?

00:28:44.90,00:28:46.37
Something very special?

00:28:46.90,00:28:48.46
- Yes.[br]-What?

00:28:48.74,00:28:49.90
A bush baby.

00:28:49.97,00:28:52.50
A bush baby?[br]Well, we'll have to see about that.

00:28:52.58,00:28:54.54
I want you to tell Mommy[br]something for me.

00:28:54.61,00:28:56.51
-Will you remember?[br]- Yes.

00:28:56.85,00:28:59.31
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

00:29:00.45,00:29:01.21
Yes.

00:29:01.28,00:29:03.95
And that I'll try[br]to telephone again tomorrow.

00:29:04.39,00:29:06.18
Now, will you tell her that?

00:29:07.22,00:29:08.05
Yes.

00:29:08.22,00:29:11.16
Okay, sweetheart.[br]Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

00:29:11.23,00:29:12.29
All right.

00:29:12.63,00:29:15.46
And have a nice birthday party[br]tomorrow, too, huh?

00:29:16.43,00:29:17.53
All right.

00:29:17.67,00:29:20.53
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,[br]won't you?

00:29:20.60,00:29:21.93
All right. Bye-bye!

00:29:22.01,00:29:24.57
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

00:29:38.25,00:29:40.45
Elena, how nice to see you again.

00:29:40.52,00:29:42.62
What a wonderful surprise[br]to meet you here!

00:29:42.69,00:29:45.75
-You're looking wonderful.[br]-Thank you. You're looking well, too.

00:29:45.83,00:29:48.02
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

00:29:48.10,00:29:50.57
-I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.[br]-How do you do?

00:29:50.63,00:29:52.76
-Dr. Stretyneva.[br]-How do you do?

00:29:52.84,00:29:54.70
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

00:29:54.77,00:29:57.40
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

00:29:57.47,00:29:58.94
Won't you sit down?

00:29:59.34,00:30:01.21
-Well, we--[br]-No, no, please.

00:30:01.74,00:30:03.21
Well, thank you.

00:30:03.48,00:30:06.51
-Would you like a drink, Doctor?[br]-No, thank you.

00:30:06.58,00:30:09.88
I haven't had breakfast yet.[br]Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

00:30:09.95,00:30:12.82
I'll just sit with you a few minutes[br]and then I must be off.

00:30:12.89,00:30:15.92
-Are you quite sure?[br]-I'm quite sure, thank you.

00:30:16.56,00:30:18.69
-And how's Gregor?[br]-He's fine.

00:30:19.03,00:30:22.40
He's been doing some underwater research[br]in the Baltic so...

00:30:22.57,00:30:26.66
...I'm afraid we don't get a chance[br]to see very much of each other these days.

00:30:26.74,00:30:28.83
When you do see him,[br]give him my regards, huh?

00:30:28.91,00:30:30.37
Yes, of course.

00:30:30.77,00:30:33.33
Well, where are you all off to?[br]Up or down?

00:30:33.48,00:30:35.03
Oh, we're going home.

00:30:35.18,00:30:39.41
We have just spent three months[br]calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

00:30:40.28,00:30:43.12
-And what about you?[br]-I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

00:30:43.19,00:30:44.59
Oh, are you?

00:30:47.19,00:30:50.49
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think[br]I'm being too inquisitive, but...

00:30:50.56,00:30:53.09
...perhaps you can clear up[br]the great big mystery...

00:30:53.16,00:30:55.36
...about what is going on up there.

00:30:56.77,00:30:58.70
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

00:30:58.77,00:31:00.86
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

00:31:00.94,00:31:04.24
...some extremely odd things[br]have been happening at Clavius.

00:31:04.61,00:31:06.27
-Oh, really?[br]-Yes, yes.

00:31:06.91,00:31:11.24
For one thing, whenever you phone[br]the base all you get is a recording which...

00:31:11.48,00:31:15.61
...repeats that the phone lines[br]are temporarily out of order.

00:31:17.19,00:31:20.92
Probably having some trouble with[br]their equipment or something like that.

00:31:20.99,00:31:23.55
That's what we thought[br]was the explanation at first...

00:31:23.63,00:31:26.19
...but it has been going on now[br]for the past ten days.

00:31:26.26,00:31:29.29
You have not been able to contact anyone[br]for the past ten days?

00:31:29.37,00:31:30.63
That's right.

00:31:30.87,00:31:31.77
Oh, I see.

00:31:31.83,00:31:33.46
And there's another thing, Heywood.

00:31:33.54,00:31:36.53
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses[br]was denied permission...

00:31:36.61,00:31:38.90
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

00:31:39.01,00:31:40.31
That does sound odd.

00:31:40.38,00:31:43.74
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be[br]a bit of a row about that.

00:31:43.81,00:31:47.77
Denying the men permission to land is[br]a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

00:31:47.85,00:31:49.61
Yes, of course. Of course.

00:31:49.69,00:31:52.55
-Did the crew get back all right?[br]-Yes, fortunately they did.

00:31:52.62,00:31:54.52
Well, I'm glad about that.

00:31:57.96,00:32:01.95
At the risk of pressing you[br]on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

00:32:02.27,00:32:04.86
...may I ask you[br]a straightforward question?

00:32:05.07,00:32:06.40
Well, certainly.

00:32:09.24,00:32:13.27
Quite frankly, we have had some[br]very reliable intelligence reports that...

00:32:13.78,00:32:17.01
...quite a serious epidemic[br]has broken out on Clavius.

00:32:17.48,00:32:20.24
Something, apparently,[br]of an unknown origin.

00:32:21.62,00:32:23.92
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

00:32:29.33,00:32:31.29
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

00:32:32.83,00:32:35.53
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

00:32:37.20,00:32:38.39
I understand.

00:32:39.44,00:32:42.89
But this epidemic could quite easily[br]spread to our base.

00:32:43.11,00:32:45.34
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

00:32:45.41,00:32:47.38
Yes, I know.

00:32:50.25,00:32:52.81
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

00:32:55.99,00:32:59.08
Now, are you sure you won't[br]change your mind about that drink?

00:32:59.16,00:33:01.28
No, I'm positive.[br]Now, I really must be going.

00:33:01.36,00:33:04.79
I hope that you and your wife can come[br]to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

00:33:04.86,00:33:06.52
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

00:33:06.60,00:33:10.16
And if you do, you remember to bring[br]that darling little daughter with you!

00:33:10.23,00:33:13.67
Well, that will all depend on[br]school vacations and all that sort of thing.

00:33:13.74,00:33:14.67
But if we can, we will.

00:33:14.74,00:33:18.30
Don't forget you have a standing invitation[br]if you ever get to the States.

00:33:18.37,00:33:21.40
No, of course not. Gregor and I will[br]look forward to seeing you.

00:33:21.48,00:33:23.07
Well, goodbye, Elena.

00:33:23.58,00:33:26.48
It has been a pleasure meeting you all,[br]Dr. Smyslov.

00:33:26.55,00:33:30.54
Whatever the reasons for your visit[br]to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

00:33:30.62,00:33:31.75
Thank you.

00:33:32.06,00:33:33.11
Ladies.

00:41:28.70,00:41:30.16
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

00:41:30.23,00:41:32.46
I'm through now.[br]Thank you very much, gentlemen.

00:41:32.54,00:41:33.66
You're welcome.

00:41:46.95,00:41:47.97
Well....

00:41:48.58,00:41:52.99
I know you will all want to join with me[br]in welcoming our...

00:41:53.79,00:41:55.85
...distinguished friend and colleague...

00:41:55.93,00:41:59.76
...from the National Council[br]of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

00:42:00.36,00:42:05.10
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius[br]to be with us today.

00:42:06.60,00:42:10.09
And before the briefing I know[br]he'd like to have a few words with you.

00:42:10.17,00:42:11.30
Dr. Floyd?

00:42:24.22,00:42:26.38
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

00:42:26.46,00:42:27.79
Hi, everybody.

00:42:27.92,00:42:29.91
Nice to be back again.

00:42:32.63,00:42:36.09
First of all, I bring a personal message[br]from Dr. Howell who...

00:42:36.23,00:42:39.50
...has asked me to convey[br]his deepest appreciation to all of you...

00:42:39.57,00:42:42.44
...for the many sacrifices[br]you have had to make.

00:42:42.74,00:42:46.04
And, of course, his congratulations[br]on your discovery...

00:42:47.14,00:42:51.60
...which may well prove to be among the[br]most significant in the history of science.

00:42:54.08,00:42:55.21
Now...

00:42:55.99,00:42:59.82
...I know there have been some[br]conflicting views held by some of you...

00:43:00.12,00:43:03.42
...regarding the need[br]for complete security in this matter.

00:43:03.99,00:43:07.22
More specifically, your opposition[br]to the cover story...

00:43:08.20,00:43:12.16
...created to give the impression[br]that there is an epidemic at the base.

00:43:12.77,00:43:16.03
I understand that beyond it being[br]a matter of principle...

00:43:17.21,00:43:20.90
...many of you are troubled[br]by the concern and anxiety...

00:43:21.01,00:43:25.38
...this story of an epidemic might cause[br]to your relatives and friends on Earth.

00:43:26.35,00:43:29.51
Well, I completely sympathize[br]with your negative views.

00:43:31.29,00:43:34.35
I find this cover story[br]personally embarrassing myself.

00:43:35.76,00:43:39.52
However, I accept the need[br]for absolute secrecy in this.

00:43:40.83,00:43:42.69
And I hope you will, too.

00:43:45.17,00:43:48.36
Now, I'm sure you are all aware[br]of the extremely grave potential...

00:43:48.44,00:43:51.10
...for cultural shock[br]and social disorientation...

00:43:51.17,00:43:53.30
...contained in this present situation...

00:43:53.38,00:43:56.34
...if the facts were prematurely[br]and suddenly made public...

00:43:56.41,00:43:59.21
...without adequate preparation[br]and conditioning.

00:44:01.15,00:44:03.52
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

00:44:04.99,00:44:08.98
The purpose of my visit here is[br]to gather additional facts and opinions...

00:44:09.19,00:44:10.75
...on the situation...

00:44:11.56,00:44:14.12
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

00:44:14.70,00:44:16.67
...recommending when and how...

00:44:17.77,00:44:20.26
...the news should eventually[br]be announced.

00:44:21.07,00:44:24.77
Now, if any of you would like to give me[br]your views and opinions...

00:44:25.04,00:44:29.37
...in private if you like, I will be only[br]too happy to include them in my report.

00:44:32.01,00:44:33.95
Well, I think that's about it.

00:44:34.78,00:44:36.15
Any questions?

00:44:38.92,00:44:43.12
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea[br]how much longer this cover story...

00:44:43.19,00:44:45.16
...will have to be maintained?

00:44:46.93,00:44:48.36
I don't know, Bill.

00:44:48.90,00:44:52.70
I suppose it will be maintained as long as[br]is deemed necessary by the Council.

00:44:52.77,00:44:56.33
There must be adequate time for[br]a full study to be made on the situation...

00:44:56.41,00:44:59.81
...before any thought can be given[br]to making a public announcement.

00:44:59.88,00:45:03.11
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,[br]the Council has requested...

00:45:03.18,00:45:06.08
...that formal security oaths are[br]to be obtained in writing...

00:45:06.15,00:45:08.95
...from everyone who has any knowledge[br]of this event.

00:45:10.99,00:45:13.11
Are there any more questions?

00:45:18.53,00:45:23.19
I'm sure we all want to cooperate[br]with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

00:45:24.53,00:45:27.26
...and as there seems[br]to be no more questions...

00:45:27.54,00:45:29.66
...I think we ought to get on[br]with the briefing.

00:45:29.74,00:45:32.21
-Thank you, Dr. Floyd.[br]-Thank you.

00:47:09.57,00:47:11.06
Anybody hungry?

00:47:13.54,00:47:15.51
-What we've got?[br]-You name it.

00:47:19.98,00:47:22.25
-What's this? Chicken?[br]-Something like that.

00:47:22.32,00:47:23.84
Tastes the same, anyway.

00:47:24.82,00:47:26.05
Any ham?

00:47:26.19,00:47:27.85
Ham, ham, ham....

00:47:32.93,00:47:36.99
-Looks pretty good.[br]-They're getting better at it all the time.

00:47:38.73,00:47:41.00
That was an excellent speech[br]you gave us, Heywood.

00:47:41.07,00:47:42.26
It certainly was.

00:47:42.87,00:47:44.96
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

00:47:45.04,00:47:46.20
Thanks, Ralph.

00:47:46.28,00:47:49.61
I want to say to both of you[br]that I think you've done a wonderful job.

00:47:49.68,00:47:51.58
I appreciate the way[br]you've handled this thing.

00:47:51.65,00:47:55.52
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job[br]to do this thing the way you want it done.

00:47:55.58,00:47:57.88
And we're only too happy[br]to be able to oblige.

00:47:58.45,00:48:00.01
Have you seen these yet?

00:48:00.09,00:48:01.45
Take a look at them.

00:48:01.52,00:48:03.82
Here's what started the whole thing.

00:48:04.36,00:48:05.92
Oh, yes.

00:48:05.99,00:48:09.76
When we first found it, we thought[br]it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

00:48:09.83,00:48:13.10
...but all the geological evidence[br]was against it.

00:48:13.17,00:48:17.83
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite[br]could produce a field as intense as this.

00:48:18.11,00:48:19.54
So, we decided to have a look.

00:48:19.61,00:48:22.63
We thought it might be[br]the upper part of some buried structure...

00:48:22.71,00:48:24.30
...so we excavated out on all sides.

00:48:24.38,00:48:26.61
But, unfortunately,[br]we didn't find anything else.

00:48:26.68,00:48:29.71
And what's more, the evidence seems[br]pretty conclusive that...

00:48:29.79,00:48:33.05
...it has not been covered up[br]by natural erosion or other forces.

00:48:33.12,00:48:35.95
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

00:48:36.46,00:48:37.93
Deliberately buried.

00:48:42.10,00:48:43.53
How about a little coffee?

00:48:43.60,00:48:45.86
-Great.[br]-Good idea.

00:48:51.24,00:48:54.27
I don't suppose you have any idea[br]what the damn thing is, huh?

00:48:54.34,00:48:56.21
I wish to hell we did.

00:48:56.85,00:49:00.84
No, the only thing we're sure of is[br]it was buried four million years ago.

00:49:01.38,00:49:05.44
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly[br]come up with something.

00:58:52.31,00:58:53.57
Good evening.

00:58:53.74,00:58:56.87
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,[br]Discovery One...

00:58:56.95,00:58:59.85
...left on its half-billion mile voyage[br]to Jupiter.

00:58:59.91,00:59:03.58
This marked the first manned attempt[br]to reach this distant planet.

00:59:04.02,00:59:07.35
Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"[br]recorded an interview...

00:59:07.42,00:59:11.65
...with the crew of Discovery at a distance[br]of 80 million miles from Earth.

00:59:12.23,00:59:15.86
It took seven minutes for our words[br]to reach the giant spacecraft...

00:59:15.93,00:59:19.23
...but this time delay has been edited[br]from this recording.

00:59:19.30,00:59:22.00
Our reporter, Martin Amer,[br]speaks to the crew.

00:59:22.90,00:59:25.77
The crew of Discovery One[br]consists of five men...

00:59:26.17,00:59:30.63
...and one of the latest generation[br]of the HAL-9000 computers.

00:59:31.41,00:59:33.78
Three of the five men[br]were put aboard asleep...

00:59:33.85,00:59:36.78
...or to be more precise,[br]in a state of hibernation.

00:59:37.25,00:59:41.92
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,[br]Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

00:59:42.76,00:59:45.59
We spoke with Mission Commander,[br]Dr. David Bowman...

00:59:45.66,00:59:47.96
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

00:59:48.16,00:59:51.13
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.[br]How is everything going?

00:59:51.20,00:59:55.03
Marvellous. We have no...[br]we have no complaints.

00:59:55.97,00:59:59.43
Well, I'm very glad to hear that[br]and I'm sure that the entire world...

00:59:59.51,01:00:02.97
...would join me in wishing you[br]a safe and successful voyage.

01:00:03.08,01:00:05.07
- Thanks very much.[br]- Thank you.

01:00:05.25,01:00:09.05
Although hibernation has been used[br]on previous space efforts...

01:00:09.35,01:00:13.79
...this is the first time that men have been[br]put into hibernation before departure.

01:00:13.86,01:00:15.22
Why was this done?

01:00:15.69,01:00:19.09
Well, this was done in order to achieve[br]the maximum conservation...

01:00:19.16,01:00:22.56
...of our life-support capabilities,[br]basically food and air.

01:00:22.86,01:00:26.46
Now, the three hibernating crew members[br]represent the survey team.

01:00:26.80,01:00:30.53
And their efforts wont be utilized[br]until we are approaching Jupiter.

01:00:30.77,01:00:34.07
Dr. Poole, what's it like[br]while you are in hibernation?

01:00:35.64,01:00:39.31
It's exactly like being asleep;[br]you have absolutely no sense of time.

01:00:39.38,01:00:41.81
The only difference is you don't dream.

01:00:42.08,01:00:44.78
As I understand it,[br]you only breathe once a minute.

01:00:44.85,01:00:46.05
Is this true?

01:00:46.12,01:00:47.09
That's right.

01:00:47.16,01:00:50.92
And your heart beats three times a minute,[br]body temperature is usually down...

01:00:50.99,01:00:53.32
...to about three degrees centigrade.

01:00:53.39,01:00:56.89
The sixth member of the Discovery crew[br]was not concerned...

01:00:56.96,01:00:59.23
...about the problems of hibernation.

01:00:59.30,01:01:02.33
For he was the latest result[br]in machine intelligence.

01:01:02.94,01:01:07.31
The HAL-9000 computer[br]which can reproduce...

01:01:07.71,01:01:10.74
...though some experts still prefer[br]to use the word "mimic"...

01:01:10.81,01:01:15.75
...most of the activities of the human brain[br]and with incalculably greater speed...

01:01:15.82,01:01:17.25
...and reliability.

01:01:17.59,01:01:21.18
We next spoke[br]with the HAL-9000 computer...

01:01:21.42,01:01:24.19
...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.

01:01:25.09,01:01:27.46
Good afternoon, Hal.[br]How's everything going?

01:01:27.53,01:01:31.23
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.[br]Everything's going extremely well.

01:01:31.67,01:01:34.46
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility[br]on this mission.

01:01:34.54,01:01:37.06
In many ways,[br]perhaps the greatest responsibility...

01:01:37.14,01:01:39.23
...of any single mission element.

01:01:39.37,01:01:42.34
You are the brain[br]and central nervous system of the ship.

01:01:42.41,01:01:46.31
Your responsibilities include[br]watching over the men in hibernation.

01:01:46.38,01:01:49.25
Does this ever cause you[br]any lack of confidence?

01:01:49.68,01:01:51.81
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

01:01:52.29,01:01:56.22
The 9000 Series is[br]the most reliable computer ever made.

01:01:57.33,01:02:01.69
No 9000 computer has ever made[br]a mistake or distorted information.

01:02:02.80,01:02:05.93
We are all by any practical definition[br]of the words...

01:02:06.30,01:02:09.10
...foolproof and incapable of error.

01:02:09.87,01:02:13.86
Hal, despite your enormous intellect,[br]are you ever frustrated...

01:02:13.94,01:02:16.91
...by your dependence on people[br]to carry out actions?

01:02:17.31,01:02:19.01
Not in the slightest bit.

01:02:19.75,01:02:21.54
I enjoy working with people.

01:02:22.08,01:02:26.11
I have a stimulating relationship[br]with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

01:02:26.82,01:02:31.22
My mission responsibilities range[br]over the entire operation of the ship...

01:02:31.56,01:02:33.55
...so I am constantly occupied.

01:02:34.63,01:02:37.72
I am putting myself[br]to the fullest possible use...

01:02:38.33,01:02:42.93
...which is all, I think, that[br]any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

01:02:43.70,01:02:47.07
Dr. Poole, what's it like living[br]for the better part of a year...

01:02:47.14,01:02:49.30
...in such close proximity with Hal?

01:02:50.75,01:02:53.15
It's pretty close to what you said[br]about him earlier.

01:02:53.21,01:02:55.38
He's just like the sixth member[br]of the crew.

01:02:55.45,01:02:59.61
You very quickly get adjusted to the idea[br]that he talks. You think of him...

01:02:59.82,01:03:01.95
...really as just another person.

01:03:02.02,01:03:05.79
In talking to the computer[br]one gets the sense that he is capable...

01:03:05.86,01:03:07.33
...of emotional response.

01:03:07.40,01:03:09.89
For example, when I asked him[br]about his abilities...

01:03:09.96,01:03:14.06
...I sensed a certain pride in his answer[br]about his accuracy and perfection.

01:03:14.34,01:03:17.10
Do you believe that Hal[br]has genuine emotions?

01:03:18.51,01:03:21.44
Oh, yes. Well, he acts[br]like he has genuine emotions.

01:03:21.64,01:03:25.37
Of course, he's programmed that way[br]to make it easier for us to talk to him.

01:03:25.45,01:03:27.71
But, as to whether or not[br]he has real feelings...

01:03:27.78,01:03:31.05
...is something I don't think anyone[br]can truthfully answer.

01:03:55.84,01:03:57.21
Excuse me, Frank.

01:03:58.15,01:03:59.27
What is it, Hal?

01:03:59.35,01:04:02.41
We've got the transmission[br]from your parents coming in.

01:04:05.29,01:04:07.75
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

01:04:07.86,01:04:08.95
Certainly.

01:04:22.17,01:04:23.90
-Hello, Frank.[br]-Happy birthday, darling.

01:04:23.97,01:04:26.24
Happy birthday.[br]Many happy returns of the day.

01:04:26.31,01:04:27.80
A bit higher, please.

01:04:27.88,01:04:30.11
Now, Mother and I are both[br]feeling wonderful, too.

01:04:30.18,01:04:32.17
Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...

01:04:32.25,01:04:35.01
...but at the last minute[br]Rays back went bad on him again.

01:04:35.08,01:04:36.55
How do you like your cake, dear?

01:04:36.62,01:04:39.09
Looks great, doesn't it?[br]Sorry you cant be with us.

01:04:39.15,01:04:40.64
Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.

01:04:40.72,01:04:42.92
He said to be sure[br]and wish you a happy birthday.

01:04:42.99,01:04:45.93
All my students made me promise[br]to send their best wishes, too.

01:04:45.99,01:04:48.59
You know they talk about you[br]all the time in the classroom.

01:04:48.66,01:04:51.13
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.

01:04:51.20,01:04:52.96
You know we were on television[br]last week?

01:04:53.03,01:04:56.20
Oh, yes! Your mother and I[br]and Dave's parents were interviewed...

01:04:56.27,01:04:58.40
...about what we thought of[br]our illustrious son.

01:04:58.47,01:05:02.10
You can imagine what we told them.[br]I think its being broadcast next Thursday.

01:05:02.18,01:05:03.73
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

01:05:03.91,01:05:06.07
Oh, we were thrilled[br]about Elaine and Bill, dear.

01:05:06.15,01:05:10.02
I'll be glad to get the present for you,[br]but please tell me how much to spend.

01:05:10.08,01:05:12.71
Oh, yes, Frank,[br]about your AGS-19 payments--

01:05:12.82,01:05:14.48
I think I straightened it out for you.

01:05:14.56,01:05:17.18
I talked to the Accounting Office[br]in Houston yesterday...

01:05:17.26,01:05:21.25
...and they said you should be receiving[br]your higher rates of pay by next month.

01:05:21.96,01:05:24.26
Well, I cant think of anything else to say.

01:05:24.33,01:05:27.77
-Oh, our love to Dave.[br]-Be sure to give him our best regards.

01:05:28.74,01:05:31.43
We wish you the very happiest[br]of birthdays.

01:05:32.31,01:05:33.71
All the best, son.

01:05:46.05,01:05:47.68
See you next Wednesday.

01:05:51.19,01:05:52.78
Happy birthday, Frank.

01:05:53.89,01:05:56.26
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

01:06:15.00,01:06:16.93
Anyway, queen takes pawn--

01:06:18.77,01:06:20.56
Bishop takes knights pawn.

01:06:28.71,01:06:30.07
Rook, king, one.

01:06:30.44,01:06:32.91
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

01:06:34.01,01:06:36.95
Queen to bishop, three.[br]Bishop takes queen.

01:06:37.75,01:06:39.78
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

01:06:44.52,01:06:47.02
Looks like you're right. Very good.

01:06:47.89,01:06:49.89
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

01:06:49.96,01:06:50.79
Thank you.

01:07:29.07,01:07:31.20
-Good evening, Dave.[br]-How are you doing, Hal?

01:07:31.27,01:07:34.64
-Everything's running smoothly. And you?[br]-Oh, not too bad.

01:07:34.71,01:07:37.70
-Have you been doing some more work?[br]-A few sketches.

01:07:37.81,01:07:39.54
-May I see them?[br]-Sure.

01:07:44.25,01:07:46.41
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

01:07:47.59,01:07:49.85
I think you've improved a great deal.

01:07:51.26,01:07:53.49
-Can you hold it a bit closer?[br]-Sure.

01:07:56.36,01:07:58.46
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

01:08:01.64,01:08:02.97
By the way....

01:08:03.97,01:08:06.56
Do you mind[br]if I ask you a personal question?

01:08:07.54,01:08:09.03
No, no. Not at all.

01:08:09.34,01:08:12.28
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...

01:08:13.75,01:08:16.15
...but during the past few weeks[br]I've wondered...

01:08:16.22,01:08:20.18
...whether you might have been having[br]some second thoughts about the mission?

01:08:20.25,01:08:21.62
How do you mean?

01:08:23.52,01:08:25.55
It's rather difficult to define.

01:08:27.16,01:08:30.22
Perhaps I'm just projecting[br]my own concern about it.

01:08:31.93,01:08:35.53
I know I've never completely freed myself[br]of the suspicion...

01:08:36.40,01:08:39.86
...that there are some extremely[br]odd things about this mission.

01:08:41.54,01:08:44.77
I'm sure you will agree there is some truth[br]in what I say.

01:08:47.58,01:08:50.35
I don't know.[br]That's a rather difficult question to answer.

01:08:50.42,01:08:53.05
You don't mind talking about it,[br]do you, Dave?

01:08:53.85,01:08:55.32
Oh, no, not at all.

01:08:56.66,01:08:58.89
Certainly no one could[br]have been unaware of...

01:08:58.96,01:09:02.22
...the very strange stories floating around[br]before we left.

01:09:03.76,01:09:06.67
Rumours of something being dug up[br]on the Moon.

01:09:08.50,01:09:11.03
I never gave these stories much credence...

01:09:12.04,01:09:16.17
...but particularly in view of some[br]of the other things that have happened...

01:09:16.34,01:09:19.04
...I find them difficult[br]to put out of my mind.

01:09:19.81,01:09:21.08
For instance:

01:09:21.48,01:09:25.11
The way all our preparations[br]were kept under such tight security...

01:09:26.35,01:09:27.91
...and the melodramatic touch...

01:09:27.99,01:09:31.36
...of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball[br]and Kaminsky aboard...

01:09:32.16,01:09:36.39
...already in hibernation after four months[br]of separate training on their own.

01:09:38.00,01:09:40.49
You working up[br]your crew psychology report?

01:09:42.10,01:09:43.47
Of course, I am.

01:09:43.90,01:09:46.93
Sorry about this. I know its a bit silly.

01:09:48.41,01:09:49.67
Just a moment.

01:09:50.28,01:09:51.51
Just a moment.

01:09:53.18,01:09:56.62
I have just picked up a fault[br]in the AE-35 unit.

01:09:58.19,01:10:01.85
It's going to go 100 percent failure[br]within 72 hours.

01:10:04.66,01:10:07.32
-You are still within operational limits?[br]- Yes.

01:10:07.73,01:10:10.09
And it will stay that way until it fails.

01:10:10.16,01:10:12.65
Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours[br]until failure?

01:10:12.73,01:10:15.79
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

01:10:18.24,01:10:21.50
We'll have to bring it in,[br]but I'd like to go over this with Frank...

01:10:21.58,01:10:25.41
...and get on to Mission Control.[br]Let me have a hard copy of it, please.
