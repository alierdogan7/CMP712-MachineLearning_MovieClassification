00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,700
ERIC: Once upon a time,
in deep winter,

2
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,782
a queen was admiring
the falling snow

3
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,415
when she saw a rose blooming
in defiance of the cold.

4
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,207
Reaching for it,
she pricked her finger

5
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,005
and three drops of blood fell.

6
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,255
And because the red seemed
so alive against the white

7
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,932
she thought, "If only I had
a child as white as snow,

8
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,434
<i>"lips as red as blood hair
as black as a raven's wings</i>

9
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,062
"and all with the
strength of that rose. "

10
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,777
Soon after, a daughter
was born to the Queen

11
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,409
and was named,
"Snow White."

12
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,407
And she was adored
throughout the kingdom

13
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,957
as much for her defiant
spirit as for her beauty.

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,948
We found it
in the woods.

15
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,325
It's injured, Mother.

16
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,410
It must have
broken its wing.

17
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,252
Don't worry,
it will heal in time.

18
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,582
I'll look after it.

19
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,414
You possess a rare
beauty, my love.

20
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,421
In here.

21
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,506
Never lose it.

22
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,260
It will serve you well
when you become queen.

23
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,316
SNOW WHITE: Be careful
you don't fall.

24
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,772
I'm just
getting you an apple.

25
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,861
Here you go.
Thank you.

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,192
William!

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,941
William!

28
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,578
ERIC: The next winter was
the harshest in memory

29
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,994
and Snow White's mother
passed away.

30
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,789
The King was inconsolable.

31
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,000
Taking advantage
of his grief,

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,427
a dark and mysterious
army appeared

33
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,258
and lured him into battle.

34
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,832
What devil
spawned this army?

35
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,417
Send them back to hell!

36
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,918
No prisoners!

37
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,397
ERIC: The dark
army was defeated,

38
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,938
but what would soon come
to pass was far darker.

39
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,105
Sire!

40
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,662
A prisoner.

41
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,242
MAGNUS: Fear not,

42
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,582
you will come to no harm
from me or my men.

43
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,290
What is your name,
my lady?

44
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,136
Ravenna, sire.

45
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,560
ERIC: So enchanted by
her beauty was the King

46
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,351
that he forgot, for the first
time, his broken heart

47
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,894
and the very next day,
she would become his wife.

48
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,272
You're so beautiful.

49
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,611
That's kind, Child.

50
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,282
Especially when
it is said that yours

51
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,580
is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,328
Come.

53
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,412
This all must be
difficult for you.

54
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,088
I, too, lost my mother
when I was a young girl.

55
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,470
I can never take
your mother's place.

56
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,879
Never

57
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,932
But I feel that
you and I are bound.

58
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,437
I feel it there.

59
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,265
Your heart.

60
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,154
You will be
the ruin of me.

61
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,911
Indeed, my lord.

62
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,749
I was ruined
by a king like you once.

63
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,959
I replaced his queen,

64
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,886
an old woman.

65
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,885
And, in time, I, too,
would have been replaced.

66
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,059
Men use women.

67
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,813
They ruin us and when
they are finished with us

68
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:04,068
they toss us to the dogs
like scraps.

69
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,070
What have you given me?

70
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,749
When a woman stays young
and beautiful forever,

71
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,542
the world is hers.

72
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,043
First, I will take
your life, my lord.

73
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,964
And then
I'll take your throne.

74
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,797
Welcome, brother.

75
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,136
MY queen.

76
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,638
ERIC: She had tricked her way into
the kingdom with a phantom army.

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,475
She now welcomed
a very real one.

78
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,888
William!

79
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,598
Snow, get out! Snow!

80
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,851
I can't leave!

81
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,351
The Princess!
No!

82
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,269
Get out of here! Go!

83
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,449
William! Don't leave me!

84
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,868
Father, we must go back!
We must!

85
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,874
No!
We've lost her!

86
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,209
No! No! No!

87
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,801
Don't leave me!
William!

88
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,404
Out.

89
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,450
Out!

90
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,971
Mirror, mirror

91
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,846

92
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,474
who is
the fairest of them all?

93
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,977
It is you, my queen.

94
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,860
Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory.

95
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,492
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?

96
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,124
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?

97
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,008
To the sword.

98
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,842
Finn.

99
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,522
Lock her up.

100
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:31,398
One never knows when royal
blood may be of value.

101
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,042
ERIC: So poisonous was
the reign of Ravenna,

102
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,004
that nature turned on itself and
people turned on each other.

103
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,919
The land died

104
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,423
<i>and with if, hope</i>

105
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,431
And all that time, she
kept Snow White imprisoned

106
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,143
high up
in the north tower.

107
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,587
Our Father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

108
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,749
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on Earth as it is in heaven,

109
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,213
Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our sins,

110
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,549
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

111
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,588
Lead us not into temptation,

112
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,474
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

113
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,118
Hello'?

114
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,077
Hello'?

115
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,797
What is your name?
I am Greta.

116
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
What happened to you'?

117
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,926
All the girls in our
village were taken.

118
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,807
I was trying to reach Duke Hammond's
castle when I was caught.

119
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,639
Duke Hammond?

120
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,303
Is he alive'?

121
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,523
Does he still fight
in my father's name?

122
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,183
You're the King's daughter.

123
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,438
The night the King died, we were
told all in the castle were slain.

124
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,481
And William?

125
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
Is the Duke's son
still alive?

126
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,194
I don't know, Princess.

127
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,996
What will they do to me?

128
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,113
Do you remember
when we were children

129
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,527
begging for scraps
like those wretches?

130
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,612
Yes, sister.

131
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,952
Am I not kinder?

132
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,710
YES.

133
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,758
These two were captured
leading an ambush

134
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,757
on one of our
supply trains.

135
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,142
Your son'?

136
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,857
Handsome.

137
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,900
Obviously, a debt
owed to your mother.

138
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,577
There was a time I would have lost
my heart to a face like yours.

139
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,494
And you, no doubt,
would have broken it.

140
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,366
lain, no!

141
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,022
You would kill your queen'?

142
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,524
Such courage.

143
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,276
Such beauty.

144
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,482
But how strong
is your heart?

145
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,907
No. My son.

146
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,294
My $On!

147
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,971
Leave him.

148
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,181
Let him return
to the Duke

149
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,230
and speak of the generosity
of his queen.

150
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,932
Out.

151
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,441
Out!

152
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,314
Magic comes
at a lofty price.

153
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,729
And the expense grows.

154
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,731
You look...
Old.

155
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,524
Tired.

156
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,496
MY Dower

157
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,913
fades.

158
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,754
I have something
for what ails you.

159
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,185
Oh.

160
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,945
SNOW WHITE: Greta?

161
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,657
Greta?

162
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,826
Mirror, mirror

163
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,619
on the wall,

164
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,299
who is fairest
of them all?

165
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,293
My queen,

166
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,551
on this day,
one has come of age

167
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,762
fairer even than you.

168
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,395
She is the reason
your powers wane.

169
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,055
Who is it'?

170
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,975
Snow White.

171
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,519
Snow White?

172
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,697
She is my undoing?

173
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,615
I should have killed her
when she was a child.

174
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,279
Be warned.

175
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:48,417
Her innocence and purity
is all that can destroy you.

176
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,331
But she is also
your salvation, Queen.

177
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,629
Take her heart
in your hand

178
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,296
and you shall never again
need to consume youth.

179
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,387
You shall never again
weaken or age.

180
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,723
Immortality.

181
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,056
Immortality

182
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,058
forever.

183
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,819
Finn!

184
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,406
Brother,

185
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,659
bring me
the King's daughter.

186
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,647
Did I wake you?

187
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,658
Are you always awake
when I watch you'?

188
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,126
You've never
come in before.

189
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,127
My sister won't allow it.

190
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,383
She wants you
all to herself.

191
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,343
I'm afraid of her.

192
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,347
And not of me?

193
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,508
No.

194
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,312
Fear not, Princess.

195
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,194
You will never again
be locked in this cell.

196
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,821
What does she
want from me'?

197
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,201
Your beating heart.

198
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,591
Get me out of here!

199
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,589
No!

200
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,174
Greta?

201
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,724
Go.
FINN: Get me out of here!

202
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,685
No!
Go.

203
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,894
FINN: No!

204
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,470
Stop her!

205
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,593
Catch her!

206
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,312
Seize her!

207
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,466
Get to the gate!

208
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,488
Bring her back to me!

209
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,051
How is it that
an innocent young girl

210
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,134
makes a fool
of my brother?

211
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,222
Armed only with a nail.

212
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,817
If she'd had a sword,

213
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,229
she would have
taken my kingdom.

214
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,158
"Bring me
the King's daughter,"

215
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:10,915
and you let her slip right through
your tiny little fingers.

216
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,824
How'?

217
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,836
You swore that
you would protect me!

218
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
You swore!

219
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,386
Now there's no one
I can trust.

220
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,889
No one. There's no
loyalty, no loyalty.

221
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,551
None, not even from you!

222
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,058
Where is she?

223
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,359
She was chased
into the Dark Forest,

224
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,861
where the men lost her.

225
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,774
She's no good to me
in the Dark Forest, lost!

226
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,036
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!

227
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,868
Have I not
given all to you!

228
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,548
Havel

229
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,209
not given you all?

230
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,263
Yes, sister.

231
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,224
Quiet.

232
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,063
I have no powers
in the Dark Forest.

233
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,904
You have to find me someone.

234
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,454
Someone who knows it.

235
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,745
Someone who can hunt her.

236
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,840
You owe me money
from my pocket

237
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,091
and money for the girl.

238
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,924
Well, you know, I seem
to have drunk it all,

239
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,009
but you're welcome to it
when it comes out again.

240
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,932
You've gone too far.
I want my money!

241
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,976
Here it is!

242
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,646
The Queen
demands your presence.

243
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,061
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?

244
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,070
Trust me on this, sister.

245
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,287
All right! All right!

246
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,280
Hey!

247
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,959
My brother tells me you are a widower.
A drunkard.

248
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,846
And one of few who has
ventured into the Dark Forest.

249
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,051
Aye.

250
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,174
One of my prisoners
has escaped there.

251
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,809
Then he's dead.
She.

252
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,264
She is certainly dead.

253
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,019
Find her.

254
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,351
Bring her to me.

255
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
No, I've been to that forest.
I'm not going back.

256
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,861
You will be
rewarded handsomely.

257
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,195
What good is gold to me

258
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,197
if I'm lying dead with the
crows picking at my eyes?

259
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,206
Why is she of such value?

260
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,371
That is none
of your concern.

261
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,544
I'll determine what
concerns me, thank you.

262
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,082
You will do this for me,
huntsman!

263
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,713
And if I refuse?

264
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,473
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.

265
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,517
To his knees.

266
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,477
So you wish to be reunited
with your beloved?

267
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,605
You do not
speak of my wife.

268
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,036
You miss her.

269
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,632
What would you give
to see her again?

270
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,219
You know of my powers.

271
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,765
Bring me the girl

272
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,219
and I will bring back
your wife.

273
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,729
Nothing can bring her back.

274
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,265
I can.

275
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,276
A life

276
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,283
for a life.

277
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,092
She can't have gone far.

278
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,635
All right,
do exactly as I do.

279
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,684
It's a bad idea.

280
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,961
Stay here.

281
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,354
Come here'
No!

282
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,609
Will you help me?

283
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,324
Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.

284
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
Sure she is.

285
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,444
She's going
to rip out my heart.

286
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,659
Quick work.

287
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,539
Hey.

288
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,075
Well done, huntsman.

289
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,581
Hand her over.

290
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,047
What do you intend
to do with her?

291
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,958
Why do you care'?

292
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,089
You want her... Hey!

293
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,300
Give me what
I was promised.

294
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,215
You did your job well.

295
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,059
Now, keep your word.

296
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,352
He'll kill us both.
Shut up.

297
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,479
He will.
I said, shut up.

298
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,186
No, no.

299
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,602
I'll keep my word
when the Queen keeps hers.

300
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,894
Where's my wife?

301
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,656
He's going
to betray you.

302
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,160
My sister has many powers.

303
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,999
She can take life away,
or sustain it,

304
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,918
but she can't bring your wife
back from the dead, you fool!

305
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,423
I want her back!

306
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,197
I will find you!

307
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,542
Quiet. All right?

308
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,920
Hey, what the
hell's going on'?

309
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,880
Who are you? Why does the
Queen want you dead?

310
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,215
She wants everyone
dead, all of us.

311
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,629
What makes you
so damn valuable?

312
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,431
You should know,
you're the one hunting me.

313
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,600
Forget it.

314
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,394
I should have never got involved
in the Queen's business.

315
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,403
What did I get in?
Stupid...

316
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,235
Where are you going'?

317
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,576
Getting away from you. You're
trouble, is what you are.

318
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,864
I need to get to the Duke's castle.
There's an army there.

319
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,576
Oh, the Duke's army?

320
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,413
Bunch of farmers and
milkmaids with pitchforks.

321
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,750
I know sheep that
have more fight in them.

322
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,043
I'm valuable.

323
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,258
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

324
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,808
If you return without me,
you're dead.

325
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,727
If you leave me,
I'm dead.

326
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,769
Just for argument's sake,
how much reward?

327
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,144
However much is enough.

328
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,273
At least thirty gold pieces...
A hundred.

329
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,577
Help me.

330
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:35,947
Who are you?

331
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,458
Maybe you should have
asked the Queen that.

332
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,959
I don't trust you.

333
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,626
I've given you my word.
I still don't trust you.

334
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,250
But you have a deal.

335
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,430
Give me that,
before you lose a finger.

336
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,815
She killed my brave lain
with just the palm of her hand

337
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,075
and then she drew a dagger
from her side with no blood.

338
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,993
She cannot be killed.

339
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,489
But there is more.

340
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,376
The Princess is alive.

341
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,712
Where is my son'?

342
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,854
We have word
of the Princess.

343
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,396
Ravenna has kept her,
all these years.

344
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:30,895
She lives?

345
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,866
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.

346
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,403
I'm going after her.

347
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,196
HAMMOND: We don't
know if she survived.

348
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,280
William!

349
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,699
What?

350
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,086
You ventured beyond the castle
walls again, disobeying my orders.

351
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,083
We're all that's left,
don't you understand?

352
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,257
I cannot afford to lose
any more of my men.

353
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,417
I'm going alone.

354
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,549
I will not lose
my only son.

355
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,969
You don't know
the Dark Forest.

356
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,134
Then I'll find
somebody who does.

357
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,429
I will not abandon her
a second time.

358
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,684
The forest gains its
strength from your weakness.

359
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,981
Do you drink
to drown your sorrows?

360
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,987
Or your conscience?

361
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,528
What concern is it of
yours, why I drink?

362
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,655
I suppose a man's
sorrows are his own.

363
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,333
What does a young girl like
you know about sorrow?

364
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,389
Don't flatter yourself.

365
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,091
Now stay close.

366
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,775
You men know the dark forest?

367
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,742
Load and prepare.

368
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,829
You ride for
50 gold pieces.

369
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,750
Does it not trouble you
to serve her'?

370
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,332
Who the Queen?

371
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,165
I serve no one.

372
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,426
Especially that old hag, and any other royalty.
They're all damned.

373
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,226
The King and his true
queen are not damned.

374
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,393
The King?

375
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,056
He's the one that let
the devil in the door.

376
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,392
It's his fault the kingdom's
plunged into darkness.

377
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,645
From you?

378
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,063
You know nothing.

379
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,318
What? And you do?

380
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,742
What's a wee scrod like you
care about the King anyway?

381
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,616
You're barely old enough
to remember him.

382
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,742
The land is diseased.

383
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,415
Nature is upturned.

384
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,539
This, this is the legacy
of your precious king.

385
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,728
Do you need a bowman?

386
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,237
I have a bowman.

387
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,694
Kill him.

388
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,203
I said, do you
need a bowman?

389
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,057
Here, I want
to show you something.

390
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,813
Which is your lead foot?

391
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,189
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up

392
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,158
and you block, and use their
strength against them.

393
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,236
You're small, so wait
until they're close

394
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,703
and you drive it through
their heart to the hilt.

395
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,709
You understand'?
Do not hesitate.

396
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,161
You look in their eyes

397
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,877
and do not pull it out
until you see their soul.

398
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,642
I couldn't do that.

399
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,647
Well, you might not
have a choice.

400
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,459
We have their trail.

401
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,049
Move on. Move on!

402
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,789
Wait.

403
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,626
Is this the edge
of the Dark Forest?

404
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,832
Aye.

405
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,335
What is it?

406
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,063
Troll!

407
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,818
Go!

408
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,369
Run!

409
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,089
I told you to run.

410
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,137
If I had,
you would be dead.

411
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,670
Only demons or spirits pass through
the Dark Forest. Which are you?

412
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,714
We're fugitives
from the Queen.

413
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,000
We mean you no harm.

414
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,842
Where are all the men?

415
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,502
Gone.

416
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,410
Have you got
nothing to drink?

417
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,911
You have traveled far

418
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,748
and carried
a great burden.

419
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,255
I've had worse jobs.

420
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,544
Anyway,
she's not that heavy.

421
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,057
You don't know
who she is.

422
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,552
What do you mean?

423
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,108
Why? Who is she?

424
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,941
Maybe it needs a skirt,
or a dress or something?

425
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,818
That's nice.

426
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,741
How about a face?

427
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,572
Your mother
wants to see you.

428
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,964
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,798
Because I'd think
it was too difficult a task?

430
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,467
You would be right.

431
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,140
I didn't trust you.

432
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,059
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

433
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,721
Our scars protect us.

434
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,141
Without beauty, we are
worthless to the Queen.

435
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,891
It's a sacrifice we made

436
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,318
so we could raise
our children in peace

437
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,856
while their fathers
are at war.

438
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,941
And you,

439
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,360
your sacrifice will come.

440
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,699
You must rest.

441
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,024
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?

442
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,935
Aye, I know the truth.

443
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,197
That's why she should be as
far away from me as possible.

444
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,483
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.

445
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,110
Not this time.

446
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,573
She's safer here with you.

447
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,146
Lily! Lily, come On!

448
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,685
Come on!

449
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,823
Run, rats, run!

450
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,286
Find her!

451
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,710
Find her!

452
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,458
Come on!

453
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,299
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!

454
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,630
Lily!

455
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,558
In there, baby.
There you go.

456
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:40,645
Come on!

457
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,891
NO! No!

458
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,896
Come on! Let's go!

459
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,440
No! We have to help them!

460
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,732
You will. Go'

461
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,822
Come on!
Go!

462
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,064
Your beauty is all that
can save you, Ravenna.

463
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,482
This spell will make your beauty
your power and protection.

464
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,906
By fairest blood
it is done.

465
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,581
Here. Drink, drink!

466
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:47,830
But, be warned.

467
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:51,466
By fairest blood,
this spell can be undone.

468
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,929
Avenge us!

469
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,001
I'm sorry.

470
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,841
I'm sorry.
You're not.

471
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,179
I am.
You left us.

472
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,647
We should never
have been there.

473
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,732
Hey, look at me.

474
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,735
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?

475
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,319
All right'?

476
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,077
You have my word.

477
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,324
Wait!

478
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,718
This is our lucky day.

479
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,005
Oh, no. Dwarves.

480
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,050
The hedge-pig I loathe most in the
world lands right in our lap.

481
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,433
ERIC: Come on, Beith.

482
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:25,885
Is this how
you treat a friend?

483
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,771
Oh! No, no, no,
you puttock.

484
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,557
This is how
I treat a friend.

485
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,276
She's pretty.

486
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,563
BEITH:
And who's this?

487
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,404
Is this an errant apprentice
or captive?

488
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,567
This man is helping me.

489
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,860
We should kill them both.

490
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,404
He's caused us
nothing but trouble.

491
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,200
Skewer him and leave her to rot.
I don't like killing girls.

492
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,208
I do.
Good.

493
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,619
Leave her alone, Duir.

494
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,753
He's got nothing. One silver
coin and an empty codpiece.

495
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,718
Two days we sat here.
What for?

496
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,254
Nothing.

497
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,630
We should have stayed by the river.
What a waste of time!

498
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,767
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.

499
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,929
It's not here, it's
hidden back in the woods.

500
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,768
Shut your ugly mug,
huntsman.

501
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,309
If you had any pennies, you would
have pissed it away on mead by now.

502
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,648
Cut us down,
then I'll show you.

503
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,312
Pull the other one,
you lying dangler.

504
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,483
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!

505
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,993
I have to take this girl to Hammond's.
She's not safe here.

506
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,825
Well, my little heart
bleeds for you.

507
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,615
We should chop them up
and feed them to the wolves.

508
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,999
ALL: Yeah. Yes!

509
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,542
Who is she?

510
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,461
She's worth
a lot of gold to me.

511
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,998
Which I am happy to share with
you stupid little dwarves.

512
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,582
Stop that!

513
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,293
Gold is worth nothing to any
of you if you're all dead!

514
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,803
The Queen's men hunt us!

515
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,135
They're very close!
Shut up!

516
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,303
You have love
for the Queen?

517
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,764
We have no
love for the Queen.

518
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,053
Then you fight against her?

519
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,604
No one fights
against the Queen.

520
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,982
We lost everything
when the King died.

521
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,437
We fight only
for ourselves!

522
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,601
YES.

523
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,320
My father was King Magnus.

524
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,655
BEITH: Muir,

525
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,784
does she speak the truth?

526
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,834
Yes. She is of the blood.

527
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,300
She is destined, Beith.

528
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,343
I see an end
to the darkness.

529
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,893
DUIR: Riders!

530
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,178
They found us!

531
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,892
If you don't cut us down,
we'll all be killed!

532
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,183
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.

533
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,727
You'll find your weight in
gold if you out us down, now!

534
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,894
Shut up, Princess.

535
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,855
Queen's riders!

536
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,899
And they're coming
this way!

537
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,033
We'll take her,
but not him!

538
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,569
What?

539
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,032
No, both of us!

540
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,697
Cut them both down, Gort!

541
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,366
Let's get the hell
out of here!

542
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,246
Move it! Move it!

543
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,531
They're close.

544
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,233
Blasted fairy music.

545
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,815
GORT: Yeah.

546
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,360
Good thing there's
plenty of moss about.

547
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,992
Where are we?

548
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,496
They call it Sanctuary,
my lady.

549
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,539
It's the home
of the fairies.

550
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,048
Fairies.

551
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,026
Clear!

552
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,865
Coll'?

553
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,411
Clear!

554
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,245
BEITH: Set up camp!

555
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,536
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.

556
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,417
Gort, your mug.

557
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,152
Play louder,
you whey-face,

558
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,730
I can still hear
them harpy fairies.

559
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,909
Duir, would you really
have killed her?

560
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:20,573
Yeah.

561
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,242
Of course.

562
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,149
That seat's not taken, if that's
what you were about to ask.

563
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,772
I want to thank you.

564
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,282
It's only a log.

565
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,985
There's no need
to thank me.

566
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,407
No, for before.

567
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,617
For defending me.

568
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,954
Ah. Your father
was a good man.

569
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,119
The kingdom prospered.

570
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,958
Our people prospered.

571
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,795
There were more of you.

572
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,380
Aye.
GORT: Yeah.

573
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,800
The men you see before you

574
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,763
and many, many more,
went deep into the caves.

575
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,313
We were noble gold miners

576
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,312
because we could see
the light in the darkness.

577
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,487
Gus. Gus?

578
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,987
You were just a boy,
but you remember.

579
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,157
When we returned
to the surface,

580
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,161
there was nothing.

581
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:45,829
The land was blackened.

582
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,961
Everything,
everyone was gone.
