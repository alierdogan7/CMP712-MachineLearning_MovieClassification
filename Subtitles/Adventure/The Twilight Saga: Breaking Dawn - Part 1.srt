change her mind.

- So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
- Sort of.

- Come on.

It's a killer, Bella.

- You're wrong.
- And when you die,

714
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,953
what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.

What were you thinking?

916
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,559
That it's probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into.

Every day it will rain, rain, rain

1265
01:52:43,465 --> 01:52:46,551
(A THOUSAND YEARS PLAYING)

1266
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:06,446
Heart beats fast

1267
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:11,534
Colors and promises

1268
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:14,162
How to be brave

1269
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:19,292
How can I love when I'm afraid

1270
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,752
To fall

1271
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:26,966
But watching you stand alone

1272
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,093
All of my doubt

1273
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:34,557
Suddenly goes away somehow

1274
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:40,229
One step closer

1275
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:48,988
I have died every day waiting for you

1276
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:53,701
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1277
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:57,872
For a thousand years

1278
01:53:57,956 --> 01:54:03,211
I'll love you for a thousand more

1279
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:13,429
Time stands still

1280
01:54:13,514 --> 01:54:18,684
Beauty in all she is

1281
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:21,229
I will be brave

1282
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:27,485
I will not let anything take away

1283
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:33,908
What's standing in front of me

1284
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:36,702
Every breath

1285
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:41,123
Every hour has come to this

1286
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:48,297
One step closer

1287
01:54:50,968 --> 01:54:56,013
I have died every day waiting for you

1288
01:54:56,098 --> 01:55:00,726
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1289
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:04,981
For a thousand years

1290
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:10,820
I'll love you for a thousand more

1291
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:16,909
And all along I believed I would find you

1292
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:21,706
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

1293
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:25,835
For a thousand years

1294
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:31,007
I'll love you for a thousand more

1295
01:55:55,824 --> 01:56:10,379
One step closer

1296
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,929
I have died every day waiting for you

1297
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:23,851
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

1298
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:27,855
For a thousand years

1299
01:56:27,939 --> 01:56:32,568
I'll love you for a thousand more

1300
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:39,825
And all along I believed I would find you

1301
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:44,538
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

1302
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:48,751
For a thousand years

1303
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:54,048
I'll love you for a thousand more
