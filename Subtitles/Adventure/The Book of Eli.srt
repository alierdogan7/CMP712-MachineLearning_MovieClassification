1
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,136
You hungry?

2
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,476
You know you've
got to come get it.

3
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,739
Don't play hard to get.

4
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,831
You will like it.

5
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,552
It's cat...

6
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,397
There you go.

7
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:47,176
Leave room
for breakfast.

8
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:33,554
¶¶ I can think of ¶¶
¶¶ younger days ¶¶

9
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:39,042
¶¶ when living for my life ¶¶

10
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:46,226
¶¶ Was everything a man ¶¶ 
¶¶ could want to do ¶¶

11
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:57,156
¶¶ I could never ¶¶
¶¶ see tomorrow ¶¶

12
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:01,755
¶¶ I was never told ¶¶

13
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:07,707
¶¶ about the sorrow ¶¶

14
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,361
¶¶ How can you mend ¶¶

15
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:20,214
¶¶ a broken heart?¶¶

16
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,917
¶¶ How can you ¶¶
¶¶ stop the rain ¶¶

17
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,123
¶¶ from falling down? ¶¶

18
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:35,301
¶¶ How can you stop ¶¶

19
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,733
¶¶ the sun from shining? ¶¶

20
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:48,119
¶¶ What makes the ¶¶
¶¶ world go round? ¶¶

21
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,933
Hello?

22
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,609
Hello?

23
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,504
Please...

24
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:05,299
don't hurt me.

25
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,136
Here, take anything
you want.

26
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,565
You want some food?

27
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:10,579
Take it.

28
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,486
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- Yeah?

29
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,626
That's what the
last guy said.

30
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,718
Could you help me?

31
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,521
The wheel came off.

32
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:26,855
I can't fix it.

33
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:30,297
Maybe if I...
if I could...

34
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:31,299
but I can't.

35
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:36,930
The only good thing
about no soap ...

36
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,936
is that you can smell
hijackers a mile off.

37
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:43,990
I am impressed!

38
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,907
This man ...

39
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,791
smelled us...

40
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,064
from thirty feet away!

41
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:54,816
What does that say
about our hygiene?

42
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,500
What you got there
in that pack?

43
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,402
What pack?

44
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,670
He's got a gun.

45
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,372
Well shit, it
isn’t loaded.

46
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:09,315
They never are.

47
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,459
Isn’t that right,
old man?

48
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,881
Open the pack and
tip it out on the road.

49
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:18,282
Nice and slow.

50
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,770
Can't do that.

51
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,358
Take off the
fucking pack...

52
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,995
and put it on
the ground...

53
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,712
or die!

54
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,459
Are you listening to me?

55
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,504
- I am now.
- Good.

56
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,753
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

57
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,153
Good.

58
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,258
Put that hand
on me again,

59
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,904
and you wont
get it back.

60
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,702
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

61
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,119
Alright, we will do
it the hard way.

62
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,276
Why did you do that?

63
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:09,551
You just cut my hand off!

64
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:16,543
What are you standing
around for?

65
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:17,544
Kiss him!

66
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,959
What did he say?

67
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,958
He's in shock.

68
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,339
I think he meant
"Kill him".

69
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,825
I told you, you weren't
going to get that back.

70
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,926
Yeah, you did.

71
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,363
Who are you?

72
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,775
Where's your water?

73
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,117
They don't have none.
They were going to take yours, ...

74
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:55,841
and then eat you.

75
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,142
It's true.

76
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:04,958
It's in the cart.

77
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,112
You're not taking it?

78
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,444
- Where are you going?
- West.

79
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,416
- Can I come with you?
- No.

80
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,124
<I>No!

81
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,776
<I>Woah, woah, woah...
Where are you going?

82
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,280
Stay on the path.

83
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:57,760
<I>No!

84
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:03,178
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

85
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:10,152
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

86
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:09,002
- I don't know you.

87
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:10,700
I know.
I'm not from around here.

88
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,908
No shit, you're not from around
here. Who are you?

89
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:14,326
I don't want any trouble.

90
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,491
Okay.

91
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:24,706
- Just a customer, okay?
- Okay.

92
00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:30,586
I'm sorry I got to
see the hands.

93
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,861
I'm not one of them.

94
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,944
Okay.

95
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:37,717
I'm going to take something
out of my pack.

96
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,822
Take your finger
off the trigger.

97
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:41,823
Yeah.

98
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:54,303
Oh, sweet. That's
a Fathom 900, man.

99
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:55,604
Is it?

100
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:57,660
I haven't seen one of
those since the 90's.

101
00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:58,961
Yeah, I got it
back east.

102
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,764
- Does it still work?
- Yeah, just need a charge.

103
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,656
Can you do that
for me? Give me a charge.

104
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,215
I got cables.

105
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,911
I don't need the cables.
I can put a trickle charger on it.

106
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:07,912
Good.

107
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,763
I need to get the coin.

108
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,778
Yes I do.

109
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,740
- It's American.
- Oh yeah.

110
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,343
I got a whole
bunch of these.

111
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:29,132
How about Chopstick?
Got any Chopstick?

112
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,226
No Chopstick.
I got cat oil.

113
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:34,116
- Fresh cat oil.
- No, no.

114
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:36,365
It's good, it's good for...

115
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,315
Works the same way.

116
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,781
What about toys?
Got any toys?

117
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:42,920
No, I don't play.
Oh, I got...

118
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:48,034
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.

119
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,448
Okay, alright.

120
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:54,757
I'll have this,
with these.

121
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,565
Oh, absolutely,
those are yours.

122
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:58,841
Okay, give me a
couple of hours.

123
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:00,680
- I'll charge it up for you
- Thank you.

124
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,697
You can wait over there,
across the street at The Orphan

125
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:07,266
- No, I'm good.
- The bar is about ready to open.

126
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,465
I'll wait here.

127
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,336
You don’t trust
me, do you?

128
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:17,051
- I'll wait here.
- Alright.

129
00:24:55,088 --> 00:25:00,301
Carnie, one of the road
crews just pulled into town.

130
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:02,552
They got something
for you.

131
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:05,872
- Books?
- A whole pack of them.

132
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:10,274
Tell them I want to
see them. Right now.

133
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,866
We did good.

134
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:40,578
The one you want.
It isn’t there?

135
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:43,741
No.

136
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,688
I just don’t understand.
That's a shitload of books.

137
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:49,998
You don't have
to understand.

138
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,087
I understand.

139
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,953
Leave that to me and
we can be friends.

140
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:58,690
I have faith in you.
You will find it.

141
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:01,458
Ah, wait!

142
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,482
I got this too.

143
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:13,882
Oh, now this is a treat.

144
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,634
It's shampoo.

145
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:23,907
Go get slammed.
Get some pussy.

146
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:27,599
Everything on me as much as
you and your boys can stand.

147
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,287
Then go back on the road.

148
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,002
Then we'll get you your book!

149
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:35,233
Of that I have no doubt.

150
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:43,522
You're sending guys out
that can't even read

151
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:45,842
to look for one book.

152
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,103
No wonder they
never find anything.

153
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,105
Yeah, I use the
tools I have at hand.

154
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,667
Unless you'd like
to go with them.

155
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:04,337
- What about these?
- Burn them.

156
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:09,165
The place across the street -
they got any water?

157
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:14,737
They have if you
can pay for it.

158
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:24,555
Here. Smell this.

159
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:32,650
One of the road crews found it.

160
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,896
Who knows...

161
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:41,730
It might be the last
shampoo on the planet.

162
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:46,128
And it's yours.

163
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:51,787
Did they find your book?

164
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,085
No.

165
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,512
Outlander?

166
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,321
Let me see.

167
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:49,760
- Alright, what will it be?
- Water.

168
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,478
That's the good stuff.

169
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,210
I got to eat into
my own rations to sell,

170
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,400
so it don't come cheap.

171
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:08,531
That will get you
maybe half way.

172
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:32,517
Solara!

173
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:38,615
Take this and get it filled.

174
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,056
Wait. You need this.

175
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,515
Can you please move?

176
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:08,553
Thank you.

177
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:25,845
That was my cat.

178
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:30,914
Fine specimen.

179
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,875
I saw you knock
him off the bar.

180
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:35,830
No, I kind of shoot it,
I didn’t really knock it.

181
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,335
You raised your
hand at him.

182
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,467
Won't happen again,
I promise you.

183
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:42,629
Hey Martz, how about
another drink?

184
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:46,614
That cat's been coming
in here for 2 years.

185
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:50,565
It's got more right
to be here than you.

186
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,634
I don't want any trouble.

187
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,938
That's too bad,
cause you...

188
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,167
I know who you are.

189
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:11,724
Murderer of innocent
travellers on the road.

190
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,853
You are going to be
held to account

191
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,953
for the things you've
done, do you know that?

192
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:24,487
It's okay.

193
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:32,652
I'm going to grab my things,
and walk out of here.

194
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:35,934
- Alright, brother?
- Yeah.

195
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:21,048
Cursed be the ground,
for our sake.

196
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:29,297
Of thorns and thistles, it
shall bring forth, for us.

197
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:30,872
For out of the ground
we were taken

198
00:32:30,873 --> 00:32:33,048
for the dust we are.

199
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:39,017
And to the dust
we shall return.

200
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:08,692
Stop!

201
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:12,805
Please.

202
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,452
Redbridge!

203
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,973
Redbridge.

204
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:45,819
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

205
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,097
Oh, I doubt that.

206
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,847
The men you killed in my bar.

207
00:33:51,848 --> 00:33:53,448
They were nobody.

208
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,768
- But you now...
- He isn’t got the shakes.

209
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,736
He isn’t one of them.

210
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,045
Good. This is a
civilized town.

211
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,046
We don't eat humans.

212
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:07,760
We don't see too many
people from before.

213
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,542
Not anymore.

214
00:34:10,937 --> 00:34:14,034
- Do you read?
- Every day.

215
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:18,149
How good for you.
Me too.

216
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,685
You know what's funny?

217
00:34:19,686 --> 00:34:23,227
As old as we are,
people like you and me,

218
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,728
we're the future.

219
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:26,986
What do you want with me?

220
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,409
Straight to the point.

221
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,147
I like that.

222
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:33,182
I like that.

223
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,294
You're not just educated.

224
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,179
I never saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did

225
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,478
I don’t know
where you learned it,

226
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:48,199
but I sure as
hell could use it.

227
00:34:49,281 --> 00:34:52,957
It's a little town,
is just the beginning.

228
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,114
I’m about to expand.
I need expert help.

229
00:34:56,115 --> 00:34:57,820
I could use
someone like you.

230
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,204
Thank you. But I'm
really not interested.

231
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,159
People who work for
me live better than

232
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,331
any worker dreamed.
Ask Redbridge, here.

233
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:07,436
Ask the boys, anyone.

234
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,842
Real beds,
hot food, women.

235
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:15,388
Clean water.

236
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:18,581
You could do a lot
worse, my friend.

237
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:21,199
Thank you.

238
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,934
But I got
somewhere I need to be.

239
00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:26,698
Where?

240
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:29,154
West.

241
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:31,423
There is nothing west.

242
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:33,532
I've been told different.

243
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,301
By who?

244
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:44,004
Tell you what.
Stay the night.

245
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,491
Try a little of
our hospitality,

246
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:47,157
See how you like it.

247
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:49,721
We'll talk again
in the morning.

248
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:53,162
Word of advice, Walker.
It's not a choice.

249
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:57,230
There's always a choice.

250
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:04,211
There'll be someone
outside your room all night.

251
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:08,178
- If you need anything.
- I don’t need anything.

252
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,045
You never know.

253
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:04,658
This is for you. It's
water for washing

254
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,163
and some food, some
special dessert too,

255
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:09,101
compliments of the house.

256
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:15,207
I need you to take
this or say something,

257
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,936
so I can find you.

258
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:32,756
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

259
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:34,092
Can I get you
anything else?

260
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,695
No, I'm fine, thank you.

261
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:38,131
You get blinded in the war?
Or the sun after?

262
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,943
I was born this way.

263
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:45,569
I think probably I'm
lucky because I was

264
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,457
already used to being
like this by the time

265
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,685
it happened.

266
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:53,024
Well, thank you,
for the food.

267
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:54,426
You're welcome.

268
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,734
I like your perfume.

269
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:08,601
It's just shampoo.
But thank you.

270
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:11,726
Good night.

271
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:37,054
I don't think he's
going to change his mind

272
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,715
by the morning.

273
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,096
He's not going to stay.

274
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:48,735
He's different
than the others.

275
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,838
You're not going to be
able to make him do

276
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,097
what you want him to do.

277
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:58,065
Who said anything about me?

278
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,686
I'll send Solara.

279
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,809
You can't do that.

280
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,378
It's about time I got
better use out of her.

281
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:17,584
Don't do that... Please.

282
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:21,480
Please, don’t. Please.

283
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,737
Can I come in?

284
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:42,919
Give me a minute.

285
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:55,493
Somebody already came
with food and water.

286
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,590
I got everything
I need.

287
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,685
Are you sure
about that?

288
00:40:09,544 --> 00:40:12,038
It's really bright in here.

289
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:16,340
- I'm Solara.
- Right

290
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:19,071
You filled my canteen
downstairs.

291
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:22,600
Yeah. You're that
walker, right?

292
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:24,585
Right.

293
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,815
If you're worried about
paying its on the house.

294
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:33,696
Paying for what?

295
00:40:35,454 --> 00:40:37,387
Why don't you
take a seat?

296
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:48,178
No.

297
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:51,775
No, I can't go.

298
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,032
I can't.
If I do he'll hurt my mom.

299
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:58,315
- Who?
- Carnegie.

300
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:03,050
- He's your father?
- No

301
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:05,614
We belong to him
just the same.

302
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:07,757
I'll sleep on
the floor.

303
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,816
Tomorrow you can
tell him you had

304
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:13,102
a good time. I promise you,
I will be no trouble.

305
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,831
Please.

306
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:29,356
Knight to b4.

307
00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:38,154
Your move.

308
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:49,460
- So... how old are you?
- Excuse me?

309
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,369
I haven’t really seen
too many people

310
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,954
your age come
through here before.

311
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,170
Well, it's been...

312
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:04,600
30 winters since
the flash.

313
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:09,291
I really don’t remember.

314
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,779
Do you remember
what it was like?

315
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,590
- In the world before.
- Yeah

316
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,227
What was it like?

317
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,735
People had more
than they needed.

318
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:34,903
We had no idea what was
precious and what wasn't.

319
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,655
We threw away things
that people would

320
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:42,589
kill each other for now.

321
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:46,751
- Really?
- Yeah.

322
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,191
You have a book.
Can I see it?

323
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:52,499
No, you cannot.

324
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,882
I just want to
look at it.

325
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:58,779
I can't even read, please
let me just see it.

326
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:01,339
What is with you?
It is just a book.

327
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,640
It's not just a book.

328
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,300
What do you mean
it's not just a book?

329
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:07,880
No more questions
about the book, okay?

330
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,182
No more questions.

331
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:38,437
I got a question for you,
since you're here.

332
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:41,598
Maybe I'll answer it.
Maybe I won't.

333
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:44,768
Where do you get
your water?

334
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:47,212
I can't tell you that.

335
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,062
You can't tell me
or you don’t know?

336
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:51,022
Oh, I know.

337
00:43:51,023 --> 00:43:54,560
But if you're not
talking about the book,

338
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:57,801
I'm not talking
about the water.

339
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,759
You're something else.

340
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,683
Alright, I got another
question for you.

341
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,985
Great.

342
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:07,008
You hungry?

343
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:09,775
There's a lot of food there.

344
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,682
More than I can eat.

345
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,619
Tell you what. We
can share it,

346
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,871
like old people used to.

347
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:25,562
- Okay.
- Okay?

348
00:44:29,828 --> 00:44:33,309
Wait a minute.
Sit.

349
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:36,205
Sit down.

350
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:43,258
Give me your hands.

351
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,865
What are you doing?

352
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:48,128
Trust me, give me
your hands.

353
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,703
Close your eyes.

354
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:58,863
Dear Lord, we thank
you for this meal.

355
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:02,805
We thank you for
a warm bed and

356
00:45:02,806 --> 00:45:04,961
roof over our head
on cold nights,

357
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:06,262
such as this.

358
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:11,579
- It's been too long.
- Is this from the book?

359
00:45:13,853 --> 00:45:15,275
Close your eyes.

360
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:21,162
We thank you for the
gift of companionship,

361
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:23,875
in hard times like these.

362
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:25,477
Amen.

363
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,897
Now we eat?

364
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:34,403
Now we eat.

365
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,771
Morning, Solara.

366
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,727
How was your night?
Did you sleep well?

367
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,199
- I did what you said.
- Of course you did.

368
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,456
but I said: Did it work?

369
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:23,986
- Is he staying?
- We didn't do much talking.

370
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:26,343
Solara, honey, eat something.

371
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,598
Mom, give me your hand.

372
00:46:34,663 --> 00:46:36,161
Close your eyes.

373
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,754
Mom, trust me.

374
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:46,959
Dear Lord.

375
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,688
We thank you for our food.

376
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:56,014
Thank you for my mother.

377
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:57,899
Thank you for the
roof over our heads.

378
00:47:02,163 --> 00:47:05,230
And...

379
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:12,359
Well I guess that’s
all for now.

380
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,659
Amen.

381
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,793
That's the word
you're looking for.

382
00:47:21,794 --> 00:47:23,094
Amen.

383
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:27,415
That's how you stop.

384
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,716
You said you
didn't talk much.

385
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:40,963
But did he do any reading?

386
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:45,400
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.

387
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:49,163
You shut your mouth.

388
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,017
Stop!

389
00:48:00,987 --> 00:48:03,432
You're hurting your
mother, Solara.

390
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:07,152
He said he read
every day. Did he?

391
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:12,594
Your mother, would
like you to talk.

392
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:13,895
I don’t know!

393
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:16,024
I don’t know.

394
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:25,538
Yes, okay. Yes,
he was reading.

395
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,237
What kind of book
was he reading?

396
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,506
I don't know, an
old leather one.

397
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:30,805
And?

398
00:48:33,566 --> 00:48:36,299
I don't know, it had
some thing on the front.

399
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,141
Tell me.

400
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:38,628
I need you to let her go.

401
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,029
Show me!

402
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:54,841
Redbridge!

403
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:10,067
Shit! I stayed
up all night.

404
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,460
Where is he?

405
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:14,662
I don’t...

406
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:20,853
I just want to
make sure...

407
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:22,835
...there's no
acid in there.

408
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:25,478
Doesn't matter, just
take these off.

409
00:49:25,513 --> 00:49:27,206
- Take them off.
- Let me dry...

410
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:28,507
- Hey!
- Alright!

411
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:32,821
Thank you. You can tell
them I made you do it.

412
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:36,113
- Say it.
- You made me do it.

413
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,490
Is that thing loaded?

414
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,463
I don't think
it's loaded.

415
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:07,758
One way to find out.

416
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:11,806
Look, I need that book.

417
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:15,665
I mean I want
the book. And you.

418
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:17,921
If you make me choose,

419
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:20,526
I'll kill you,
I'll take the book.

420
00:50:21,736 --> 00:50:24,312
Why? Why do you want it?

421
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:30,912
I grew up with it.
I know its power.

422
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:33,859
And if you read it,
then so do you.

423
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,172
That's why they burned
them all after the war.

424
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:41,696
Just staying alive
is an act of faith,

425
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:43,153
building this town
is an even bigger

426
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:46,785
act of faith. But they
don't understand that.

427
00:50:47,204 --> 00:50:48,871
None of them do.

428
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:52,090
And I don’t have the
right words to help them,

429
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,292
but the book does.

430
00:50:56,366 --> 00:50:59,297
And I admit...

431
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:01,551
I've had to do things,
many many things

432
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:04,508
I hate to build this,
I confess that.

433
00:51:06,218 --> 00:51:09,492
But if we had that book,

434
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:10,492
I wouldn't have to.

435
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:17,615
Can you imagine how
different, how righteous

436
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,257
this little world
could be if we had

437
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:21,265
the right words for our faith.

438
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:22,634
The people would truly
understand why

439
00:51:22,635 --> 00:51:23,952
they're here and what
they're doing,

440
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:27,516
they wouldn't need any
other uglier motivations.

441
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:31,405
It's not right to keep
that book hidden away,

442
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:34,441
it's meant to be
shared with others.

443
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,525
It's meant to be spread.

444
00:51:37,526 --> 00:51:38,984
Isn't that what you want?

445
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:42,257
With all my heart and soul.

446
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,098
I always believed that
I'd find a place where

447
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:51,734
this book belongs,
where it was needed.

448
00:51:53,763 --> 00:51:55,843
I haven't found it yet.

449
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,846
I love this guy.

450
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,377
I love this guy.

451
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:17,376
Shoot him. Please.

452
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:41,003
What are you
standing around for?

453
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,007
Take him out, goddamnit!

454
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,340
Take him out!

455
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,750
I don't like being followed.

456
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:53,245
I want to come with you.

457
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:56,381
- No you don't.
- I hate it here.

458
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,094
Then change it.

459
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,412
My mother thinks I'll
be safer with you.

460
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:09,890
I'll take you to where
we get our water.

461
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:13,065
You can have all
that you can carry.

462
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:23,440
I mean all that
we can carry.

463
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,558
Carnegie knows about two
more springs up North.

464
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:35,257
He says he's going to
build more towns.

465
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:38,804
How did he know
about this one?

466
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:42,436
He's been here.
When he was young.

467
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:46,412
In the world before.

468
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:49,635
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

469
00:55:52,093 --> 00:55:54,202
We really better hurry.

470
00:55:57,858 --> 00:55:58,858
Shoot.

471
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:00,503
I think I left my
glasses inside.

472
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:01,315
Can you take a look for me?

473
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,316
I'll look out here.

474
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,304
What are you doing?

475
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:16,897
You are such a liar.

476
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:21,477
I'm not a liar.

477
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,589
You said I could
come with you,

478
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,326
if you got your water.

479
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:27,176
I didn't say that.
You said that.

480
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:29,688
Besides, the road's
no place for you.

481
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,245
Much worse than
you think.

482
00:56:33,441 --> 00:56:34,693
Good bye, Solara.

483
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:35,981
Nice knowing you,
I mean that.

484
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:38,983
- Hey.
- Yeah?

485
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:40,284
Fuck you!

486
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,880
Have you washed your
filthy fucking hands?

487
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:01,412
Twice, Sir.
With your soap.

488
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:07,160
Put a crew together.
We're going after them.

489
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:12,362
- For a fucking book.
- It's not a fucking book!

490
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:14,696
It's a weapon!

491
00:57:15,504 --> 00:57:18,215
A weapon that aims
right at the hearts

492
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:20,114
and minds of the
weak and desperate.

493
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:23,655
It will give us
control of them!

494
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,991
If we want to rule more
than one small fucking town,

495
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:30,466
we have to have it.

496
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:32,465
People will come from
all over and do exactly

497
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:38,352
what I tell them if the
words are from the book.

498
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:45,639
It's happened before,
and it will happen again.

499
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,521
All we need is that book.

500
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:04,759
Then I want Solara.

501
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,254
Are you
bargaining with me?

502
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:15,796
Is this a deal
we're making?

503
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,019
We lost a lot of men.

504
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,564
You need me
more than ever.

505
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:25,313
When you say that
book's worth the trouble.

506
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:29,669
Well I believe you.

507
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,480
But I want Solara for it.

508
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,995
Why not?
Why not?

509
00:58:48,954 --> 00:58:51,570
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

510
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,944
Which way are
we heading?

511
00:59:27,845 --> 00:59:29,146
West.

512
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,860
Hello?

513
01:00:10,957 --> 01:00:13,479
Can anyone help me?

514
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:17,518
Hello, is anybody there?

515
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,916
Are you okay?

516
01:00:29,984 --> 01:00:32,237
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

517
01:00:32,238 --> 01:00:35,116
You go along,
I'll be okay.

518
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:37,304
- Let me just...
- No! Really, please!

519
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:41,328
I'm fine, really. I need
a man to help me...

520
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:43,848
You just go along.

521
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,449
It's okay, it will just
take a minute.

522
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,909
I'm fine. Please...

523
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:13,466
Help!

524
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,949
Get off me!

525
01:03:32,045 --> 01:03:33,943
Hold them there.

526
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:46,035
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear that?

527
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,892
Don't move.

528
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:15,772
Take the wire off
of that. Spool it up.

529
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:18,966
- What is that?
- Dinner.

530
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:41,400
It's like he's
protected somehow.

531
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,500
Like there's nothing
that can touch him.

532
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,990
He's just a fucking man.

533
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:51,527
You put a bullet in him

534
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,069
he'll go down
like any other man.

535
01:04:59,326 --> 01:05:00,698
Still warm.

536
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:06,606
No more than a
few hours dead.

537
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:12,101
He can't be far.

538
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,859
Son of a bitch.

539
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:26,237
Solara.

540
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:29,539
You sure you
still want her?

541
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:35,368
It's going to be
dark soon.

542
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,183
We can't track
them at night,

543
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:37,484
they'll see us coming.

544
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:42,790
We'll drive right past
them and never know it.

545
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,791
He's right.

546
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:48,613
They're on foot. Tired.
They'll have to sleep.

547
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:52,353
We'll make up the
ground tomorrow.

548
01:05:52,354 --> 01:05:54,498
We'll have them
before morning, Sam.

549
01:05:55,988 --> 01:05:59,145
That better be
a guarantee.

550
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:18,373
Do you really read the
same book every day?

551
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:19,674
Without fail.

552
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,976
Will you read some to me?

553
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:29,875
Please.

554
01:06:35,185 --> 01:06:42,155
The Lord is my Sheppard.
I shall not want;

555
01:06:42,156 --> 01:06:47,476
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

556
01:06:47,477 --> 01:06:50,765
He leads me beside
still waters;

557
01:06:50,766 --> 01:06:54,538
He restores my soul.

558
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:57,645
He leaded me in paths
of righteousness

559
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,946
for His name's sake.

560
01:07:03,002 --> 01:07:04,251
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

561
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:06,823
of the shadow
of death,

562
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:09,851
I will fear no evil;

563
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:10,852
for Thou art with me

564
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:15,433
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?

565
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,681
- Did you write that?
- Yes I did.

566
01:07:18,682 --> 01:07:22,068
- Really?
- No.

567
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,476
That was around
a long time before

568
01:07:25,477 --> 01:07:28,108
you and I got here,
that’s for sure.

569
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:35,174
What did you mean
when you said it's

570
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:36,475
not just any book?

571
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:48,528
It's the only one.

572
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:52,742
Really?

573
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,585
After the war people
made it their business

574
01:07:54,586 --> 01:07:58,872
to find and destroy any
that the fires didn't get already,

575
01:07:58,873 --> 01:07:59,959
some people say this
was the reason

576
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,511
for the war in the first place.

577
01:08:04,035 --> 01:08:08,433
Anyway, it's the only
one that survived.

578
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,665
How did you get it?

579
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:22,383
They said that the war,
tore a hole in the sky.

580
01:08:22,384 --> 01:08:23,967
You probably
heard the stories.

581
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:24,968
Yeah.

582
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:29,948
Tore a hole in the sky,
sun came down,

583
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:31,448
and burned everything.

584
01:08:32,014 --> 01:08:34,335
Everything and
everybody.

585
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,843
You were lucky, to
hole up and hide in

586
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:39,892
a place like this,
or underground.

587
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,839
Most people weren't lucky.

588
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,783
So, a year later we
started coming out.

589
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:51,746
People wandering around.

590
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:54,611
Not knowing what
I was going to do.

591
01:08:54,888 --> 01:08:58,821
Trying to find a place to survive.

592
01:08:59,362 --> 01:09:04,353
One day, I heard a voice.
It's hard to explain,

593
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:10,159
but it was like if it was
coming from inside of me.

594
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,268
But I could hear it as
clear as I can hear you

595
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:13,269
talking to me now.

596
01:09:14,978 --> 01:09:17,369
What did this voice say?

597
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:22,766
It led me ... to a place
where I found the book ...

598
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:25,859
buried, under some rubble.

599
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:33,914
The voice told me to
carry the book out West.

600
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:37,634
It told me a path had
been laid out for me,

601
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:41,437
that I'd be led to a
place where the book

602
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:42,738
would be safe.

603
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:49,533
Told me that I'd
be protected,

604
01:09:49,534 --> 01:09:52,997
against any one or anything
that stood in my path.

605
01:09:55,976 --> 01:09:58,701
I've been walking ever since.

606
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:01,315
And you did all that
because a voice

607
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,449
in your head told
you to.

608
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:05,862
Yes, I did.

609
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:07,515
I know what I heard.

610
01:10:08,822 --> 01:10:09,878
I know what I hear.

611
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:12,323
I know I'm not crazy.

612
01:10:13,029 --> 01:10:15,836
And I know I would
have never made it,

613
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,734
without help.

614
01:10:18,217 --> 01:10:21,184
- What's that?
- One question too many.

615
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:23,705
Go to bed, we've got an
early start in the morning.

616
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:28,526
What are you doing?

617
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm sorry, I thought
you were sleeping.

618
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:33,662
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?

619
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:35,191
I just wanted to
see the book.

620
01:11:35,192 --> 01:11:38,794
Nobody touches it but
me, you understand me?

621
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,173
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand.

622
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:42,748
Go to sleep.

623
01:11:52,877 --> 01:11:54,398
You said you don't know
how to read anyway.

624
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:56,095
It's of no use to you.

625
01:11:56,096 --> 01:11:57,395
Yeah.

626
01:11:58,376 --> 01:12:00,403
So teach me.

627
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,345
Hold on. Hold up.
Stop!

628
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:30,050
You say you've been
walking for 30 years, right?

629
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:31,251
Right.

630
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,817
Have you ever thought
maybe you were lost?

631
01:12:33,818 --> 01:12:35,117
No.

632
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,394
How do you know you're
walking in the right direction?

633
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,012
I walk by faith,
not by sight.

634
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,596
- What does that mean?
- It means you know something,

635
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:45,933
even if you don't
know something.

636
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:47,062
It doesn't make
any sense.

637
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,850
It doesn't have to
make sense. It's faith.

638
01:12:49,851 --> 01:12:52,435
Its a flower of light,
in a field of darkness,

639
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:54,638
giving me the strength
to carry on, understand?

640
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:56,134
Is that from
your book?

641
01:12:56,135 --> 01:13:00,736
No, it's Johnny Cash.
'Live from Folsom Prison'.

642
01:13:00,737 --> 01:13:02,038
What?

643
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,661
Do you think anyone
lives there?

644
01:13:26,662 --> 01:13:27,962
I don’t know.

645
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:31,256
Maybe there's water.

646
01:13:41,103 --> 01:13:42,662
Stay behind me.

647
01:13:47,805 --> 01:13:49,792
This is weird.

648
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:25,716
Who are you?

649
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,545
Travellers, that’s all.
Don't mean any harm.

650
01:14:32,546 --> 01:14:35,861
No trespassing. Didn't
you read the sign?

651
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:38,311
We're very sorry,
I didn't see it.

652
01:14:39,155 --> 01:14:40,663
- What's your business?
- We were just...

653
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:42,724
No business.

654
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:44,858
We're very sorry,
and if you let us,

655
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:46,729
we'll be on our way.

656
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,638
George, look at them.

657
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:50,906
One of them is
just a girl.

658
01:14:50,907 --> 01:14:54,203
Old story. Heard it a
hundred times before.

659
01:14:54,204 --> 01:14:56,155
We get so few
visitors these days,

660
01:14:56,156 --> 01:14:58,814
George is suspicious
of everybody.

661
01:14:58,815 --> 01:15:00,649
I'm Martha.

662
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,995
Would you care
for some tea?

663
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:16,916
How about some music?
It's so soothing.

664
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,218
George!

665
01:15:31,062 --> 01:15:38,055
<I>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.

666
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:39,355
How do you like it?

667
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:52,184
<I>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.

668
01:15:52,185 --> 01:15:54,951
- Is that good?
- Good, good.

669
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:56,852
Great.

670
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:03,039
It's amazing that you
two have survived

671
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,812
out here all by
yourselves.

672
01:16:04,813 --> 01:16:08,592
Well, now. George is
something of a handyman.

673
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:11,970
He did a lot of
work on this place,

674
01:16:11,971 --> 01:16:13,670
making it safe.

675
01:16:13,671 --> 01:16:16,453
We may be old, but
we're resilient.

676
01:16:17,127 --> 01:16:18,595
We've had more
than a few try to take

677
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,335
this place from us.

678
01:16:19,924 --> 01:16:20,867
Haven't we George?

679
01:16:21,134 --> 01:16:22,860
Yes we have.

680
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:25,006
I want to show you
something, come on.

681
01:16:25,007 --> 01:16:27,919
George, no. Not now.

682
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,520
Come on!

683
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:34,851
- Are these...?
- Graves? Sure.

684
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:37,082
It'd be uncivilized
not to bury them.

685
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,254
Besides, it's good
for the soil.

686
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:41,899
Come on back inside.

687
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:44,138
I might be able to rustle
you up some sandwiches.

688
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:46,295
Well, thank you. Thank
you very much.

689
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:48,181
- We got to go now.
- They killed all these people.

690
01:16:48,182 --> 01:16:49,592
They didn't just kill
them. They ate them.

691
01:16:49,593 --> 01:16:51,539
- Their hands are shaking.
- Too much human meat.

692
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,840
Let's go.

693
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:56,042
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.

694
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:57,571
No. No, thank you.

695
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:01,358
- Well, we got to be going.
- So soon?

696
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:02,856
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

697
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:04,236
Are you sure you
won't stay?

698
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:07,425
I'm sure. Very sure.
Put the gun down.

699
01:17:07,426 --> 01:17:10,329
Sorry. Take this. Open
the door for us, please.

700
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:13,438
- Thank you for the tea.
- Thank you so much.

701
01:17:20,763 --> 01:17:22,174
Go back inside.

702
01:17:26,373 --> 01:17:27,345
George, what's wrong?

703
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:29,827
A whole company of armed
degenerates, that’s what's wrong,

704
01:17:29,828 --> 01:17:32,247
and they led them
straight to us.

705
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,795
I just set out the
good china.

706
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:34,921
Fuck the china.

707
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:36,409
Have you got any
more weapons?

708
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:39,731
Weapons? I'll show
you some weapons.

709
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:47,942
Come on.

710
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:50,288
We know you're
in there.

711
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:54,791
Come on out and nobody
needs to get hurt.

712
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:00,923
I'll make it easy.

713
01:18:00,924 --> 01:18:03,909
Send out Solara
with the book.

714
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:04,831
What are we going to do?

715
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:06,629
I know what the
fuck I'm doing.

716
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,220
Wait, wait.
-- That's all I want

717
01:18:08,221 --> 01:18:09,221
is the book!

718
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:10,987
And the girl.

719
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,425
They isn’t coming out.

720
01:18:41,148 --> 01:18:44,381
Shit! Get down!
Everybody down!

721
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,912
Hey! You know that
voice you heard?

722
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,562
Did he say anything
about this?

723
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,275
We'll get out alive.
Both of us.

724
01:19:10,276 --> 01:19:11,630
What about us?

725
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,233
Didn't mention you.

726
01:19:23,594 --> 01:19:24,894
Cease fire!

727
01:19:25,716 --> 01:19:27,015
Cease fire.

728
01:19:39,236 --> 01:19:41,276
Motherfuckers!

729
01:19:46,922 --> 01:19:50,418
<I>Over on the side!
Over on the side!

730
01:19:53,254 --> 01:19:54,866
Fucking bastards!

731
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,262
Hold your fire!

732
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,540
- What are they doing?
- Nothing good.

733
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:20,535
Where is the book?

734
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:29,087
Check his pack.

735
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:48,874
It isn’t here.

736
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:54,934
This is your last chance.
You give it up, or

737
01:21:54,935 --> 01:21:57,344
I swear I'll bury
you out here.

738
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,705
Son-of-a...
Let's try this again.

739
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:18,196
- Carnegie!
- What!?

740
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:32,502
Now. Where's the book?

741
01:22:36,607 --> 01:22:39,233
Give him the book.
Please.

742
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,554
Don't tell him.

743
01:22:55,113 --> 01:22:58,254
It's in the house.
Back of the TV.

744
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:03,152
- Go check the TV.
- The what?

745
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:04,551
You're fucking shitting me.

746
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:05,552
You go!

747
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:07,912
Go!

748
01:23:43,624 --> 01:23:47,442
Ask and you
shall receive.

749
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,627
God is good,
is he not?

750
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,133
All the time.

751
01:23:59,483 --> 01:24:01,302
Not all the time.

752
01:24:28,529 --> 01:24:29,829
No!

753
01:25:14,817 --> 01:25:15,558
You see?

754
01:25:18,151 --> 01:25:19,473
What did I tell you?

755
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:28,384
He's just a man.

756
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:34,873
No! Leave him alone!

757
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:45,423
Where's your protection now?

758
01:25:46,743 --> 01:25:48,143
Hmm?

759
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:02,055
Pray for me.

760
01:26:05,283 --> 01:26:06,584
Okay?

761
01:26:11,028 --> 01:26:12,628
I mean it.

762
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:40,779
Shit.

763
01:27:42,265 --> 01:27:43,565
Go back!

764
01:28:27,283 --> 01:28:29,738
Come on.
Come on!

765
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,485
We've barely got enough
fuel to make it back.

766
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:32,302
Do you want to
go after her?

767
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:35,677
No.

768
01:30:56,539 --> 01:31:00,137
- Where are you going?
- I'm going West.

769
01:31:00,138 --> 01:31:00,938
Got to go West.

770
01:31:03,775 --> 01:31:05,075
Hey.

771
01:31:30,288 --> 01:31:34,156
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

772
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:35,903
This. This is
all my fault.

773
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:37,377
- No, it's not.
- Yeah it is,

774
01:31:37,378 --> 01:31:38,420
if I didn't come with
you, none of this

775
01:31:38,421 --> 01:31:39,721
would have happened.

776
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:44,164
It's not your fault.

777
01:31:46,022 --> 01:31:47,870
Did what I had to do.

778
01:31:47,871 --> 01:31:49,571
Didn't think anything
could make you

779
01:31:49,572 --> 01:31:50,272
give up that book.

780
01:31:56,366 --> 01:31:58,138
You know, for years
I've been carrying and

781
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:00,024
reading it every day.

782
01:32:02,545 --> 01:32:05,529
I got so caught up
with keeping it safe

783
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:10,408
I forgot to live by
what I learned from it.

784
01:32:10,912 --> 01:32:12,823
Yeah? What's that?

785
01:32:13,899 --> 01:32:15,738
Just to...

786
01:32:18,151 --> 01:32:21,270
Do for others more than
you do for yourself.

787
01:32:23,659 --> 01:32:26,152
It's what I got
from it anyway.

788
01:33:12,907 --> 01:33:14,385
Do you smell that?

789
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:18,908
- What?
- In the air. Salt.

790
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:26,032
We're getting close
to the ocean.

791
01:34:24,391 --> 01:34:25,237
That's it.

792
01:34:27,817 --> 01:34:28,588
That's it.

793
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,618
Get the Engineer!

794
01:36:35,825 --> 01:36:36,902
That's far enough!

795
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,566
What's your
business here?

796
01:36:42,217 --> 01:36:44,709
My name is Eli.

797
01:36:44,908 --> 01:36:47,763
I have a King James
Bible in my possession.

798
01:36:48,032 --> 01:36:50,091
Remain where you are.
Don't attempt to make

799
01:36:50,228 --> 01:36:54,288
any sudden moves, or
you will be fired upon.

800
01:37:10,427 --> 01:37:13,936
Be careful with it.
Thank you.

801
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,526
Careful with it.

802
01:37:32,265 --> 01:37:33,588
Wait.

803
01:37:34,983 --> 01:37:37,983
We've been doing this
for a long time now.

804
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:40,956
Feels like a museum.

805
01:37:41,016 --> 01:37:43,293
Oh no.
It's much more than that.

806
01:37:43,821 --> 01:37:47,116
This is where we're
going to start again.

807
01:37:47,217 --> 01:37:48,879
We've got a printing
press that will be

808
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:50,657
operational quite soon.

809
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:52,433
We're going to teach
people about the

810
01:37:52,473 --> 01:37:53,468
world they lost.

811
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,255
Help them start
to rebuild it.

812
01:37:56,972 --> 01:37:59,507
And look, Shakespeare,
Britannica.

813
01:37:59,537 --> 01:38:01,476
Missing only a
few volumes.

814
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:03,609
There's a whole series
of beautiful Mozart

815
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,055
and Wagner records. Still
in very pristine condition.

816
01:38:08,056 --> 01:38:11,714
But never a Bible.
Well, not until now.

817
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:14,380
May I ask what
condition it's in?

818
01:38:16,085 --> 01:38:19,758
It's beat up. But it
will do the job.

819
01:38:21,258 --> 01:38:22,473
Do you think
I could see it?

820
01:38:23,127 --> 01:38:24,363
Yes, you may.

821
01:38:32,075 --> 01:38:34,030
- That's it. It's open.
- Good.

822
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:10,423
Do you have anything
to write on?

823
01:39:10,424 --> 01:39:14,071
Could you get us some
writing paper, please?

824
01:39:14,072 --> 01:39:15,373
A lot of it.

825
01:39:17,206 --> 01:39:18,908
A whole lot of it.

826
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:20,552
It can't be.

827
01:39:28,358 --> 01:39:30,309
It's impossible!

828
01:39:31,618 --> 01:39:33,233
It can't be!

829
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,203
Pay close attention.

830
01:39:38,204 --> 01:39:43,641
And write down
everything I say.

831
01:39:44,493 --> 01:39:48,254
Exactly as I say it.

832
01:39:52,308 --> 01:39:58,814
The first book of Moses.
Called Genesis.

833
01:39:59,481 --> 01:40:03,373
Chapter one,
verse one:

834
01:40:06,576 --> 01:40:13,709
"In the beginning God
created the heavens

835
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:15,111
and the earth. "

836
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:21,105
Verse two:

837
01:40:22,978 --> 01:40:31,699
"And the earth was
without form and void;

838
01:40:36,172 --> 01:40:43,729
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

839
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:54,954
And the Spirit of God
was hovering

840
01:40:54,955 --> 01:40:58,057
over the face
of the waters. "

841
01:41:01,107 --> 01:41:03,680
Verse three:

842
01:41:06,163 --> 01:41:18,971
"And God said, Let
there be light:

843
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:21,136
and there was light. "

844
01:41:31,563 --> 01:41:33,890
Where is Solara?

845
01:41:37,004 --> 01:41:41,348
Out there. Her choice.

846
01:41:41,978 --> 01:41:46,889
I tried to bring her
back. She refused.

847
01:41:50,041 --> 01:41:52,825
What did you do
when she refused?

848
01:41:58,635 --> 01:41:59,513
Read it.

849
01:41:59,514 --> 01:42:00,772
What did you do
to my daughter?

850
01:42:00,773 --> 01:42:01,719
Read it!

851
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:04,850
What did you do
to my daughter!?

852
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:24,971
You can start anytime.

853
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:34,170
Sorry.

854
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:39,920
It's been so long
I don’t remember.

855
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:50,471
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?

856
01:42:50,472 --> 01:42:52,933
You have to. Please.

857
01:42:56,112 --> 01:43:01,686
- Your leg.
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

858
01:43:02,417 --> 01:43:04,384
I can smell it.

859
01:43:18,996 --> 01:43:21,968
You worked so hard
for that book.

860
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:26,685
You sacrificed so
much, so many men.

861
01:43:27,948 --> 01:43:30,080
More than you
could spare.

862
01:43:31,934 --> 01:43:34,060
Now, all those people
who were too scared

863
01:43:34,061 --> 01:43:36,989
to even say your name.
They're downstairs,

864
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:40,262
tearing up the bar right
now, did you know that?

865
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:43,966
And there's no one
there to stop them.

866
01:43:44,911 --> 01:43:47,553
And you are feverish.

867
01:43:49,691 --> 01:43:51,268
I can't imagine what
it must feel like to

868
01:43:51,269 --> 01:43:53,207
have what you want
so close and it might

869
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:55,454
as well be a
million miles away.

870
01:43:55,455 --> 01:43:56,758
Stop it!

871
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:07,102
Are you leaving me?
Claudia?

872
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:10,355
Claudia!?

873
01:44:13,294 --> 01:44:15,291
Claudia!

874
01:46:03,483 --> 01:46:07,309
Dear Lord. Thank you for
giving me the strength

875
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:09,098
and the conviction to
complete the task you

876
01:46:09,099 --> 01:46:10,626
entrusted to me.

877
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:38,670
Thank you for guiding
me straight and true,

878
01:46:38,671 --> 01:46:41,614
through the many
obstacles on my path.

879
01:46:47,237 --> 01:46:49,259
And for keeping me
resolute when all around

880
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,369
seemed lost.

881
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:53,388
Thank you for your
protection and for your

882
01:46:53,389 --> 01:46:56,190
many signs along
the way.

883
01:46:57,483 --> 01:47:00,201
Thank you for any good
that I may have done,

884
01:47:00,202 --> 01:47:03,445
I'm so sorry
about the bad.

885
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,342
You don't have to
leave, you know.

886
01:47:05,343 --> 01:47:07,561
You're very welcome
to stay here.

887
01:47:07,562 --> 01:47:09,835
You'll be perfectly safe.

888
01:47:09,836 --> 01:47:11,756
Thank you.

889
01:47:11,757 --> 01:47:14,682
But this is something
that I have to do.

890
01:47:19,248 --> 01:47:21,128
Where will you go?

891
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:23,531
Home.

892
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,826
Thank you for the
friend I made.

893
01:47:31,827 --> 01:47:36,022
Please watch over her,
as you watched over me.

894
01:47:56,391 --> 01:48:00,106
Thank you for finally
allowing me to rest.

895
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:02,241
I'm so very tired.

896
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:06,589
But I go now to my
rest at peace.

897
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:08,506
Knowing that I've done
right with my time

898
01:48:08,507 --> 01:48:10,575
on this earth.

899
01:48:19,262 --> 01:48:25,238
I fought the good fight.
I finished the race.

900
01:48:27,037 --> 01:48:29,857
I kept the faith.
