We don't intercept with Earth at all...

but we come close enough

1206
01:24:21,213 --> 01:24:23,516

01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:16,369
- Is he right?
- VINCENT: Yeah.

1229
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:18,971
SANDERS: Bruce, what do you think?

1230
01:25:18,972 --> 01:25:20,640
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1231
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,077
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1232
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,477
VINCENT: Uh-huh.

1233
01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:27,613
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1234
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:29,147
Because we can only do one.

1235
01:25:29,148 --> 01:25:31,383
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1236
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,052
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1237
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,087
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1238
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,390
so we have to choose.

1239
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:39,025
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1240
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:40,892
We'd be asking them to add

1241
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:44,396
533 extra days to their mission.

1242
01:25:44,397 --> 01:25:46,237
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1243
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,034
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1244
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:50,236
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1245
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:51,404
It should.

1246
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:53,573
Built to last the full
<i>Ares</i> mission...

1247
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:56,175
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1248
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:57,577
But if something goes wrong...

1249
01:25:57,578 --> 01:25:59,412
Then we lose the crew.

1250
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:00,913
BRUCE: <i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

1251
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:03,082
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1252
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:05,685
<i>or a low chance of
killing six people.</i>

1253
01:26:05,686 --> 01:26:07,086
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1254
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:08,788
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1255
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,522
He does.

1256
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:12,025
MITCH: Yeah, well, bullshit.

1257
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:14,026
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1258
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:15,861
We still have a chance to bring

1259
01:26:15,862 --> 01:26:17,396
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1260
01:26:17,397 --> 01:26:19,300
I'm not risking their lives.

1261
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,935
Let them make that decision.

1262
01:26:22,669 --> 01:26:25,438
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1263
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:29,376
You goddamn coward.

1264
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:50,296
- VOGEL: <i>Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

1265
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:52,731
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1266
01:26:52,732 --> 01:26:53,766
JOHANSSEN: <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1267
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:54,633
VOGEL: <i>Where are you?</i>

1268
01:26:54,634 --> 01:26:55,935
The gym.

1269
01:27:11,919 --> 01:27:13,487
(BEEPS)

1270
01:27:14,655 --> 01:27:16,356
(PANTING)

1271
01:27:17,557 --> 01:27:19,092
What's up?

1272
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:20,293
I just got an email from my wife

1273
01:27:20,294 --> 01:27:23,462
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1274
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:25,632
My computer won't open the attachment.

1275
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,066
Okay.

1276
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,569
Let's take a look.

1277
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,608
Uh...

1278
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:36,977
Let's see.

1279
01:27:39,044 --> 01:27:41,547
This isn't a JPEG.

1280
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,118
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1281
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,700
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1282
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,458
Does that make any sense to you?

1283
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:56,096
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1284
01:27:56,097 --> 01:27:58,865
It's a course maneuver
for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1285
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:06,772
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1286
01:28:06,773 --> 01:28:08,007
211 days later.

1287
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:11,310
MARTINEZ: Would it work?

1288
01:28:11,311 --> 01:28:13,245
LEWIS: Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1289
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,881
BECK: It's a brilliant course.

1290
01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:18,017
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1291
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:19,819
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1292
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,988
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1293
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:24,190
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1294
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:27,528
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1295
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:30,930
So, are we gonna do it?

1296
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:34,266
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1297
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,903
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1298
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:38,270
(CHUCKLES) Not this time.

1299
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,208
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1300
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:43,976
We're talking about mutiny here,

1301
01:28:43,977 --> 01:28:45,444
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1302
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,314
So we do this together or not at all.

1303
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:51,449
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1304
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:54,553
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1305
01:28:54,554 --> 01:28:57,455
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1306
01:28:57,456 --> 01:29:00,659
If we do everything perfectly...

1307
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,129
we add 533 days to our mission.

1308
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:08,101
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1309
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:12,738
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1310
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:14,373
where anything could go wrong.

1311
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:17,945
If it's mission critical, we die.

1312
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:19,912
Sign me up.

1313
01:29:19,913 --> 01:29:21,346
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1314
01:29:21,347 --> 01:29:23,483
You and I, we're military.

1315
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:24,984
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1316
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,185
Yeah, there's that.

1317
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:27,619
LEWIS: And for the rest of you guys...

1318
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,522
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1319
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:35,093
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1320
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:36,729
I plot the course and execute it.

1321
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,230
JOHANSSEN: Remote override.

1322
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,297
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1323
01:29:39,298 --> 01:29:40,833
from Mission Control.

1324
01:29:41,869 --> 01:29:44,203
LEWIS: Can you disable it?

1325
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:46,372
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1326
01:29:46,373 --> 01:29:48,807
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1327
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:50,142
We can't shut down the comms

1328
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,677
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1329
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,412
And we can't shut down the computers

1330
01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:55,347
because we need to run the ship.

1331
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,818
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1332
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,852
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1333
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:03,623
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1334
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,859
I can do it.

1335
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:08,896
Great.

1336
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,032
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1337
01:30:12,766 --> 01:30:17,604
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1338
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:23,775
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1339
01:30:23,776 --> 01:30:25,645
so, yes.

1340
01:30:25,646 --> 01:30:27,180
I vote yes.

1341
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:31,051
Let's go get him.

1342
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:35,421
Johanssen?

1343
01:30:35,422 --> 01:30:36,888
Yes.

1344
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:38,056
- Yeah!
- (ALL CHEERING)

1345
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:39,292
(APPLAUSE)

1346
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:43,395
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

1347
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:44,629
BRENDAN: Roger. Read it out.

1348
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,499
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

1349
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,068
"Rich Purnell is a
steely-eyed missile man."

1350
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,468
What?

1351
01:30:50,469 --> 01:30:51,970
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN: Flight, Guidance.

1352
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:54,105
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

1353
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:55,341
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i>
they're drifting.

1354
01:30:55,342 --> 01:30:57,208
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1355
01:30:57,209 --> 01:30:58,209
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN: Negative, Flight,

1356
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,811
it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

1357
01:30:59,812 --> 01:31:01,446
What the hell?

1358
01:31:01,447 --> 01:31:04,650
Telemetry, any chance this
is instrumentation failure?

1359
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:06,385
Negative, Flight.

1360
01:31:06,386 --> 01:31:07,520
Guidance, work at how long they can stay

1361
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:09,387
on this course before it's irreversible.

1362
01:31:09,388 --> 01:31:11,056
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN:
Working on that now, Flight.

1363
01:31:11,057 --> 01:31:12,958
(WHISPERS) Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

1364
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:14,927
I dunno.

1365
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,663
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1366
01:31:17,664 --> 01:31:19,565
SANDERS: Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1367
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:21,301
and inform them of NASA's decision

1368
01:31:21,302 --> 01:31:24,235
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1369
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,072
Sounds like a smart move.

1370
01:31:26,972 --> 01:31:29,941
Considering the circumstances.

1371
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:34,546
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1372
01:31:34,547 --> 01:31:36,382
Crew made the decision on their own.

1373
01:31:38,151 --> 01:31:40,087
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1374
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,123
We're fighting the same war.

1375
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,458
Every time something goes wrong,

1376
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,325
the world forgets why we fly.

1377
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,095
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1378
01:31:49,096 --> 01:31:51,097
It's bigger than one person.

1379
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,601
No.

1380
01:31:54,602 --> 01:31:55,836
It's not.

1381
01:31:57,036 --> 01:32:00,740
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1382
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:05,378
I understand.

1383
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:07,981
Bring our astronauts home.

1384
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,953
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1385
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:16,622
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1386
01:32:16,623 --> 01:32:18,056
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1387
01:32:18,057 --> 01:32:19,492
rather than bring it with us.

1388
01:32:19,493 --> 01:32:23,096
So, as a result, the
MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1389
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:24,463
is already there

1390
01:32:24,464 --> 01:32:26,632
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1391
01:32:26,633 --> 01:32:30,369
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1392
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:33,405
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1393
01:32:33,406 --> 01:32:36,876
and I guess they catch me?

1394
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,445
In space.

1395
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:45,051
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

1396
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:47,886
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1397
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:49,555
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,

1398
01:32:49,556 --> 01:32:51,556
the atmospheric regulator...

1399
01:32:51,557 --> 01:32:53,793
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

1400

1578
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:41,325

1747
01:55:58,209 --> 01:55:59,944
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1748
01:55:59,945 --> 01:56:01,812
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1749

JOHANSSEN: Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1755
01:56:46,592 --> 01:56:48,659
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1756
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:49,961
That's too low.

1757
01:56:49,962 --> 01:56:51,430
It's fighting me.

1758
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,369

1761
01:57:05,843 --> 01:57:08,980
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1762
01:57:08,981 --> 01:57:10,315
He's well below target altitude.

1763
01:57:10,316 --> 01:57:11,983
How far below?

1764
01:57:11,984 --> 01:57:13,583
JOHANSSEN: Checking.

1765
01:57:13,584 --> 01:57:15,520
Watney.

1766
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:17,020
Do you read?

1767
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:18,321
BECK: <i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1768
01:57:18,322 --> 01:57:19,556
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1769
01:57:19,557 --> 01:57:20,891
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1770
01:57:20,892 --> 01:57:22,361
LEWIS: <i>Copy that.</i>

01:57:33,804 --> 01:57:35,407
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:39,610
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

1777
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:42,913
LEWIS: <i>Watney?</i>

1778
01:57:42,914 --> 01:57:44,515
<i>Do you read?</i>

1779
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:46,583
<i>It seems there's
some sort of problem</i>

1780
01:57:46,584 --> 01:57:48,319
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1781
01:57:55,192 --> 01:57:57,128
JOHANSSEN: <i>I have interval pings.</i>

1782
01:57:57,129 --> 01:57:58,962
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1783
01:57:58,963 --> 01:58:00,932
I can make that work.

1784
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:04,168
JOHANSSEN: Distance at intercept will be...

1785
01:58:04,169 --> 01:58:06,404
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1786
01:58:06,405 --> 01:58:08,506
BECK: <i>68 kilometers?</i>

1787
01:58:08,507 --> 01:58:10,943
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1788
01:58:11,776 --> 01:58:12,642
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1789
01:58:12,643 --> 01:58:13,845
Work the problem.

1790
01:58:14,478 --> 01:58:16,846
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1791
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:18,817
JOHANSSEN: <i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1792
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:20,851
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1793
01:58:20,852 --> 01:58:22,653
in the same direction?

1794
01:58:22,654 --> 01:58:25,923
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1795
01:58:25,924 --> 01:58:27,056
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1796
01:58:27,057 --> 01:58:28,458
How much do you need?

1797
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:32,830
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1798
01:58:33,999 --> 01:58:37,267
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1799
01:58:37,268 --> 01:58:39,136
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1800
01:58:39,137 --> 01:58:40,404
Do it.

1801
01:58:41,139 --> 01:58:44,542
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1802
01:58:44,543 --> 01:58:47,144
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1803
01:58:47,145 --> 01:58:49,413
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1804
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:51,414
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1805
01:58:51,415 --> 01:58:53,018
how to slow down.

1806
01:58:55,954 --> 01:58:57,855
Martinez, burn the jets.

1807
01:58:57,856 --> 01:58:59,524
MARTINEZ: Copy that.

LEWIS: <i>What's your status?</i>

1813
01:59:31,822 --> 01:59:33,791
WATNEY: <i>My chest hurts.</i>

1814
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:35,959
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1815
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,394
<i>How are you?</i>

1816
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:38,495
LEWIS: <i>We're working
on getting to you.</i>

1817
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,998
<i>There was a complication
during launch.</i>

1818
01:59:39,999 --> 01:59:41,932
Copy that.

1819
01:59:41,933 --> 01:59:43,967
How bad is it?

1820
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,470
LEWIS: <i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1821
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:47,605
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1822
01:59:47,606 --> 01:59:48,873
WATNEY: <i>How big a problem?</i>

1823
01:59:48,874 --> 01:59:50,641
42 meters a second.

1824
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:51,943
Well...

1825
01:59:52,878 --> 01:59:54,746
shit.

1826
01:59:59,618 --> 02:00:01,519
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1827
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,253
LEWIS: <i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1828
02:00:03,254 --> 02:00:06,489
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1829
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,494
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1830
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:11,962
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1831
02:00:11,963 --> 02:00:13,696
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1832
02:00:13,697 --> 02:00:17,167
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1833
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:19,003
LEWIS: I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1834
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,937
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1835
02:00:20,938 --> 02:00:23,373
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1836
02:00:23,374 --> 02:00:27,110
Yes, those are all very good points.

1837
02:00:27,111 --> 02:00:30,081
But consider this.

1838
02:00:32,150 --> 02:00:34,784
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

NASA TECHNICIAN 2:
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1844
02:00:46,964 --> 02:00:49,833
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1845
02:00:49,834 --> 02:00:51,702
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1846
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:53,003
Not what he said.

1847
02:00:53,004 --> 02:00:55,407
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1848
02:00:57,409 --> 02:00:59,610
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1849
02:00:59,611 --> 02:01:01,645
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1850
02:01:01,646 --> 02:01:02,980
It'll give us a good kick.

1851
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:05,048
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1852
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,952
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1853
02:01:07,953 --> 02:01:10,187
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1854
02:01:10,188 --> 02:01:11,821
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

1861
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,404
Probably.

1862
02:01:26,169 --> 02:01:27,604
But I feel obliged to mention

1863
02:01:27,605 --> 02:01:29,640
that setting off an explosive device...

1864
