1
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,883
There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

2
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,020
It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,491
They're just touched
by something extra.

4
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,430
One such fish was The Beast.

5
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,032
And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,847
He'd passed up more $ 100 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

7
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,016
Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

8
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,486
...who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

9
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,656
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

10
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,663
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

11
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,563
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

12
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,295
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

13
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,296
And on the day you were born...

14
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,410
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

15
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,980
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

16
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,977
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

17
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,786
But on that day I had a revelation:

18
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:06,789
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

19
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:11,623
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

20
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,833
- Your finger?
- Gold.

21
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,898
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

22
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,907
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

23
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,105
And then I cast upriver.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,613
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,349
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,016
Well, you can see my predicament.

27
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,353
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

28
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,090
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.

29
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,135
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

30
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,002
What did you do?

31
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,569
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

32
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,675
This fish, The Beast...

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,785
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

34
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,386
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

35
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,047
Now, I was in a situation.

36
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,883
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

37
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,566
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,932
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

39
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,095
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

40
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,938
This ladyfish and I...

41
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,637
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."

42
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,807
Now, you may well ask...

43
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:41,748
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

44
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:47,791
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

45
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,021
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

46
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,200
...the day my son was born.

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:04:00,563
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

48
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,174
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

49
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,449
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

50
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,453
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

51
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:23,688
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,823
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,628
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

54
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:34,068
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,176
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

56
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,738
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

57
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,974
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

58
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:49,645
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.

59
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,590
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

60
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,721
After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

61
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,163
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...

62
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,742
We communicated indirectly, I guess.

63
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,751
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

64
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,956
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

65
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,127
True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

66
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,894
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

67
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,299
And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

68
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:46,104
We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,980
In telling the story
of my father's life...

70
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,714
...it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

71
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,252
The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

72
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,796
It doesn't always make sense,
and most of it never happened.

73
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,196
Give me back my ring!

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,141
Thank you!

75
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,738
But that's what kind of story this is.

76
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,020
His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

77
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,185
No longer than most men's,
but larger.

78
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,797
And as strange as his stories got...

79
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,366
...the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

80
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,926
Yes. Yes, he's here.

81
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,863
It's your mother.

82
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,275
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

83
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,911
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

84
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,916
Yeah, I'll wait.

85
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,675
It's bad?

86
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,880
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

87
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,787
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.

88
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,122
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.

89
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,129
I'm going with you.

90
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,227
Now, which one's it gonna be?

91
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,265
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

92
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,060
The one about the witch.

93
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,500
The one about the witch.

94
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,065
[Skipped item nr. 94]

95
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,072
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

96
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,769
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.

97
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,972
Well, neither was I, at first.

98
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,349
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

99
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:17,182
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

100
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,020
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

101
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,355
There were five of us
out there that night:

102
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,362
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

103
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,231
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

104
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,238
And not one of us knew
what was in store.

105
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:41,039
It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

106
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,374
...if only to eat
misbehaving children...

107
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,985
...and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

108
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,113
Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

109
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,780
...and make the land infertile.

110
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,020
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.

111
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,323
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.

112
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,897
Your momma's a bitch.

113
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,228
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

114
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,562
- Shit.
- Damn.

115
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:05,904
Screw.

116
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,130
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

117
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,969
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

118
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,044
...there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

119
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,240
For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

120
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,285
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

121
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,185
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

122
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,384
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

123
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,191
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

124
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,493
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

125
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,995
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.

126
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,971
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.

127
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,334
Edward, don't!

128
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,445
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

129
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,275
She makes soap out of people.

130
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,429
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

131
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,263
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

132
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,385
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.

133
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,644
Let's see it.

134
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,258
Whoa, help!

135
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,369
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

136
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,542
I wasn't old at all.

137
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,585
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

138
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,323
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

139
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,356
...it could kind of screw you up.

140
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,260
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

141
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,493
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

142
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,399
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

143
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,146
That's how I go.

144
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,570
Hi, Mom.

145
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,716
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.

146
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,592
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.

147
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,788
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

148
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,191
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

149
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:01,237
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,031
Not yet.

He won't, but go ahead and try.

- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?

162
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,750
Having a kid changes everything.

163
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,721
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

- No.

00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:16,465
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

168
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:21,305
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.

169
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,951
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

170
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,753
Everyone wins.

171
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,291
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

172
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,394
This is not how I go.

173
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,692
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

174
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,665
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.

175
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,532
No, she was old and probably senile.

176
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:52,803
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

177
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,207
So how does it happen?

178
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:59,784
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

179
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,819
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

180
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,821
Look at us. We're talking fine.

181
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,823
We're storytellers, both of us.

182
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,557
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

183
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,629
Dad...

184
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,974
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

185
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,468
You mean while I'm here.

186
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,642
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

187
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,613
Events. Stories.

188
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,249
You.

189
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,492
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

190
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,501
- lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.

191
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,699
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.

192
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:01,847
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

193
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,039
And this here, being stuck in bed...

194
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,818
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

195
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:15,488
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.

196
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,563
The last part is much more unusual.

197
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,961
Trust me on that.

198
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,868
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

199
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,733
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

200
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,103
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.

201
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,460
Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

202
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,132
Most times a person
grows up gradually...

203
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,766
...while I found myself in a hurry.

204
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,104
My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

205
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,772
So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

206
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,884
...with the encyclopedia being
my only means of exploration.

207
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,021
I had made it all the way to the G's...

208
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,084
...hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...

209
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,086
...when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

210
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:01,164
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

211
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,761
With more space...

212
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,769
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

213
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,136
It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

214
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,869
...was that I was intended
for larger things.

215
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,639
After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

216
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,517
As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

217
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:26,624
...I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

218
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,852
Tigers, go!

219
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,033
Edward Bloom!

220
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,912
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!

221
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,125
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

222
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,972
Until one day, a stranger arrived.

223
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,885
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

224
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,826
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.

225
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,624
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

226
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,825
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

227
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,936
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

228
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,767
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.

229
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,736
I'll do it.

230
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,758
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

231
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,225
That creature could crush you
without trying.

232
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,565
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

233
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,362
Hello?

234
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,035
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

235
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,205
Go away!

236
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,171
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

237
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,317
I said, go away!

238
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,170
Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

239
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,399
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

240
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,075
All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

241
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,216
Why are you here?

242
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,050
So you can eat me.

243
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,418
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

244
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,227
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

245
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,229
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

246
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,892
So I guess, well...

247
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:35,266
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

248
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,447
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

249
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,189
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

250
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,987
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

251
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,855
Here.

252
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,357
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

253
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,932
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

254
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:11,032
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

255
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,008
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

256
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,272
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

257
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,316
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

258
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,817
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

259
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,354
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

260
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,924
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

261
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,928
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.

262
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,997
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

263
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,191
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

264
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,496
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

265
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,373
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.

266
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,035
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...

267
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:52,046
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

268
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,014
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

269
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,212
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

270
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,517
So, what do you say? Join me?

271
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,022
Okay.

272
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,889
Okay.

273
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,295
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

274
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,318
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

275
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,018
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

276
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,890
But take with you
this key to the city...

277
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,999
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

278
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,194
...all our doors are open to you.

279
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,839
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

280
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,112
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

281
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,222
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

282
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:10,122
But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

283
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,525
She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

284
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,963
...gets that way
by never being caught.

285
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,045
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.

286
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:40,451
[Skipped item nr. 286]

287
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,617
There were two roads out of Ashton:

288
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,860
A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.

289
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,964
People didn't use
the old one anymore...

290
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,963
...and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

291
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,263
Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

292
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:57,534
...this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

293
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,471
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

294
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,414
He was going to Paris, France.

295
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,075
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

296
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,379
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

297
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:15,151
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

298
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,420
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

299
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,359
Here.

300
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,899
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

301
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,545
Why, you son of a...

302
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,474
Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

303
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:41,408
...will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

304
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,516
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

305
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,381
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

306
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:55,616
...the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

307
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,646
Friend! Welcome to you!

308
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,192
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.

309
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,353
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.

310
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,624
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

311
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,234
We weren't expecting you yet.

312
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,462
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.

313
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,303
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

314
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,838
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

315
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,282
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.

316
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,353
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

317
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,681
What is this place?

318
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,223
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

319
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,692
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

320
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,264
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

321
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,367
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

322
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:48,801
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

323
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,869
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

324
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,302
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

325
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,381
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

326
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,877
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

327
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,777
It truly is.

328
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,491
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

329
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,830
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

330
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,564
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

331
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,470
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

332
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,410
Hey! Jenny!

333
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,881
Come back here!

334
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,954
Jenny!

335
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,437
Hey, I need those.

336
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,312
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.

337
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,879
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

338
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,920
I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

339
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,955
...the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

340
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,492
I've been working on this poem
for 12 years.

341
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,464
Really?

342
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:03,803
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

343
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,765
May I?

344
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,691
It's only three lines long.

345
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,368
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

346
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,929
I got him!

347
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,340
There's leeches in there.

348
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,117
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?

349
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,817
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?

350
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,715
Yes, she was.

351
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,090
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

352
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,789
Fish looks different
to different people.

353
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,899
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

354
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,796
...back from the dead.

355
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,041
Oh, darn.

356
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,379
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

357
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,542
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18,
you'll be 28.

358
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,386
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.

359
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,927
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

360
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,893
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

361
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,428
Hey, Edward!

362
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:26,065
[Skipped item nr. 362]

363
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:26,210
[Skipped item nr. 363]

364
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,169
Roses are red
Violets are blue

365
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,908
I love Spectre...

366
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,690
Excuse me.

367
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,230
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

368
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,660
What?

369
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,865
I said, you're quite a catch.

370
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,892
I have to leave.

371
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,230
Tonight.

372
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,997
Why?

373
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,905
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

374
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,669
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

375
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:38,747
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

376
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,978
But no one's ever left.

377
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,620
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

378
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,291
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

379
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,958
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.

380
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,263
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.

381
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,774
Promise me you'll come back.

382
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,816
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

383
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,150
That night,
I reached two conclusions.

384
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:55,314
The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

385
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,254
The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

386
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,900
These woods would become
my graveyard.

387
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:11,040
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

388
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,167
After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

389
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,629
And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

390
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,733
This isn't how I die.

391
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,413
Friend.

392
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,950
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.

393
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,671
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

394
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,243
...in the most recent Newsweek.

395
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,279
Really?

396
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,882
That's just wonderful.

397
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,154
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

398
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,852
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

399
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,198
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

400
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,905
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

401
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,209
Really?

402
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,148
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

403
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,187
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

404
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,088
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

405
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:15,958
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

406
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,829
Everything but religion.

407
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,198
Why not religion, Dad?

408
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:26,500
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

409
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,144
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

410
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,878
Oh, so you know.

411
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,962
Hello.

412
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,405
Hi. How are you feeling?

413
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,279
Oh, I was dreaming.

414
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,545
What were you dreaming about?

415
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,944
Oh, I don't usually remember...

416
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,387
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

417
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,888
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

418
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,088
Like one night, I had a dream...

419
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:27,067
...where this crow came and said:

420
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,797
"Your aunt is gonna die."

421
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,104
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

422
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,442
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

423
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,177
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

424
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,453
That's terrible.

425
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:50,356
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

426
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:55,126
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

427
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,032
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

428
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,939
I didn't know what to do.

429
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,970
I finally told my father, but he said:

430
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:12,980
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

431
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,983
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

432
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,613
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

433
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:26,019
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

434
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,357
"Your daddy's gonna die."

435
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:34,971
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

436
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,903
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

437
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,239
...like he was waiting
for the ax to fall all day.

438
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,075
He said to my mother:

439
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:48,014
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

440
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:52,144
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

441
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:57,419
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

442
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,897
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

443
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:10,268
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.

444
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:14,571
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

445
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,173
Please?

446
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,239
All right.

447
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,644
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

448
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,314
There is a great one
of you and my father.

449
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,294
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

450
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,098
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

451
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,437
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

452
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:49,443
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.

453
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,241
Will never told you?

454
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,281
Probably just as well.

455
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,114
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

456
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:01,416
All the facts, none of the flavor.

457
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,289
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

458
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,563
Well, it's not a short one.

459
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:10,462
[Skipped item nr. 459]

460
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,403
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

461
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,164
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

462
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,070
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

463
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,175
Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

464
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:25,113
...I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

465
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,244
Coco! Coco! There they are.

466
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,782
Ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,748
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

468
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:12,322
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

469
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:18,198
But I've traveled
to the five corners of the world...

470
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:25,532
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

471
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,482
When I met this man...

472
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,379
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

473
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:39,545
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

474
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,049
Because when you worked
beside him...

475
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,689
...he blocked out the daylight!

476
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,490
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

477
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:56,196
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

478
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,809
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

479
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,571
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

480
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,805
...he will not hurt her...

481
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,718
...because he is our own gentle giant.

482
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:16,318
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

483
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,474
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

484
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,946
...thank y'all for coming.

485
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,719
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

486
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,848
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

487
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,590
And I met mine, almost.

488
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:03,597
They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

489
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,291
And that's true.

490
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,574
What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

491
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,013
...it moves extra fast to catch up.

492
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,388
What's your name?

493
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:37,559
- It's Karl.
- Karl.

494
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:48,562
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

495
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,605
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?

496
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,644
- Nope.
- Great.

497
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,838
Here you go.

498
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,712
Here you are.

499
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,719
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

500
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,086
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

501
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,100
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

502
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,476
Hey, kid.

503
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,944
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.

504
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,911
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.

505
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,748
Pleased to meet you.

506
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,920
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

507
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,463
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

508
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,794
"Depressed"?

509
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,837
See? The big guy likes it.

510
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,733
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

511
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,971
I know it. But I lost her.

512
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,514
Oh, tough break.

513
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,551
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

514
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,783
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

515
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,991
Damn, kid.

516
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,666
Let me guess. Real pretty?

517
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,800
Reddish-blondish hair?

518
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,900
Blue dress?

519
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,931
Yeah!

520
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:36,078
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

521
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,607
Who is she? Where does she live?

522
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,515
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

523
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:45,052
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.

524
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:49,750
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

525
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,860
You don't have a plan or a job.

526
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,519
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

527
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,866
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

528
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,766
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

529
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,542
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

530
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,177
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

531
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,839
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.

532
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,645
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

533
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,851
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

534
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,025
And I may not have much...

535
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,923
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

536
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,828
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

537
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,168
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

538
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,100
...and you won't have to pay me.

539
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:43,112
You just have to tell me who she is.

540
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,718
Every month you work for me...

541
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,217
...l'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

542
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,752
Let's get started.

543
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,805
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

544
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,780
I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

545
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,610
And four days without sleeping.

546
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,651
What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

547
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,015
...who would be my wife.

548
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,128
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

549
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,201
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?

550
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,128
It's been a month today.

551
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,268
This girl, the love of your life...

552
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,740
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.

553
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:57,876
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.

554
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,986
Daffodils.

555
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,853
Daffodils.

556
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,594
True to his word...

557
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,330
...every month Amos would tell me
something new...

558
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,969
...about the woman of my dreams.

559
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,042
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

560
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,769
She's going to college.

561
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:27,344
College. She's going to college.

562
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,359
She likes music.

563
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,896
Music. She likes music.

564
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,196
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

565
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,901
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

566
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,070
...but not her name,
and not where to find her.

567
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,879
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

568
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,357
Mr. Calloway?

569
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,834
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

570
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,405
Mr. Calloway?

571
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,971
No. Wait!

572
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,289
That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

573
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,369
...are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

574
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,965
Didn't kill anything, did I?

575
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:10,309
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

576
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,519
That would explain the indigestion.

577
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,993
Thank you.

578
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,928
I was wrong about you, kid.

579
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,398
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

580
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,235
You could get any girl.

581
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,374
There's only one I want.

582
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,407
Her name...

583
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,010
...is Sandra Templeton.

584
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,056
She goes to Auburn.

585
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:59,456
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

586
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,353
Thank you. Thank you.

587
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,465
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!

588
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:17,477
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.

589
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,416
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

590
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:28,045
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.

591
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:07,060
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

592
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,392
...and I love you.

593
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,064
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

594
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:18,435
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

595
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,034
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

596
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,146
...and to finally get to talk to you.

597
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,612
Because I'm destined to marry you.

598
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:34,457
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

599
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,424
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.

600
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,995
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

601
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,258
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

602
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,536
But you're wrong. I do know you.

603
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,680
At least by reputation.

604
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,116
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

605
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:06,021
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

606
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,216
He was a few years older than you.
