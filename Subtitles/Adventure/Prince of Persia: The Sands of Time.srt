355
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,917
I didn't murder my father.

356
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,632
That robe was given to me
by my brother.

357
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,954
Tus did this.

358
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,309
And now he stands to be crowned king.

359
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,036
I didn't kill my father.

360
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,839
I believe you.

361
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,276
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.

362
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,677
But you did.

363
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,312
I promised my brother I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.

364
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,794
(SEDUCTIVELY) Well,

365
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,956
the solution would be to kiss me

366
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,273
and then kill me.

368

Don't!

- See what?

Go for that sword again,

384

Releasing the sand

389

turns back time.

390
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,917
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.

391
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,588
He can go back and alter events,
change time,

392
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,078
and no one knows but him.

393
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,037
How much can it unwind?

394
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,949
- Answer me, Princess.
- You destroyed my city!

395
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,079
Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.

396
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,599
It was about this dagger.

397
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,397
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.

398
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,317
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

399
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,395
With it he could change anything.

400
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,431
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.

401
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,436
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

402
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,714
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.

403
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,432
Greater even than my father.

404
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,595
It was all about this dagger!

405

- TAMINA: What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

411
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,348
And Aksh is the most famous horse
in the empire.

412
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,233
- This will obscure his tracks.
- Tracks where? Where are you going?

413
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,157
To Avrat, where my father will be buried.

414
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,428
You're wanted for the King's murder

415
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,833
and you're going to
march into his funeral

416
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,916
alongside thousands
of Persian soldiers?

417
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,111
Well, Nizam will be there.
He's the only one I can trust.

418
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,752
He'll see I was set up by Tus.

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,194
Step aside, Princess.

420
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,196
Every road to Avrat will be covered
with Persian troops.

421
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,959
I'm not taking roads. I'm going
through the Valley of the Slaves.

422

No one goes near that wasteland.

423

It's filled with murdering cutthroats.

(DISMISSIVELY) So they say.

425
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,632
- Your whole plan is suicide!
- My brother murdered my father

426
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,114
and left his blood on my hands.
If I die trying to set that right,

427
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,354
then so be it.

(SHOUTS)

429
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,836
So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere?

430
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,396
Noble Dastan, abandoning
a helpless woman in the wilderness!

431
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,000
What does your precious honour
have to say about that?

433
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,077

436

it's just another knife.

Not even very sharp.

438
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,876

439
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,679
Of course not.

440
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,513

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,838
It's not your problem, Princess.

448
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,352
You know, you really walk like one.

449
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,238
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.

450
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,873
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

451
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,758
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,

452
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,279
(SCOFFS) and actually believing it.

453
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,356
I wasn't born in a palace like you.

454
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,597
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,

455
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,949
where I lived if I fought
and I clawed for it.

456
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,557
Then how did you become a prince?

457
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,388
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...

458
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,313
I don't know. He...

459
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,233
He found me.

460
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,958
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.

What you're looking at

462
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,472

I think you mean "spoiled."

470

The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.

471
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,079
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,

472
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,919

Do you remember, after the battle,

698
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,076
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?

699
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,155
Mmm-hmm.

700
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,158
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.

701
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,638
This dagger, you have it with you?

702
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,594
Yes.

703
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,798
It has incredible powers.

704
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,790
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

705
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,431
What? No, it was in there.

706
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,879
Then where's your so-called evidence?

707
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,039
Tamina.

708
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,675
I...

709
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,030
(STAMMERING)

710
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,479
Your hands are burned.

711
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,315
Yes.

712
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,393
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.

713
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,954
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

714
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,195
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

715
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,712
It's just that, uh,

716
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,593
Tus is my brother.

717
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,997
How could he betray me like this?

718
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,235
I can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he

719
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,832
never respected you as you deserve,

720
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,632
only saw you as someone he could use.

721
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,398
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?

722
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,396
My service to your father was different.

723
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,556
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

724
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,991
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?

725
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,919
- That was his favourite story.
- One of many, yes.

726
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,718
- (CEILING CREAKING)
- No, that was his favourite.

727
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,990
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.

728
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,914
Wait! Dastan!

729
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,474
(CROWD CLAMOURING)

730
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,715
Over here!

731
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,033
GARSIV: Murderer!

732
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,592
I didn't kill Father!

733
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,079
(ROARING)

734
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,719
DASTAN: Out of the way!
Get out of the way!
