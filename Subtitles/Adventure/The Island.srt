my insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1191
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,718
I find this whole operation strange.

Where's the woman?

1193
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:55,307
She said she was going out of state...

1194
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:57,685
...to look for her sponsor.

1195
01:45:57,851 --> 01:46:01,689
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1196
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:06,902
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

1197
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:09,363
That kind of secret?

1198
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,992
Have you talked with
anyone else about this?

1199
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:14,660
Who would believe it?

1200
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:16,745
Can I count on that?

1201
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:19,331
The only thing you can count on...

1202
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:22,835
...is that people will do
anything to survive.

1203
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:27,715

Hey, Jordan, it's me. It's me.

CHIEF: About half.

We're seeing the same neural patterns
in all the Echos...

1216
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:33,173
...plus every subsequent generation:
the Foxtrots, Gammas and Hilos.

1217
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:36,969
We predicated our entire system
on predictability.

1218
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:41,432
Six Echo has displayed the one trait
that undermines it:

1219
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:44,184
Human curiosity.

1220
01:48:45,227 --> 01:48:50,357
So we're now facing
four generations...

1221

for defiant behavior.

My deepest apologies for yesterday's
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

1231

Your defect in your policy was
by no means an isolated incident...

1232

...and it is totally correctable,
I assure you.

1233
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:36,779
We are calling other valued clients

01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:42,034
"Unfortunate inconvenience"?

1236
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,661
That's a bit of an understatement,
don't you think?

1237
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:47,456
Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

1238
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:51,126
I had a home invasion once,
where they put the gun to my head.

It's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:03,180
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

we can regrow your policy.
