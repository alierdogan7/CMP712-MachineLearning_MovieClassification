<i>what you just said, did you?</i>
- When?

160
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,881
Just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

161
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,437
- and having it be an act of... cruelty.
- I meant it at the time.

162
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,121
Stanley, at the time? You said it
seven and a half seconds ago.

163
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:19,759
Well... <i>gosh,</i> kind of
a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

164
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,759
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

165
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,600
- It's funny?
- Do you love me?

166
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,884
- Of course I love you.
- Good.

167
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:36,803
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa, whoa, hey...
Marriage Police, pull over.

168
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:40,084
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>The Rock is the most famous and was</i>
<i>the most feared prison ever built.</i>

Is it really true
that there's never been an escape?

171
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,766
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until '63
when the prison closed,

172
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,678
there were 14 attempts.

173
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:05,680
No one is believed to have made it

You give a shit?

- No. Come here, fruity.
- Move!

00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,956

You all havin' a good time?
- [Girls Together] Yeah.

179
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,880
Will you do something for me?
It's really... It's really important.

180
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:25,243

[Guide]
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

182
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,042
This cell block housed...

183
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:34,437
the most awesome scum
in America.

184
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:37,166
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, Ranger Bob,

185
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:41,638
cordially invite you
to become inmates of Alcatraz...
temporarily, of course, heh!

186
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,562
<i>On the line!</i>

187
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:51,005
<i>Pretty tight quarters,</i>
<i>aren't they, huh?</i>

188
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,396
Like being a caged animal.

189
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,047
Spend a couple of years
in there...

190
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:59,085
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour's over, Bob.

191
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:08,244
What kind of
fucked-up tour is this?

192
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,485
Gen. Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

193
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:28,003
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

194
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,317
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

195
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,557
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun!

196
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,956
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun?
I got a goddamned gun!

197
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:38,756
If I'd had known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
<i>my</i> motherfuckin' gun! Help!

198
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:45,000
All right, gentlemen, this'll
be our new home. Tom, I want
my command centre right here.

199
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,882
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

200
00:15:54,967 --> 00:16:00,325
Put the satellite over there.
I want to be up at 1600. Let's move it.

<i>- [Electronic Beeping]</i>
- Systems up.

202

Possible penetration point in the shower
room. We're setting anti-intrusion.

203
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:20,165
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It's an antimotion trembler device.

204
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:24,035
It's custom-made. Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

205
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:27,437
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam,

206
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:31,315
and then if they disturb
Mr Backup here...
[Chuckles] we own 'em.

- [Gunshot]
- [Tourists Screaming]

208
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:49,517
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
being detained against your
will. For that I apologize.

209
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:52,280
<i>It is not our intention</i>
<i>in any way to harm you.</i>

210
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,598
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

211
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,122
[Evac Commander]
Attention on deck!

212
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,357
[Sighs]
Stand easy, men.

213
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:11,476
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen.
We are now in harm's way.

214
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:15,526
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last
campaign in a career dating back...

215
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,438
to Tet '68.

216
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,803
Likewise for Captain Hendrix
and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

217
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:24,562
<i>who cut their teeth</i>
<i>under my command in Desert Storm.</i>

218
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,559
Capt. Frye, Capt. Darrow, this is my
first operational situation with you...

219
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,764
<i>and your men, and I have to say thus far</i>
<i>your conduct reflects your reputations.</i>

220
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,678
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

221
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:36,203
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

222
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,243
To this we must
now add resolve.

223
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,637
We'll be branded as traitors;
the gravest capital crime.

224
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,844
Punishable by death.

225
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:48,886
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

226
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,846
were branded as traitors
by the British.

227
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,566
And now they're called
patriots.

228
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:57,603
In time, so shall we.

229
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:03,246
God willing, in less than 48 hours we
will evacuate this island in gunships...

230
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,842
under cover of hostages
and VX gas warheads.

231
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,124
Your destination:
a nonextradition-treaty country.

232
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:14,678
<i>You will each be paid a fee</i>
<i>of $ 1 million for services rendered.</i>

233
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:18,237
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

234
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:22,115
- Can you live with that?
- [All] Yes, sir!

235
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,846
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected...

236
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,840
to carry out illegal operations
throughout the world.

237
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:34,479
When they don't come home, their
families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

238
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,639
<i>and denied compensation.</i>

239
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:41,037
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career.

240
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:43,516
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

241
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,716
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,560
<i>[Phone Ringing, Receiver Clanking]</i>

00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:17,046
- Who is this?
- Mr Director, you have
a very serious problem.

249
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:20,164
A battery of VX gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver...

250
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,763
a highly lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

251
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,678
I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

252
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,235
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.
- This is Brigadier General...

253
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:33,559
- Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps from Alcatraz... out.
<i>- [Receiver Slams]</i>

00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,996
I'll cancel

Get the Pentagon and call
the San Francisco office.

256
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,364
It seems Alcatraz
was just reopened.

a security exercise, walked off
with 15 VX poison-gas rockets.

<i>He lost one of his own men</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

<i>Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm; :</i>

<i>and the Congressional Medal of...</i>

Jesus. This man is a hero.

264
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,439
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr Sinclair.

265
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:16,042
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

<i>Mr Sinclair,</i>
<i>Gen. Hummel is a man of honour.</i>

- Frank, it's Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al. How ya doin'?

269
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,482
I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me?

270
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,286
There are a lot of very,
very worried people here, Frank.

271
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,517
I'll come straight
to the point.

272
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,599
Eighty-three Force
Reconnaissance Marines have died
under my various commands.

273
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:39,962
Forty-seven in Northern Laos
and Southern China.

274
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,119
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

275
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,357
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

276
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,200
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

277
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:51,597
How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?

278
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,121
- I'm 33.
<i>- Well, Mr Sinclair,</i>

279
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,960
you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about.

280
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,356
By your ninth birthday
I was runnin' black ops into China,

281
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:02,325
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

282
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,240
Now put some rigging tape
over Mr Sinclair's mouth.

283
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:08,603
- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

284
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,723
Remember Operation
Desert Storm?

285
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:14,482
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs covered so well on CNN?

286
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:19,038
<i>It was my men on the ground</i>
<i>that made those hits possible</i>
<i>by lasing the targets.</i>

287
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:22,437
<i>Twenty of them were left</i>
<i>to rot outside Baghdad</i>
<i>after the conflict ended.</i>

288
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:26,406
No benefits were paid to their
families. No medals conferred.

289
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:32,320
These men died for their country
and they weren't even given
a goddam military burial.

290
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,842
The situation
is unacceptable.

291
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:40,397
<i>You will transfer $ 100 million</i>
<i>from the Grand Cayman Red Sea</i>
<i>Trading Company account...</i>

<i>to an account I designate.</i>

293
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:44,967

of $ 1 million will be paid...

294
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,561

the 83 marines' families.

295
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:51,037
<i>The rest of the funds</i>
<i>I will disperse at my discretion.</i>

296
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,243
Do I make myself clear?

297
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:56,478
Except for the Red Sea
Trading Company. What is that?

298
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,479
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

299
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:03,037
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

300
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:05,561
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

301
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:09,117
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

302
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,880
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

303
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,755
You've got 40 hours...
till noon, day after tomorrow...
to arrange transfer of the money.

<i>All right.</i>

00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,205
<i>We have to identify the hostages</i>
<i>and contact each of their families.</i>

308
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:31,916
Tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

309
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:36,046
If this comes out, the city of
San Francisco will be in chaos.
I am talking anarchy.

310
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:39,517
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

311
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:43,680

00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,927
it's lethal up to...
100 feet.

317

One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

318

Get the point?

320
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:08,515
What did Hummel mean by
your "countermeasure," General?

321
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:12,316
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

322
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:16,241
<i>Now, the problem with VX poison gas</i>
<i>is that it's designed specifically...</i>

323
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:19,558
to withstand napalm; that's
where thermite plasma comes in.

324
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:22,844
- Gen. Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems...

325
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,919
<i>can burn hot enough to consume VX,</i>
<i>but they're still in the test phase.</i>

326
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:29,636
It's not operational.
Hummel knows this.

327
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:33,197
- We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.
- What's it going to take...

328
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,917
to equip a flight of F-18s
with thermite plasma
within the next 36 hours?

329

All right. We can try.

use of this as a secondary initiative.

782
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:33,203
I should really begin briefing your
guys on defusing and detoxification.

783
00:53:33,287 --> 00:53:37,758
Got a really neat layout here
of the chem round as well as the
rocket, so let's get rolling.

784
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,678
That won't be necessary.

785
00:53:41,047 --> 00:53:43,561
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

786
00:53:43,647 --> 00:53:45,922
The power of this chemical is way
beyond anything you can imagine.

787
00:53:46,007 --> 00:53:48,567
<i>An ecological disaster,</i>
<i>sir.</i>

788
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:50,922
Plus, the devices themselves
are complicated.

789
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,475
That's why you're
coming with us.

790
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:56,998
I am?

791
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,204
You're the expert.
What's your problem?

792
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:04,360
You mean I'm going...
going out there... under the water?

793
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:09,282
<i>Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.</i>
<i>Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.</i>

794
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:11,278
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

795
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:14,439
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

796
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,758
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

797
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:21,635
of US Marines in possession of
81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

798
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:24,036
armed with VX poison gas.

799
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,722
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

- Ah, thank you.

00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,717
You don't look
too good.

805
00:54:40,807 --> 00:54:43,560
In fact,
you look like shit.

806
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:47,560
My stomach's doing
hula hoops around my ass.

807
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:51,242
You all right? I mean, you gonna
make it through this thing?

808
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:54,285
I don't know.

809
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:58,645
I always expected something
like this was going to happen
but nothing prepares you for it.

810
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,844
Now I'm...
I'm responsible...

811
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,804
for a whole city.

812
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,764

813
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:08,361
<i>- [Turns Faucet Off]</i>
- Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

814
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:10,642
<i>Remember, you were trained</i>
<i>for this kind of situation...</i>

815
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,683
<i>and believe me,</i>
<i>it'll come back to you.</i>

816
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,361
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backin' you up.

817
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:18,439
Okay.
You're right.

818
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,446
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

819
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,358
There's something else.

820
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,483
It's terrible...
N-No, it's wonderful...

821
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,956
except it isn't.

822
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:34,163
My girlfriend's pregnant...

823
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,961
and she's...
just flown in to see me.

824
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,686
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight,

825
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:45,476
<i>and I'll send someone to pick up</i>
<i>your girlfriend and bring her</i>

<i>- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.</i>

827
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:04,348
<i>I'm at the White House</i>
<i>with General Kramer.</i>

Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

829
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:10,423
<i>Don't tell me problems,</i>
<i>tell me solutions.</i>

830
00:56:10,513 --> 00:56:14,631
We've spoken to the President,
and I know that you're aware
of his stance on terrorism,

831
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:18,672
<i>- so what we'd like to do...</i>
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

832
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:21,665
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

833
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,983
This is goin' nowhere,
Frank.

834
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:28,271
Well, let me tell you what is: 15 VX gas
rockets into the heart of San Francisco.

835
00:56:28,353 --> 00:56:30,503
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

836
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:33,187
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

What's the word
from Mojave?

838
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:43,869
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma.

839
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:45,830
That is the word.

00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:10,550

00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:15,104
<i>All right. Listen up.</i>
<i>Mr Mason will run point for us.</i>

843
00:57:15,193 --> 00:57:17,024
<i>Lieutenant Shepard will be</i>

00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,388
Pass out and activate

Minicams operational?

857
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:26,953
Roger that, sir.
We are on line.

858
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:34,792
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr Mason?

859
00:58:37,673 --> 00:58:40,585
Let's see, we have, uh,

860
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:45,303
<i>one quart of kerosene</i>
<i>and a squeeze bottle,</i>

861
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:49,386
three washers
and waterproof matches.

862
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:54,184
<i>Use the green flares to signal</i>
<i>when the threat has been neutralized.</i>

863
00:58:54,273 --> 00:58:56,389
<i>Now, this is atropine.</i>
<i>If you come in contact with the gas,</i>

864
00:58:56,473 --> 00:58:59,146
<i>you have 20 seconds</i>
<i>to inject it into your heart.</i>

865
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:02,031
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

866
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:10,786
<i>I have three incoming bogeys</i>
<i>bearing 2-7-5. Range: 6,000 metres.</i>

868
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:19,905
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

869
00:59:19,993 --> 00:59:22,302
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.

870
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,669
- Actually, he's my fiance. Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

871
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:28,665
Okay, well you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

872

Hey, where are you...
Goddam it.

873
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:38,107
Decoy choppers commencing

<i>We only got two flying in.</i>
<i>I just lost one.</i>

876
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:46,749
Shit.

877
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:58,708
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

878
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:01,751
- Your day?
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?

879
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:04,711
I don't... I don't know
anything about you.

880
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:07,261
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

Goodspeed,
Godspeed, Godspell,

882
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:13,511
you never went to
any anti-terrorist school.

883
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:16,391
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

884
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,627
We're going dark.

885
01:00:20,713 --> 01:00:22,271
Night vision!

01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,949
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

888
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:32,505
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

889
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:39,424

890
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:42,311
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

891
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,070
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

892
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:54,343
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

893
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:57,822
- <i>Everyone, good to go?</i>
- Good to go!

894
01:00:57,913 --> 01:01:01,462
- Good to go!
- [Muffled Words] Good to go!

895
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:13,189
All right, so the SDUs
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

896
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,511
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

897
01:01:25,593 --> 01:01:29,063
- Yes, sir. Hendrix,
you lead the patrol.
- Aye, sir.

898
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,984
Let's move! Move out,

<i>They've entered the cistern room.</i>

Thank you very fucking much, Mr Mason.
You've led us into a room with no exit.

901
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,504
Any ideas, Dillinger?

902
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:47,107
Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

903
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:50,981
- Real tight on time.
- You stand by the door. Until I open it.

904
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:54,145
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

905

Through here.

906
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:06,782
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

907
01:03:06,873 --> 01:03:09,023
I just hope
it hasn't been changed.

908
01:03:09,113 --> 01:03:12,867
<i>- You catch one of those</i>
<i>flame bursts, you're a corpse.</i>
- Thank you.

909
01:03:12,953 --> 01:03:16,707
- Commander, you said never
leave his side, but, uh...
- Stand fast, Lieutenant.

910
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,512
Have a nice day.

911
01:03:41,073 --> 01:03:44,702
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

912
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:54,186
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

913
01:03:54,273 --> 01:03:56,104
Nothing.

914
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:58,149
Well, tell them
to stay out there.

915
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,428
Sweep forward!

916
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:10,864
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

917
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:14,628
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

918
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:21,709
Welcome to the Rock.

919
01:04:35,073 --> 01:04:36,062
Mason.

920
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:39,866
That's a no-no.
That's the subway.

921
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:41,784
<i>That'll drop you</i>
<i>into the tunnels.</i>

922
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:44,224
Do it!

923
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:03,589
<i>Sir, the Eagles</i>
<i>have breached the tunnel system.</i>

924
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,743
You enjoying this?

925
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:15,189
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

926
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:19,425
reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

927
01:05:19,513 --> 01:05:23,392
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

928
01:05:27,713 --> 01:05:30,830
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

929

Continue patrolling
the area.

01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:36,710
Sweep forward.

931
01:05:36,793 --> 01:05:38,863
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

932
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:42,467
<i>They're hearing</i>
<i>sounds above, sir.</i>

933
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:45,545
<i>Stand fast.</i>
<i>Down, down, down.</i>

934
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:53,707
West storm drain's clear.

01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:01,462
Ninety-seven paces

Something's not right.

939
01:06:22,553 --> 01:06:25,670
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

940
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,352
Quiet.

Motion sensors.

942
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:59,902

- Deal with it.

- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

It stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

Any epidermal exposure or

on our side at the moment, don't you?

1158

So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

down after 500 feet.

01:46:08,953 --> 01:46:11,183
What the hell
was that, Frank?

1431
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,632
- I said, what the hell...
- I heard what you said!

1432
01:46:15,713 --> 01:46:19,069
- I'd appreciate a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1433
01:46:19,153 --> 01:46:21,428
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1434
01:46:21,513 --> 01:46:23,469
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No.

1435
01:46:23,553 --> 01:46:26,511
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1436
01:46:26,593 --> 01:46:29,585
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1437
01:46:29,673 --> 01:46:32,506
- We're gonna ask them
for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1438
01:46:32,593 --> 01:46:35,869
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are Marines!
- Are they?

1439
01:46:35,953 --> 01:46:38,751
<i>I wanna talk</i>
<i>to General Kramer.</i>

1440
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:41,711
- You've been asked by an old friend.
- Put him on the phone right now.

1441
01:46:41,793 --> 01:46:43,784
- You've been ordered.
- This is Major Baxter!

1442
01:46:43,873 --> 01:46:47,104
Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1443
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:49,104
<i>Put the phone down.</i>

1444
01:46:50,913 --> 01:46:53,222
I thought you weren't
ready to kill.

1445
01:46:53,313 --> 01:46:55,873
I'm warming up.

1446
01:46:55,953 --> 01:46:58,023

1450

1451

Frank Hummel.

1453

<i>or marginalized a great</i>

1455

for that neglect...

1456

<i>in blood</i>

1457
01:47:49,473 --> 01:47:51,782
<i>and equally tragic.</i>

1458
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:56,269
We are at war with terror,

1459
01:47:56,353 --> 01:47:59,789
<i>and fighting war</i>
<i>means casualties.</i>

1460
01:47:59,873 --> 01:48:03,149
<i>This is the worst call</i>
<i>I've ever had to make.</i>

Prepared to go.

01:48:19,633 --> 01:48:21,942

<i>with all due respect to you,</i>
<i>but what the fuck is going on?</i>

1468
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:37,811
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

1469
01:48:37,901 --> 01:48:41,689
So now they think we're gutless,
the Feds? They think we won't
actually do it.

1470
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:44,420
They're gonna come at us with
everything they got. Air and sea.

1471
01:48:44,501 --> 01:48:47,061
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.

1472
01:48:47,141 --> 01:48:49,530
They don't know
we missed on purpose.

1473
01:48:49,621 --> 01:48:52,340
Great. We're not gutless.
We're incompetent.

1474
01:48:52,421 --> 01:48:54,252
That right?

1475
01:48:54,341 --> 01:48:56,901
I don't think
I like your tone, Captain.

1476
01:48:56,981 --> 01:49:00,576
We planned for this contingency.
Load the VX into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1477
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:02,970
<i>The consequences of our actions</i>
<i>I'll face alone.</i>

Excuse me, General, but
what about the fucking money?

1479
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:08,450
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1480
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:10,259
Bullshit, it's over.

1481
01:49:10,341 --> 01:49:13,731
You're talking to a general,
soldier! Maintain discipline!

1482
01:49:13,821 --> 01:49:18,292
I'm not a soldier, Major. The day we
took hostages we became mercenaries.

1483
01:49:18,381 --> 01:49:23,011
<i>And mercenaries get paid.</i>
<i>I want my fucking money!</i>

1484
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:26,537
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1485
01:49:26,621 --> 01:49:29,215
<i>I'm not about to kill</i>
<i>80,000 innocent people.</i>

Do you think I'm
out of my fucking mind?

1487
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:35,453
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1488
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:41,374
Who ever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1489
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:44,134
Stand down, Captain.

1490
01:49:48,501 --> 01:49:51,573
Stand down, Captain!

1491
01:49:56,061 --> 01:50:00,657
<i>Major, I'm ordering you to take these</i>
<i>men to the choppers and evacuate.</i>

1492

It's not so simple, Frank.

1494

1497
01:50:26,301 --> 01:50:29,213
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1498
01:50:37,781 --> 01:50:41,091
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1499
01:50:46,461 --> 01:50:50,215
It has been the greatest honour
of my life to serve with you, General.

1500

02:00:50,341 --> 02:00:52,138
Oh, goddam it!

1594
02:00:53,221 --> 02:00:56,099
Oh, my God.

1595
02:00:56,181 --> 02:00:59,651
Get out of my way.
Let me through, please. Let me through.

1596
02:01:02,621 --> 02:01:07,649
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1597
02:01:27,901 --> 02:01:31,177
- [Grunting, Gasping]
- I'm fed up saving your ass.

1598
02:01:31,261 --> 02:01:33,570
I'm amazed you ever
got past puberty.

1599
02:01:33,661 --> 02:01:38,530
I suppose all this will make a
great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1600
02:01:38,621 --> 02:01:41,419
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.

1601
02:01:41,501 --> 02:01:43,696
I'll spend all my money
on shrinks.

1602
02:01:43,781 --> 02:01:49,094
<i>Goodspeed, come in.</i>
<i>Goodspeed, Goodspeed,</i>
<i>do you read me? Come in.</i>

1604

Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in.

02:01:53,421 --> 02:01:57,209
[Walkie-Talkie Clicks]
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1606
02:02:02,261 --> 02:02:05,731
Goodspeed?
Do you read me? Come in.

1607
02:02:05,821 --> 02:02:07,777
This is Goodspeed.

1608
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:13,132
Are the hostages alive?

1609
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:15,132
Every one of'em.

1610

[Cheering]

1611
02:02:17,821 --> 02:02:22,133
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?

1612
02:02:29,341 --> 02:02:31,172
He's dead, sir.

1613
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:34,970
- How? When?
- Just come and get me.

1614
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:39,297
Womack tore up
your pardon, John.

1615
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:42,851
[Chuckles]
But of course. I knew he would.

1616
02:02:42,941 --> 02:02:46,217
<i>The SDUs and the scuba gear should</i>
<i>still be where we came ashore.</i>

1617
02:02:46,301 --> 02:02:48,861
If you can get
to the Pan Pacific Hotel,

1618
02:02:48,941 --> 02:02:51,819
there's clothes in my closet
and $200 in the Bible.

1619

<i>Room 26.</i>

1620
02:02:53,821 --> 02:02:58,053
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1621
02:02:58,141 --> 02:03:00,052
But thank you.

1622
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:06,771
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

1623
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:12,613
Uh... I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name, "Goodspeed."

1624
02:03:12,701 --> 02:03:16,933
Yeah, "Godspeed." To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1625
02:03:17,021 --> 02:03:20,491
Well, if you fancy
a journey,

1626
02:03:20,581 --> 02:03:23,698
I recommend
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1627
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:25,772
I was thinking of Maui.

1628
02:03:25,861 --> 02:03:27,692
No.

1629
02:03:32,261 --> 02:03:35,094
Forget Maui.

1630
02:03:40,261 --> 02:03:43,651
"St. Michael's Church,

Hollow."

1633
02:03:48,901 --> 02:03:52,052
Is this what I think it is?

1634
02:03:53,581 --> 02:03:55,856
Mason?

1635
02:04:08,661 --> 02:04:10,492
Congratulations, Dr Goodspeed.
You did it.

1636
02:04:10,581 --> 02:04:12,412
Thank you, sir.

1637
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:15,652
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1638
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:19,256
<i>Well done, son.</i>
<i>So, where's Mason?</i>

1639
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:23,300
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1640
02:04:23,381 --> 02:04:25,611
Blown out to sea, huh?

1641
02:04:25,701 --> 02:04:27,931
Yeah.

1642
02:04:28,021 --> 02:04:29,852
Poor bastard.

1643
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:35,370
Goodspeed, where's Mason?
Where's his body?

1644
02:04:35,461 --> 02:04:37,850
I wanna see
that son of a bitch.

1645
02:04:37,941 --> 02:04:40,774
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1646
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:45,935
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1647
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:49,218
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
