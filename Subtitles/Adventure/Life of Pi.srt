168
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,110
Yashoda once accused
baby Krishna of eating dirt.

169
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,982
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

170
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,218
But he didn't!

171
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,988
That's what he told her.

172
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,856
"I didn't eat dirt."

173
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,960
Yashoda said,
"No? Well then..."

174
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,296
"Open your mouth."

175
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,199
So Krishna opened his mouth.

176
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,234
And what do you
think Yashoda saw?

177
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,436
What?

178
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:32,277

I brought you this.

207
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,908
Why would a god do that?

208
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,211
Why would
He send His own son...

of ordinary people?

210
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,349
Because He loves us.

211
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,086
God made Himself
approachable to us,

212
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,989
human,
so we could understand Him.

213
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,658
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

But we can
understand God's son

215

as we would a brother's.

216
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,900

Because believing

868
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:45,652
Hey, come on!

869
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:49,656
Hey.

870
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:54,193
Hey, get away.
This is my bed.

871
01:41:02,623 --> 01:41:05,291
WRITER:
<i>It was a human tooth?</i>

872
01:41:05,293 --> 01:41:08,461
Don't you see?
The island was
carnivorous.

873
01:41:08,463 --> 01:41:11,297
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus Flytrap?

874
01:41:11,299 --> 01:41:14,867
Yes, the whole island.

875
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:19,872
The plants,
the water in those pools,
the very ground itself.

876
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:22,875
During the day,
those pools held
fresh water.

877
01:41:22,877 --> 01:41:25,111
But at night,
some chemical process

878
01:41:25,113 --> 01:41:27,680
turned the water
in those pools into acid...

879
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:31,551
acid that dissolved
those fish...

880
01:41:31,553 --> 01:41:33,986
that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees,

881
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:36,255
and Richard Parker
running to the boat.

882
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:38,691
But where did
the tooth come from?

883
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:41,561
Years ago, some poor fellow,
just like me...

884
01:41:41,563 --> 01:41:44,564
must have found himself
stranded on that island...

885
01:41:44,566 --> 01:41:48,334
and, like me,
thought he might
stay there forever.

886
01:41:48,336 --> 01:41:52,438
But all that
the island gave him by day,
it took away again by night.

887
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:59,412
To think, how many hours
spent with only meerkats
for company.

888
01:41:59,414 --> 01:42:02,381
How much loneliness
taken on.

889
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:04,684
All I know is that
eventually he died

890
01:42:04,686 --> 01:42:06,819
and the island
digested him...

891
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,322
leaving behind
only his teeth.

892
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:14,393
I saw how my life would end
if I stayed on that island.

893
01:42:14,395 --> 01:42:17,196
Alone and forgotten.

894
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:21,467
I had to get
back to the world,
or die trying.

895
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:28,674
<i>I spent the next day</i>
<i>preparing the boat.</i>

896
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:31,010
<i>I filled my stores</i>
<i>with fresh water...</i>

897
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:33,646
<i>ate seaweed</i>
<i>until my stomach</i>
<i>could take no more...</i>

898
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,982
<i>and brought</i>
<i>as many meerkats</i>
<i>as I could fit</i>

899
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:38,751
<i>into the storage locker</i>
<i>for Richard Parker.</i>

900
01:42:40,354 --> 01:42:42,488
<i>I couldn't leave</i>
<i>without him, of course.</i>

901
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:44,290
<i>It would mean</i>
<i>killing him.</i>

902
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,159
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

903
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:49,061
<i>And so,</i>
<i>I waited for his return.</i>

904
01:42:49,063 --> 01:42:51,297
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

905
01:42:51,299 --> 01:42:53,166
<i>I knew</i>
<i>he wouldn't be late.</i>

906
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:56,502
Richard Parker!

907
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:12,118
<i>No one has seen that</i>
<i>floating island since.</i>

908
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,521
<i>And you won't read</i>
<i>about those trees</i>
<i>in any nature book.</i>

909
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:19,525
<i>And yet, if I hadn't</i>
<i>found those shores,</i>
<i>I would have died.</i>

910
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,827
<i>If I hadn't</i>
<i>discovered that tooth,</i>

911
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:25,298
<i>I would have been lost,</i>
<i>alone forever.</i>

912
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,700
<i>Even when God seemed</i>
<i>to have abandoned me...</i>

913
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:29,835
<i>He was watching.</i>

914
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:32,205
<i>Even when He seemed</i>
<i>indifferent to my</i>
<i>suffering...</i>

915
01:43:32,207 --> 01:43:34,473
<i>He was watching.</i>

916
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:38,044
<i>And when I was</i>
<i>beyond all hope of savin,</i>
<i>He gave me rest...</i>

917
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:40,813
<i>then gave me a sign</i>
<i>to continue my journey.</i>

918
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:56,762
<i>By the time we reached</i>
<i>the Mexican shore,</i>

919
01:43:56,764 --> 01:43:59,966
<i>I was afraid to</i>
<i>let go of the boat.</i>

920
01:43:59,968 --> 01:44:03,903
<i>My strength was gone.</i>
<i>I was so weak.</i>

921
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:07,273
<i>I was afraid that</i>
<i>in two feet of water,</i>
<i>so close to deliverance..</i>

922
01:44:07,275 --> 01:44:09,308
<i>I would drown.</i>

923
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:22,888
<i>I struggled to shore</i>
<i>and fell upon the sand.</i>

924
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:25,124
<i>It was warm and soft...</i>

925
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:29,228
<i>like pressing my face</i>
<i>against the cheek of God.</i>

926
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:33,332
<i>And somewhere,</i>
<i>two eyes were smiling</i>
<i>at having me there.</i>

927
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:40,940
<i>I was so spent,</i>
<i>I could hardly move.</i>

928
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:50,283
<i>And so, Richard Parker</i>
<i>went ahead of me.</i>

929
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:55,621
<i>He stretched his legs</i>
<i>and walked along the sho.</i>

930
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:03,396
<i>At the edge of the jungle,</i>
<i>he stopped.</i>

931
01:45:03,398 --> 01:45:05,931
<i>I was certain</i>
<i>he was going to</i>
<i>look back at me...</i>

932
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:09,302
<i>flatten his ears</i>
<i>to his head, growl.</i>

933
01:45:09,304 --> 01:45:12,838
<i>That he would</i>
<i>bring our relationship</i>
<i>to an end in some way.</i>

934
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:17,910
<i>But he just stared ahead</i>
<i>into the jungle.</i>

935
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:24,750
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion...

936
01:45:24,752 --> 01:45:26,919
the terrible one
who kept me alive...

937
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:33,459
disappeared
forever from my life.

938
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:43,969
<i>After a few hours,</i>
<i>a member of my own</i>
<i>species found me.</i>

939
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:46,539
<i>He left and</i>
<i>returned with a group</i>
<i>who carried me away.</i>

940
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:48,741
(SOBBING)

941
01:45:48,743 --> 01:45:51,644
<i>I wept like a child.</i>

942
01:45:51,646 --> 01:45:56,882
<i>Not because I was overwhelmed</i>
<i>at having survived,</i>
<i>although I was.</i>

943
01:45:56,884 --> 01:46:02,555
<i>I was weeping</i>
<i>because Richard Parker</i>
<i>left me so unceremoniously.</i>

944
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,559
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

945
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,301
You know,
my father was right.

946
01:46:15,303 --> 01:46:19,004
Richard Parker never
saw me as his friend.

947
01:46:19,006 --> 01:46:22,375
After all
we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

948
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:25,745
But I have to believe
there was more in his
eyes...

949
01:46:25,747 --> 01:46:28,914
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

950
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:30,916
I know it.
I felt it.

951
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:33,986
Even if I can't prove it.

952
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,293
You know,
I've left so much behind.

953
01:46:41,295 --> 01:46:45,398
My family, the zoo,
India, Anandi.

954
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,801
I suppose, in the end,
the whole of life becomes
an act of letting go.

955
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:52,838
But what always
hurts the most...

956
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:56,108
is not taking a moment
to say goodbye.

957
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:02,548
I was never able
to thank my father
for all I learned from him.

958
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:06,051
To tell him,
without his lessons...

959
01:47:06,053 --> 01:47:08,020
I would never
have survived.

960
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:14,260
I know Richard Parker
is a tiger,
but I wish I had said...

961
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:17,229
"It's over.
We survived.

962
01:47:17,231 --> 01:47:21,066
"Thank you
for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.

963
01:47:21,068 --> 01:47:23,602
"You will always
be with me.

964
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,506
"May God be with you."

965
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,916
I don't know
what to say.

966
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:45,858
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

967
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,730
It is a lot to take in.

968
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:54,767
To figure out
what it all means.

969
01:47:54,769 --> 01:47:55,835
If it happened,
it happened.

970
01:47:55,837 --> 01:47:58,137
Why should it have
to mean anything?

971
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:03,175
Some of it is
pretty incredible.

972
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:06,512
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

973
01:48:06,514 --> 01:48:09,548
So the Japanese
shipping company sent
two men to talk to me...

974
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:11,951
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

975
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:15,955
I still have a copy
of their report.

976
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:21,727
They had insurance claims
to settle...

977
01:48:21,729 --> 01:48:24,230
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

978
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:26,799
They didn't
believe me, either.

979
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:34,139
Thousands of meerkats
on a floating
carnivorous island...

980
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:36,242
and no one
has ever seen it?

981
01:48:36,244 --> 01:48:39,178
Yes, just like I told you.

982
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,913
Bananas don't float.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

983
01:48:40,915 --> 01:48:42,748
Why are you talking
about bananas?

984
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:45,518
You said the orangutan
floated to you
on a bundle of bananas.

985
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,553
But bananas don't float.

986
01:48:47,555 --> 01:48:49,021
Are you sure about that?

987
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:52,925
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

988
01:48:52,927 --> 01:48:57,162
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas
or meerkats.

989
01:48:57,164 --> 01:49:00,699
Look, I've just
told you a long story
and I'm very tired.

990
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:05,471
We are here because
a Japanese cargo ship
sank in the Pacific.

991
01:49:05,473 --> 01:49:07,706
Something I never forget.

992
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:11,210
I lost my whole family.

993
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:17,650
Get him some water.

994
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,288
We don't mean
to push you.

995
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:26,692
And you have our
deepest sympathies.

996
01:49:26,694 --> 01:49:29,361
But we have come
a long way...

997
01:49:29,363 --> 01:49:32,197
and we are no closer
to understanding
why the ship sank.

998
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,667
Because I don't know.

999
01:49:34,669 --> 01:49:36,502
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.

1000
01:49:36,504 --> 01:49:38,804
It could have
been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

1001
01:49:38,806 --> 01:49:41,574
And then the ship sank.

1002
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:43,275
What else do you
want from me?

1003
01:49:43,277 --> 01:49:45,778
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

1004
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:48,847
We need a simpler story
for our report.

1005
01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:51,350
One our company
can understand.

1006
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:53,652
A story
we can all believe.

1007
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,325
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

1008
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:01,794
That's right.

1009
01:50:01,796 --> 01:50:05,764
Without surprises.
Without animals
or islands.

1010
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,334
Yes. The truth.

1011
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,812
So, what did you do?

1012
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:26,218
I told them
another story.

1013
01:50:27,387 --> 01:50:29,555
Four of us survived.

1014
01:50:29,557 --> 01:50:32,491
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

1015
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:34,593
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

1016
01:50:34,595 --> 01:50:37,630
and Mother held on to
some bananas and made it
to the lifeboat.

1017
01:50:39,332 --> 01:50:42,368
The cook was
a disgusting man.

1018
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,237
He ate a rat.

1019
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:48,273
We had food enough for weeks,
but he found the rat
in the first few days...

1020
01:50:48,275 --> 01:50:51,944
and he killed it,
dried it in the sun
and ate it.

1021
01:50:51,946 --> 01:50:54,013
He was such a brute,
that man.

1022
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:59,218
But he was resourceful.

1023
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:03,155
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

1024
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,891
We would have died in
those first few days
without him.

1025
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:13,332
The sailor was the same man
who brought rice and gravy,
the Buddhist.

1026
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:17,102
We didn't understand
much of what he said,
only that he was suffering.

1027
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:19,438
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

1028
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:23,075
We tried to set it
as best we could, but
the leg became infected...

1029
01:51:23,077 --> 01:51:27,746
and the cook said that
we had to do something
or he'd die.

1030
01:51:27,748 --> 01:51:29,014
The cook said
he'd do it,

1031
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:31,417
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

1032
01:51:31,419 --> 01:51:33,752
And I believed him,
we needed to do it.

1033
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:36,155
So...

1034
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:41,627
I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

1035
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:44,963
And he just
kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

1036
01:51:48,435 --> 01:51:51,470
I'll never
understand the point
of that man's suffering.

1037
01:51:52,839 --> 01:51:56,175
I can still hear him.

1038
01:51:56,177 --> 01:51:59,311
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

1039
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:06,752
We didn't save him,
of course.

1040
01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:08,187
He died.

1041
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:12,224
The morning after,
the cook caught
his first dorado...

1042
01:52:12,226 --> 01:52:15,060
and I didn't understand
what he had done at first,
but Mother did...

1043
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:17,796
and I had never seen
Mother so angry.

1044
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:21,200
"Stop whining and
be happy," he said.

1045
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:24,069
"We need more
food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

1046
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,205
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

1047
01:52:26,207 --> 01:52:29,875
"You let that poor boy
die in order to get bait,
you monster!"

1048
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:32,911
The cook got furious.

1049
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:35,214
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

1050
01:52:35,216 --> 01:52:37,950
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

1051
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:40,252
I was stunned.

1052
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,387
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

1053
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:45,758
But he didn't.

1054
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:50,262
The cook didn't stop
at bait either, no.

1055
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,098
The sailor...

1056
01:52:55,235 --> 01:52:57,169
He went the same
way the rat went.

1057
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:02,374
The cook was
a resourceful man.

1058
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:08,847
It was a week later
that he...

1059
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:13,252
Because of me.

1060
01:53:13,254 --> 01:53:16,688
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

1061
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:19,525
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

1062
01:53:19,527 --> 01:53:21,927
And the cook came up
and he punched me on
the side of my head...

1063
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,129
and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars.

1064
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,831
I thought he was
going to hit me again...

1065
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,533
but Mother started
pounding on him
with her fists...

1066
01:53:27,535 --> 01:53:29,601
screaming,
"Monster, monster!"

1067
01:53:29,603 --> 01:53:30,969
She yelled at me
to go to the raft.

1068
01:53:30,971 --> 01:53:33,105
(SPEAKING TAMIL)

1069
01:53:33,107 --> 01:53:35,407
I thought she
was coming with me,
or I'd never have...

1070
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:41,046
I don't know why
I didn't make her
go first.

1071
01:53:43,349 --> 01:53:45,317
I think about that
every day.

1072
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:55,093
I jumped over
and turned back just
as the knife came out.

1073
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:01,433
There wasn't anything
I could do.

1074
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:05,304
I couldn't look away.

1075
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:12,044
He threw her body overboard.

1076
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:17,449
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

1077
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:23,922
I saw.

1078
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:34,266
The next day,
I killed him.

1079
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:36,935
He didn't even fight back.
He knew he had gone
too far...

1080
01:54:36,937 --> 01:54:38,937
even by his
own standards.

1081
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,708
He'd left the knife
out on the bench,

1082
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,477
and I did to him what
he did to the sailor.

1083
01:54:48,514 --> 01:54:51,483
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

1084
01:54:53,853 --> 01:54:56,255
He brought
the evil out in me.

1085
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:00,125
And I have to
live with that.

1086
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:09,501
I was alone
in a lifeboat...

1087
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:13,272
drifting across
the Pacific Ocean.

1088
01:55:14,007 --> 01:55:15,908
And I survived.

1089
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:24,850
PI: After that,
they had no more
questions.

1090
01:55:24,852 --> 01:55:29,421
The investigators
didn't seem to like
the story, exactly.

1091
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:33,392
But they thanked me,
they wished me well,
and they left.

1092
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:42,267
So the stories...

1093
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:47,306
both the zebra
and the sailor...

1094
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,542
broke their leg.

1095
01:55:50,544 --> 01:55:53,979
And the hyena
killed the zebra
and the orangutan.

1096
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:58,283
So... the hyena is the cook.

1097
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:01,186
The sailor
is the zebra.

1098
01:56:01,188 --> 01:56:03,889
Your mother
is the orangutan.

1099
01:56:03,891 --> 01:56:07,025
And you are...

1100
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:10,228
the tiger.

1101
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:16,068
Can I ask you something?

1102
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:20,105
Of course.

1103
01:56:20,107 --> 01:56:23,976
I've told you two stories
about what happened
out on the ocean.

1104
01:56:23,978 --> 01:56:27,512
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

1105
01:56:27,514 --> 01:56:31,583
and no one can prove
which story is true
and which is not.

1106
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:35,220
In both stories,
the ship sinks...

1107
01:56:35,222 --> 01:56:37,656
my family dies
and I suffer.

1108
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:39,591
True.

1109
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:44,463
So, which story
do you prefer?

1110
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:54,206
The one with the tiger.

1111
01:56:55,308 --> 01:56:57,409
That's the better story.

1112
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,481
Thank you.

1113
01:57:03,282 --> 01:57:05,484
And so it goes with God.

1114
01:57:17,296 --> 01:57:19,131
Mamaji was right.

1115
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:22,367
It's an amazing story.

1116
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,971
Will you really
let me write it?

1117
01:57:25,973 --> 01:57:27,839
Of course.

1118
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:30,642
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

1119
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,245
(CAR APPROACHING)

1120
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:37,015
My wife is here.

1121
01:57:37,017 --> 01:57:39,151
Do you want to
stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

1122
01:57:39,153 --> 01:57:40,218
I didn't know
you had a wife.

1123
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,287
And a cat
and two children.

1124
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:45,290
So, your story does
have a happy ending.

1125
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:48,894
Well, that's up to you.

1126
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:51,229
The story is yours now.

1127
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:52,531
(CHUCKLES)

1128
01:58:02,942 --> 01:58:04,409
(DOOR OPENING)

1129
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:09,081
Hmm.

1130
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:13,285
"Mr. Patel's is
an astounding story
of courage and endurance...

1131
01:58:13,287 --> 01:58:16,488
"unparalleled
in the history
of shipwrecks.

1132
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:20,525
"Very few castaways can
claim to have survived
so long at sea...

1133
01:58:20,527 --> 01:58:23,295
"and none in the company...

1134
01:58:23,297 --> 01:58:25,730
"of an adult Bengal tiger."

1135
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:30,368
BOY: Hi, Dad.

1136
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:32,604
PI: We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.

1137
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:35,073
Hi.
Hi.

1138
01:58:35,075 --> 01:58:36,475
Nice to meet you.

1139
01:58:36,477 --> 01:58:37,576
Adita.

1140
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:39,678
Ravi.
