lnspired by the late President Kennedy,

00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:55,097
in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...

""the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

with our manned space program,

-[ Astronaut ] We got a short !
-and after that sudden, horrible fire...

- Ed White and Roger Chaffee,
- Get us outta here !

12
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,248
there were serious doubts that
we could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,585
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1,

as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

just a moment ago.

the spacecraft permission...

on the moon--

far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,942
The important thing when you're
penetrating the lunar module...

22
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,945
is your attitude
and your relative speed.

23

- Absolutely.

Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

Do we know for sure that we can

awfully cold in here.

have to deal with that later.

- Yeah.

to forget the flight plan.

Oh, come on. Sorry about that.

- Find a bulb around here.

How do we get our people home ?

1004

They are here. Do we turn 'em around ?
Straight back ? Direct abort ?

- Yes !
- l can't guarantee the burn yet.

- [ Technicians Arguing ]
- No, sir, no, sir, no, sir !

1007
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:56,410
We get them
on a free-return trajectory.

1008
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:59,037
lt's the option with
the fewest question marks for safety.

1009
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:03,375
l agree with Jerry. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

1010
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:06,712
The LEM will not support three guys
for that amount of time.

1011
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:10,632
We've got to do a direct abort. We do
an about-face. We bring the guys home.

1012
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,843
Get 'em back soon.
Absolutely.

1013
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,887
We don't even know if
the Odyssey's engine's working.

1014
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:16,930

to this spacecraft--

They blow up and they die !

1016
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,934
That is not the argument !
We are talking about time !

1017
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:24,146
- [ All Arguing ]
- l'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you !

1018
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:27,065
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

1019
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:30,402
Hold it down, people. The only engine
with enough power for a direct abort...

1020
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:32,905
is the S.P.S.
on the service module.

1021
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:35,240
From what Lovell has told us, it could
have been damaged in an explosion,

1022
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,242
so let's consider
that engine dead.

1023
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,244
We light that thing up,
could blow the whole works.

1024
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:41,830
lt's just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

1025
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:44,333
The command module
is only good for reentry.

1026
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:48,086
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

1027
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,964
Once we get
the guys around the moon,

1028
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:53,425
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn,

1029
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,928

as quick as we can.

1030

Gene, l'm wondering what
the Grumman guys think about this.

1031
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:04,186
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon,

1032
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:06,605
not fire the engine out there
for course corrections.

1033
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:10,692
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we ?

1034
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:15,781
l don't care what anything was designed
to do. l care about what it can do.

Let's lay it out, okay ?

it will be ready in time.

1037

in the flight plan for them to sleep.

The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,

of consumption of water,
