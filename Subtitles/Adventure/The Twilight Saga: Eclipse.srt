00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,775
I don't know, we're just...

182
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,712
RENEE: In love. I get it.

183
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,009
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

184
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,001
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

185
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,423
All right, enough with the heavy.

186
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,596
Mom.

187
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:04,503
Congraduation.

188
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,337
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

189
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,172
I didn't, come on.

190
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,124
(BOTH LAUGHING)

191
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:23,853
Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:26,327
BELLA: Get out!
I saved them all.

193
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,422
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

194
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,468
Remember this one? Ensenada.

195
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,106
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

196
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:39,536
But this one is my favorite, here.

197
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,669
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

198
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,742
This is amazing.
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

199
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,305
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

200
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,680
have kids, we can add to it.

201
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,618
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

202
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:51,984
Thanks.

203
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,390
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:14:56,927 --> 00:15:00,363
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

205
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,764
Mom...
Yeah?

206
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,007
I miss you.

207
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,976
Honey, I miss you, too.

208
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,096
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

209
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,028
She's almost here.

210
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,047
On your left!

211
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,831
(GRUNTING)

212
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,243
Wait!

213
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,816
She's in their territory.

214
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,951
She'll get away!

215
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,217
No, she won't!

216
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,888
ESME: Emmett, no!

217
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,962
(GRUNTING)

218
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,637
(GROWLING)

219
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,692
Do you regret going?

220
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:49,961
No.

221
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,903
It was really great seeing my mom.

222
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,742
Just really hard saying goodbye.

223
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,205
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

224
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,407
Is that why you asked me to go?

225
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,382
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

226
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:07,281
I'm always hoping for that.

227
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,083
What?

228
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,425
If I asked you to stay
in the car, would you?

229
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,100
Of course not.

230
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:35,810
Hey.

231
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,417
Charlie said you left town.

232
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,883
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

233
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,587
He's checking to see if you're still human.

234
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:46,789
Look, I'm here to warn you.

235
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,657
If your kind come on our land again...

236
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,456
Wait, what?

237
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:55,326
You didn't tell her?

238
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:56,931
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

239
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Tell me what?

240
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:04,112
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

241
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,142
It's nothing to worry about.

242
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:07,545
JACOB: Listen to you.

243
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,744
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

244
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,547
You should just leave.

245
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,145
Now.

246
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,049
She has a right to know.

247
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:18,284
She is the one the redhead wants.

248
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,488
Victoria?

249
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,926
Alice's vision.

250
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,993
I was trying to protect you.

251
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:29,998
By lying to me.

252
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,771
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

253
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:36,971
You.

254
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,013
Why haven't you called me back?

255
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,519
I had nothing to say.

256
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,280
Well, I have tons. Hold on.
Hey.

257
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,591
Bella.

258
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,589
Edward, you have to trust me.

259
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,256
I do trust you.

260
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,298
It's him I don't trust.

261
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,913
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

262
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,007
Hold on tight.

263
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,985
♪ (JONATHAN LOW PLAYING) ♪

264
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,149
♪ Last born of the clan ♪

265
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,354

267
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,660
Are you sure this is a good idea?

268
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,704
I am the vampire girl, remember?

269
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,272
Hey, look who's back!

270
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,508
What up, Bella?

271
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,236
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

272
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,737
Finally made the pack.

273
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:43,336
EMBRY: I'm glad you're here, Bella.

274
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:46,075
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

275
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:47,241
"I wish Bella would call."

276
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,049
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

277
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,918
"Maybe I should call Bella."
"Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

278
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,184
(ALL LAUGHING)

279
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:55,385
All right, you can shut up now.

280
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:01,790
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

281
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,393
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

282
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:08,277
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

283
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,102
Fun, isn't she?

284
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:16,939
Bella, hi!
Hey.

285
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:20,115
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

286
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,549
BELLA: Yeah. Same here.

287
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,719
Sam, we good?

288
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:26,448
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

289
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,515
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

290
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:40,135
So when did Leah join the pack?

291
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:44,269
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

292
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,375
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

293
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:52,581
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

294
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,182
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

295
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,583
Come on, don't be such a guy.

296
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,125
No, it's not a chick thing.

297
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,291
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

298
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,525
We all have to live
the Leah Sam Emily pain-fest.

299
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,300
Wolf telepathy, remember?

300
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:14,131
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

301
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:18,675
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

302
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,004
But Emily was the one.

303
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:26,113
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

304
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:30,088
It's more than some crush, Bella.

305
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,317
Sam imprinted on Emily.

306
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,422
Do I even want to know what that is?

307
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:48,267
Imprinting on someone is like...

308
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,703
Like when you see her,

309
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,777
everything changes.

310
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:01,083
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

311
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,485
It's her.

312
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,256
Nothing else matters.

313
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,519
You would do anything,

314
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:12,860
be anything for her.

315
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,134
Sounds like you know the feeling.

316
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,307
Have you

317
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,381
imprinted on someone?

318
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:33,976
You'd know if I had.

319
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,185
I just have a direct
line to Sam's thoughts.

320
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,726
So for now you're

321
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:46,528
still you.

322
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,195
And you're still you.

323
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,533
Yeah.

324
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,377
Until graduation.

325
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,514
Graduation?

326
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,882
You knew this was gonna happen.

327
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,047
Not in a month!

328
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,495
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

329
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,556
Or before I could...

330
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:18,999
(CRASHING)

331
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,201
For a second, just a second, I thought...

332
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,439
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

333
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,910
I decided this, not him.

334
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,347
Bella, they're not even alive.

335
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,909
It makes me sick.

336
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:43,387
Better you really be dead than one of them.

337
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,139
I can't believe you said that.

338
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:05,042
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

339
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:08,015
Bella, come on. Please.

340
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,348
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:26,392
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

342
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:28,459
I was just with Jake.

343
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,333
Oh.

344
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:32,900
Good.

345
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:34,263
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

346
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,841
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

347
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,149
Hey.
Do you understand how worried I've been?

348
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,983
I was perfectly safe.

349
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:49,212
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

350
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:53,382
I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
No, something's wrong.

351
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,226
Edward, what's wrong?

352
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,291
Someone's been in here.

353
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,965
DR. CULLEN: Who was it?
Someone we know?

354
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:16,005
This stranger, I didn't
recognize his scent.

355
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,741
A nomad passing through?

356
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:19,815
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

357
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,188
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

358
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,957
Someone's orchestrating this.

359
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:28,391
Victoria?

360
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,619
I would have seen her decide.

361
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:31,955
Has to be the Volturi.

362
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:35,293
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

363

I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

guarding Bella at her house.

No, she's right.

369

You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

it again. We'll handle it from here.

It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

You're okay. I thought...

408
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,288
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

to the powerful wolf.

428
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,222
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

429
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,560
and protect our tribe.

430
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:06,167

You invited me, remember?

716
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:33,092
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

718

the kiss and your hand.

They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

750
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:16,898

They'll give us the numbers.

760
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:56,729
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

761
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:58,240
We'll need to coordinate.

762
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:02,142
Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
We'll all need some training.

763
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:05,182
Fighting newborns requires knowledge

Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

781
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,713
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

782
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:51,515
They're a great deal stronger than us

783
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:54,458
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

784
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:58,322
Our kind is never more physically powerful

785
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,993
than in our first several
months of this life.

786
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:08,337
Carlisle's right. That's
why they are created.

787
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:13,611
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

788
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,808
but no human army
could stand against them.

789
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:21,545
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

790
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:25,057
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

791
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,683
And second,

792
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:30,692
never go for the obvious kill.

793
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,429
They'll be expecting that,

794
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,299

there's nothing I can do to help?

Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

was useless against the newborns.

You may be of great use to me.

Maria was creating an army?
They were very common in the South.

847
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:27,527
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

848
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:29,897

01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,807
or it's so easy that you're gonna
be sidelined. Which is it?

890
01:06:32,884 --> 01:06:35,375
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

891
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:41,986
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

892
01:06:43,027 --> 01:06:47,760
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

893
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:52,097
Okay, you're right.

894
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:56,365
So I'm coming with you.
No, we both stay away together.

895
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:59,675
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

896
01:06:59,744 --> 01:07:02,770
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

897
01:07:06,984 --> 01:07:11,045
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

898
01:07:11,122 --> 01:07:13,522
He's doing it for me, okay?
Whatever.

899
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:16,121
Just tell me the plan.

900
01:07:17,062 --> 01:07:19,030
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

901
01:07:19,098 --> 01:07:21,896
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

902
01:07:22,634 --> 01:07:24,397
but it needs to end here.

903
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,097
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

904
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,504
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

905
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:31,543
Your stench, however, is revolting.

906
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,737
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

907
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:37,407
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

908
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:41,309
Done.
This is not a good idea.

909
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:46,381
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

910
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:48,649
Okay. Let's just try it.

911
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:53,796
Eau de wolf coming up.
Run.

912
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:06,670
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

913
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:08,873
Or don't you care about my safety?

914
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:14,787
Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
I won't have a choice, anyways.

915
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:20,322
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

916
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:23,461
Since you let Sam be alpha?

917
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:28,531
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

918
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:31,495
Wow.

919
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:35,975
Chief Jacob.
Opted out.

920
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,408
But every choice has its consequences.

921
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:42,539
Some more than others.
Don't start.

922
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:46,018
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

923
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:49,486
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

924
01:08:49,556 --> 01:08:53,185
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

925
01:08:54,728 --> 01:08:59,665
Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
It has nothing to do with imprinting.

926
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:04,464
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

927
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:07,733
And I know you feel something for me.

928
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:12,071
I can sense how I make
you feel, physically.

929
01:09:13,948 --> 01:09:15,711
I make you nervous.

930
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,248
Jake.

931
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:24,757
Don't worry.

932
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:29,060
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

933
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:33,292
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

934
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:39,830
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

935
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,512
This will work.
Great.

936
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,043
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

937
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:55,283
Yes. Scout's honor.

938
01:09:56,057 --> 01:09:58,958
Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
Okay.

939
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:02,512
Your alibi for the
battle is all arranged.

940
01:10:02,677 --> 01:10:03,677
Really?

941
01:10:04,024 --> 01:10:06,720
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

942
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:09,185
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

943
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,253
Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
Charlie?

944
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:17,288
You guys are on first name basis now?
Me, he likes.

945
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,245
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

946
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:26,643
Like alone?

947
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:30,930
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

948
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,792
You're welcome.

949
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:40,715
Hey. You want a sandwich?
No, I'm good.

950
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:44,857
Well, the sister, I like.

951
01:10:45,886 --> 01:10:48,787
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

952
01:10:56,828 --> 01:10:58,796
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

953
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:03,423
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

954
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:12,611
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

955
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:17,134
Why?
I don't know.

956
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:24,671
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

957
01:11:25,691 --> 01:11:27,124
of marriage.

958
01:11:28,754 --> 01:11:30,394
But do you think there's any value in it?

959
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:35,771
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

960
01:11:37,935 --> 01:11:39,527
When you're older.

961
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:41,926
Much older.

962
01:11:43,977 --> 01:11:45,569
Like your mother.

963
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:48,379
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

964
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:51,311
later in life.
Yeah, I guess.

965
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:58,179
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

966
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:00,821
careful.

967
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:06,165
What?
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

968
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,881
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

969
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:13,597
Okay. Don't have "the
talk" with me, please.

970
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:16,187
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

971
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:17,462
I doubt that.

972
01:12:17,493 --> 01:12:19,933
And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat
you to it like 10 years ago.

973
01:12:20,013 --> 01:12:21,913
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

974
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,452
I'm sure things work the same way.

975
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:28,352
All right, so...

976
01:12:30,323 --> 01:12:32,757
You guys are taking precautions and...

977
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,889
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

978
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:39,998
Edward is old school.

979
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:46,002
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

980
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,695
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

981
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:53,113
Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

982
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:58,992
Virgin.

983
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,958
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

984
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:15,992
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

985
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:18,571
Nothing.

986
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:41,053
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

987
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:47,823
It's really pretty.

988
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:50,086
Thanks.

989
01:13:58,322 --> 01:13:59,812
There's a bed.

990
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:03,435
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

991
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:08,412
I think an air mattress
would have sufficed.

992
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:11,529
Is this too much?
No.

993
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:14,340
No, it's perfect.

994
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:19,353
I wanna ask you something.
Anything.

995
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,103
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

996
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,024
Yes.

997
01:14:33,854 --> 01:14:36,915
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

998
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:41,437
Anything you want. It's yours.

999
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,087
You promise?

1000
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,592
Yeah.

1001
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:52,613
Okay.

1002
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:00,645
Hey.

1003
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,698
Bella.

1004
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:12,901
No.

1005
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,578
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

1006
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:18,772
Not ones that will risk killing you.
You won't.

1007
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:24,047
And everyone says once I'm changed all
I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1008
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:28,587
That part doesn't last forever.
I want you.

1009
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:35,361
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1010
01:15:39,663 --> 01:15:45,193
It's too dangerous.
Try. Just try.

1011
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:52,088
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

1012
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,362
I'll marry you. Just try.

Believe me, I want to.

1026
01:17:18,942 --> 01:17:20,876
I just want to be married to you first.

1027
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,505
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1028
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:29,710
trying to steal your virtue or something.

1029
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:34,317
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1030
01:17:36,516 --> 01:17:38,177
Are you kidding?

1031
01:17:38,712 --> 01:17:42,739
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1032
01:17:45,217 --> 01:17:48,948
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1033
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:52,819
I know that's not a modern notion.

1034
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:56,080
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1035
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,169
I'm from a different era.

1036
01:18:03,563 --> 01:18:07,090
Things were a lot less complicated.

1037
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:13,825
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1038
01:18:16,102 --> 01:18:21,267
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1039
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:34,333
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1040
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:40,785
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1041
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:44,253
I would have got down on one knee,

1042
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:54,239
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1043
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:02,264
This was my mother's.

1044
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:11,543
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1045
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:16,378
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1046
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,732
Yes.

1047
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:33,968
♪ ♪

1048
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:47,685
You're not coming with us?

1049
01:19:56,206 --> 01:19:58,697
It'll be a last minute decision.

1050
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:06,006
I told you how it works.
The Cullens have powers.

1051
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:11,826
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1052
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:17,945
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

1053
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:22,163
According to your friend?
Yes.

1054
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:25,573
My dead friend.

1055
01:20:28,368 --> 01:20:31,633
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

1056
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,464
and they killed him.

1057
01:20:37,478 --> 01:20:39,673
But not before he told me.

1058
01:20:44,818 --> 01:20:46,649
Maybe he was wrong.

1059
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:56,117
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1060
01:20:57,214 --> 01:21:01,150
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1061
01:21:02,217 --> 01:21:03,980
You don't trust me.

1062
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:09,723
With my life. I'm just saying...
I'm doing this for us.

1063
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:14,817
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1064
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:18,782
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1065
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:20,548
I won't let them.

1066
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:26,490
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1067
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:30,763
I swear.

1068
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:51,282
I love you so much.

1069
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:13,306
You're going overboard.

1070
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,469
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1071
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:18,775
The new borns'll be frantic.

1072
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:24,384
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1073
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:25,784
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1074
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,084
Since when?

1075
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:32,584
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1076
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,460
You're not wearing your ring.

1077
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:40,333
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1078
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:43,694
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1079
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:50,845
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1080
01:22:50,914 --> 01:22:53,542
If you're having second thoughts...
I'm not.

1081
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:57,713
I just want him to have a clear head.
Whose head is unclear?

1082
01:22:59,256 --> 01:23:00,951
Nobody's I hope.

1083
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:04,927
Alice says there's a storm coming.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1084
01:23:06,163 --> 01:23:07,960
We should get going.

1085
01:23:09,099 --> 01:23:11,567
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1086
01:23:20,844 --> 01:23:22,311
Something up?

1087
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:28,945
Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
Same old same old.

1088
01:24:46,837 --> 01:24:47,929
Thank you.

1089
01:24:50,438 --> 01:24:52,253
You should get back
before the storm hits.

1090
01:24:52,284 --> 01:24:53,528
No, I'm staying.

1091
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:57,065
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1092
01:24:57,096 --> 01:25:00,623
You're not gonna fight?
Seth will spell me in the morning.

1093
01:25:01,113 --> 01:25:04,048
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1094
01:25:05,661 --> 01:25:07,219
Let's get you inside.

(WHIMPERING)

1096
01:25:25,572 --> 01:25:30,737
I should have chosen a site lower down.
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1097
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:33,003
What can I do?

(WIND HOWLING)

1099
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:49,057
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1100
01:25:56,336 --> 01:26:00,569
Forget it.
She may need her toes someday.

1101
01:26:01,842 --> 01:26:05,175
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1102
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:15,120
Get your hand off me.
Keep your hands off her.

1103
01:26:15,623 --> 01:26:17,113
Don't fight.

1104
01:26:20,494 --> 01:26:22,291
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1105
01:26:39,346 --> 01:26:41,541
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1106
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:46,108
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1107

Jake.
Survival 101.

1109
01:27:24,693 --> 01:27:27,924
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1110
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:33,927
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1111
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:37,398
What?

1112
01:27:38,441 --> 01:27:41,103
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1113
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:44,871
Nice.

1114
01:27:46,015 --> 01:27:51,351
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1115
01:27:55,358 --> 01:27:56,518
Look.

1116
01:27:58,094 --> 01:28:00,961
I know she's in love with you.
Good.

1117
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:03,963
But she's in love with me, too.

1118
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:08,727
She just won't admit it to herself.

1119
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:14,175
I can't tell if you're right.

1120
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:17,169
Then let me ask you something.

1121
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:20,977
If she chooses me...
She won't.

1122
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:22,881
If she did,

1123
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,019
would you try to kill me?

1124
01:28:27,658 --> 01:28:29,751
That's an intriguing idea.

1125
01:28:34,665 --> 01:28:37,793
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1126
01:28:38,935 --> 01:28:41,699
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1127
01:28:42,506 --> 01:28:45,407
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1128
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:48,367
So stop her.
I tried.

1129
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,910
I left.
But you gave up too quickly.

1130
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:59,754
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1131
01:29:00,524 --> 01:29:01,855
Trust me.

1132
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,195
You have to consider that I might
be better for her than you are.

1133
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:12,801
I have considered that.

1134
01:29:16,507 --> 01:29:18,668
I know you can protect her.

1135
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:26,147
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1136
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,378
But I'm not...

1137
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:34,721
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1138
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:40,494
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1139
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,234
Yeah. That I remember.

1140
01:29:49,474 --> 01:29:51,738
When you thought she was gone,

1141
01:29:54,078 --> 01:29:55,841
that you'd lost her,

1142
01:29:58,349 --> 01:30:01,250
how did you cope?

1143
01:30:03,254 --> 01:30:05,052
There are no words.

1144
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:13,530
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1145
01:30:16,268 --> 01:30:19,795
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1146
01:30:20,672 --> 01:30:21,969
Meaning,

1147
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:25,977
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1148
01:30:29,114 --> 01:30:31,412
If we weren't natural enemies

1149
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,885
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1150
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,382
I might actually like you.

1151
01:30:39,424 --> 01:30:40,721
Well,

1152
01:30:42,294 --> 01:30:46,492
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1153
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:48,730
I might...

1154
01:30:55,809 --> 01:30:58,869
No. Not even then.

1155
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:10,519
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1156
01:31:17,297 --> 01:31:18,662
Then I'd let her go.

1157
01:31:38,818 --> 01:31:40,410
Right. Hey, Seth.

1158
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,559
Where's Jacob? Did he already...
Not yet.

1159
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:52,195
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1160
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:02,867
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1161
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,302
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1162
01:32:07,381 --> 01:32:11,511
You have a list?
All 10 I spent with you.

1163
01:32:12,953 --> 01:32:17,322
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1164
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:25,063
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1165
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,358
You're marrying him?
Jake, I...

1166
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:37,200
You knew he was listening!
He deserves to know.

1167
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,138
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1168
01:32:40,248 --> 01:32:41,374
Don't!

1169
01:32:44,452 --> 01:32:45,510
Jake, stop!

1170
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:52,648
BELLA: Jake, please!
I'm done! I'm so done!

1171
01:32:53,895 --> 01:32:55,123
What can I do?

1172
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:59,394
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1173
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:02,061
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1174
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,932
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1175
01:33:05,006 --> 01:33:07,440
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1176
01:33:09,344 --> 01:33:10,538
Why?

1177
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:14,109
Give me one good reason.

1178
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,184
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1179
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,186
It's not good enough.

1180
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,455
Because you're too important.

1181
01:33:26,896 --> 01:33:30,388
Still not good enough.
Jacob!

1182
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:35,899
Kiss me.

1183
01:33:39,275 --> 01:33:42,733
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1184
01:34:30,527 --> 01:34:33,155
That should have been our first kiss.

1185
01:34:38,769 --> 01:34:40,168
I gotta go.

1186
01:34:43,106 --> 01:34:44,505
I'll be back.

1187
01:35:14,739 --> 01:35:18,140
You saw.
No, but...

1188
01:35:19,143 --> 01:35:20,906
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1189
01:35:22,447 --> 01:35:23,971
I don't know what happened.

1190
01:35:25,983 --> 01:35:27,416
You love him.

1191
01:35:31,823 --> 01:35:33,620
I love you more.

01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:36,724

Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

You want her.

1231
01:40:22,753 --> 01:40:25,984
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1232
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:30,787
when I tore him to pieces,

1233
01:40:33,296 --> 01:40:35,992
when I turned him into ash,

1234
01:40:38,168 --> 01:40:42,128
when I turned him into nothing.

Alice needs us to go.

Now.

1247
01:43:30,644 --> 01:43:33,704
EDWARD: How long?
A few minutes. Maybe 10?

1248

Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

1254
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,913
The bones on the right half of his body
are shattered.

Bella.
Jake, I'm right here.

1256

Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
Leah!

1257
01:44:21,363 --> 01:44:24,025
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1258
01:44:24,099 --> 01:44:26,397
It's already starting.
EDWARD: We need to get him out of here.

1259
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:29,335
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1260
01:44:29,404 --> 01:44:32,134
We'll take him back to Billy's.
I'll be there soon as I can.

1261
01:44:32,674 --> 01:44:33,732
Hang in there, Jake.

an assault of this magnitude intact.

1267
01:45:16,886 --> 01:45:18,444
We were lucky.

1268
01:45:19,922 --> 01:45:21,514
I doubt that.

1269
01:45:23,426 --> 01:45:25,484
It appears we missed
an entertaining fight.

JANE: Yes.

1271
01:45:27,418 --> 01:45:30,080
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1272
01:45:30,139 --> 01:45:32,979
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would have fulfilled your purpose.

1273

Pity.

1274
01:45:39,551 --> 01:45:41,109
You missed one.

1275
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:50,515
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1276
01:45:51,897 --> 01:45:53,660
That wasn't yours to offer.

1277

You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

1282
01:46:10,777 --> 01:46:12,039
I know.

1283
01:46:14,154 --> 01:46:18,022
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1284
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:21,185
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1285
01:46:21,247 --> 01:46:24,512
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1286
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:28,675
DR. CULLEN: Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1287
01:46:28,926 --> 01:46:30,046
they would have stopped her.

1288
01:46:31,313 --> 01:46:32,610
Isn't that right, Jane?

1289
01:46:35,009 --> 01:46:36,499
Of course.

1290
01:46:37,948 --> 01:46:39,006
Felix.

1291
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:41,727
She didn't know what she was doing.

1292
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:46,027
We'll take responsibility for her.

1293
01:46:46,778 --> 01:46:48,405
Give her a chance.

1294
01:46:51,066 --> 01:46:56,265
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1295
01:46:57,532 --> 01:47:00,399
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1296
01:47:00,823 --> 01:47:02,916
The date is set.

1297
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:08,863
Take care of that, Felix.
I'd like to go home.

It's been going on for a while.
EMBRY: Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1301
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,971
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1302
01:47:50,042 --> 01:47:51,566
Give it a rest, Leah.

1303
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,982
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1304
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:02,180
I gave him some morphine,

1305
01:48:02,255 --> 01:48:04,587
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1306
01:48:04,657 --> 01:48:06,716
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1307
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,693
Thank you.

1308
01:48:18,638 --> 01:48:19,832
He's asking for you.

1309
01:48:35,154 --> 01:48:36,212
Hey, Jake.

1310
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:41,054
Hey.

1311
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:57,741
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?

1312
01:48:59,513 --> 01:49:01,105
Yeah.

1313
01:49:02,116 --> 01:49:04,914
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1314
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:11,046
Was he hard on you?
He wasn't even mad at me.

1315
01:49:12,293 --> 01:49:13,453
Or you.

1316
01:49:14,962 --> 01:49:16,452
Well, damn.

1317
01:49:18,966 --> 01:49:22,925
He's better than I thought.
He's not playing a game.

1318
01:49:25,472 --> 01:49:26,734
Right.

1319
01:49:30,277 --> 01:49:31,574
Bella.

1320
01:49:34,882 --> 01:49:37,716
He's not as perfect as you think.

1321
01:49:41,256 --> 01:49:42,951
I know who he is.

1322
01:49:47,295 --> 01:49:49,695
Can we just not talk about that?

1323
01:49:50,899 --> 01:49:53,959
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1324
01:50:00,075 --> 01:50:02,908
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1325
01:50:06,748 --> 01:50:10,081
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1326
01:50:13,521 --> 01:50:16,547
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1327
01:50:24,766 --> 01:50:27,702
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1328
01:50:30,206 --> 01:50:34,870
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1329
01:50:40,883 --> 01:50:43,181
You know I love you.

1330
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:52,860
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1331
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,900
Should I come back?

1332
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:10,806
I need some time.

1333
01:51:15,519 --> 01:51:17,612
But I'll always be waiting.

1334
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:25,657
Until my heart stops beating.

1335
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:28,962
Maybe even then.

1336
01:51:52,055 --> 01:51:56,355
August 13th?
Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1337
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,054
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1338
01:52:00,864 --> 01:52:02,984
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1339
01:52:03,768 --> 01:52:05,463
I'm sure she can.

1340
01:52:07,839 --> 01:52:09,500
There's no rush.

1341
01:52:12,076 --> 01:52:15,273
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1342
01:52:16,247 --> 01:52:19,705
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1343
01:52:20,051 --> 01:52:24,545
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1344
01:52:24,622 --> 01:52:27,420
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1345
01:52:29,427 --> 01:52:30,985
Does it matter?

1346
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,534
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1347
01:52:37,602 --> 01:52:40,799
What? The wedding?
No.

1348
01:52:43,774 --> 01:52:46,607
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1349
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:50,105
but you're already giving
away too much.

1350
01:52:51,048 --> 01:52:52,539
You're wrong.

1351
01:53:00,559 --> 01:53:03,926
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1352
01:53:07,766 --> 01:53:11,862
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1353
01:53:15,574 --> 01:53:20,568
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1354
01:53:23,749 --> 01:53:25,649
I've never felt normal.

1355
01:53:28,187 --> 01:53:30,121
Because I'm not normal.

1356
01:53:31,356 --> 01:53:33,017
I don't want to be.

1357
01:53:34,526 --> 01:53:39,759
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1358
01:53:41,134 --> 01:53:44,297
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1359
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:50,306
and more real, more myself.

1360
01:53:53,046 --> 01:53:55,207
Because it's my world, too.

1361
01:53:58,451 --> 01:54:00,214
It's where I belong.

1362
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,221
So it's not just about me?

1363
01:54:11,464 --> 01:54:14,490
No. Sorry.

1364
01:54:16,869 --> 01:54:21,932
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1365
01:54:23,309 --> 01:54:27,712
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1366
01:54:32,052 --> 01:54:33,610
Starting with a wedding.

1367
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:39,290
Actually,

1368
01:54:40,194 --> 01:54:45,154
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1369
01:54:50,904 --> 01:54:52,337
We have to tell Charlie.

1370
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,772
It's highly dangerous.

1371
01:54:58,846 --> 01:55:01,007
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1372
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:04,607
