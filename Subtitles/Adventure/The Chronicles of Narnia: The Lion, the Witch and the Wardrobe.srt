1
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:07,219
I, too, want my family safe.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,361
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

3
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,839
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

4
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:24,238
Special treatment for the special boy!

5
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,883
Isn't that what you wanted?

6
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,449
[Lucy] You look like Mum.

7
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:35,457
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,762
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

9
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,761
If we ever get back.

10
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:50,372
I'm sorry I'm like that.

11
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:55,100
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

12
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:59,479
Yes. Before you got boring.

13
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:00,982
Oh, really?

14
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,484
[screaming, laughing]

15
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,493
- [growls]
- [screaming]

16
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,997
Please don't try to run.

17
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:19,934
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

18
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:23,737
[shouting]

19
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,536
- [horn sounding]
- Susan!

20
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,971
- [screaming]
- [snarling]

21
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:37,150
Get back!

22
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,055
Peter! Ah!

23
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,224
Come on.

24
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,163
We've already been through this before.

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,790
We both know you haven't got it in you.

26
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,629
Peter! Watch out!

27
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,227
- [growling]
- [snarling]

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,737
[roaring]

29
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:05,376
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

30
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,010
You may think you're a king,

31
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,383
but you're going to die...

32
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,684
...like a dog!
- [Susan] Look out!

33
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,051
[both screaming] Peter!

34
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:22,023
[straining]

35
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,733
- [yelping, barking]
- After him.

36
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,207
He'll lead you to Edmund.

37
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,943
Peter.

38
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:46,246
Clean your sword.

39
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:55,558
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

40
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,430
Knight of Narnia.

41
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:16,748
- [metal clanging]
- [indistinct chatter]

42
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,189
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

43
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,460
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

44
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,057
- [growling]
- [snarling]

45
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,570
- [yelping]
- [hooves stomping]

46
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,366
Ah!

47
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,339
The prisoner!

48
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,944
[moaning]

49
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,224
[breathing heavily]

50
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,359
[groans]

51
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,199
[Ginarrbrik] You're not
going to kill me?

52
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,279
Not yet.

53
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,612
[snorting]

54
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,844
We have work to do.

55
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,944
- [indistinct chatter]
- [horses whinny]

56
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,750
[gasps] Edmund!

57
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,947
What's done is done.

58
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:33,114
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

59
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,626
Hello.

60
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,742
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

61
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,115
Get some sleep.

62
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,187
And Edmund...

63
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:16,992
...try not to wander off.

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,780
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

65
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,918
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

66
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,352
We're going home?

67
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,417
You are.

68
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,617
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

69
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,987
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

70
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,465
But they need us.

71
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,832
All four of us.

72
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:56,804
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

73
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:59,433
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

74
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:03,043
Which is why we have to stay.

75
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:09,514
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

76
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,720
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

77
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,423
I suppose that's it then.

78
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,326
Where are you going?

79
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,572
To get in some practice.

80
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:48,983
[laughing]

81
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,923
[horse whinnies]

82
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,657
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

83
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,100
- [Edmund] En garde!
- [Peter] Now block.

84
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,865
- [Edmund] Hey!
- [Mr. Beaver] Peter! Edmund!

85
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,739
- [whinnying]
- Whoa, horsie!

86
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,335
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

87
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,210
[stammers] Sorry.

88
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,876
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

89
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,551
She's on her way here.

90
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,757
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

91
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,349
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

92
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:26,691
- [male voice #1] Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

93
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:30,389
[male voice #2] You don't belong here!
Go away!

94
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,901
[growling]

95
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,961
[crowd murmuring]

96
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,784
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

97
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,657
[crowd murmuring]

98
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:03,064
His offense was not against you.

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,865
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

100
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:10,428
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

101
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:13,600
I was there when it was written.

102
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,575
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

103
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,950
- His blood is my property.
- [swords unsheathing]

104
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,317
- Try and take him then.
- [grunting]

105
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:32,756
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

106
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,159
...little King?

107
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,466
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

108
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,973
all of Narnia will be overturned

109
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,033
and perish in fire and water.

110
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:51,342
That boy will die

111
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:55,009
- on the Stone Table...
- [crowd murmuring]

112
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,080
...as is tradition.

113
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,948
You dare not refuse me.

114
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,826
Enough.

115
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,128
I shall talk with you alone.

116
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,320
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

117
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,324
[cheering, applause]

118
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,225
How do I know your promise will be kept?

119
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,762
[roaring]

120
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,597
[cheering]

121
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,463
[crickets chirping]

122
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,695
[sighing]

123
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,336
[footsteps]

124
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,377
- Susan!
- Mm?

125
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,458
[horse whinnies]

126
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,633
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

127
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,471
We couldn't sleep.

128
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,840
Please, Aslan.

129
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,073
Couldn't we come with you?

130
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:14,275
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

131
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:17,783
Thank you.

132
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:43,473
It is time.

133
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,982
From here, I must go on alone.

134
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,482
But Aslan...

135
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:52,078
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

136
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,418
Thank you, Susan.

137
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,924
Thank you, Lucy.

138
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,052
And farewell.

139
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,575
[sighs]

140
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:25,219
[squealing]

141
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:30,222
[howling]

142
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,660
[snarling]

143
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:43,632
[screeching]

144
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,574
[hissing]

145
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:08,324
Behold. The great lion.

146
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,592
[all laughing]

147
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,541
- [growling]
- [crowd yelling]

148
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:30,484
- [snorting]
- [cheering]

149
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:35,984
Do you want some milk?

150
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,185
Why doesn't he fight back?

151
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,091
- Bind him!
- [snorting]

152
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,624
Tie him up! Get him!

153
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:52,966
- [moaning]
- Wait!

154
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:57,069
Let him first be shaved.

155
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:06,251
[crowd cheering]

156
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,593
Bring him to me.

157
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:39,780
[howling]

158
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:46,623
[crowd silences]

159
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:04,512
[growling]

160
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,174
[howling]

161
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:24,427
You know, Aslan,

162
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,764
I'm a little disappointed in you.

163
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:32,767
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

164
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:38,745
You are giving me your life

165
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,782
and saving no one.

166
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,477
[chuckles]

167
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,620
So much for love.

168
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:52,017
[cheering, grunting]

169
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,692
Tonight...

170
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:01,962
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

171
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,834
[cheering]

172
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:08,204
But tomorrow,

173
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:13,639
we will take Narnia

174
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:18,050
- forever!
- [cheering]

175
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:25,086
In that knowledge,

176
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:28,062
despair...

177
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,670
...and die!

178
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,835
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

179
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,812
[groaning]

180
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:51,552
[both sobbing]

181
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,180
[crowd cheering]

182
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:00,161
The Great Cat...

183
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,925
...is dead!
- [cheering]

184
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,529
[howling]

185
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,661
- General.
- [snorting]

186
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:11,706
- Prepare your troops for battle.
- [grunting]

187
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:14,709
[roaring]

188
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:17,211
However short it may be.

189
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:25,150
[distant howling]

190
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,522
It's too late.

191
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:09,928
He's gone.

192
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,515
He must have known what he was doing.

193
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,810
[squeaking]

194
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:09,249
Get away! Get away, all of you!

195
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:12,385
No. Look.

196
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,877
We have to tell the others.

197
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:40,048
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

198
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,386
They need to know.

199
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,689
The trees.

200
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,200
[rustling]

201
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,438
[grunting]

202
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:36,868
Be still, my Princes.

203
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,946
I bring grave news from your sisters.

204
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:44,586
[indistinct chatter]

205
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:47,214
[indistinct chatter]

206
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:58,796
She's right.

207
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,835
He's gone.

208
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:11,439
Then you'll have to lead us.

209
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,851
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

210
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,448
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

211
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,395
And so do I.

212
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,029
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

213
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,081
[screeching]

214
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,249
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

215
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:30,484
Numbers do not win a battle.

216
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,393
No. But I bet they help.

217
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:41,127
[growling]

218
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,181
[roaring]

219
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:55,901
[horn sounds]

220
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:59,572
[cheering]

221
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:06,944
I have no interest in prisoners.

222
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,853
Kill them all.

223
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:13,020
- [roaring]
- Ahh!

224
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:59,867
- [screeching]
- Go on!

225
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,811
Look to the sky!

226
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,121
- [grunting]
- [screaming]

227
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,597
[screeching]

228
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,644
Are you with me?

229
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:40,212
To the death.

230
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:47,981
For Narnia and for Aslan!

231
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,324
Go!

232
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:57,126
Go! For Aslan!

233
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,631
- [whinnies]
- [growls]

234
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:07,708
[roaring]

235
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,368
[snarling]

236
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:41,906
[noise silences]

237
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:57,323
[noise resumes]

238
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:10,405
[birds chirping]

239
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:11,804
[birds chirping]

240
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,486
We should go.

241
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:38,925
I'm so cold.

242
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,642
[wind howling]

243
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,412
- [rumbling]
- Ah!

244
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:06,690
Susan!

245
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:24,903
Where's Aslan?

246
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:28,248
What have they done?

247
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,918
[both] Aslan!

248
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,664
[Aslan chuckles]

249
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,536
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

250
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,132
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

251
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,542
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

252
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:00,240
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

253
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,545
is killed in a traitor's stead,

254
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:05,882
the Stone Table will crack

255
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:09,617
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

256
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:12,216
We sent the news that you were dead.

257
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,488
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

258
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:15,961
We have to help them.

259
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:19,831
We will, dear one, but not alone.

260
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:21,930
Climb on my back.

261
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:24,733
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

262
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,536
And you may want to cover your ears.

263
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,134
[roaring]

264
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,706
[grunting, roaring]

265
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,421
Fire!

266
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,916
Yes!

267
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:27,100
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

268
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:31,002
- [horn sounds]
- That's the signal. Come on!

269
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,246
Where are we going?

270
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,084
Hang on!

271
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:54,886
Fall back!

272
00:32:56,731 --> 00:32:58,198
Go on, fall back!

273
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:13,039
- [whinnying]
- [grunting]

274
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,113
[grunting]

275
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:36,200
Stop!

276
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,624
[groaning]

277
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:10,337
[shouting]

278
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,720
[sobbing]

279
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:16,900
[blowing]

280
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:24,468
[heartbeats]

281
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:27,479
[cracking]

282
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,742
[Tumnus groaning]

283
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,924
[Tumnus gasping]

284
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,760
[laughing]

285
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:50,568
Susan, this is...

286
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:52,970
- Mr. Tumnus!
- [gasps]

287
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:57,006
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

288
00:35:57,078 --> 00:35:59,842
Peter will need everyone we can find.

289
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:06,985
Ah!

290
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:13,056
[screeching]

291
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:29,068
Edmund! There's too many!

292
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,701
Get out of here!

293
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:33,713
Get the girls and get them home!

294
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:38,709
You heard him! Let's go!

295
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:49,586
[roaring]

296
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,899
Peter said get out of here!

297
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,805
Peter's not king yet.

298
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:16,947
[yelling]

299
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:28,026
[gasps]

300
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:30,434
[silence]

301
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:31,733
[groaning]

302
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:14,641
Ah!

303
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,195
[roaring]

304
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:38,998
[roaring]

305
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:40,404
lmpossible!

306
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:18,372
Ah!

307
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,247
It is finished.

308
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:00,118
- [Susan] Peter!
- [Lucy] Peter!

309
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:07,853
Where's Edmund?

310
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:11,925
[gasping]

311
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,238
- Edmund!
- [gasps]

312
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,401
Ah!

313
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,438
[coughing]

314
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:16,329
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

315
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,279
[blowing]

316
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:08,070
[laughing]

317
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,157
[horns sounding]

318
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:54,695
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

319
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:59,256
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

320
00:43:24,024 --> 00:43:26,458
[Aslan] To the great Western Wood,

321
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:30,861
King Edmund the Just.

322
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:35,197
To the radiant Southern Sun,

323
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,001
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

324
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:44,005
And to the clear Northern Sky,

325
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:47,775
I give you King Peter,

326
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,180
the Magnificent.

327
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:56,590
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

328
00:43:56,657 --> 00:43:59,888
always a King or Queen.

329
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,723
May your wisdom grace us

330
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:04,924
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

331
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,365
[all] Long live King Peter!

332
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:10,097
Long live King Edmund!

333
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:12,731
Long live Queen Susan!

334
00:44:12,807 --> 00:44:16,174
Long live Queen Lucy!

335
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:21,645
[cheering]

336
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,062
[Tumnus] Don't worry.

337
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:46,006
We'll see him again.

338
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:49,668
- When?
- In time.

339
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:54,544
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

340
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,284
But you mustn't press him.

341
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,145
After all, he's not a tame lion.

342
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,054
No.

343
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,059
But he is good.

344
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:09,422
Here.

345
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:13,295
You need it more than I do.

346
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:08,046
[breathing heavily]

347
00:46:09,023 --> 00:46:11,184
Are you all right, Philip?

348
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,556
I'm not as young as I once was.

349
00:46:13,627 --> 00:46:15,561
[horse whinnies]

350
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,894
Come on, Ed.

351
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:21,324
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

352
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:23,768
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

353
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:27,068
- I'll get the stag myself."
- [chuckling]

354
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,209
What's this?

355
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,119
It seems familiar.

356
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,491
As if from a dream.

357
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,618
Or a dream of a dream.

358
00:46:50,898 --> 00:46:53,196
Spare Oom.

359
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:58,596
- Lucy!
- Not again.

360
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:02,798
- [Peter] Lu?
- Come on!

361
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,345
These aren't branches.

362
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:17,846
[Edmund] Ow! Ooh!

363
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:20,985
- They're coats.
- [Edmund] Susan, you're on my foot!

364
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:23,256
[Lucy] Peter, move off!

365
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,491
- [Peter] Stop shoving.
- [Edmund] Stop it!

366
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,397
I'm not on your toe!

367
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:30,232
[all grunting]

368
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,144
[Kirke] Oh!

369
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,811
There you are.

370
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,154
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

371
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:56,859
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

372
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:04,297
Try me.

373
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,764
[Kirke] I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

374
00:49:12,873 --> 00:49:17,537
You see... I've already tried.

375
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:21,570
Will we ever go back?

376
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:23,343
Oh, I expect so.

377
00:49:24,484 --> 00:49:27,453
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

378
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,617
All the same...

379
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:34,216
[whispers] best to keep your eyes open.

380
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:46,199
[Aslan roars]
