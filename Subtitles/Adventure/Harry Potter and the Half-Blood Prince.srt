...he's known all over the world
by another name.

342
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,594
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

343
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,035
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

344
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,152
Every day, every hour...

345
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,197
...this very minute, perhaps...

346
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,512
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

347
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,393
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

348
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,356
Just something to think about.

349
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,073
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

350
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,398
RON:
That was cheerful.

351
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,031
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

352
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,590

That is the girls' lavatory.

356
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,232
-I had a free period this morning.
-So I noticed.

357
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,029
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

358
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?.

359
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,990
It was, but I was told I had to
get an ""outstanding"" in my o.W.L.

360
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,913
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

361
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,471
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...

366

SLUGHORN: Attention to detail
in the preparation...

369
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,995
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

370
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,759
Ah.

371
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,674

We've brought someone with us, I see.

372

373
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,315
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

376
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,194

my book yet, and nor has Ron.

Get what you want from the cupboard.

378
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,357
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

379
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,308
Any ideas what these might be?.

380
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,228
-Y es, Miss...?.
-Granger, sir.

381
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,638
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

382
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,394
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

383
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,472
It's terribly tricky to make.

384
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,596
And this is Amortentia...

385
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,069
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

386
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,635
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

387
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,791
For example, I smell...

388
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,399
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

389
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,757
...spearmint toothpaste.

390
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,430
SLUGHORN: Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

391
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,390
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

392
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,954
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

393
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,953
Sir?. You haven't told us
what's in that one.

394
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,958
oh, yes.

395
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,588
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

396
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,959
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

397
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,510
But it is more commonly referred to as--

398
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,754
-Liquid luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

399
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,118
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

400

that all of your endeavors succeed.

So this is what I offer each of you today.

403
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,310
one tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

404
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,871
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

405

on page 1 0 of your books.

406
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,835
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

407
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,197
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

You crush it. Don't cut it.

412
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,749
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

No, really.

REMUS: Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?.

849
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,795
I know it sounds mad.

850
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,316
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

851
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,869
...so he could find out
what he was up to?.

852
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,918

T o make an Unbreakable Vow, it's--

854
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,516
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

855
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,593
-Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
-Dumbledore can make mistakes.

Yes, I did.

If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

875

Dumbledore wants it.

Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?.

My thoughts exactly.

01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,995

my person for just such occasions as this.

I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1193
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,715
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

oh, dear.

01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,992
-Would you like me to say a few words?.
-Yes.

1196
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,719
He had a family, I trust?.

1197
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,313
oh, yeah.

Farewell, Aragog...

[SLUGHORN & HAGRID SINGING]

1206
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:15,150
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1207
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,869
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1208
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:23,989
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1209
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:29,109
one afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1210
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,793
Poof.

1211
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,032
-That's very odd, isn't it?.
-It is, isn't it?.

1212
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,749
But that's life, I suppose.

1213
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:43,040
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

[HAGRID SNORING]

1216
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:03,672
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1217
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:08,758
one spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1218
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,473
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1219
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,630
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1220
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,475
As I watched, it sank.

1221
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,639
Just before it reached the bottom...

1222
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,199
...it transformed...

1223
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,272
...into a wee fish.

1224
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,916
It was beautiful magic.

1225
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,030
Wondrous to behold.

1226
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,199
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1227
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,469
Your mother.

1228
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,829
The day I came downstairs...

1229
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,955
...the day the bowl was empty...

1230
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,510
...was the day your mother....

01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,271
I know why you're here.

1232
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,071
But I can't help you.

1233
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,438
It would ruin me.

01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,355
Do you know why I survived, professor?.

The night I got this?.

1236
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:20,878
Because of her.

1237
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,478
Because she sacrificed herself.

1238
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,155
Because she refused to step aside.

1239
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:29,392
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,109
-Don't say his name.
-I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

otherwise, you disgrace her.

RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1256
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,510
...in the Restricted Section...

1257
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,830
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1258
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,719
It's called, as I understand it...

1259
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,234
...a Horcrux.

1260
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,639
-I beg your pardon?.
-Horcrux.

1261
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,600
I came across the term while reading...

1262
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,638
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1263
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,472
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1264
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,108
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1265
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,759
Which is...

1266
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,592
...why I came to you.

1267
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,713
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1268
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,394
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1269
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,714
one splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1270
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,350
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1271
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,589
Protected?.

1272
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,832
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1273
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,549
In other words, you cannot die.

1274
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,477
And how does one split his soul, sir?.

1275
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,313
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, T om.

1276
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,913
Murder.

1277
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,674
Yes.

1278
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,910
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1279
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,311

once?. For instance, isn't seven...?.

01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:45,714

All academic?.

1284
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,354
of course, sir.

1285
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,111
It'll be our little secret.

1286
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,754
HARRY:
Sir.

1287
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,556
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1288
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:33,280
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?.

1289
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,432
oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1290
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,589
What are they exactly?.

1291
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,957
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1292
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,638
A ring, for example.

1293
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,673
or a book.

1294
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,195
-T om Riddle's diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1295
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,716
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1296
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,075
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1297
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,071
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1298
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,030
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1299
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,111
-The ring?.
-Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1300
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:10,031
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1301
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,909
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1302
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,195
one destroys Voldemort.

1303
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,158
But how would you find them?.
They could be hidden anywhere.

1304
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,437
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1305
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,637
...leaves traces.

1306
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,111
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?.

1307
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,475
-When you leave the school?.
-Yes.

1308
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,238
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1309
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,313
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1310
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:02,271
once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1311
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,275
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1312
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,954
...that you take too much for granted?.

1313
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:15,955
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?.

1314
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,156
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1315
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,552
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1316
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,758
oh, Harry.

1317
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,470
You need a shave, my friend.

1318
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:55,199
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1319
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:59,148
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1320
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,915
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1321
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,793
I'm an old man.

1322
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,552
You still look the same to me, sir.

1323
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,838
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1324
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,072
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1325
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:21,032
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1326
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,556
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1327
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,472
But there is one condition:

1328
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,712
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1329
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,118
Yes, sir.

1330
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,316
You do understand what I'm saying?.

1331
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,269
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1332
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,670
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1333
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,674
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1334
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,153
Your word, Harry.

1335
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,153
My word.

1336
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,512
Take my arm.

1337
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,189
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1338
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,150
Well, being me has its privileges.

1339
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,038
DUMBLEDORE:
This is the place.

1340
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,313
oh, yes.

1341
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,668
This place has known magic.

1342
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,839
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1343
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,353
...payment must be made.

1344
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:09,990
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1345
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,272
-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

1346
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,314
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1347
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:41,757
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1348
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,117
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1349
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,953
Careful.

1350
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,589
There it is.

1351
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,634
The only question is,
how do we get there?.

1352
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,672
