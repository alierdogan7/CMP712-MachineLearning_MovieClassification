888

If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

889

Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

890

These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

-Poachers.

Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

922

Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

923
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,937
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

924
01:18:55,645 --> 01:18:58,307
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

925

What happens here?

926
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:03,551
FRlAR TUCK: We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

928
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:08,423
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

929
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:11,517
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders
of my superiors

930
01:19:11,594 --> 01:19:13,994
and abide by their saying and rule.

931
01:19:19,035 --> 01:19:21,526
Does His Holiness
know about your wealth of honey?

932
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:27,704
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

933
01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:30,806
The bees are my family.

934
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:33,408
I'm a procreator by design.

935
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:36,880
I'm not a churchy friar. Never was.

936
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,483
My bees give life.

937
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:41,952
They are my life, Sir Robert.

938
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,924
Should not the Bishop be told

939
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:47,188
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

940
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:53,400
What if the grain were not to reach York?

941
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:58,204
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

942
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:10,547
MARlON: I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

943
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,989
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

944
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:19,155
We were wed, and then a week later

945

for France and the Holy Lands.

946
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:26,425

-A good knight.
-Short, but sweet.

949
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:39,807
I mean, he was a good knight.

950
