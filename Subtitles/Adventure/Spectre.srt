how one of our agents decided to
potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

was taking some overdue holiday.

186
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,985

187

188

our dirty work abroad.

191

Of course, he did.

192

security conference in Tokyo

194

have unlimited access

196

streams of nine countries.

197

198

A train bombing in Hamburg and an
industrial explosion in Tunisia.

201
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:09,162
It's not great timing for us.

202
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,764
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

203

feeling the pressure.

209
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:32,452

from prying eyes, as it were.

01:00:27,472 --> 01:00:30,007
C: Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

542
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:33,277
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

543
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:34,378
When it goes online,

544
01:00:34,379 --> 01:00:36,246
this building will be
the most sophisticated

545
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,315
data gathering system in history.

546
01:00:38,316 --> 01:00:41,384
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

547
01:00:41,385 --> 01:00:43,119
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

548
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,755
I'm glad you like it.

549
01:00:44,756 --> 01:00:47,692
My commiserations on
losing the Nine Eyes vote.

550
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:48,860
Must have been a blow.

551
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,128
Not really. Only a matter of time

552
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:52,429
before the South Africans see the light.

553
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,731
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

554
01:00:54,732 --> 01:00:56,800
Day and a half maybe.

555
01:00:56,801 --> 01:01:00,472
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.

556
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:04,241
It's how you use the
information that concerns me,

557
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:05,775
and who is using it.

558
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:08,779
This is what we need to
do to keep the people safe.

559
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,949
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

560
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,451
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field

561
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:16,253
can compete with all of this,

562
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:19,457
running around out there
with his license to kill.

563
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:22,727
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

564
01:01:23,861 --> 01:01:25,628
Have you?

565
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:28,166
To pull that trigger, you have to be sure.

566
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:32,404
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

567
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,606
And then you have to look him in the eye.

568
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,641
And you make the call.

569
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,911
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

570
01:01:41,912 --> 01:01:43,980
all the surveillance in the world

571
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:46,884
can't tell you what to do next.

572
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:50,487
A license to kill

573
01:01:50,488 --> 01:01:54,158
is also a license not to kill.

574
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:59,128
I didn't want to have to do this,

575
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:02,600
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.

01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:19,217
C: So maybe there's something to be said

583
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:21,653
for total surveillance after all.

584
01:02:24,388 --> 01:02:26,925

Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

592
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,621
Our job today is to analyze your needs,

593
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:07,291
both psychological and physical.

594
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,427
Hmm, sounds pretty straightforward.

595
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:12,663
I hope you don't mind. The
view can be distracting.

596
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:14,799
I hadn't noticed.

597
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:23,806
I see you filled out most of the paperwork.

598
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:28,212
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.

599
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:30,213
Do you exercise?

600
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:32,116
When I have to.

601
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:35,653
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?

602
01:04:36,187 --> 01:04:37,820
Sometimes.

603
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:39,790
How much alcohol do you consume?

604
01:04:40,323 --> 01:04:41,959
Too much.

605
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,996
Some broader questions.

606
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:48,599
As a child, would you say you
were close to your parents?

607
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,902
My parents died when I was young.

608
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:54,070
Really? How old?

609
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:55,905
Old enough to remember.

610
01:04:55,906 --> 01:04:57,375
How, if I may ask?

611
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:59,610
It was a climbing accident.

612
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:00,777
So who brought you up?

613
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:03,012
Someone else.

614
01:05:03,013 --> 01:05:05,248
Humor me.

615
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:09,085
How does one train at Oxford and
the Sorbonne become a consultant,

616
01:05:09,086 --> 01:05:12,190
spend two years with
<i>Medecins Sans Frontieres</i>

617
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,292
and end up here?

618
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,360
Forgive me, but anyone might think

619
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:19,530
you were hiding from something.

620
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,367
You're paying a lot of
money to be here, Mr. Bond.

621
01:05:23,368 --> 01:05:25,869
Who's asking the questions, you or me?

622
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,406
Of course. Carry on.

623
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:35,012
I see you left this final question blank.

624
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:36,480
What is your occupation?

625
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:40,483
Well, that's not the sort of
thing that looks good on a form.

626
01:05:40,484 --> 01:05:41,652
And why is that?

627
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:43,154
I kill people.

628
01:05:45,823 --> 01:05:47,524
Small world?

629
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,061
Where is he?

630
01:05:51,062 --> 01:05:52,996
Your father's dead.

631
01:05:52,997 --> 01:05:54,565
Two days ago.

632
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:56,199
(SHUDDERING) How do you know?

633
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,335
Because I was there.

634
01:05:58,336 --> 01:05:59,503
Did you kill him?

635
01:05:59,504 --> 01:06:01,338
I didn't have to.

636
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:03,739
He did it himself.

637
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:07,376
And you came all the
way just to tell me this?

638
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,179
That my father's dead?

639
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:13,150
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

640
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:17,288
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.

641
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,956
You're lying.

642
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:21,358
Why would he trust you?

643
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,795
Because he knew that I
needed something in return.

644
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:26,762
And what was that?

645
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,700
To find <i>L'Americain.</i>

646
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:30,967
This interview is over.

647
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,436
Dr. Swann...

648
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:37,008
You have 10 minutes to leave the
building. Then I'm calling security.

649
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:42,414
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

651
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:05,768
Can I get you something, sir?

652
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,338
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

653
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:11,440
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

654
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:13,677
I'm really starting to love this place.

655
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:16,346
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

656
01:07:16,347 --> 01:07:17,713
Certainly.

657
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:19,148
If you've come for the car,

658
01:07:19,149 --> 01:07:20,851
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

659
01:07:20,852 --> 01:07:24,121
Well, not to worry, 007. It was
only a £3,000,000 prototype.

660
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:25,355
Why are you here, Q?

661
01:07:25,356 --> 01:07:27,358
Oh, I just fancied a break, to be honest.

662
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,527
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.

663
01:07:29,528 --> 01:07:31,527
What with C's people crawling all over us

664
01:07:31,528 --> 01:07:33,530
and the fact that M wants my
balls for Christmas decorations.

665
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,766
- Get to the point.
- The point, 007,

666
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:37,934
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

667
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,503
Dead and buried.

668
01:07:39,504 --> 01:07:40,905
And unless you come back with me right now,

669
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:43,907
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

670
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:46,909
Do you understand? All hell is
breaking loose out there and...

671
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,612
- I saw him.
- You thought you saw him.

672
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:51,280
We've been through the records.

673
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:53,983
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

674
01:07:53,984 --> 01:07:56,018
Yes. I know that.

675
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:57,955
But I saw him.

676
01:07:59,524 --> 01:08:01,993
He's not someone I'll ever forget.

677
01:08:02,993 --> 01:08:05,228
So you have a lead?

678
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:07,096
I have a name. <i>L'Americain.</i>

679
01:08:07,097 --> 01:08:10,000
(SCOFFS) Well, that narrows it down.

680
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:12,369
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

681

My whole career is on the line here.

682
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:17,006
Either you come back in and do
this through proper channels,

683
01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:18,241
or I go directly to M.

684
01:08:18,242 --> 01:08:21,378
Do one more thing for me. Then you're out.

685
01:08:21,946 --> 01:08:24,781
Find out what you can from this.

686
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,625

you? Because my father did?

01:15:07,251 --> 01:15:09,954

- Enchanted.

01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:49,492
She knows.

01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:52,295
- But, Bond...
- She knows.

01:15:54,164 --> 01:15:57,065
I owe you an apology, 007.

You are onto something.

Oberhauser is still
alive. The ring proves it.

731
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,176

part of one organization.

01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:14,850
Exactly.

01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:18,755
This organization, do
you know what it's called?

737
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,357
- No.
- SWANN: Spectre.

738
01:16:22,593 --> 01:16:25,228
Its name is Spectre.

739
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:26,296
How does she know that?

740
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:29,498
Because my father was part of it.

never be hurt by that man again.

do with him or his sick life.

he sends me you.

The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.

was still beating was you.

01:49:42,024 --> 01:49:48,162
As you know all too well, dear
Madeleine, a man lives inside his head.

1074
01:49:48,163 --> 01:49:51,467
That's where the seat of his soul is.

1075
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:54,836
Now, James and I were both present recently

1076
01:49:54,837 --> 01:49:58,338
when a man was deprived of his eyes.

1077
01:49:58,339 --> 01:50:01,708

Didn't you notice?

1079
01:50:03,378 --> 01:50:05,912
He wasn't there anymore.

1080
01:50:05,913 --> 01:50:08,350
He'd gone even though he was still alive.

1081
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:12,319
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

1082
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,658
there was nobody inside his skull.

1083
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:18,526

01:50:19,961 --> 01:50:21,395

1107
01:52:04,466 --> 01:52:09,470
he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.
