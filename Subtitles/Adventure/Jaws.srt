to swim at the beaches

the Hamptons, Long Island.

183
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,258
That doesn't mean we have to
serve them up a smorgasbord.

184
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,627
But we've never had
that kind of trouble
in these waters.

185
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,563
What else could've
done that to that girl?

186
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,827
A boat propeller?

187
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,166
Well, I think, uh, possibly,
uh, yes, a boating accident.

188
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,001
That's not what
you told me on the phone.

189
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,404
I was wrong.

190
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,374
We'll have to
amend our reports.

191
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,704
And you'll
stand by that?

192
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,075
I'll stand by that.

193
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,346

goes swimming,

194
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,349

It's happened before.

I don't think you
appreciate the gut reaction

198
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,484

to these things.

00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,820
Larry, I appreciate it.

200
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,656
I'm just reacting
to what I was told.

201
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,356
Martin,
i-it's all psychological.

202
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,664
You yell, "Barracuda!" and
everybody says, "Huh, what?"

203
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,435
You yell, "Shark!"

204
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,733
we've got a panic on our hands

Okay.

I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

your fingers.

Alex Kintner,
they're beginning to prune.

211
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,526
Just let me go out
a little longer.

212
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,070
Just 10 more minutes.

00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,776
that'll put all
your businesses
on a payin' basis.

357
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,880
But it's not
gonna be pleasant.

358
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,248
I value my neck a lot
more than $3,000, Chief.

359
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,513
(Quint)
I'll find him for $3,000,

360
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,822
but I'll catch him
and kill him for $10,000.

361
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,085
You got to make up
your minds.

362
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,655
Gonna stay alive
and ante up,

363
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,361
gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare
the whole winter.

364
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,168
I don't want
no volunteers.

365
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,399
I don't want no mates.

366
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,169
There's too many
captains on this island.

367
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,042
$10,000 for me,
by myself.

368
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,609
For that,
you get the head,

369
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,549
the tail,
the whole damn thing.

370
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,855
Thank you very much,
Mr. Quint.

371
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,059
We'll, uh, we'll take it
under advisement.

372
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,593
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

373
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,634
ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,919
[clock ticking]

375
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,827
[both exclaiming]

376
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,634
Oh, God,
you scared me.

377
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,075
Oh.

378
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,131
Uh.

379
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,706
You know, Ellen,

380
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,213
people don't even know
how old sharks are.

381
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,272
I mean, if they live
2,000, 3,000 years...

382
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,442
They don't know.

383
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,008
Enough. Enough.

384
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,954
You're not gonna
even be able to go
to sleep tonight here.

385
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,456
Here. Come on.

386
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,655
Thanks.

387
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,321
Oh.

388
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,386
[sighs]

389
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,955
[sighs]

390
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,395
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

391
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,366
Oh, yeah.

392
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,375
Hey, Mikey really
loves his present.

393
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,011
Where is he?

394
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,480
Sitting in it.

395
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,951
Good God.

396
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,154
[children chattering]

397
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,055
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

398
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,859
Tied up to the jetties,
sittin' in the boat.

399
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,161
I'm helping Michael.

400
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,530
Get out of that boat!

401
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,659
(Michael)
Hi, Dad.

402
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,226
Just a little longer.
Please?

403
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,804
Martin, it's his birthday
tomorrow.

404
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,134
I don't want him
on the ocean!

405
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,936
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.

406
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,340
He's not gonna
go in the water.

407
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,310
I don't think
he'll go in the water again,

408
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,074
after what
happened yesterday.

409
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,343
All right,
now don't say that.

410
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,479
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

411
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,415
(Brody)
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

412
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,290
the rules, you know, before
he goes out on his own.

413
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,528
Michael,
did you hear your father?

414
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,156
Out of the water now!

415
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,393
Now!

416
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,708
(Charlie)
I'm tired.

417
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,710
Let's stop before
someone reports us.

418
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,571
(Denherder)
Don't worry.

419
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,206
The Chief lives on
the other side of the island.

420
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,147
Am I coming in straight?

421
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,746
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.

422
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,253

##[Charlie whistling]

424
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,652
We better catch somethin',

425
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,721
this is my wife's
holiday roast.

426
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,260
Don't worry about it.

427
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,494
$3,000 buys
an awful lot of roast.

428
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,230
[grunting]

429
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,175
Come and get it.

430
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,644
(Denherder)
The tide's
taking it right out.

431
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,420
Can't we go home?

432
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,101

[clattering]

435
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,077
Hey, hey,
he's takin' it.

436
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,416
He's takin' it.
He's takin' it. Hey!

437
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,318
(Charlie)
Go! Go! Go!

438
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,644
Charlie,
take my word for it,

439
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,382
don't look back!
Swim, Charlie!

440
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,617
Swim, come on, Charlie!
Swim!

441
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,254
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on!

442
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,318
Come on, Charlie!
Swim! To me!

443
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,624
Come on, Charlie,
keep coming.

444
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,755
Keep swimming.

445
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,697
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.

446
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,167
(Charlie)
I can't get up.
I can't get up.

447
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,535
Give me your hand, Charlie.
Just give me your hand.

448
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,970
(Charlie)
Help me! Help me!

449
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,101
Get your feet
out of the water!

450
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,377
[Charlie panting]

451
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,221
(Charlie)
Can we go home now?

452

[people chattering]

454
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,998
(Hendricks)
So then Denherder and Charlie

455
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,004
sat there trying to
catch their breath,

456
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,199
and figure out
how to tell Charlie's wife

457
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,367
what happened to her
freezer full of meat.

458
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,105
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

459
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,874
Mrs. Kintner must've
put her ad in <i>Field & Stream. </i>

460
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,314
Looks more like
<i>The National Enquirer. </i>

[men chattering]

462
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,709
All right, hold it.
Hold it.

463
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,915
Hold everything.
I said, hold it!

464
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,520
Hello.

465
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,759
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

466
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,734
Say, I hope
you're not goin' out

467
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,565
with those nuts,
are you?

468
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,561
[ship horn blowing]

469
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,237
[people chattering]

470
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,732
The Weetock boat's
gotta move out first.

471
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,677
You have to move out
or he can't get out at all.

472
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,013
Don't raise sail,
you're going to luff it.

473
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,208
You got a paddle
on the boat?

474
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,307
I got a paddle.

475
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,442
Scull it out of here.

476
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,145
Officer, Officer,
wait a second,

477
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,653
wait a second. Just...

478
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,055
Hey, how many guys
are you gonna
put aboard that boat?

479
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,558
(skipper)
Whatever's safe, right?

480
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,991
Yeah, well, that ain't safe.

481
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,961
Hey, hey, watch it,
that's dynamite.

482
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,520
What are you
doing with that?

483
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,031
Where are you
going with that?

484
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,260
I'm going on the boat.

485
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,665
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, please,

486
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,863
help me get those guys out
of the boat, will you?

487
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:00,962
Sure.
Come on.

488
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,563
Gentlemen,
gentlemen,

489
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,403
the officer asked me
to tell you

490
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,535
that you're
overloading that boat!

491
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,078
(Hunter)
Go on, get out of here.

492
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,046
(skipper)
You ain't going.
What do you care?

493
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,639
Then can you tell me

494
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,911
if there's a good restaurant
or hotel on the island?

495
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,850
(Hunter)
Yeah, you walk
straight ahead.

496
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,080
[men chuckling]

497
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,214
They're all
going to die.

498
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,716
Hi, listen to me.

499
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,760
We've got some road
block signs outside.

500
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,761
You... you gotta get
somebody to help us.

501
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,797
Yeah, get some...
Get those road block signs

502
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:27,957
out on the highway.

503
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,761
Because we've got
more people down here

504
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,233
than we can handle.

505
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,767
What're you
doing out there?

506
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,737
These are your people.
Go and talk to them.

507
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:35,898
Those aren't my people.

508
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,305
They're from
all over the place.

509
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,637
You see all
the license plates?

510
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,405
Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New Jersey.

511
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm all by myself
out there.

512
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,637
What happened to
the extra help...

513
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,205
That's not until
the Fourth of July.

514
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,910
Between now and then,
it's you and me.

515
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,283
Uh, you know those guys in
the fan-tail launch out there?

516
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,515
None of them are getting
out of the harbor alive.

517
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,113
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

518
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,250
You know their first names.
Talk to those clowns.

519
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,385
Everyone's seems to be
having a good time today.

520
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,520
Tell me about it.

521
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,756
Polly,
I'll get back to you.

522
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,095
Listen, could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

523
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,191
Who are you?

524
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,235
Matt Hooper.

525
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,497
I'm from the, uh,
Oceanographic Institute.

526
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,732
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called.

527
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,933
I'm Brody. I'm Brody.

528
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,407
Oh, I'm very glad
to meet you.

529
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,443
Glad to meet you, too.

530
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,977
I know you got
a lot on your hands.

531
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,103
What can we
do for you?

532
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,013
I think the best thing for me
to do is to, uh,
see the remains

533
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,913
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

534
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,713
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?

535
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,048
Sure.

536
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,751
Wait till we get
them silly bastards

537
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,052
down in that rock pile.

538
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,888
There'll be some fun.
They'll wish

539
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,951
their fathers
had never met their mothers

540
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,724
when they start
diggin' the bottoms out,

541
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,992
and slamming into
them rocks, boy.

542
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,762
(fisherman No.1)
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!

543
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,531
What's the matter with you?

544
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,368
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

545
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,571
(fisherman No.2)
What are these guys
doing out here?

546
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,439
What the hell
are they doin' back there?

547
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,740
They're chumming right now.

548
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,405
Chumming?
What the hell is that?

549
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,778
They're tracking the shark.

550
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,818
(fisherman No.3)
$3,000 divided 4 ways is what?

551
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,855
(fisherman No.4)
Watch your starboard. Jesus!

552
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,322
Let's show Mr. Hooper
our accident.

553
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,398
"Uh, victim identified
as Christine Watkins,

554
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,766
female Caucasian."

555
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,361
Yeah, and here's
the way we have it.

556
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,906
Probable boating accident.

557
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,963
Yeah.

558
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,664
Good?

559
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,107
The height and weight
of the victim

560
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,447
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

561
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,177
[sighing]

562
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,791
The torso has been
severed in mid-thorax.

563
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,417
There are no
major organs remaining.

564
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,018
May I have
a glass of water, please?

565
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,858
The right arm
has been severed

566
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,094
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss

567
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,930
in the upper
musculature.

568
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,595
Thank you very much.

569
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,536
Partially denuded
bone remaining.

570
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,974
This was
no boat accident.

571
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,035
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?

572
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,310
No. It was only
local jurisdiction.

573
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,518
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum,

574
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,284
and portions of
the rib cage are intact.

575
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,518
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

576
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,395
This is what happens.

577
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,661
It indicates
the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus, </i>

578
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,670
possibly <i>longimanus</i>
or <i>isurus glaucus. </i>

579
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,836
Now, the enormous
amount of tissue loss

580
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,432
prevents any
detailed analysis,

581
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,002
however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be considerably larger

582
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,579
than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

583
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,981
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

584
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,041
No.

585
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,110
Well, this is not
a boat accident.

586
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,883
And it wasn't
any propeller.

587
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,718
It wasn't any coral reef.

588
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,083
And it wasn't
Jack the Ripper.

589
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,651
[sighing]

590
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,597
It was a shark.

591
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,757
[men clamoring]

592
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,010
I wanna go AP and UPI.

593
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,847
I want to get on
the state wire services.

594
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,853
See if Boston'll pick
it up and go national.

595
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,115
Call Dave Axelrod
in New York

596
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,180
and tell him
he owes me a favor, all right?

597
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,987
This is the shot
I want with everybody
and the fish in it, okay?

598
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,290
Guys, could we
please get organized?

599
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,388
(Meadows)
I want to get
a picture for the paper.

600
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,864
Now, can we
just have the...

601
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,491
Ben Gardner get this?

602
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,226
(fisherman)
No, no, no, we caught it.

603
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,793
We got it.
We got it.

604
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,166
[men chattering]

605
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,433
That's swell.

606
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,474
It's a beauty, ain't it?

607
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,137
(Meadows)
Guys, please, I need
a picture for the paper.

608
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,770
Clear out of the way,
please.

609
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,337
Just the guys
that caught the fish.

610
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,939
Just open it up
a little bit, please.

611
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,281
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

612
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,683
Come on, guys.
Come on, please.

613
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,051
I need a picture
for the paper.

614
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,987
Could we get the sign,
please?

615
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,615
[people chattering]

616
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,555
(Meadows)
Kneel down,
just like in high school.

617
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,756
One row kneeling,
one row standing.

618
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,594
Come on,
just get out of the way.

619
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,964
Young fellow, could you
step out of the picture?

620
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,627
Take your rake with you.

621
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,063
(man)
We're ready.

622
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,402
Thank you.

623
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,602
Can you get that, please.

624
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,473
(photographer)
How's that?

625
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,870
Larry.

626
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,914
Larry,
you won't believe it.

627
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,647
What kind of
a shark is that?

628
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,813
I don't know.

629
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,186
I think it's a mako.

630
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,654
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

631
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,817
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

632
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,418
Tiger shark.

633
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,056
A what?

634
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,462
We can start
breathing again.

635
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,966
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

636
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,228
Oh, you bet he is.

637
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,929
What is this
bite radius crap?

638
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,266
That is a big mouth.

639
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,203
You stuff your
friggin' head in there, man,

640
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,902
and find out if
it's a man-eater, all right?

641
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,472
[people chattering]

642
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,946
All I'm saying is
that it may not be the shark.

643
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,279
It's just a slight...

644
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,012
I want you to meet Matt.

645
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,916
This is Larry Vaughn,
our mayor.

646
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,047
Matt's from
the Oceanographic Institute.

647
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,182
Nice to meet you.

648
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,158
Terrific, huh, Mayor, huh?

649
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,987
Martin, there are
all kinds of sharks
in the waters, you know?

650
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,498
Hammerheads, white tips,
blues, makos.

651
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,295
And the chances that these
bozos got the exact shark...

652
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,132
There are no other
sharks like this here.

653
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,435
It's 100-to-1.
A 100-to-1.

654
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,002
Now I'm not saying
that this is not the shark.

655
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,044
It probably is, Martin.
It probably is.

656
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,170
It's a man-eater.

657
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,941
It's extremely rare
for these waters.

658
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,414
But the fact is,
the bite radius on this animal

659
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,850
is different than
the wounds on the victim.

660
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,049
I just... I wanna be sure.
You want to be sure.

661
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,921
We all wanna
be sure, okay?

662
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,619
What I wanna do
is very simple.

663
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,254
The digestive system of this
animal is very, very slow.

664
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,729
Let's cut it open.

665
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,595
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

666
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,258
is bound to
still be in there.

667
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,030
And then we'll be sure.

668
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,306
It may be the only way
to confirm it, huh?

669
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,845
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable, huh.

670
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,478
This is not
the time or the place

671
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,074
to perform some kind of

672
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,450
a half-assed autopsy
on a fish.

673
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,080
And I am not
going to stand here

674
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,749
and see that thing cut open

675
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,554
and see that
little Kintner boy

676
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,595
spill out all over
the dock.

677
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,969
Chief Brody?

678
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,603
Yes?

679
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
[sobbing]

680
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,850
I just found out

681
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,086
that a girl got
killed here last week.

682
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,188
And you knew it.

683
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,860
You knew there was
a shark out there.

684
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,400
[continues sobbing]

685
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,800
You knew it was dangerous.

686
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,900
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

687
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,441
You knew all those things,

688
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,248
but still my boy is dead now.

689
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,252
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

690
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,757
My boy is dead.

691
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,466
I wanted you to know that.

692
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,421
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.

693
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,616
No, she's not.

694
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,099
(Vaughn)
All right, fellows,

695
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,100
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

696
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,102
before it stinks up
the whole island.

697
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,001
Harve, you and Carl
take it out tomorrow

698
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,505
and dump it in the drink.

699
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,178
Come here.

700
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,813
Give us a kiss.

701
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,781
Why?

702
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,552
Because I need it.

703
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,817
[knocking on door]

704
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,955
(Ellen) Get out of here.
Hello?

705
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,628
(Ellen)
Can I help you?

706
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,667
(Hooper)
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?

707
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,066
Uh, I'm Matt Hooper.

708
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,296
Oh, Hi. Ellen Brody.

709
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,360
Your husband's home?

710
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,370
Yes.

711
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,929
I'd really, uh, like
to talk to him.

712
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,599
Uh, yes, so would I.

713
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,537
Come in. Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?

714
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,273
No, no. No, no, no.
Nothing, thank you.

715
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,008
Oh, wine. How nice.

716
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,429
How was your day?

717
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,236
[both snickering]

718
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,502
Swell.

719
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,137
I got, uh,
red and white.

720
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,738
I didn't know
what you'd be serving.

721
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,283
Oh, that's nice.

722
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,943
Is anyone eating this?

723
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,114
No.

724
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,593
My husband tells me
that you're in sharks.

725
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,594
[laughs]

726
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,533
Excuse me.
Well, yes.

727
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,662
l-I've never heard it
quite put that way.

728
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,206
But yes, I am.

729
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,536
I love sharks.

730
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,734
You love sharks?

731
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,107
Yeah, I love them.
I love them.

732
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,203
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me

733
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,271
this boat and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

734
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,543
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in,

735
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,211
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

736
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,587
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

737
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,624
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

738
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,752
He turned an inboard
into an outboard,

739
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,162
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

740
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,462
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

741
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,764
and I actually saw my boat
being taken apart.

742
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,431
Ever since then, yes,
I have been studying sharks,

743
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,100
and that's why I know
that I'm gonna go

744
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,267
to the Institute tomorrow

745
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,708
and tell them
that you still have

746
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,972
a shark problem here.

747
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,980
Why do you have
to tell them that?
Sorry.

748
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,538
I'm sorry,
I thought that...

749
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,083
You told me
the shark was caught.

750
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,413
l... I heard it
on the news.

751
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,748
I heard it on
the Cape station.

752
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,380
They caught a shark,
not the shark.

753
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,484
Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

754
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,355
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

755
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,262
Which I wanted to prove today
by cutting the shark open...

756
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,856
You may want to let
that breathe...

757
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,332
Nothing, nothing.

758
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,033
[laughs]

759
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,938
Yeah, yeah.

760
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,779
You know, uh, you're gonna
be the only rational man

761
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,721
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

762
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,381
Where are you going?

763
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,285
I am going on the <i>Aurora. </i>

764
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,920
The <i>Aurora? </i> What is that?

765
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,793
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

766
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,266
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

767
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,030
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

768
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,471
Martin sits in his car

769
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,874
when we go on
the ferry to the mainland.

770
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,037
I guess it's
a childhood thing. It's, uh...

771
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,047
There's a clinical name
for it, isn't there?

772
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,844
Drowning.

773
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,347
Listen, is it true that
most people get attacked

774
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,319
by sharks in three feet
of water,

775
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,081
about 10 feet
from the beach?

776
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,749
Yeah.

777
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,292
And that... And that before
people started to swim

778
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,486
for recreation...

779
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,656
l... I mean, before sharks
knew what they were missing

780
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,461
that a lot of these
attacks weren't reported?

781
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,202
That's right.

782
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,066
Now this shark
that... that swims alone,

783
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,540
what's it called?
Rogue. Rogue.

784
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,008
Rogue, yeah.

785
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,275
Now, this guy, he,
he, keeps swimming around

786
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,440
in a place where
the feeding is good

787
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,279
until the food supply
is gone, right?

788
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,012
That's called
territoriality.

789
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,317
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

790
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,783
Then why don't we
have one more drink,

791
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,885
and go down and
cut that shark open?

792
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,293
Martin? Can you do that?

793
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,128
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

794
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,132
[foghorn blowing]

795
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,274
We start in
the alimentary canal,

796
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,308
and open the digestive tract.

797
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,082
[grunts]

798
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,456
[panting]

799
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,609
[coughing]

800
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,073
[exclaims]

801
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,446
Just like I thought.

802
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,541
What?

803
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,652
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.

804
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,394
He didn't eat a car, did he?

805
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,656
No.

806
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,129
Tiger shark's
like a garbage can.

807
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,529
It'll eat anything.

808
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,864
Somebody probably
threw that in the river.

809
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,561
[panting]

810
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,302
[exhales]

811
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,241
That's it.

812
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,570
I've got to close the beach,
call the Mayor.

813
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,876
[panting]

814
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,211
You got a bigger
problem than that, Martin.

815
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,852
You still got a hell
of a fish out there

816
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,889
with a mouth about this big.

817
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,555
How do we confirm that
by morning?

818
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,126
If he is a rogue,

819
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,531
and there's any truth
to territoriality at all,

820
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,262
we got a good chance
of spotting him

821
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,065
between Cape Scott
and South Beach.

822
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,332
Where are you going?

823
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,839
To find him.
He's a night feeder.

824
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:11,966
On the water?

825
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,566
We're not gonna
find him on the land.

826
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,202
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

827
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,268
Yes, you are.

828
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,335
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

829
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,972
I can't do that.
Yes, you can.

830
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,322
[boat engine whirring]

831
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,989
I'm telling you,
the crime rate

832
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,459
in New York will kill you.

833
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,328
There's so many problems,

834
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,831
you never feel like you're
accomplishing anything.

835
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,891
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

836
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,434
The kids can't
leave the house.

837
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,369
You've gotta
walk them to school.

838
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,340
But in Amity, one man
can make a difference.

839
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,911
In 25 years,
there's never been

840
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,344
a shooting or a murder
in this town.

841
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,272
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

842
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,177
Where are we?

843
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,049
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

844
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,691
Can you get <i>The Late Show</i>
on this thing?

845
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,751
No, it's a closed circuit
TV system.

846
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,058
I have underwater
cameras fore-and-aft.

847
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,122
Who pays for
all this stuff?

848
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,961
The government?
The Institute?

849
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,093
This stuff costs
a lot of money.

850
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,732
Well, l, uh, I paid for this
mostly myself, actually.

851
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:17,796
You're kidding.

852
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,864
No.

853
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,208
You rich?

854
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,266
Yeah.

855
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,244
Yeah, how much?

856
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,679
Well, personally,
or the whole family?

857
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,875
Doesn't make any sense.

858
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,385
I mean, they pay a guy
like you to watch sharks?

859
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,185
Well, uh, it doesn't
make sense for a guy

860
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,624
who hates the water to
live on an island either.

861
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,388
It's only an island
if you look at it

862
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,656
from the water.

863
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,827
That makes a lot of sense.

864
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,728
[electronic buzzing]

865
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,534
(Brody)
What is that thing doing?

866
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,967
Well, it's a,
it's a fish finder.

867
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,603
It's probably just a school
of mackerel or something,

868
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,306
all clumped together.

869
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,315
[rapid electronic buzzing]

870
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,240
Wait a minute.

871
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,314
There's something else
out there.

872
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,790
What is it?

873
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,918
About 100 yards,
south-southwest.

874
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,293
(Brody)
That's Ben Gardner's boat.

875
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,696
(Hooper)
You know him?

876
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,894
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

877
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,462
What happened?

878
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,809
Look, Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

879
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,315
Wait. Why don't we
just tow it all in?

880
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,716
We will, we will. I just
got to check something out.

881
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,617
Hit the lights for me.

882
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,276
Let's tow it in.

883
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,712
Don't worry, Martin.

884
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,613
Nothing's gonna happen.

885
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,449
[panting]

886
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,450
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

887
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,924
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

888
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,018
Don't touch any
of the equipment.

889
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,261
I'll be back
in two minutes.

890
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,197
[gasping]

891
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,507
[panting]

892
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,712
This is a great white, Larry.
A big one.

893
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,756
Any shark expert will tell you
it's a killer, a man-eater.

894
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,589
Look, the situation is that
apparently a great white shark

895
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,095
has staked a claim in
the waters off Amity Island.

896
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,654
He'll continue to feed here

897
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,290
as long as there's
food in the water.

898
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,857
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

899
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,425
We've already had
three incidents.

900
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,903
Two people killed
within a week.

901
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:42,996
It'll happen again.

902
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,041
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

903
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,200
Five people were killed...

904
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,243
In one week.

905
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,470
Tell him about
the swimmers.

906
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,513
A shark is attracted to
the exact kind of

907
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,808
splashing and activity

908
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,509
that occurs whenever
human beings swim.

909
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,845
You cannot avoid it.

910
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,113
Opening the beaches on
the Fourth of July is like

911
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,484
ringing the dinner bell.

912
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,988
Look, Mr. Vaughn,
Mr. Vaughn,

913
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,287
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass

914
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,350
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.

915
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,918
It was the tooth
of a great white.

916
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,964
It was Ben Gardner's boat,
all chewed up.

917
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,999
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

918
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,831
Where... where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

919
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,028
No, I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.

920
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,663
I had an accident.

921
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,337
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

922
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,137
It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias. </i>

923
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,737
It's a great white.

924
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,783
But you... you don't
have the tooth?

925
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,886
Look, we depend on
the summer people here
for our very lives...

926
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,421
You won't have a summer

927
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,047
unless you deal
with this problem!

928
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,591
We have to close the beach

929
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,286
and hire someone
to kill the shark!

930
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,260
I mean, we have to
tell the Coast Guard.

931
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,230
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

932
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,597
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

933
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,397
I don't think
either one of you

934
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,199
are familiar
with our problems!

935
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,466
Uh, I think that I am
familiar with the fact

936
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,735
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

937
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,141
until it swims up
and bites you in the ass!

938
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,509
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

939
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,514
There are two ways
to deal with this problem!

940
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,449
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

941
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,577
(Brody)
Larry, we have to
close the beaches.

942
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,950
Brody?

943
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,947
Sick vandalism.

944
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,558
That is
a deliberate mutilation

945
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,321
of a public service message.

946
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,027
Now, I want those little
paint-happy bastards

947
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,497
caught and hung up
by their Buster Browns.

948
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,659
That's it. I won't waste
my time arguing with

949
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,828
a man who's lining
up to be a hot lunch.

950
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,496
I'm gonna see you
later, Brody.

951
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,631
Please, don't do this.
He's not...

[people chattering]

953
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,640
Mr. Vaughn,

954
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,572
What we are
dealing with here

955
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,085
is a perfect engine, uh,
an eating machine.

956
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,148
It's really
a miracle of evolution.

957
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:42,055
All this machine does
is swim and eat

958
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,816
and make little sharks.
And that's all.

959
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,826
Why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign?

960
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,627
Those proportions
are correct.

961
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,496
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?

962
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,968
Get your name into
the <i>National Geographic. </i>

963
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,969
[laughing]

964
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,976
(Brody)
Larry, Larry,
if we make an effort today,

965
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,643
we might be able
to save August.

966
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,744
August? For Christ's sake,

967
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,288
tomorrow's
the Fourth of July!

968
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,085
We will be
open for business.

969
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,353
It's gonna be one of the best
summers we've ever had.

970
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,452
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

971
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,656
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.

972
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,723
But those beaches will be
open for this weekend.

you're going to send me.

There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane

white shark right here!
