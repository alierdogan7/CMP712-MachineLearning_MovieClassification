PETER: Yeah, I remember a picture
of that in my dad's office.

617
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,930
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

618
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,577
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even a city.

cure polio in an afternoon.

That's incredible.

621
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,716
Well, others disagreed. What if the
device were loaded with a toxin?

622
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,878
What if you wanted to
opt out? You can't

good things for other people,

you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

1080
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,018
I got no idea.

1081
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,718
First time.

1082
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,454
(WHISPERS) Branzino.
HELEN: George.

1083
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,395
Tell us about your day.
Did you catch that spider guy yet?

1084
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,125
CAPTAIN STACY:
No, we didn't catch him yet.

1085
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,200
But we will. He's an amateur

1086
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,067
who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

1087
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,105
He's clumsy,
he leaves clues,

1088
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,641
but he's still dangerous.

1089
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,978
He's assaulting people?

1090
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,814
I'm not sure.

1091
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,449
I mean, I saw that video

1092
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,585
with him and the car thief, and...

1093
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,881
I think most people
would say that he was

1094
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,988
providing a public service.

1095
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,659
Most people would be wrong.

1096
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,420
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

1097
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,861
So why wasn't he then?

1098
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,464
(CHUCKLES)

1099
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,894
Let me illuminate you.

1100
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,666
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run

1101
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,070
the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

1102
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,236
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

1103
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,905
You've heard about that in school?
Yeah.

1104
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:29,947
CAPTAIN STACY:
Good.

1105
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,346
(MOUTHS)
<i>I know.</i>

1106
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,181
He didn't know you had a plan.
You seem to know

1107
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,117
a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

1108
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,588
Whose side are you on?
I'm not on anyone's side.

1109
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,124
I saw a video on the internet...
Oh.

1110
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,818
You saw the video on the Internet.

1111
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,191
Well, then the case is closed.
PETER: Well, no.

1112
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,330
If you watch the video...

1113
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:46,967
Maybe send you a link?

1114
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,796
It looks like he's trying to help.

1115
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,837
On the Internet he's being
made out to look like a hero.

1116
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:52,665
No, no.

1117
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,535
I'm not saying he's a hero.

1118
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,041
What are you trying to say?
He's trying to help.

1119
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,542
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

1120
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,112
Something the police can't?

1121
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,805
I don't know.
What do you think we do?

1122
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,507
Sit around eating doughnuts

1123
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,481
with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

1124
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,678
(IN NORMAL VOICE) George. George.
Daddy.

1125
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,615
Up your what?
HELEN: Howard.

1126
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,620
He stands for what you stand for.

1127
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,315
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

1128
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,552
CAPTAIN STACY: I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

1129
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,321
Okay? I wear a badge.

1130
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,523
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

1131
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,225
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same,

1132
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,563
like he's got some son
of personal vendetta.

1133
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:27,731
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

1134
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,739
Let's get some air, Peter.

1135
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,539
Dad, we need to talk.
CAPTAIN STACY: Yes, we do.

1136
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,746
PETER:
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry

1137
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,180
if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

1138
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,686
You're welcome.
Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

1139
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,950
Thank you.
HELEN: You're welcome.

1140
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,186
SIMON: Dad.
CAPTAIN STACY: Yeah?

1141
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,356
(♪♪♪)

1142
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,869
Well, that was something.

1143
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,400
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

1144
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,205
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

1145
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,883
What happened to your face?
I wanna tell you something.

1146
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,043
Oh. Heh.

1147
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,783
Okay.

1148
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,224
I've been bitten...

1149
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,432
So have I.

1150
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,306
Okay.

1151
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,301
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

1152
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,241
I gotta tell you this one thing
about
