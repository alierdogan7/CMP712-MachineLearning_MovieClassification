myself in need of a ship and a crew.

92

Hmm. lt's an odd coincidence.

93
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,697
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

94

No.

95
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,870
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

97
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:27,075

- That he would get caught!

You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

But l cannot help but wonder...

112
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,695
Why?

113
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:01,875
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

114
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,146
We must convene the Brethren Court.

115
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:12,178
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

120
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,312
lt is true.

121
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,646
lt seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

122
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:44,687
...is by betraying other pirates.

123
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:47,122
[Barbossa] We must put
our differences aside.

124
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,250
Wait for the signal.

125
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,489
[Barbossa] The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

126
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:56,227
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

127
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,097
[Sao Feng] Against East lndia
Trading Company,

128
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,832

00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,338
What can any of us do?

130
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:07,242
You can fight!
Get off me!

131
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,770
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

132
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:15,548
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

133
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,490
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

134
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,821
and those who pass the test
become legend.

135
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,258
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

136

The most notorious pirates
from around the world

137

138

There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

And the eye does not go wanting.

142
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:56,926
But l cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

143
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:01,664
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

144
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:02,927
Jack Sparrow.

...l would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

149
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:24,485
...is so l can send him back myself!

150
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,192
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

151
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,722
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

152
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,429
So we must go and get him back.

153
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:47,975
So you admit...

154
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,577

Drop your weapons or l kill the man!

Kill him. He's not our man.

lt's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

181
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:35,979
The East lndia Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

182
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,480
lt is coincidence only.

183
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,116
[gun cocks]

184
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:45,087
lf you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what l offer.

185
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:50,818
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

186
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,924
Why should l expect any better?

187
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,865
<i>l need the Black Pearl
to free my father.</i>

188
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,765
You're helping me to get it.

189
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,348
[squawks] Uh-oh.

190
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,155
Fire in the hole.

191
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,827
[popping and exploding]

192
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,567
[man screaming]

193
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:38,535
Thank you, Jack.

194
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,702
- [screeches]
- [squawk] Thank you, Jack.

195
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,745
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

196
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:49,148
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

197
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,053
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

198
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:53,954
This way. Be quick.

199
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,994
[Gibbs] Haul the snotters with a will!

200
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,762
[Pintel] Keep it taut.

201
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,828
[Gibbs] Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

202
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,739
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

203
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,709
Do you think he will honor the call?

204
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,247
l cannot say.

205
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,379
There's an evil on these seas

206
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:25,787
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

207
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,444
[cannon fire booming]

208
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,357
A piece of eight.

209
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:36,821
Nine of them, you say.

210
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:39,988
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

211
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,656
Nine pieces of eight.

212
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:44,292
What's the significance of that,
l wonder.

213
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:46,700
Nothing can hold against the armada.

214
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,001
<i>Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.</i>

215
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,597
Nothing we know of.

216
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:55,309
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

217
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,109
He was mum on that, sir.

218
00:21:58,182 --> 00:21:59,649
Hmm.

219
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,151
Then he knows the value of information.

220
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:05,017
Better keep this between ourselves.

221
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,388
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

222
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:14,994
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

223
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,796
Yes. Something for you there.

224
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:21,235
Your new station deserves an old friend.

225
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,352
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

226
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,980
Execution.

227
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:41,649
[sword unsheathed]

228
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:48,058
The Brethren know they face extinction.

229
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:53,435
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

230
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,426
No one said anything about cold.

231
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:25,265
l'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

232
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,205
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

233
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:33,801
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

234
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:39,378
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

235
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,615
to a place not of death, but punishment.

236
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:48,522
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

237
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,189
...stretching on forever.

238
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,121
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

239
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:02,670
Yeah. l knew there was a good reason.

240
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:12,105
[groaning]

241
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,915
[shudders] Nothing here is set.

242
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,282
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

243
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:24,020
No. But it leads to more places.

244
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,624
"Over the edge.

245
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,136
Over again."

246
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,669
"Sunrise sets.

247
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,734
Flash of green."

248
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:46,606
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

249
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:52,287
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

250
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:56,918
l reckon l seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

251
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,794
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

252
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:04,190
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

253
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:07,101
Some claim to have seen it who ain't .
And some say...

254
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:11,335
lt signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

255
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,508
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

256
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,916
lt's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

257
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,918
lt's getting back.

258
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:07,565
[man] Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

259
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:12,161
[man] Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

260
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,464
[man 2] Aye, aye, sir!

261
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,733
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

262
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,176
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

263
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,614
Fetch the chest.

264
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,477
And the governor?

265
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:32,018
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

266
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,421
Does he know?

267
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:41,658
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

268
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:55,243
- [organ playing]
- [sighing]

269
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,611
[music box playing]

270
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,108
[music box stops]

271
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,917
[man] Step lively, men.

272
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:45,919
Step lively!

273
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,192
Stand fast!

274
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:57,601
Steady, men.

275
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,250
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

276
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,288
l will not have it on my ship!

277
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:15,883
Oh, l'm sorry to hear that...
because l will.

278
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,860
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

279
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,330
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

280
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,972
We need prisoners to interrogate,

281
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,237
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

282
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,212
<i>The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.</i>

283
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:41,183
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

284
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:47,883
l would have thought you'd learned that
when l ordered you to kill your pet.

285
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,556
This is no longer your world, Jones.

286
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:56,764
The immaterial has become...

287
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,630
...immaterial.

288
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,831
[Norrington] Charge your bayonets.

289
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,742
[heartbeat]

290
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:44,212
How long do we continue not talking?

291
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:50,743
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

292
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,290
Then we rescue Jack.

293
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:23,781
For what we want most...

294
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,088
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

295
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,307
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

296
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,838
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

297
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:50,903
to find a place as can't be found.

298
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,347
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

299
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:56,085
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

300
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:58,679
To stations!

301
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,189
All hands to stations!

302
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:04,022
- [men shouting]
- Huh?

303
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:06,995
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

304
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:11,899
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

305
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,032
Blimey.

306
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:32,419
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

307
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:35,151
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

308
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:39,059
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

309
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,062
Tie her off.

310
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,732
[muttering]

311
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,436
Hard aport.

312
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,117
[men shouting]

313
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,209
Hold on!

314
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:35,082
- [music playing]
- [cannons firing]

315
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:39,782
<i>[man laughs] Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.</i>

316
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:45,385
<i>[man 2] Dead men tell no tales.</i>

317
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,293
<i>[echoing]</i>

318
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,892
[man sniffing]

319
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:20,591
[gunshot]

320
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:35,010
My peanut.

321
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:38,672
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

322
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,047
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

323
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:43,245
Step lively with a will.

324
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,912
-Aye, aye.
-Right away, sir.

325
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,683
l want a fire down below!

326
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:53,524
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

327
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,929
[muffled groaning]

328
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,496
[clucking]

329
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:08,308
[all] Haul! Haul!

330
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,245
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

331
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:13,111
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

332
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,098
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n .

333
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,596
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

334
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:36,739
- lt be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

335
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:40,675
lt is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
lt is not acceptable nor adequate.

336
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:43,178
lt is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

337
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:46,773
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

338
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:49,118
- Shall l?
- [unsheathes sword]

339
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,150
lt's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

340
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,762
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

341
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:06,064
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

342
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,933
Do you understand?

343
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:11,132
- [all] Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

344
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:14,872
lt will all have to be redone.
All of it.

345
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:17,413
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

346
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,973
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

347
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,020
l have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

348
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,988
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

349
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:33,786
Gentlemen, l wash my hands
of this weirdness.

350
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,740
No wind.

351
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,211
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

352
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,314
My soul l do swear for a breeze.

353
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:57,217
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

354
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,491
Yes, sir, l know, but why?
Why would he do that?

355
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,264
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

356
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:18,034
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

357
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:32,721
Shoo.

358
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:53,003
A rock.

359
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:23,864
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

360
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:25,163
Oh.

361
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,201
A rope.

362
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:37,176
[grunting]

363
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,590
[panting]

364
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:11,607
[rumbling]

365
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,576
[coughing and gagging]

366
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:52,012
This truly is a godforsaken place.

367
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:55,849
l don't see Jack.
l don't see anyone.

368
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,820
He's here.

369
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:02,194
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

370
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,698
And does it matter?

371
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,827
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

372
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:15,171
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

373
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,343
lmpossible.

374
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:03,981
Boat.

375
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:14,268
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. lt's Jack.

376
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,109
- lt's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

377
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:27,274
[parrot] Hide the rum.

378
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,284
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n .

379
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:30,717
l thought so.

380
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,756
l expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

381
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:34,812
Sir?

382
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:38,918
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

383
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,327
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

384
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,963
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n .

385
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,970
l know that.
l know where l am.

386
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:56,273
- And don't think l don't .
- Jack Sparrow.

387
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,845
Oh, Hector.

388
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,849
lt's been too long. Hasn't it?

389
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:05,718
Aye. lsla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

390
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,988
No, l didn't .

391
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,151
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

392
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:15,129
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

393
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:18,366
He thinks we're a hallucination.

394
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:20,930
William, tell me something:

395
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:25,031
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

396
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,669
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

397
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,201
No.

398
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,714
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

399
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:36,775
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

400
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,218
[Elizabeth] Jack.

401
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,324
This is real. We're here.

402
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,965
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

403
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,704
We've come to rescue you.

404
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,837
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

405
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:07,246
But it would seem that
as l possess a ship and you don't ,

406
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:11,479
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and l'm not sure as l'm in the mood.

407
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:15,849
l see my ship. Right there.

408
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,886
Can't spot it.

409
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:24,297
<i>Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.</i>

410
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,165
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

411
00:43:27,236 --> 00:43:30,603
<i>- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.</i>

412
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:33,540
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

413
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,410
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

414
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,142
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

415
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,013
And you need a crew.

416
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,315
Why should l sail with any of you?

417
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,881
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

418
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,066
Oh, she's not told you.

419
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:59,966
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

420
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:02,804
As for you...

421
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,910
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

422
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,939
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

423
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:14,950
Don't need you. You scare me.

424
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:18,886
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

425
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:20,616
- Cotton.
- [parrot squawks]

426
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,218
Cotton's parrot, l'm a little iffy, but
at least l'll have someone to talk to.

427
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:27,693
Who are you?

428
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,062
Tai Huang. These are my men.

429
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:34,567
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

430
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:38,667
- l have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

431
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:42,768
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

432
00:44:42,845 --> 00:44:44,039
[parrot] Weigh anchor.

433
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,209
[Barbossa] Jack...

434
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:54,148
Which way are you going, Jack?

435
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:59,591
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

436
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:02,222
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

437
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:03,731
What are you doing?

438
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,394
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

439
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,233
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

440
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:11,796
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

441
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,035
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

442
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,602
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

443
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,171
That makes you " chartman."

444
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:25,152
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

445
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:34,190
Sorry. l just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

446
00:45:34,263 --> 00:45:37,198
l'd throw in my name for consideration.

447
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:38,528
Sorry.

448
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:45,570
- l'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

449
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:22,842
You left Jack to the Kraken.

450
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:26,040
He's rescued now. lt's done with.

451
00:46:29,218 --> 00:46:31,186
Will, l had no choice.

452
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:34,286
You chose not to tell me.

453
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:36,953
l couldn't .

454
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,886
lt wasn't your burden to bear.

455
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:42,762
But l did bear it, didn't l?

456
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,332
l just didn't know what it was.

457
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:48,763
l thought...

458
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:51,930
You thought l loved him.

459
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:04,283
lf you make your choices alone,
how can l trust you?

460
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,587
You can't .

461
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,375
[ship creaking]

462
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,242
[gasps]

463
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:38,313
Eerie.

464
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:42,250
That's downright macabre.

465
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:51,460
l wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

466
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,131
[both chuckling]

467
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,572
Be disrespectful, it would.

468
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:07,412
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

469
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:12,214
That was the duty
him was charged with...

470
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,217
...by the goddess, Calypso.

471
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:20,893
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

472
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,168
And every ten years...

473
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,096
...him could come ashore...

474
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:34,439
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

475
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:41,375
But the man has become a monster.

476
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:46,011
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

477
00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:49,284
No.

478
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,894
Him was a man...

479
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,954
...once.

480
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:05,297
Now there's boats coming.

481
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,746
They're not a threat to us. Am l right?

482
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:18,946
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

483
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,285
lt's best just let them be.

484
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,239
lt's my father. We've made it back.

485
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,867
Father! Father, here, look here!

486
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:43,770
Elizabeth.

487
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,239
We're not back.

488
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,381
Father!

489
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:02,153
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

490
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,730
No. No.

491
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,430
l think l am.

492
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,494
No, you can't be.

493
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,506
There was this chest, you see.

494
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:17,939
lt's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

495
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:19,842
Come aboard.

496
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:21,678
And a heart.

497
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:27,018
l learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

498
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:30,616
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

499
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:33,685
<i>The Dutchman must have a captain.</i>

500
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,755
Silly thing to die for.

501
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,364
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

502
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:43,296
Come on.

503
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:48,605
A touch... of destiny.

504
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,777
Take the line.

505
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,479
l'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

506
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:59,282
Father, the line! Take the line!

507
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:05,424
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

508
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:09,760
Please come with us!
Please! No! l won't leave you!

509
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,390
l'll give your love to your mother.

510
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:15,335
- Please, l won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

511
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,463
- Elizabeth.
- [sobbing]

512
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:24,841
ls there a way?

513
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:31,347
Him at peace.

514
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:40,319
No water.

515
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,557
Why is all but the rum gone?

516
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,634
Rum's gone too.

517
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:59,440
lf we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

518
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:03,417
l fear we will sail on trackless seas.

519
00:52:03,486 --> 00:52:06,717
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

520
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:08,615
Forever.

521
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:12,650
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

522
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:14,958
Why doesn't he do something?

523
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:18,231
- [Ragetti] Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

524
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,634
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

525
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:27,669
[Gibbs] "Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

526
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,278
Sunrises don't set.

527
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:36,683
[Jack] "Up is down."

528
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:39,243
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

529
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,289
Why are these things never clear?

530
00:52:41,357 --> 00:52:44,190
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

531
00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:50,354
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

532
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,595
<i>- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.</i>

533
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:56,194
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

534
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:59,036
Sail the seas for eternity.

535
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:02,043
- l love the sea.
- What about port?

536
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,102
l prefer rum. Rum's good.

537
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:09,174
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

538
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:13,180
- Once every 1 0 years.
- What'd he say?

539
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:16,713
- Once every 1 0 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

540
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,124
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

541
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,459
But eternity is longer still.

542
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,224
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

543
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:27,300
Or not?

544
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:31,237
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, l like that.

545
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,872
Come sunset, it won't matter.

546
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,374
Not sunset.

547
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:42,844
Sundown.

548
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:46,344
And rise. Up.

549
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:48,817
What's that?

550
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:54,755
What is that?
l don't know. What do you think?

551
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,525
- Where?
- There.

552
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:05,569
[Jack grunting, stammers]

553
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,651
What is it?

554
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,531
He's rocking the ship.

555
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:35,496
We're rocking the ship.

556
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:42,475
Aye. He's onto it.

557
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:44,705
[creaking]

558
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,509
He's rocking the ship.

559
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:48,982
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

560
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,713
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

561
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,345
Time it with the swell.

562
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:59,688
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

563
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,059
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

564
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:07,531
[crew shouting in Chinese]

565
00:55:56,752 --> 00:55:58,379
[ship creaking]

566
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:01,981
[screaming]

567
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:11,397
Now up...

568
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:14,299
...is down.

569
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:36,148
[coughing]

570
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,485
[squawks]

571
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,290
This was your idea.

572
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,360
Blessed sweet westerlies!

573
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:58,495
We're back!

574
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:03,608
lt's the sunrise.

575
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,749
- [screeches]
- Parley?

576
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:21,295
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

577
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:38,144
All right, then!

578
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:41,341
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

579
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:45,113
And, Jack, you and l are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

580
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:46,586
l is arguing the point.

581
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,284
lf there's pirates a-gathering,
l'm pointing my ship the other way.

582
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,795
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

583
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:56,160
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

584
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:59,257
lf we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

585
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:00,961
till there be none left but you.

586
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:07,331
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

587
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:08,433
Aye.

588
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:13,313
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

589
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:15,373
l'm still working on that.

590
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,944
But l will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

591
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:21,046
[clicks]

592
00:59:22,157 --> 00:59:24,421
[guns clicking]

593
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:26,958
Wet powder.

594
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:33,225
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

595
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:37,762
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

596
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,899
There's fresh water on this island.

597
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:44,605
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

598
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:47,711
You lead the shore party.
l'll stay with my ship.

599
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:50,617
l'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

600
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:54,315
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

601
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:56,888
Temporarily.

602
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:01,494
[telescope opening]

603
01:00:09,805 --> 01:00:12,273
[shouting]

604
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,268
[squawks] Mind the boat.

605
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:30,223
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

606
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:47,706
[seagulls cawing]

607
01:00:49,244 --> 01:00:51,235
Careful! Careful!

608
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:54,681
You stupid fish!

609
01:00:54,816 --> 01:00:56,784
Actually it's a cephalopod.

610
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:58,446
Serves you right.

611
01:00:58,587 --> 01:01:01,579
[Ragetti] Pin, l bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

612
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,820
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

613
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:07,919
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

614
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:10,829
[Ragetti] We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

615
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:13,493
Still thinking of running, Jack?

616
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:16,760
Think you can outrun the world?

617
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:26,278
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

618
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,044
...by and by, there be none left at all.

619
01:01:30,452 --> 01:01:35,446
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

620
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:38,652
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

621
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:42,023
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

622
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:45,193
But passing on, that's dead certain.

623
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:51,562
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

624
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,369
lt's our only hope, lad.

625
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:57,768
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

626
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:02,076
The world used to be a bigger place.

627
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:06,653
The world's still the same.

628
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:11,354
There's just... less in it.

629
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:35,980
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

630
01:02:38,787 --> 01:02:42,587
Eh, l know him. He was in Singapore!

631
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:44,648
- [squawks] Singapore.
- Captain!

632
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:48,588
Hoy!

633
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:51,461
We got company!

634
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:04,639
He's the captain.

635
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,439
[shouting]

636
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,387
Sao Feng...

637
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:20,952
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

638
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:25,392
[Sao Feng] Jack Sparrow.

639
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,462
You paid me great insult once.

640
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,028
That doesn't sound like me.

641
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,407
[groans]

642
01:03:35,944 --> 01:03:38,105
Shall we just call it square, then?

643
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:39,807
Release her.

644
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:44,449
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

645
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,311
You heard Captain Turner.

646
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:51,451
- Release her!
-"Captain Turner" ?

647
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:54,290
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

648
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,922
<i>l need the Pearl to free my father.</i>

649
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:59,489
That's the only reason
l came on this voyage.

650
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,868
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

651
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,133
lt was my burden to bear.

652
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:11,675
<i>He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.</i>

653
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:15,807
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

654
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,787
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

655
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:30,464
l'm standing with them.

656
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:38,300
l'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

657
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,002
l'm not certain l can survive
any more visits from old friends.

658
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:46,642
Here is your chance to find out.

659
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,718
Curious.

660
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,955
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

661
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:05,557
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

662
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,602
<i>can defeat the Flying Dutchman.</i>

663
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:11,772
And so despair leads to betrayal.

664
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:16,166
But you and l are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

665
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,437
lt's not here, Jack.

666
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,249
What? What isn't ?

667
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,812
<i>The heart of Davy Jones.
lt's safely aboard the Dutchman,</i>

668
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,915
and so unavailable for use as leverage

669
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,654
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

670
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,993
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

671
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,191
[Beckett] By your death?

672
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,326
And yet here you are.

673
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,498
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

674
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,005
That's how l get by.

675
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:50,537
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

676
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:52,613
[man] Ship oars.

677
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,239
[man 2] Ship oars.

678
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,141
Be on your guard, men.

679
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,652
My men are crew enough.

680
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:02,883
Company ship, company crew.

681
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,860
<i>You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.</i>

682
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:09,161
And so it was.

683
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:15,293
[Beckett] Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

684
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:20,603
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

685
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:31,747
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
ln exchange for fair compensation?

686
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,880
Square my debt with Jones...

687
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,789
...guarantee my freedom?

688
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,486
Of course.

689
01:06:39,561 --> 01:06:41,495
lt's just good business.

690
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:47,365
Were l in a divulgatory mood,
what then might l divulge?

691
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,630
Everything.

692
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,402
Where are they meeting?

693
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,198
Who are the pirate lords?

694
01:06:55,176 --> 01:06:58,373
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

695
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:02,142
[man] Prepare the brig.

696
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:09,722
<i>Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.</i>

697
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,454
<i>He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?</i>

698
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,971
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

699
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,271
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

700
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:32,140
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

701
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:36,741
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

702
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:40,686
<i>- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.</i>

703
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,245
<i>Now the Pearll</i>

704
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,192
And what do the Brethren have?

705
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,954
We have Calypso.

706
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,104
[laughs] Calypso.

707
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:03,167
An old legend.

708
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:09,249
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

709
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:14,951
lmagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

710
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:20,325
l intend to release her.
But for that l need the Brethren Court.

711
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:24,289
All the Court.

712
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:27,862
You can keep Barbossa.

713
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:31,997
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

714
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:34,598
And Turner. Especially Turner.

715
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:38,134
<i>The rest go with me on the Pearl.
l'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,</i>

716
01:08:38,213 --> 01:08:42,547
where l will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

717
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:47,145
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

718
01:08:49,891 --> 01:08:52,018
What interest is she to you?

719
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:56,928
What are you proposing, captain?

720
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,990
What be accepting, cap'n ?

721
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:03,835
- The girl.
- What?

722
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:05,463
Jack.

723
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,938
l've just recalled.

724
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:13,003
l've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever l want.

725
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,812
So for what do l need you?

726
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:17,909
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

727
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,051
Out of the question.

728
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,918
lt was not a question.

729
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,753
Points to the thing you want most.

730
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:26,020
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

731
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:29,325
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

732
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:32,426
- Dead.
- Done.

733
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,162
What? Not done.

734
01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:37,796
You got us into this.
lf it frees us, then done!

735
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:38,964
Damn.

736
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:46,944
Although, if l kill you,
then l can use the compass

737
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:51,509
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

738
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:54,219
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

739
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:56,018
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

740
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,582
l have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

741
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,561
Then we have an accord?

742
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:06,992
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

743
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:10,265
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

744
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:13,273
...able to withstand blockade for years.

745
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:17,903
Then you'd be wishing, "lf only there
was someone l had not killed inside

746
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:21,482
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

747
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,250
And you can accomplish all this?

748
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:28,613
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

749
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:30,015
Who am l?

750
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,022
l'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

751
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,792
[rumbling]

752
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:39,025
Done!

753
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,837
- [man shouting]
- [cannon fire]

754
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,460
[man] Man overboard!

755
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:28,742
You're mad.

756
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,281
Thank goodness.
lf l wasn't , this'd probably never work.

757
01:11:36,891 --> 01:11:39,257
[Jack shouting]

758
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:53,134
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

759
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:05,415
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

760
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,316
Which ship do we follow?

761
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:14,054
<i>Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.</i>

762
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,554
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

763
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:19,964
[wood cracking]

764
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:21,732
[man] She's going down!

765
01:12:21,803 --> 01:12:23,327
[man 2] Stand clear!

766
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:32,345
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

767
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:35,204
Sir.

768
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:57,463
[speaking Chinese]

769
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:23,621
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

770
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,566
Calypso.

771
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:30,136
Excuse me?

772
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:35,268
Not a name you fancy, l imagine,
out of the many that you have...

773
01:13:35,843 --> 01:13:37,470
...but it is what we call you.

774
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,574
We being who?

775
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,116
You confirm it.

776
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:49,888
Confirm what?

777
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:55,755
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not l.

778
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:00,426
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision l would have opposed.

779
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:03,436
They bound you to human form

780
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:06,962
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

781
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,804
To me.

782
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:16,248
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

783
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,911
Pretty speech from a captor.

784
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:22,979
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

785
01:14:23,324 --> 01:14:26,316
Can l be blamed for my efforts?

786
01:14:28,296 --> 01:14:32,562
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

787
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:36,433
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

788
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,997
l offer simply my desire.

789
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:42,966
And in return?

790
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:48,014
l would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

791
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:56,079
And if l should choose not?

792
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,560
Then l will take...

793
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:01,919
...your fury.

794
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:06,761
[grunting]

795
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:08,893
[Elizabeth panting]

796
01:15:16,878 --> 01:15:19,210
[pirates shouting]

797
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:29,019
Sao Feng?

798
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:31,717
Here.

799
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,593
Please.

800
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:42,994
With all nine pieces of eight...

801
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,532
...you will be free.

802
01:15:49,377 --> 01:15:50,503
Take it!

803
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:54,177
You are captain now.

804
01:15:55,349 --> 01:15:56,373
Me?

805
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,616
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

806
01:16:05,693 --> 01:16:08,287
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

807
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,291
Forgive me... Calypso.

808
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,367
[explosions and shouting]

809
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:23,635
Sao.

810
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:30,444
What did he tell you?

811
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,388
He made me captain.

812
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,890
Set! Fire!

813
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,360
You are not my captain.

814
01:16:49,637 --> 01:16:50,968
Elizabeth.

815
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,397
James. James.

816
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:00,113
Thank God, you're alive.

817
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:02,373
Your father'll be overjoyed

818
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,283
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

819
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:08,483
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

820
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:11,424
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

821
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:15,491
Who among you
do you name as captain?

822
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,053
Captain. Her.

823
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:18,792
[all] Her.

824
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:22,761
Captain?

825
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:26,500
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

826
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,776
The captain shall have my quarters.

827
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:32,812
Thank you, sir.

828
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,611
- But l prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

829
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:38,174
l swear.

830
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,178
l did not know.

831
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:44,384
Know what?
Which side you chose?

832
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,163
Well, now you do.

833
01:18:02,843 --> 01:18:03,832
Bootstrap?

834
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:09,641
[chuckling]

835
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:13,750
Bootstrap.

836
01:18:14,255 --> 01:18:15,483
Bill Turner?

837
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:17,750
[man] Bootstrap.

838
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:28,834
You know my name.

839
01:18:32,339 --> 01:18:33,704
Yes, l know your son.

840
01:18:35,776 --> 01:18:37,300
Will Turner.

841
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:39,838
William.

842
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,211
He made it. He's alive.

843
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:52,521
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

844
01:18:54,495 --> 01:18:56,861
God's wounds. He's on his way.

845
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,296
Yes, Will is alive.

846
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:01,292
And he wants to help you.

847
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:10,403
He can't help me. He won't come.

848
01:19:11,178 --> 01:19:12,736
But you're his father.

849
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,344
l know you.

850
01:19:16,183 --> 01:19:17,741
He spoke of you.

851
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,883
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

852
01:19:24,258 --> 01:19:25,282
Me?

853
01:19:26,827 --> 01:19:28,556
You're Elizabeth.

854
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,397
Yes, l'm Elizabeth.

855
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,160
lf Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

856
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:41,606
Captain... Forever.

857
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:47,447
<i>The Dutchman
must always have a captain.</i>

858
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:50,242
And if he saves me...

859
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:53,317
...he loses you.

860
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,382
l see.

861
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,225
He won't pick me.

862
01:20:02,163 --> 01:20:04,324
l wouldn't pick me.

863
01:20:09,403 --> 01:20:10,927
Tell him not to come.

864
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,267
Tell him to stay away.

865
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:18,602
Tell him it's too late.

866
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:22,445
l'm already a part of the ship...

867
01:20:24,518 --> 01:20:26,145
...and the crew.

868
01:20:28,322 --> 01:20:29,311
Bootstrap.

869
01:20:32,393 --> 01:20:34,293
You know my name.

870
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:37,289
You know my name.

871
01:20:38,532 --> 01:20:40,363
Yes, l know your son.

872
01:20:41,368 --> 01:20:43,063
William.

873
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:47,641
He's coming for me.

874
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:49,832
Wait and see.

875
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:52,276
You'll see.

876
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:55,444
He promised.

877
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:13,800
[man] Swing her over.

878
01:21:15,002 --> 01:21:16,765
Ready those lines.

879
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:29,675
Sir.

880
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:34,918
[Beckett] A breadcrumb trail.

881
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:39,323
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

882
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:44,558
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

883
01:21:45,866 --> 01:21:49,859
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

884
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:53,969
We can only hope
to reach our destination

885
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:56,066
before they run out of bodies.

886
01:22:09,723 --> 01:22:12,783
You escaped the brig
even quicker than l expected.

887
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:17,128
William, do you notice anything?

888
01:22:18,799 --> 01:22:20,027
Rather...

889
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:23,961
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

890
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,730
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

891
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:29,275
Not as odd as this.

892
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,146
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

893
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,239
l said to myself, "Think like Jack."

894
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:38,812
This is what you've arrived at?

895
01:22:38,886 --> 01:22:42,219
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

896
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,120
...accomplish your own ends?

897
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:45,988
lt's like you don't know me at all.

898
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:52,390
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

899
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:55,098
Ah.

900
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:58,228
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

901
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,166
l'm losing her, Jack.

902
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:07,847
Every step l make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

903
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,012
lf you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

904
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:15,750
lf l might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

905
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:18,892
...avoid the choice altogether.

906
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:21,194
Change the facts.

907
01:23:22,262 --> 01:23:25,254
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

908
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:27,364
Who?

909
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:32,627
You?

910
01:23:34,975 --> 01:23:38,376
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

911
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:41,972
<i>l slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,</i>

912
01:23:42,049 --> 01:23:43,812
your father's free from his debt,

913
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:46,614
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

914
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:50,521
<i>You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...</i>

915
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:54,550
- ...forever?
- No, mate. l'm free forever.

916
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:58,655
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

917
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:01,058
You have to do the job though, Jack.

918
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:04,195
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

919
01:24:04,838 --> 01:24:07,432
- Or end up just like Jones.
- [groans]

920
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,501
l don't have the face for tentacles.

921
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:15,907
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

922
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,080
What's this for?

923
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:23,851
Think like me. lt'll come to you.

924
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:39,504
My regards to Davy Jones.

925
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:46,245
l hate him.

926
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:51,944
Come with me.

927
01:24:55,522 --> 01:24:56,750
Quickly.

928
01:25:05,799 --> 01:25:07,061
What are you doing?

929
01:25:08,735 --> 01:25:10,760
Choosing a side.

930
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:31,981
[whispering in Chinese]

931
01:25:35,295 --> 01:25:39,254
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

932
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,665
l fear there may be
a traitor among them.

933
01:25:43,003 --> 01:25:45,130
lt's too late to earn my forgiveness.

934
01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:49,171
l had nothing to do
with your father's death.

935
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:54,370
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

936
01:25:57,918 --> 01:25:58,976
Come with us.

937
01:26:03,056 --> 01:26:04,751
James, come with me.

938
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:07,859
[Bootstrap Bill] Who goes there?

939
01:26:10,631 --> 01:26:12,565
Go. l will follow.

940
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:15,829
You're lying.

941
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:21,473
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

942
01:26:23,844 --> 01:26:25,368
...but never joined.

943
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:33,580
Go, now.

944
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,721
Back to your station, sailor.

945
01:26:43,564 --> 01:26:48,831
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

946
01:26:48,902 --> 01:26:50,597
That's an order.

947
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:54,334
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

948
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:57,172
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

949
01:26:57,244 --> 01:27:00,145
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

950
01:27:00,214 --> 01:27:02,614
All hands, prisoner escape!

951
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,180
- Belay that!
- James!

952
01:27:12,492 --> 01:27:14,619
[screaming]

953
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:19,023
[man] Prisoner escape!

954
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:23,129
James! No!

955
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:35,010
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

956
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:37,107
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

957
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,880
- To the captain's cabin!
- [all] Aye!

958
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,947
Back to the ship.

959
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:50,863
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

960
01:28:00,207 --> 01:28:02,266
l take that as a " no."

961
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,304
Nice sword.

962
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:34,297
<i>The Dutchman is under my command.</i>

963
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,108
For now.

964
01:28:54,886 --> 01:28:56,945
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

965
01:28:57,022 --> 01:28:59,422
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck lsland.

966
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:02,927
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

967
01:29:02,994 --> 01:29:05,428
You heard him. Step lively.

968
01:29:05,497 --> 01:29:07,829
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

969
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:10,732
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

970
01:29:10,802 --> 01:29:12,030
Aye.

971
01:29:12,104 --> 01:29:16,234
l once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

972
01:29:16,308 --> 01:29:17,900
What'd you call him?

973
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:20,305
Larry.

974
01:29:24,015 --> 01:29:26,984
l do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

975
01:29:27,052 --> 01:29:29,043
But we agreed on ends only.

976
01:29:29,121 --> 01:29:32,090
The means are mine to decide.

977
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:34,648
Caution, Barbossa.

978
01:29:34,726 --> 01:29:38,958
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

979
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:42,864
Or what it mean if you fail me.

980
01:29:46,138 --> 01:29:49,005
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

981
01:29:49,074 --> 01:29:52,805
Why l could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

982
01:29:53,712 --> 01:29:56,237
lt took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

983
01:29:56,782 --> 01:30:00,081
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

984
01:30:00,152 --> 01:30:02,347
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

985
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:07,283
Take this fishwife to the brig.

986
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:11,254
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

987
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:43,083
l cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

988
01:30:43,161 --> 01:30:45,095
Apparently, you can.

989
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,291
l believe you know each other.
