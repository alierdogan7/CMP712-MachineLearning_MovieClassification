[KNOCKING CONTINUES]

1231
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,274
David, I often felt a sort
of envy of humans...

1232
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:23,444
...of that thing they called spirit.

1233
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:27,865
Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life...

1234
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,660
...in art, poetry, mathematical formulas.

1235
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:35,123
Certainly human beings must be the key
to the meaning of existence.

1236
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:38,292
But human beings no longer existed.

1237
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,295
So we began a project...

1238
02:08:41,463 --> 02:08:45,383
...that would make it possible to re-create
the living body of a person long dead...

1239
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:49,846
...from the DNA in a fragment
of bone or mummified skin.

1240
02:08:50,097 --> 02:08:52,640
We also wondered,
would it be possible...

1241
02:08:52,808 --> 02:08:56,811
...to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a re-created body?

1242
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,355
And you know what we found?

1243
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:03,735
We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...

1244
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:07,155
...appeared to store information
about every event...

1245
02:09:07,364 --> 02:09:10,241
...which had ever occurred in the past.

1246
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:15,371
But the experiment was a failure.

1247
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:20,752
Those who were resurrected only lived
through a single day of renewed life.

1248
02:09:21,545 --> 02:09:25,673
When the resurrectees fell asleep
on the night of their first new day...

1249
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,884
...they died again.

1250
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:32,054
As soon as they became unconscious,
their very existence...

1251
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:34,849
...faded away into darkness.

1252
02:09:35,058 --> 02:09:38,186
So you see, David,
the equations had shown...

1253
02:09:38,395 --> 02:09:42,732
...that once an individual space-time
pathway had been used...

1254
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:45,693
