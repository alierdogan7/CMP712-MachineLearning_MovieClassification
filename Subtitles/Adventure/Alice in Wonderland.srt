00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:17,056
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,924
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,125
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,098
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,965
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,127
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,732
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,113
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,816
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,821
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,326
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,828
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:05,466
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,635
I didn't know cats could smile.

15
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,935
(SIGHING) Neither did l.

16
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,246
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,979
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,779
Hmm.

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,550
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:31,657
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,699
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

22
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:37,831
(LAUGHING)

23
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,366
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

24
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,346
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,677
(LAUGHING) Ow!

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,211
(SIGHING)

27
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,559
Must we go?

28
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,599
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

29
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,369
They will notice.

30
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,844
Where's your corset?

31
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,045
And no stockings.

32
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,418
I'm against them.

33
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,184
But you're not properly dressed.

34
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,749
Who's to say what is proper?

35
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,092
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

36
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,256
-Would you wear it?
-Alice.

37
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,062
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

38
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,434
Please, not today.

39
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,529
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:50,569
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,105
Did you have bad dreams again?

42
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,581
Only one.

43
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,745
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

44
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,381
Do you think that's normal?

45
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't most people
have different dreams?

46
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,455
I don't know.

47
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,805
There. You're beautiful.

48
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,436

At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

51

Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

52
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,802
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

53
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,500
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

-I am sorry.
-Oh, never mind!

55
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:02,578
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

56
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,783
If only Charles were here...

57
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:07,980
My condolences.

58
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,822
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

59
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,993
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

60
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,526
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

61
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,342
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

62
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,812
Charles thought so, too.

On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

No.

69
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,505
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

70
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,676
and the men wearing dresses.

71
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,651
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

72
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:14,155

Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

Where's your head?

77
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,338
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

78
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,464
Why would you spend your time

79
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,736
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

80
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,107
Why wouldn't l?

81
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,443
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:39,606

We have a secret to tell you.

If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

-Perhaps we shouldn't.
-We decided we should.

If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

-Will you be surprised?
-Not if you tell me.

91

But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

-No, we don't.
-In fact, we won't.

in the Havershims' pond.

-You wouldn't.
-Oh, but I would.

There's your mother right now.

Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,552
You've ruined the surprise!

00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,327
I could strangle them!

to keep the secret.

Does everyone know?

It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

if I want to marry Hamish.

You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

And you don't want to be a burden
on Mother, do you?

No.

You could always paint the roses red.

1049
01:37:01,665 --> 01:37:04,691
She left me standing there
without an answer.

1050
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,929
A case of nerves, no doubt.

1051
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,307
-Alice.
-LORD ASCOT: Good Lord.

1052
01:37:13,143 --> 01:37:15,441
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?

1053
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:18,539
I fell down a hole and hit my head.

1054
01:37:18,816 --> 01:37:23,310
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.

1055
01:37:24,822 --> 01:37:27,814
And there's that trouble
with your digestion.

1056
01:37:28,826 --> 01:37:33,354
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.

1057
01:37:36,734 --> 01:37:40,226
You're lucky to have my sister
for your wife, Lowell,

1058
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:44,035
and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

1059
01:37:46,544 --> 01:37:49,035
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.

1060
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,310
You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.

1061
01:37:54,685 --> 01:37:57,848
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

1062
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,053
Don't worry, Mother,

1063
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:05,095
I'll find something useful
to do with my life.

1064
01:38:07,197 --> 01:38:10,689
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.

1065
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,905
-You've left me out.
-No, I haven't, sir.

1066
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:19,402
You and I have business to discuss.

1067
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,671
Shall we speak in the study?

1068
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:30,580
Oh. And one more thing.

(ALL GASPING)

1070
01:38:38,762 --> 01:38:43,631
My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,

1071
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:46,261
but I don't think
he was looking far enough.

1072
01:38:46,303 --> 01:38:48,601
Why not go all the way to China?

1073
01:38:49,406 --> 01:38:53,740
It's vast, the culture is rich,
and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.

1074
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:58,106
To be the first to trade with China,
can you imagine it?

1075
01:39:00,084 --> 01:39:01,745
You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,

1076
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:04,720
I'd say, "You've lost your senses."

1077
01:39:04,922 --> 01:39:07,117
But I've seen that look before.

1078
01:39:07,257 --> 01:39:11,751
Well, as you're not going to be
my daughter-in-law,

1079
01:39:11,795 --> 01:39:15,754
perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.

1080
