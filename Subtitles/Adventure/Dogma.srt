1
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,920
Ladies and gentlemen, the driving
force behind Catholicism Wow!

2
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:12,755
...Cardinal Glick.

3
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,847
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,807
Now, we all know
how the majority...

5
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:25,059
...and the media in this country...

6
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,353
...view the Catholic Church.

7
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:30,648
They think of us as a passé,
archaic institution.

8
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,901
People find the Bible obtuse...

9
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,486
...even hokey.

10
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,655
Now, in an effort
to disprove all that...

11
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:41,409
...the Church has appointed this year
as a time of renewal...

12
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:43,536
...both of faith and of style.

13
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,581
For example, the crucifix.

14
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,375
While it has been a time-honored
symbol of our faith...

15
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,420
...Holy Mother Church
has decided to retire...

16
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,088
...this highly recognizable...

17
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,549
...yet wholly depressing image...

18
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,760
...of our Lord, crucified.

19
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,180
Christ didn't come to Earth
to give us the willies.

20
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,098
He came to help us out.

21
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,894
He was a booster, and it's
with that take on our Lord in mind...

22
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,772
...that we've come up with a new,
more inspiring sigil.

23
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:14,776
So it is with great pleasure
that I present you with the first...

24
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,445
...of many revamps
the Catholicism Wow! campaign...

25
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:21,032
...will unveil over the next year,
I give you...

26
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,325
..."The Buddy Christ."

27
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:34,962
That's not the sanctioned term
we're using for the symbol.

28
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,548
Just something we've been
kicking around the office.

29
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,092
But look at it.

30
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,052
Doesn't it pop?

31
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,762
Buddy Christ.

32
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,889
Well, there you have it.

33
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,775
Let me get this straight.

34
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,070
You don't believe in God
because of Alice in Wonderland?

35
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,572
No, Through the Looking Glass.

36
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,742
That poem,
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"...

37
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,827
...is an indictment
of organized religion.

38
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,079
The Walrus, with his girth
and good nature...

39
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,207
...he obviously represents
either Buddha...

40
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,169
...or with his tusks, the Hindu
elephant god, Lord Ganesha.

41
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,254
That takes care
of your Eastern religions.

42
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:09,090
Now, the Carpenter,
an obvious reference to Jesus Christ...

43
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,344
...who was raised a carpenter's son,
represents Western religions.

44
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,263
Now, in the poem,
what do they do?

45
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,932
They dupe all these oysters
into following them...

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,770
...then proceed to shuck and devour
the helpless creatures en masse.

47
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,773
I don't know what that says to you,
but to me it says...

48
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,610
...that following these faiths
based on mythological figures...

49
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,403
...destroys one's inner being.

50
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,615
Organized religion destroys
who we are...

51
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:36,618
...by inhibiting our actions,
by inhibiting our decisions...

52
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:39,913
...out of fear of some
intangible parent figure...

53
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,957
...who shakes a finger at us
from thousands of years ago...

54
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,961
...and says, "Do it...
Do it and I'll fucking spank you!"

55
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,380
Oh, Jesus!

56
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:52,092
The way you put it, I've never really
thought about it like that before.

57
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,470
What have I been doing
with my life?

58
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,973
- What am I...?
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,809
Listen, my advice to you...

60
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,603
...take this money you've
collected for your parish...

61
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,731
...go get yourself a nice dress,
you know? Fix yourself up.

62
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,110
Find some man, some woman, you
can connect with, even for a moment...

63
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:14,030
...because that's really all life is,
Sister, it's a series of moments.

64
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,324
Why don't you seize yours?

65
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,164
Attagirl. Attagirl.

66
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,840
You know, here's what
I don't get about you.

67
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,717
You know for a fact
that there is a God.

68
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,595
You've been in his presence.
He's spoken to you personally.

69
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:40,015
- Yet I heard you claim to be atheist.
- I like to fuck with the clergy.

70
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:43,436
I just love it. I love to keep
those guys on their toes.

71
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:45,271
Here's what I don't get about you.

72
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,274
Why do you feel the need
to come to this place all the time?

73
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,860
My friend, because
this is humanity at its best.

74
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,069
Look at them.

75
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:56,031
All that anger, all that mistrust,
all that unhappiness...

76
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,035
...forgotten for that one perfect moment
when they get off the plane.

77
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,370
See those two?

78
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:04,790
That guy doesn't know that the girl
cheated on him while she was away.

79
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,709
- She did?
- Twice.

80
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,961
- Nice.
- But it doesn't matter right now...

81
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,381
...because they're just both so relieved
to be with one another.

82
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:14,341
I like that.

83
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,719
I wish they could all
feel that way more often.

84
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,889
Is this why I had to come down here
and miss my fucking cartoons?

85
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,475
You call me, you tell me
it's important, you know?

86
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,769
What, to share in your half-assed
obsession with Hallmark moments?

87
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,063
We're going home.

88
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,483
Somebody sent us this in the mail.

89
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:38,408
Take it and quit leering at me.
People will think I broke up with you.

90
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,870
- You did just say we're going home?
- Read.

91
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,916
"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon On
Catholicism Wow! Campaign."

92
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,542
And?

93
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,254
You have to keep reading.

94
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,507
"The rededication of
St. Michael's Church"...

95
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,258
is the kickoff of
a new campaign...

96
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,844
...which seeks to bring
Catholicism into the mainstream.

97
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,263
With a papal sanction,
the archway entrance...

98
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,933
...of the century-old Jersey Shore
house of worship...

99
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,435
...will serve as a passageway
of plenary indulgence...

100
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:08,939
...a little-known Catholic belief
offering all that passes through it...

101
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,774
...a morally clean slate.

102
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:14,027
For Sunday News Brief,
I'm Grant Hicks.

103
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,656
All I gotta do, I walk through the arch
thing, and then I can go back home?

104
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:21,117
No. By walking through the archway,
all your sins are forgiven.

105
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,870
- Then all we have to do is die.
- Die? I don't wanna die.

106
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,666
- You rather hang around here?
- No. We don't know if we can die.

107
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,835
But what if we can and then
the arch thing doesn't work?

108
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:32,587
What then, hell? Fuck that.

109
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,714
It's impossible.
If we cut off our wings...

110
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:38,218
...and transubstantiate to complete
human form, we become mortal.

111
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,762
If we die with clean souls,
they can't keep us out.

112
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,974
We won't be angels anymore,
but at least we get to go home.

113
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:47,352
- Who sent the paper?
- Who cares who sent the paper?

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,648
All that matters is that after
all these years, we found a loophole.

115
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,316
He can't keep us out anymore.

116
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,735
Once we're back in,
he'll just forgive and forget.

117
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:58,698
But this thing, this is Church law.
It's not divine mandate.

118
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,368
Church laws are fallible
because they're created by man.

119
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:05,871
One of the last sacred promises
imparted to Peter, the first pope...

120
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,500
...by the son of God
before he left was:

121
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,335
"Whatever you hold true on Earth..."

122
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:12,795
"I'll hold true in heaven."

123
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:15,840
It's dogmatic law. If the Church
says it's so, God must adhere.

124
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,633
This thing has a papal sanction...

125
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,678
Let it never be said your
anal retentive attention to detail...

126
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,471
...never yielded positive results.

127
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,141
You can't be anal retentive
if you don't have an anus.

128
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,184
Outstanding work!

129
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:30,104
There's just one thing
I think we gotta do before we leave.

130
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,273
This will help us get back
on his good side.

131
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,524
What?

132
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,485
I've been dreaming about this
for five years. Read that.

133
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:38,029
"Mooby, the Golden Calf.

134
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:40,865
Creating an empire
out of simplicity."

135
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,825
I wanna hit them.

136
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:45,411
You really are
Just a simple creature.

137
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:47,955
We find a way back
and you wanna jeopardize that...

138
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:50,166
...because you yearn
for the good old days.

139
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,711
What better way to repent than by
resuming the position I once denied...

140
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,254
...thanks to you?

141
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:58,424
I don't think a killing spree
is gonna make things better for us.

142
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,218
Killing spree?
I'm talking about divine justice here.

143
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:04,765
I'm talking about raining down fire
and brimstone, punishing the wicked.

144
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,476
He's all about that.
I know he'd want this done.

145
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,145
There hasn't been an Angel of Death
since you quit.

146
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,897
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

147
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,858
And besides, what if you're wrong,
like you always are?

148
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:17,569
If I'm wrong, which I'm not,
it's not gonna matter.

149
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,905
We're gonna pass through
your arch thing anyway.

150
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,866
We're gonna be forgiven.
No harm, no foul.

151
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:26,578
Well, he does hate competition.
I will say that.

152
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,914
And your Mooby certainly falls
under that heading.

153
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,041
Where is this church
we have to go to?

154
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,419
New Jersey. Rededication ceremony
is in four days.

155
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,421
Last four days on Earth?

156
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,799
If I had a dick, I'd go get laid.

157
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,093
- We can do the next best thing.
- What's that?

158
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,011
Let's kill people.

159
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,763
Oh, not you.

160
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,314
The Illinois Chapter
of the Right to Life Foundation...

161
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,901
...will be holding its
biannual softball game...

162
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:01,571
...against the Cook County
Pro-Choice League next Sunday at 2.

163
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,990
Today's second collection
will be donated...

164
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,910
...to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund.

165
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,371
For those of you
who haven't followed the news...

166
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,374
...an unidentified homeless man
who was accosted...

167
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,711
...and severely beaten at
the New Jersey Shore last Tuesday...

168
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:19,966
...lies in critical but stable condition
in one of that area's hospitals.

169
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,801
He lacks identification...

170
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:25,388
...and police have had no luck
tracking down any possible family.

171
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,809
The archbishop of the Trenton diocese
has disputed the state's decision...

172
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:33,146
...to remove the indigent man
from life-support systems...

173
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,523
...asking that Catholics
all over the country...

174
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,152
...join in this protest
against euthanasia.

175
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,655
Well, now please rise
for the recession of faith.

176
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,162
We believe in one god,
the Father Almighty...

177
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,830
...maker of heaven and earth.

178
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:54,000
We believe in Jesus Christ,
his only son, our Lord...

179
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:56,878
Hey, choose life!

180
00:10:57,045 --> 00:11:00,423
You're gonna burn in hell,
you fucking baby killer!

181
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,508
Holy shit, it's the pope.

182
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:03,760
Where?

183
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,178
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,149
Jesus. You're a Catholic.
Can't you talk to them?

185
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,318
They hate me more than you,
no doubt.

186
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:23,279
You have an excuse. You're Jewish.
You don't know any better.

187
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,824
We already used that excuse
when we killed Christ.

188
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,035
Where were you yesterday?
We went to brunch.

189
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,495
I went to church.

190
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:32,413
That still kills me, you and church.

191
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:36,043
If only they knew your tithing came
from a Planned Parenthood check.

192
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,754
I don't know why I still go, Liz.

193
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,425
I can remember going to church
when I was young and being moved.

194
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,804
Now I sit there every Sunday
and I feel nothing.

195
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,306
I don't think I have any faith left.

196
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:53,519
Remember that seminary student
I tried to set you up with?

197
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:58,982
The 20-year-old. The one I could
have babysat for in high school.

198
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,360
Well, the point is,
he told me something.

199
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,987
He said that faith
is like a glass of water.

200
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:07,074
When you're young, the glass is little,
so it's easy to fill.

201
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,076
As you get older,
the glass gets bigger.

202
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:11,161
The same amount of liquid
doesn't fill it.

203
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:14,081
But periodically
the glass has to be refilled.

204
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,041
You're suggesting I need
to get filled?

205
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,334
In more ways than one.

206
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,211
You need to get laid,
Bethany Sloane.

207
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,839
You need a man,
if only for 10 minutes.

208
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,716
My experience is that
the average male is never a man...

209
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:27,219
...not even for 10 minutes
in his entire life span.

210
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,222
That sounds militant.
You thinking ofjoining the other side?

211
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,224
Couldn't do it.
Women are insane.

212
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:35,435
Then you need to go back to church
and ask God for a third option.

213
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:37,437
I think God is dead.

214
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,940
The sign of a true Catholic.

215
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,788
Good afternoon, Mrs. Reynolds.

216
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,582
I'm from the EPA.

217
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,502
We're checking on possible
Freon leaks.

218
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,963
Tell me,
do you have air conditioning?

219
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,756
Yes, we have central air.

220
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:05,425
In every room?

221
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,302
Except the bathroom. Why?

222
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,387
Well, you know
what that means, don't you?

223
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:22,358
Move.

224
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,619
No pleasure, no rapture,
no exquisite sin greater...

225
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,622
...than central air.

226
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,499
Pick that up.

227
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,798
This will be the base of operations
from here on in.

228
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,760
Now, if I remember
the protocol correctly...

229
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:53,681
...the powers will attempt
to contact the last scion.

230
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,892
I need you three...

231
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,145
...to shuffle her loose
the mortal coil.

232
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,317
Go.

233
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,980
Behold the Metatron!

234
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,816
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

235
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,568
Behold the Metatron!

236
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:50,739
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true god!

237
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,116
Behold the Metatron!

238
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:55,911
Herald of the Almighty
and voice of the one true...

239
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:10,217
Sweet Jesus!
Do you have to use the whole can?

240
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:13,262
Who the fuck are you and what
the fuck are you doing in my room?

241
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,181
I'm soaked and she's
the one that's surly. That's rich.

242
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,183
Stubbed my fucking...

243
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,602
Get the fuck out of here, now!

244
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,273
Or you'll do what exactly?

245
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,608
Hit me with that fish?

246
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:33,450
Now, just sit down on the bed
and shut up.

247
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:36,119
Jesus wept!

248
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,954
Look at my suit.

249
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,916
Take what you want,
but don't kill or rape me.

250
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:46,379
Give over! I couldn't rape you
if I wanted to. Angels are ill-equipped.

251
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,133
See?

252
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:55,555
I'm as anatomically impaired
as a Ken doll.

253
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,808
Make yourself useful
and give me that towel.

254
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:02,270
Honestly, you bottom-feeders
and your arrogance.

255
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,106
You think everybody's just trying
to get in your knickers.

256
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,775
What are you?

257
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,818
I'm pissed off is what I am.

258
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:12,947
Do you drench everyone who comes in
here with flame-retardant chemicals?

259
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,575
No wonder you're single.

260
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,831
Stand back.

261
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,509
As I was saying...

262
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,804
...prior to your
fire-fighting episode...

263
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:39,350
...I am the Metatron.

264
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,855
Don't tell me the name
doesn't ring a bell.

265
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,109
You people.

266
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:52,363
If there isn't a movie about it,
it's not worth knowing, is it?

267
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:55,366
I am a seraphim.

268
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:00,037
The highest choir of angels.

269
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,332
You do know what an angel is,
don't you?

270
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,963
Metatron acts as the voice of God.

271
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:13,259
Any occasion when some yahoo
claims that God has spoken to them...

272
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:15,052
...they're speaking to me.

273
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,388
Or they're talking to themselves.

274
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,559
Why doesn't God speak for himself?

275
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:25,771
Glad you decided to join
the conversation. To answer that...

276
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,275
...human beings have neither the aural
nor the psychological capacity...

277
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:33,571
...to withstand the awesome power
of God's true voice.

278
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:37,158
Were you to hear it, your mind would
cave in and your heart would explode.

279
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,077
We went through five Adams
before we figured that one out.

280
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,998
Well, how do I know
you're an angel?

281
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:49,003
What, aside from the fiery entrance
and the expansive wingspan?

282
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,091
You want more proof?

283
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:54,801
Fine.

284
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:56,094
How about tequila?

285
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:04,769
Where the hell are we?

286
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,314
Only place you can go
for a good tequila.

287
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:10,567
Dos tequilas, por favor,
and an empty glass.

288
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:14,279
We're in Mexico?

289
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:16,948
Actually, we're in the franchised
Mexican eatery...

290
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:19,117
...down the street
from your apartment...

291
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:21,036
...but it's impressive nonetheless.

292
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,705
You don't mind I lost the wings,
do you?

293
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,790
I'm trying to keep our profile low.

294
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,626
What do you want with me?

295
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:34,132
I am to charge you
with a holy crusade.

296
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,469
For the record,
I work in an abortion clinic.

297
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:39,888
Noah was a drunk.
Look what he accomplished.

298
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:41,932
And no one's asking you
to build an ark.

299
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:43,934
All you gotta do is go
to New Jersey...

300
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,561
...and visit a small church
on a very important day.

301
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,317
New Jersey?

302
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,612
That doesn't sound like
much of a crusade.

303
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,156
Aside from the fine print,
that's it.

304
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,325
What's the fine print?

305
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:04,329
Stop a couple angels from entering
and thus negating all existence.

306
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,623
Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.

307
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,877
Stop a couple of angels
from entering...

308
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:13,005
...and thus negating all existence.

309
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,508
I hate it when people
need it spelled out for them.

310
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,468
You might want to clarify that.

311
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,848
Back in the old days,
God was vengeful and hot-tempered.

312
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:25,017
And his wrath was bore...

313
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:28,354
...by the Angel of Death,
name of Loki.

314
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,606
When Sodom and Gomorrah
was destroyed...

315
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:32,191
...that was Loki.

316
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,279
When the waters wiped out everything
except Noah and his menagerie...

317
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:39,115
...that was Loki.
And he was good at what he did.

318
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:43,995
But one day he refused to
bear God's wrath any longer.

319
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,456
- Why?
- He listened to his friend...

320
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,709
...a Grigori
by the name of Bartleby.

321
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:50,876
Grigori?

322
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:54,171
One of the choirs of angels.
They're called Watchers.

323
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,715
Guess what they do.

324
00:19:55,882 --> 00:20:00,219
So one day, Loki's wiping out
all the firstborn of Egypt...

325
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,805
The Tenth Plague.

326
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,474
Tell a person you're the Metatron,
they stare blankly.

327
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,768
Mention something in
a Charlton Heston movie...

328
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,062
...and suddenly everybody's
a theology scholar.

329
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,064
May I continue uninterrupted?

330
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,191
Once he's done with the firstborn...

331
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,946
...Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink.

332
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,365
And over many rounds...

333
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,576
...they get into
this discussion about...

334
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,579
...whether murder
in God's name is okay.

335
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:26,997
And in the end...

336
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:31,043
...Bartleby convinces Loki
to quit his position...

337
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,420
...and take one which doesn't
involve slaughter.

338
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:35,088
So...

339
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:38,925
...very inebriated...

340
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,636
...Loki tells God he quits...

341
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:44,014
...throws down his fiery sword...

342
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:46,058
...and gives him the finger.

343
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:49,269
Which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward...

344
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:52,439
...God decreed that angels
could no longer imbibe alcohol.

345
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,024
Hence all the spitting.

346
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,526
So for their insolence...

347
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,529
...God decreed that neither Loki
nor Bartleby...

348
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:02,240
...would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.

349
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,117
- Were they sent to hell?
- Worse.

350
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,119
Wisconsin...

351
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,914
...for the entire span
of human history.

352
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:12,542
And when the world ends, they'll have
to sit outside the gates for eternity.

353
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,461
And this has what to do with me?

354
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:19,007
Someone has clued them in
to a loophole in Catholic dogma...

355
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,718
...that would allow them
to reenter heaven.

356
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:24,471
So what? They beat the system.
Good for them.

357
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,473
It's not that simple.

358
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:31,019
If they get in, they will have
reversed God's decree.

359
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,649
Now listen closely because
this bit's very important.

360
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:40,446
Existence in all its form
and splendor...

361
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:44,158
...functions solely on one principle:

362
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,286
God is infallible.

363
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:49,288
To prove him wrong...

364
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:52,333
...would undo reality
and everything that is.

365
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:55,294
Up would become down,
black would become white.

366
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:58,339
Existence would
become nothingness.

367
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:00,049
In essence...

368
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:03,594
...if they're allowed to enter
that church...

369
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:08,349
...they'll unmake the world.

370
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,352
If this is so major,
why are you talking to me?

371
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,354
Why doesn't God
do something about it?

372
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:17,358
He could. But he'd rather see you
take care of this one personally.

373
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:19,110
Why me?

374
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,487
Because of who you are.

375
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:23,364
And who am I?

376
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,575
The girl in the P.J.'s!

377
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:29,370
Don't ask so many questions.
Just serve your purpose.

378
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,497
I'm gonna have to pass.

379
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,541
I beg your pardon?

380
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:38,045
When some quiet little infection
destroyed my uterus, where was God?

381
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:39,714
When my husband decided...

382
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:42,467
...he couldn't be with a wife
who couldn't bear children...

383
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,676
...where was God?

384
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:47,346
To hell with him.

385
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:51,559
Don't allow eons of history and life
to get blinked out of being...

386
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,978
...just because of a grudge
against your creator.

387
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:56,482
So you lost the ability
to make life.

388
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:00,068
You're being offered the chance
to play mother to the world...

389
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:02,404
...by acting like one
and protecting it.

390
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:04,490
Saving it!

391
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,952
But I can't make you.

392
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,623
However, if you should decide
to stop being selfish...

393
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,209
...and accept your responsibility...

394
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,169
...you won't be alone.

395
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:18,587
You'll have support.

396
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:20,756
What? More angels?

397
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,508
Prophets.

398
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,471
In a manner of speaking.
Two of them.

399
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,476
The one who speaks...

400
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,979
And he will, at great length,
whether you want him to or not.

401
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,232
- will make mention of himself
as a prophet.

402
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,775
The other one...

403
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:42,528
...well, he's the quiet type.

404
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:43,862
Look, I've gotta go.

405
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,281
Remember, we're working
in a time frame here.

406
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,118
Hey.

407
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:52,955
- What's he like?
- God?

408
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,667
Lonely...

409
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,627
...but funny.

410
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:00,712
He's got a great sense of humor.

411
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,881
Sex, for example.
There's nothing funnier...

412
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,634
...than the ridiculous faces
you people make mid-coitus.

413
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:07,636
Sex is a joke in heaven?

414
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:11,516
The way I understand it,
it's mostly a joke down here too.

415
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,892
I'll see you.

416
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:18,769
Snootch to
the motherfucking nootch!

417
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:58,351
Go back to your paper routes,
you Mighty Duck Fucks!

418
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:01,896
Snoogans.
Did you see that shit, man?

419
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:06,151
I know they were just kids, but we
kicked their fucking pubeless asses!

420
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:13,950
I don't know what to say
or think, except...

421
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:15,952
That you'll offer us sex
as a reward?

422
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,289
That I'd like to know
who they and you are.

423
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:22,208
I'm Jay, and this is
my hetero life mate, Silent Bob.

424
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:25,003
I don't know those kids,
but they would have kicked yours...

425
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:27,839
...and lunchbox's asses
if I hadn't represented.

426
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:30,717
Well, thanks for being
out here so late.

427
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,011
Wait a minute. Are you protestors?

428
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,097
You mean those dickheads with signs
and pictures of dead babies?

429
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,516
Shit, no!
Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.

430
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:40,643
A woman's body
is her own fucking business.

431
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,687
But what are you doing
hanging around?

432
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:44,814
We're here to pick up chicks.

433
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:46,649
Excuse me?

434
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:49,861
We figure abortion clinics are
a good place to meet loose women.

435
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,697
Why else would they be here
unless they like to fuck?

436
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,700
Right.

437
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,537
Well, I should be going.
Thanks for the rescue.

438
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:00,414
- I think.
- Wait a second.

439
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:03,167
We just saved your ass,
and you're just gonna take off.

440
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:04,376
What the shit is that?

441
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:08,339
I had a weird night last night and
tonight's not shaping up to be better.

442
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:11,383
I think I should go home,
take some Percosets and lay down.

443
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:16,096
Now, how about that shit?
Fuck this town, man!

444
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:18,891
I'm going back to Jersey
and starting the business again.

445
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,728
I can kick the shit out of kids
in Red Bank and make myself a profit.

446
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:25,314
Prophets. Two of them.

447
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,191
You know what I'm saying,
Silent Bob?

448
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,193
You gotta be kidding me.

449
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,904
We call this piece "The Fecalator."

450
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:34,615
One look at it and the target
shits him or herself.

451
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,200
Try it on.

452
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,370
It's a lot more compact
than the flaming sword...

453
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:41,497
...but it's not nearly as impressive.

454
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:44,875
It doesn't have that
"wrath of the Almighty" edge to it.

455
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:49,088
How am I supposed to strike fear into
the hearts of the wicked with this?

456
00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:50,256
Look at this.

457
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:55,010
Well, then, you know, don't use a gun.
Lay the place to waste like.

458
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:58,013
Easy for you to say.
You get off light in a razing.

459
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,391
You got to stand and read
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

460
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,393
I had to do all the work.

461
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,688
What work did you do?
You lit a few fires.

462
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:08,399
I rained down sulfur, man.
There's a subtle difference.

463
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,150
Okay, I'm sure.

464
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:14,114
Fuck you, man. Any moron with
a pack of matches can set a fire.

465
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:16,157
Raining down sulfur
is an endurance trial.

466
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:19,035
Mass genocide is the most
exhausting activity one can do...

467
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,704
...next to soccer.

468
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,915
I'll take this one.

469
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,807
So, what's up? You have a friend for
Silent Bob, or you gonna do us both?

470
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:43,268
If so, I'm first.
I hate sloppy seconds.

471
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,395
You're a man of principle.

472
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:49,107
Jersey's pretty far from McHenry.
May I ask what brought you here?

473
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,651
Some fuck named John Hughes.

474
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,403
Sixteen Candles John Hughes?

475
00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:57,657
You know that guy too?
That fucking guy.

476
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:00,493
He made this flick Sixteen Candles.
Not bad.

477
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,579
There's tits in it, but no bush.

478
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:05,498
But Ebert here don't give
a shit about that kind of thing...

479
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:08,001
...because he's in love
with this John Hughes guy.

480
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,253
He goes out and rents
every one of his movies.

481
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:14,758
Fucking Breakfast Club, where stupid
kids actually show up for detention.

482
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:18,637
Fucking Weird Science, where this
babe wants to undress and get down...

483
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:21,848
...but, oh, no, she don't,
because it's a PG movie.

484
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:26,102
And then Pretty in Pink, which I can't
watch with this tubby bitch anymore...

485
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,523
...because when the redhead
hooks up with her dream guy...

486
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:33,152
...he starts sobbing like a little bitch
with a skinned knee and shit.

487
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,489
And there's nothing worse
than watching a fucking fat man weep.

488
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:38,491
What exactly brought you
to Illlinois?

489
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,453
All these movies take place in this
small town called Shermer, Illinois...

490
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,666
...where all the honeys are top-shelf
but all the dudes are whiny pussies.

491
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,710
Except for Judd Nelson.
He was fucking harsh.

492
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,045
But best of all...

493
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:53,255
...there was no one dealing, man.

494
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:55,675
Then it hits me.
We could live like phat rats...

495
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,386
...if we were the blunt connection
in Shermer, Illinois.

496
00:30:58,553 --> 00:31:01,389
So we collected some money
we were owed and caught a bus.

497
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,558
But you know what the fuck
we found out when we got there?

498
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:07,561
There is no Shermer in Illinois.

499
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:09,563
Movies are fucking bullshit.

500
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:11,232
When are you going
to New Jersey?

501
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,651
Jeez, this broad asks
a lot of questions.

502
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:16,904
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

503
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:18,823
Yeah. So you do anal?

504
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:21,409
Is it true chicks fart
if you blast them in the ass?

505
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:23,411
I didn't ask you out for sex.

506
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:25,454
I'll take head.

507
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:31,419
This is gonna sound really bad. I can't
believe I'm even thinking about this...

508
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,923
...but I think I should go with you.

509
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:39,260
What, like steady?
You wanna be my girlfriend?

510
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:43,014
All right, but Silent Bob gets
to live with us and you pay the rent.

511
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:45,892
No. I wanna go with you
to New Jersey.

512
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Really?

513
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:49,229
You're going to
lead me somewhere.

514
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:50,856
Me lead you?

515
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:53,817
Lady, look at me. I don't even know
where I am half the time.

516
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:57,070
If we're not gonna fuck, then what
the fuck did you ask us out for?

517
00:31:57,238 --> 00:32:01,241
Someone said I'd meet you and you'd
take me someplace I'm supposed to go.

518
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:03,285
What the hell are
you babbling about?

519
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:06,038
We saved your ass from
some angry fucking dwarves...

520
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:09,916
...and now we're supposed to take you
somewhere as if we know where it is?

521
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:13,587
Do you believe in God?

522
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:18,258
Holy fuck! All the fine, immoral bitches
out in front of that place...

523
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:19,843
...and we get the Jesus freak?

524
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,636
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

525
00:32:21,804 --> 00:32:23,430
- I'll scream rape.
- I can pay you.

526
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:25,849
Pay?

527
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,437
A hundred bucks
for being my guide.

528
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:34,608
You were going to Jersey anyway.
All I'm asking is to tag along.

529
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:38,153
I feel like Han Solo, you're Chewie,
and she's Ben Kenobi...

530
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,655
...and we're in that fucked-up bar!

531
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:42,240
What about sex?

532
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:43,658
No sex.

533
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:49,581
Let's say we're caught in a situation
where we have five minutes left to live.

534
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:53,168
A bomb or something's gonna go off.
Would you fuck us then?

535
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,295
In that highly unlikely situation?

536
00:32:58,591 --> 00:32:59,842
Yeah, sure.

537
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:03,012
Yeah? She's a slut.

538
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,933
All right.

539
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,436
But I get to drive.

540
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:21,823
What gear are you in?

541
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,282
Gear?

542
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,877
Well, what do I know
about shifting?

543
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:40,174
Like I ever drove before.

544
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:46,848
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania...

545
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,349
...New Jersey.

546
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,434
Maybe you're wrong
on the slaughter thing.

547
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:53,396
How can you be sure what incurs
the Lord's wrath these days?

548
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,730
Times change.

549
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:58,526
I remember eating meat on a Friday
used to be a hell-worthy trespass.

550
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:01,112
The major sins never change.

551
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,949
And besides, I can spot
a commandment-breaker...

552
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:07,243
...from, like, a mile away.

553
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,162
Bet on it.

554
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,123
This from the guy who still owes me
10 bucks over that bet...

555
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,419
...about which was gonna be the
bigger movie, E. T. or Krush Groove.

556
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,755
You know, fuck you, man,
because time's gonna tell on that one.

557
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:25,554
Are you insinuating that I don't have
what it takes anymore?

558
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:27,181
Insinuating, no.

559
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:29,892
Flat-out telling you.

560
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:34,938
Right there. Right there.
There's one.

561
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,232
So? They're kissing.

562
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,442
Adultery.

563
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,777
- Adultery?
- Adultery.

564
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,863
You are just a simple creature.

565
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,490
- Am I right or what?
- I happen to know the truth.

566
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:48,619
I'm not gonna tell. I wanna see
how boned up on the job you are.

567
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,455
- What's your proof?
- He's wearing a wedding band.

568
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,249
And it never occurred to you
that maybe she's his wife?

569
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,627
No married man kisses
his wife like that.

570
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,463
Okay. Well, it's a good thing
you were never...

571
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,507
...the deciding member on a jury
is all I'm saying.

572
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:06,470
"No married man kisses his wife
like that"? Are you stoned?

573
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:07,638
Excuse me.

574
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,892
Are you married?

575
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,769
Why?

576
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,312
I'm just curious.

577
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,731
What do you think?

578
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,700
- What?
- To her?

579
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,828
- What?
- Are you married to her?

580
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:34,332
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, but no.

581
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,251
Why?

582
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:23,047
Whose house?

583
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,591
Run's house

584
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:28,303
I said, whose house?

585
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,305
Run's house

586
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,515
Whose house
Say what?

587
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:34,892
Run's house
Say what?

588
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,521
Martin

589
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,735
She's fucking pissed, dude.
She's never gonna fuck us now.

590
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,820
Maybe you,
but definitely not me.

591
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:48,073
Let me know how she is.

592
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:50,993
Nobody is fucking me!
You got that?

593
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:54,163
I don't know what I was thinking
in that diner...

594
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:57,416
...but being that I've decided to
go home, and not to New Jersey...

595
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:00,044
...sorry for the inconvenience,
and goodbye.

596
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,254
You're breaking up with us?

597
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:05,924
Who the hell do you think
you are, lady?

598
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:09,011
You can't just go around
breaking people's hearts like that!

599
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,348
I fell in love with you!
We fell in love with you!

600
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:15,601
Guys like us just don't fall out
of the fucking sky, you know.

601
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:27,237
Beautiful, naked, big-tittied women
just don't fall out of the sky, you know.

602
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:42,628
No heartbeat.

603
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:45,589
Think someone threw him out a plane
with a message on him...

604
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:47,132
...like in Con Air?

605
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,927
- Did you ever see that flick?
- Oh, did that suck!

606
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,638
- Con Air? Con Shit.
- Kill it! Kill it!

607
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:55,808
- Sounds familiar.
- Jesus, are you okay?

608
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,976
Yeah, it's Rufus.
And yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,312
He's the fucking undead!
Cut his head off!

610
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,274
Hey! What I just did gave me
a fucking migraine!

611
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:07,445
So if you don't pipe down, I'm gonna
yank your sac off like a paper towel.

612
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:09,989
Speaking of which,
you're awfully nude.

613
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,826
- Rufus, is it?
- Yes, Rufus it is.

614
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:17,330
It's usually Long Rufus, but it's
a little cold out here. You understand.

615
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:20,750
Big Papa, how about lending a brother
your coat till I find threads?

616
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,921
Dude, he fell out of thin air.

617
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,342
Dude, his piece is gonna be rubbing
inside of your armor.

618
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,803
- Dude!
- Thanks a lot, baby.

619
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:35,056
I'll do my best to tuck it back.

620
00:38:35,224 --> 00:38:37,684
It's been a while since physics
but I would think...

621
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:40,687
...the impact with which you hit
would have liquefied you.

622
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,522
Death is a worry of the living.

623
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,151
The dead, like myself, only worry
about decay and necrophiliacs.

624
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:48,945
- Told you he was the undead.
- Not the undead. The dead.

625
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:50,155
I died.

626
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:52,490
Christ told me the secret
to resurrection once.

627
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:56,119
We were at this wedding in Canaan.
And I got drunk and forgot it.

628
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:57,954
Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:38:58,122 --> 00:38:59,914
Christ?

630
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,041
You knew Christ?

631
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,210
Knew him?
Shit, nigga owes me 12 bucks.

632
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,129
Let me guess.

633
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,715
- You're another angel?
- Oh, I ain't no angel.

634
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,634
I'm a man, just like you and him.
Well, maybe not him.

635
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:13,344
At least I was a man.

636
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:16,598
Been dead nearly 2000 years.
Here, check this out.

637
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:20,895
No wonder he saw Jesus.
Homey's rocking the ganj.

638
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,147
It's not a joint.

639
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,524
I can't read this.

640
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:30,654
It's Aramaic. It says,
"Rufus, see you in two years. Jesus."

641
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:33,908
Freaked me out because he basically
told me when my number was up.

642
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,827
Took all the flavor out of
the remaining years. We gotta go.

643
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:40,539
Let's say we continue this discussion
over a two-piece and a biscuit.

644
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:43,209
I'm starving. Back off, Kato.

645
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:44,543
Wait a second!

646
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:48,380
Between guys with wings,
guys falling out of the sky...

647
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,424
...and guys trying like hell
to fuck me...

648
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:53,552
...I think I've been a pretty good sport
about all this so far.

649
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,014
But I'm not going anywhere until
I find out where you came from.

650
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:59,058
Me? I came from heaven.

651
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:00,601
Now let's start walking.

652
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:03,562
Walk? Fuck you! Do you know
how far we are from anywheres?

653
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,816
Hey, man, back in the old days
with J.C., we used to walk everywhere.

654
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:10,236
Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

655
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:17,117
What the hell's an apostle?

656
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,060
Let me get this straight.

657
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,437
She's already met the prophets...

658
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,606
...and the apostle's with them?

659
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,820
I think that our best course
of action...

660
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:55,407
...is to ensure that our parcel
is not found.

661
00:40:55,575 --> 00:41:00,120
And being that I can't even
trust you enough to kill a woman...

662
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,332
...well, I'm left with no choice...

663
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,545
...but to seek outside assistance
in guarding said package.

664
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:14,009
I'm gonna have to summon
the Golgothan.

665
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:19,514
I appreciate the loan.
You can have that back.

666
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:22,976
I remember when all we had
for breakfast was fish and goat's milk.

667
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:25,520
- What do you call this shit?
- Egga Mooby Muffin.

668
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:28,773
Now, how about you start
explaining things, like for starters...

669
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:30,275
...how did you find us?

670
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:32,694
You know what the dead do
with most of their time?

671
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:35,530
Watch the living.
Especially in the shower.

672
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:37,198
I can't wait to die.

673
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:39,117
And why are you watching me?

674
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:41,536
Because you're gonna help me
get changes made...

675
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:43,538
...in that book
you put so much stock in.

676
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,999
- Hustler?
- The Bible!

677
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:49,378
- What's your beef with the Bible?
- For starters, I'm not in it.

678
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:52,048
Neither are we. You don't
hear us bitching and moaning.

679
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:55,551
But I'm supposed to be in it.
I was the 13th apostle.

680
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,223
I've gone to church my whole life and
never heard of Rufus, the 13th apostle.

681
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:04,060
Yeah, but you heard of
the other 12 apostles.

682
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:07,730
Yeah, all white boys, I might add.
But no mention of me, Rufus.

683
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:10,358
And why is that?
Because I'm a black man.

684
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:12,526
But you know what?
That's just my pet peeve.

685
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:17,031
I'm mainly here to correct a major error
you've been basing the faith on.

686
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,660
- What's that?
- Jesus wasn't white. Jesus was black.

687
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:21,911
I don't buy it.

688
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,165
If that's true, why did he get
written about and you were left out?

689
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,292
Well, he is the son of God.

690
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,753
Kind of hard to have
a New Testament without him.

691
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,589
So you fudge a few facts,
you put a spin on his ethnicity.

692
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:37,259
Leaving me out's okay because you
still got 12 white boys to choose from.

693
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:38,761
You gonna listen to this shit?

694
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:41,013
That's what the good people
of Antioch said...

695
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:42,890
...right before they stoned my ass.

696
00:42:43,058 --> 00:42:44,100
You were martyred?

697
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:46,102
That's one way of putting it.

698
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:49,230
Another way is to say I was
bludgeoned by big fucking rocks.

699
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:52,108
White folks only wanna hear
the good shit:

700
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:54,443
Life eternal,
a place in God's heaven.

701
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:57,196
But as soon as you hear
you're getting this good shit...

702
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,906
...from a black Jesus, you freak.

703
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,200
And that, my friends,
is called hypocrisy.

704
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:05,956
A black man can steal your stereo,
but he can't be your savior.

705
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:07,416
Gonna eat that hash brown?

706
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:10,377
So you went to heaven?

707
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:13,547
Damn right I went to heaven!
Shit, that's the least he could do.

708
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:17,217
In the three years I followed his ass
around Jerusalem, did I ever get laid?

709
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:20,262
Hell, no. And I was in my prime.

710
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,973
I could have been knee-deep
in shepherds' daughters...

711
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:25,642
...not to mention fine-ass
Mary Magdalene.

712
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,644
She had a thing for dark meat.

713
00:43:27,812 --> 00:43:30,772
Maybe this is just me talking,
but if I were in heaven...

714
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,942
...I wouldn't care what the Bible said
as long as the message was right.

715
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,153
The message is what counts.

716
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,990
But folks who build their faith
on that message should be colorblind.

717
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:43,160
And all my rabble-rousing
is not doing that much above.

718
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:45,036
So I'm gonna need
some help down here.

719
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:48,957
That's why I'm gonna help stop those
angels from getting into that church...

720
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,626
...in exchange for you helping me
with my campaign.

721
00:43:51,794 --> 00:43:54,463
How do you know about that,
the angels?

722
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,674
- Isn't much I don't know about you.
- I find that hard to believe.

723
00:43:57,842 --> 00:44:02,012
When you were 5, you let a kid
from next door piss in your hand.

724
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,515
You did that shit? You're nasty.

725
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:08,101
I never told anybody about that.

726
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:09,853
Neither did he.

727
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:12,773
Two years later,
that kid died of leukemia.

728
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,525
- His name was Brian Johnson.
- Brian Johnson.

729
00:44:15,693 --> 00:44:17,778
See, your exploits,
no matter how inane...

730
00:44:17,945 --> 00:44:19,864
...are well documented in heaven.

731
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,783
Probably hell too.

732
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,664
Where are you going?

733
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,541
Yo, man, tell me
something about me.

734
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,586
You masturbate more
than anyone on the planet.

735
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,547
Fuck. Everyone knows that.
Tell me something nobody knows.

736
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,050
When you do it,
you're thinking about guys.

737
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,348
- Dude, not all the time.
- Sorry if I scared you.

738
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,396
Two-thirds of me wants to
forget about this and go home.

739
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,066
Yesterday, I wasn't sure
if God even existed.

740
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,653
Now I'm up to my ass
in Christian mythology.

741
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,573
Let me let you in
on a little inside info.

742
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:07,703
God hates it when
it's referred to as "mythology."

743
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:13,334
Oh, well, then let's ask the "prophets"
what we should call it instead.

744
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,631
Where did those two assholes go?

745
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,443
What are you doing?

746
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,529
Proving to this bastard
I ain't gay.

747
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,614
- What?
- Long story. Forget it.

748
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,033
We gotta get moving.
How can we get to Jersey?

749
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,119
The train. I'll call for reservations.

750
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,887
I thought she looked familiar.

751
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,597
- Who?
- Serendipity.

752
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,029
Morning, shoppers.

753
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:04,864
Good morning.

754
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,201
- Has anyone seen the overnights?
- No, sir.

755
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,162
- We creamed them.
- All right.

756
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:16,501
Last night was a rerun,
which says to me...

757
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:21,005
Do I smell onions?

758
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,763
Excuse me.

759
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:34,686
May I ask what you're doing
in my boardroom?

760
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:38,564
You may proceed, mon ami.

761
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,153
I'm gonna have to start
by apologizing.

762
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:47,156
My friend has a bit of a penchant
for the dramatic.

763
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:48,908
Oh, come on!

764
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:54,122
Would you just relax? I'm doing it.

765
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,376
Mooby, the Golden Calf.

766
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:02,839
Created by Nancy Goldruff,
a former kindergarten teacher, in 1989.

767
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:05,675
Bought by the Complex Corporation
in 1991.

768
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:09,513
Broadcast nationally
as the Mooby Fun-Time Hour.

769
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:14,101
Since its inception,
has spawned two theatrical films...

770
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:18,147
...16 records,
eight prime-time specials...

771
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:22,818
...and a library
of priced-to-own videocassettes.

772
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:26,864
Not to mention
bicoastal theme parks...

773
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,491
...dubbed "Mooby World."

774
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:31,910
Did I miss anything?

775
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,746
You forgot Mooby Magazine.

776
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:35,247
Damn it!

777
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,041
Now, is there a point to this?

778
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,878
You and your board are idolaters.

779
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:45,799
I can't believe you forgot
the magazine.

780
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:49,470
That's you.

781
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:52,931
Do you know much about voodoo?

782
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,686
That's a fascinating practice.
No real doctrine of faith to speak of.

783
00:48:57,854 --> 00:49:00,481
More an arrangement
of superstitions...

784
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,566
...the most well-known of which...

785
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,151
...is the voodoo doll.

786
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,778
You see...

787
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,081
...a mockup of an individual
is subjected...

788
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:19,291
...to various pokes and prods.

789
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:23,505
The desired result is that
the individual will feel those effects.

790
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,131
- Call security, now!
- Yes, sir.

791
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,514
All lines are currently down.

792
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,974
- I have to apologize...
- Would you knock it off?

793
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,519
You're doing it again. Stop.
What did we talk about?

794
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:42,023
You are responsible
for raising an icon...

795
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:44,067
...which draws worship
from the Lord.

796
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:46,486
You have broken
the First Commandment.

797
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:49,531
More than that,
I'm afraid not a one of you...

798
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:52,367
...passes for a decent human being.

799
00:49:52,535 --> 00:49:56,871
Your continued existence
is a mockery of morality.

800
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,873
Like you, Mr. Burton.

801
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:02,460
Last year, you cheated on your wife
of 17 years eight times.

802
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,712
You even had sex
with her best friend...

803
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,134
...while you were supposed to
be home watching the kids.

804
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,720
In the bed that you
and your wife share, no less.

805
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:13,888
Mr. Newman.

806
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:16,724
You got your girlfriend drunk
at last year's Christmas party...

807
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,060
...and then paid a kid
from the mail room...

808
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:21,688
...to have sex with her
while she was passed out...

809
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,399
...just so you could break up
with her guilt-free...

810
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,818
...when she sobbingly confessed
in the morning.

811
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:31,072
She killed herself
three months later.

812
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,075
Mr. Brace disowned his gay son.

813
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,077
Very compassionate, Mr. Brace.

814
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:39,248
Mr. Ray put his mother
in a third-rate nursing home...

815
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,668
...and used the profits
from the sale of her home...

816
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:46,589
...to buy an Oriental rug for himself.

817
00:50:46,756 --> 00:50:48,382
Heavens.

818
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,177
Mr. Barker flew to Thailand
on the company account...

819
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:54,930
...to have sex with
an 11-year-old boy.

820
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:58,058
Mr. Holtzman okayed the production
of Mooby Dolls...

821
00:50:58,226 --> 00:51:00,895
...from materials he knew
to be toxic and unsafe...

822
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:03,397
...because it was, survey says...

823
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,692
...less costly.

824
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,778
You, on the other hand...

825
00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:12,114
...are an innocent.

826
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:14,074
You lead a good life.

827
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:15,284
Good for you.

828
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:19,163
But you, Mr. Whitland...

829
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:23,209
...you have more skeletons in
your closet than this assembled party.

830
00:51:23,376 --> 00:51:26,045
I cannot even mention them aloud.

831
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:33,510
You're his father, you sick fuck.

832
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,140
- Good.
- Not bad, right?

833
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,184
That's great work. Very good.

834
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,062
Well...

835
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:46,315
...alone at last.

836
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,943
With the exception of
Miss Pryce here...

837
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,821
...there isn't a decent human being
amongst you.

838
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:54,658
Not one.

839
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:58,328
Do you know what makes
a human being decent?

840
00:51:58,496 --> 00:51:59,663
Fear.

841
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,831
And therein lies the problem.

842
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,834
None of you has anything
left to fear anymore.

843
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:08,338
You rest comfortably in seats
of inscrutable power...

844
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:11,675
...hiding behind your false idol,
far from judgment...

845
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:15,345
...lives shrouded in secrecy,
even from one another.

846
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:18,723
But not from God.

847
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:25,855
Forgot my little voodoo doll.

848
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:31,528
Man, it really looks
just like you, doesn't it?

849
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:35,365
Look, if I believed enough in this...

850
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,075
...I wonder...

851
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:57,220
Come on. I don't believe in voodoo.

852
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,226
Voodoo.

853
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,820
But I do believe in this.

854
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,281
Don't run! Don't run!

855
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:19,160
Fakes! Fakes! All of you, fakes!
Oh, and you!

856
00:53:20,704 --> 00:53:22,913
"But I do believe in this."

857
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:24,415
What does that mean?

858
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:25,916
And one to grow on.

859
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,090
Gum?

860
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:37,053
Go on. It's okay.

861
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,180
You've done nothing wrong.

862
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:42,350
These guys were fakes.

863
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:44,769
You're a pure soul.

864
00:53:46,438 --> 00:53:48,939
But you didn't say "God bless you"
when I sneezed.

865
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:51,901
Loki!

866
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:54,945
You're getting off light.

867
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:57,448
- Loki!
- I know. I'm coming.

868
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,870
You're so lucky.

869
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,752
I forgot you were down here.
How long now?

870
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,253
Three years this August.

871
00:54:11,421 --> 00:54:14,965
Let me guess, 14th apostle, left out
of the Bible because she's a woman?

872
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,300
This girl's no woman.

873
00:54:16,468 --> 00:54:19,387
Oh. Those weren't tits
I saw Jay cozying up to?

874
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:21,180
What, these?

875
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:25,477
You should know better than anyone
here that tits don't make a woman.

876
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:27,938
The tubby, coat-wearing
motherfucker's got tits.

877
00:54:28,106 --> 00:54:31,525
What traditionally defines a woman
falls between two things:

878
00:54:31,692 --> 00:54:33,318
Her legs.

879
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,821
But as you can see...

880
00:54:35,988 --> 00:54:37,656
...I lack definition.

881
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:41,451
Hey, they're getting a free show!
Let me see that shit!

882
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,538
Oh, God,
another angel like Metatron.

883
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:47,290
How do you know...?
How does she know Metatron?

884
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,334
This is the last scion.

885
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:52,379
You're kidding.

886
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:55,882
I'm confused.

887
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:00,011
Bethany, Serendipity here
isn't technically an angel.

888
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:03,807
Nor is she, by any means,
a human being like I was and you are.

889
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:07,644
- I used to be an abstract.
- Now I'm really confused.

890
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:09,271
I'm a muse, stupid.

891
00:55:10,398 --> 00:55:12,941
I can't take much more of this.

892
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,693
So you, what, inspire people?

893
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:17,028
What just went down
with your friends there...

894
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:20,490
It doesn't take a muse to inspire
horny retards to empty their wallets.

895
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:22,534
I used to specialize
in entertainment.

896
00:55:22,702 --> 00:55:28,123
For example, I'm responsible for 19 of
the 20 top-grossing films of all time.

897
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,792
- Nineteen?
- Yeah.

898
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,795
The one about the kid
by himself in his house...

899
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,882
...burglars trying to come in
and he fights them off...

900
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:39,217
...I had nothing to do
with that one.

901
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:43,639
Somebody sold their soul to Satan to
get grosses up on that piece of shit.

902
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:04,368
What are you doing stripping?

903
00:56:04,536 --> 00:56:05,870
You remember why I left?

904
00:56:06,038 --> 00:56:09,373
Because you were tired of getting
none of the credit for your ideas.

905
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:12,585
So I opted to quit being a muse
and write for myself.

906
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:16,589
I gave my two weeks' notice,
got a body, 50 bucks...

907
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:19,717
...and got sent out into the world
to make my fortune.

908
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:21,427
So, what happened?

909
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:24,180
Writer's block.

910
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:27,099
Can you believe it?
Me, a muse, for God's sake.

911
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:31,229
I can inspire anyone I meet and give
out a zillion and nine ideas a second...

912
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:33,231
...but I can't keep any for myself.

913
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,235
Her quirky sense of humor.

914
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,529
- Whose?
- God's.

915
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,573
- You're saying God's a woman?
- Was there a doubt in your mind?

916
00:56:42,741 --> 00:56:44,450
He's always referred to as "him."

917
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,160
Well, that's not how I wrote it.

918
00:56:46,328 --> 00:56:48,454
But one of the drawbacks
to being intangible...

919
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:51,123
...is that you have no say
in the editorial process.

920
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:54,293
The people that held the pens
added their own perspective...

921
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:56,880
...and all the penholders were men.

922
00:56:57,048 --> 00:57:00,884
So she became a he.
Doesn't stop with God either.

923
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:03,011
The whole book's gender-biased.

924
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:05,305
A woman's responsible
for original sin.

925
00:57:05,473 --> 00:57:07,599
A woman cuts Samson's
coif of power.

926
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:11,061
A woman asks for the head
of John the Baptist.

927
00:57:11,229 --> 00:57:12,604
Read that book again.

928
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:15,816
Women are bigger antagonists than
Egyptians and Romans combined.

929
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:17,150
It stinks.

930
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:25,284
Why is the last scion here?

931
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:28,328
Bartleby and Loki.
They found a way back.

932
00:57:28,496 --> 00:57:31,582
- Not the plenary-indulgence loophole.
- You know about that?

933
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:34,251
I always knew that thing
was a bad idea.

934
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:36,587
Leave it to the Catholics
to destroy existence.

935
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:39,172
You have issues with Catholicism,
I take it?

936
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,843
I have issues with those who treat God
like a burden instead of a blessing...

937
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:44,261
...like some Catholics.

938
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:47,306
You people don't celebrate your faith,
you mourn it.

939
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:51,602
- lf we're wrong, what religion is right?
- It's not about who's right or wrong.

940
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,604
No denomination's nailed it yet...

941
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:56,315
...because they're all
too self-righteous to realize...

942
00:57:56,482 --> 00:58:01,320
...that it doesn't matter what you have
faith in, Just that you have faith.

943
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:05,824
Your hearts are in the right place,
but your brains gotta wake up.

944
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:10,787
Look, they made me and Silent Bob
part of the gang.

945
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:18,713
Who fucking farted?

946
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:23,384
Not born. Shit into existence.

947
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:29,641
Sweet Christ,
somebody wants you bad!

948
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:32,226
- What is that thing?
- An excremental.

949
00:58:32,394 --> 00:58:34,562
- The Golgothan.
- A what?

950
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,022
A shit demon!

951
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,734
No man of woman born!

952
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:43,696
- Friend of yours?
- Is this smelly fuck with us?

953
00:58:43,864 --> 00:58:45,406
It came for Bethany!

954
00:58:45,574 --> 00:58:48,409
Smoke that motherfucker
like it ain't no thing!

955
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:50,912
Damn! I knew I was gonna
whack somebody today!

956
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,914
Yo, get your fucking hand back.

957
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:54,248
Represent!

958
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:58,086
Go! Go! Go!

959
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:21,776
Looks like we're in charge
of the gang now.

960
00:59:23,278 --> 00:59:24,696
Over the bar! Come on!

961
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:37,626
- Where did that thing come from?
- Ever heard of Golgotha?

962
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:39,670
The hill where Christ
was crucified?

963
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:42,548
It wasn't just Christ.
The Romans crucified everyone there.

964
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:46,135
Christ excluded, they were criminals.
Killers, brigands, thieves, rapists.

965
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:49,388
Whenever the crucified expired,
their bodies lost muscle control...

966
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:51,974
...spilling bowel and bladder
in the process...

967
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,893
...the result of which is
that walking pile of crap there.

968
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:58,063
The Golgothan shit demon,
hell's chief assassin.

969
00:59:58,231 --> 00:59:59,940
And it's here for you, girlie.

970
01:00:05,029 --> 01:00:07,614
- Bob, get down!
- Matches! Matches!

971
01:00:39,689 --> 01:00:42,191
- You the man.
- How?

972
01:00:44,028 --> 01:00:45,653
"Knocks strong odors out."

973
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,282
- Way to go, biggie.
- Why would you ever carry this?

974
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,452
What?

975
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,454
Whoever sent this might send more.

976
01:00:54,622 --> 01:00:58,500
I suggest you take the princess
and get as far away as possible.

977
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:01,127
I'll try to get something
out of poopy boy here.

978
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:04,047
If he tells me something,
I'll let you know.

979
01:01:05,216 --> 01:01:07,550
Hello. We'd like two tickets
to New Jersey, please.

980
01:01:07,718 --> 01:01:10,345
- Jersey's sold out, sir.
- What?

981
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:12,013
There's one same time tomorrow.

982
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:16,017
Don't underestimate the staggering
drawing power of the Garden State...

983
01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:18,394
...and show up
two hours in advance.

984
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:22,106
Nice.

985
01:01:22,274 --> 01:01:25,109
Your hard-on for smiting
has prevented us from negotiating...

986
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:29,322
...what ought to be the relatively simple
matter of catching or staying on a bus.

987
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,074
Bus, schmus.

988
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:35,745
Why should we fall victim to gravity
when we can just as easily rise above?

989
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:38,248
- You mean fly?
- We got wings, right?

990
01:01:38,415 --> 01:01:39,916
Fuck, let's use them!

991
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:42,460
I wouldn't suggest that.

992
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:45,630
You see, kids...

993
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:49,425
...you wouldn't want to look like
a couple of fairies, now, would you?

994
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:56,891
Look at this pimp.
How'd you get out of hell?

995
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,186
I said I was coming up
on a routine possession.

996
01:01:59,354 --> 01:02:02,565
I don't have much time. They figure
out my ruse, they'll come for me.

997
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:06,318
- What's with bringing us in here?
- You're inches from getting caught.

998
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:09,905
Going around killing people,
about to uncase your wings.

999
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:11,907
Don't you know what's going on?

1000
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:13,909
Well, we're going home.

1001
01:02:14,077 --> 01:02:18,455
Really. Are you so clueless as to think
you can just waltz back into heaven?

1002
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,083
- Why not?
- Everybody is looking for you.

1003
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:24,086
Both sides. Above and below.

1004
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,463
Orders are to terminate you
on sight.

1005
01:02:26,631 --> 01:02:27,923
- Really?
- Why?

1006
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:30,175
Because you're pissing people off,
that's why.

1007
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:34,138
Word is that God's pissed off
at your presumption...

1008
01:02:34,306 --> 01:02:37,474
...and I know Lucifer's pissed because
you might make him look bad...

1009
01:02:37,642 --> 01:02:39,476
...by succeeding where he's failed.

1010
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:42,646
- So they're just gonna kill us?
- They're gonna try.

1011
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:45,649
That's why you have to
travel incognito.

1012
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:48,777
Tone down your behavior.
Stay off their respective radars.

1013
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:50,821
Quit killing people.
That's high-profile.

1014
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:53,782
- Oh, lighten up.
- I can't believe they wanna kill us.

1015
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,826
Oh, believe it, boys.

1016
01:02:57,078 --> 01:02:59,288
They've even got the last scion
looking for you.

1017
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:01,123
- Really?
- You're kidding.

1018
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:04,168
This is huge. Your reentry
is a thorn in a lot of sides.

1019
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:06,170
They'll stop at nothing
to prevent it.

1020
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:09,506
Meanwhile, I suggest you find
an alternate mode of transportation.

1021
01:03:09,674 --> 01:03:11,675
If anything else comes up,
I'll contact you.

1022
01:03:11,843 --> 01:03:14,930
Thank you, Azrael.
You're a true friend.

1023
01:03:15,097 --> 01:03:17,933
I have to get back to the pit
before they get suspicious.

1024
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,686
And remember, incognito.

1025
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:28,693
How you coping, kid?

1026
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:30,487
It's weird.

1027
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:33,156
Just when I think
I have a handle on things...

1028
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:36,493
...something wholly unbelievable
presents itself.

1029
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:39,120
Sometimes I wish
I'd just stayed home.

1030
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,873
You sound like the man.

1031
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,333
What's he like?

1032
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:45,961
He likes to listen to people talk.

1033
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:49,464
Christ loved to sit around the fire,
listen to me and the other guys.

1034
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:52,050
Whenever we were going on
about unimportant shit...

1035
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:54,177
...he always had a smile
on his face.

1036
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:56,304
His oly real beef with mankind...

1037
01:03:56,472 --> 01:03:59,641
...is the shit that gets carried out
in his name.

1038
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:03,103
Wars, bigotry, televangelism.

1039
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:06,856
The big one, though,
is the factioning of all the religions.

1040
01:04:07,024 --> 01:04:08,858
He said mankind got it all wrong...

1041
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:12,404
...by taking a good idea
and building a belief structure on it.

1042
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:15,156
You're saying having beliefs
is a bad thing?

1043
01:04:15,324 --> 01:04:17,325
I just think it's better
to have ideas.

1044
01:04:17,493 --> 01:04:20,537
You can change an idea.
Changing a belief is trickier.

1045
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:23,081
People die for it. People kill for it.

1046
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:25,583
The whole of existence
is in jeopardy right now...

1047
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:30,798
...because of the Catholic beliefs
regarding this plenary-indulgence shit.

1048
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:33,259
Bartleby and Loki,
whether they know it or not...

1049
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:35,177
...are exploiting that belief...

1050
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:36,887
...and if they're successful...

1051
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:40,975
...you, me, all of this
ends in a heartbeat.

1052
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,060
All over a belief.

1053
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:49,275
I haven't seen the moron twins
in a while. How about you?

1054
01:04:49,443 --> 01:04:52,403
One time we were at the mall,
we tied Tubby to the ceiling...

1055
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:55,906
...and he went flying through the air,
fucking crashed through the wall.

1056
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:57,324
It was fucked up.

1057
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:59,827
You two aren't getting into
any trouble, are you?

1058
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:03,664
No. We're just about to smoke a fatty
with these two suave motherfuckers...

1059
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:07,043
...who just got on at the last stop.
This is Larry and Barry.

1060
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,461
- Hi.
- Hey.

1061
01:05:08,628 --> 01:05:11,130
So Jay tells us
you're gonna sleep with him.

1062
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:18,679
Hit this shit, man. It's good stuff.

1063
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:21,390
Oh, fuck.

1064
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:27,104
That's some bad shit, dude.

1065
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:29,148
You hit that?

1066
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:33,486
Yeah, you're bad, dude.

1067
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,115
Bad shit.

1068
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:41,619
So why are you
heading to New Jersey?

1069
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:45,123
It's just this thing I have to do.

1070
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,666
We're going home.

1071
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:49,503
Oh. Do you two live together?

1072
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,463
Unfortunately, yes.

1073
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,843
So how long have you two
been together?

1074
01:05:58,179 --> 01:05:59,971
A while.

1075
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:03,767
He can be pretty flaky sometimes,
but we have a lot in common.

1076
01:06:04,185 --> 01:06:05,435
How'd you meet?

1077
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:07,104
We were stationed together.

1078
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:09,523
See, that's beautiful.

1079
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,485
Everybody's always up in arms
about this "out in the military" issue.

1080
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:15,695
Pardon?

1081
01:06:15,863 --> 01:06:20,033
There's all that macho bullshit
about it being "this man's army."

1082
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:22,369
And you two meet there, hook up...

1083
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,540
You think we're lovers?
No, no. We're not gay.

1084
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:29,042
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1085
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:32,212
- I just assumed.
- Do I come off as gay?

1086
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,965
- No.
- All right.

1087
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:38,218
My ex-husband sort of screwed up
my relationship awareness barometer.

1088
01:06:38,386 --> 01:06:40,887
- You're divorced.
- That's a nice way of putting it.

1089
01:06:41,055 --> 01:06:42,556
I call it being dumped.

1090
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:44,599
I was...

1091
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,351
...dumped once.

1092
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:49,354
Don't you just constantly
question your value?

1093
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:52,065
Like, why was I so easy
to cast aside?

1094
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:55,735
And you wonder if the other party
is gonna come to their senses...

1095
01:06:55,903 --> 01:06:57,237
...and call you back.

1096
01:06:57,405 --> 01:07:00,741
And they always tell you
it'll hurt less with time.

1097
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:02,910
When actually...

1098
01:07:03,078 --> 01:07:04,704
...it hurts more.

1099
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,334
You know what we need?

1100
01:07:10,502 --> 01:07:12,253
What do we need?

1101
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:13,838
We need drinks.

1102
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:17,383
We need a lot of drinks.

1103
01:07:19,052 --> 01:07:20,928
Garçon.

1104
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,353
You're saying you still
go to church?

1105
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:31,606
Every Sunday.

1106
01:07:31,773 --> 01:07:34,066
Does it...? I mean, does it
do anything for you?

1107
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:37,278
It gives me time to balance
my checkbook every week.

1108
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:41,449
That's what I'm saying. People don't
go to church to feel spiritual anymore.

1109
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:43,784
They go to church and feel bored...

1110
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:47,246
...but they keep going every week
just out of habit.

1111
01:07:47,414 --> 01:07:49,624
I am so buzzed.

1112
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:54,128
When do you think
you lost your faith?

1113
01:07:54,296 --> 01:07:56,505
I remember the exact moment.

1114
01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:02,803
I was on the phone
with my mother...

1115
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:06,933
...and she was trying to counsel me
through this...

1116
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,810
This thing.

1117
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:15,984
And when nothing she was saying
was making me feel any better...

1118
01:08:16,152 --> 01:08:17,986
...she said:

1119
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:19,947
"Bethany...

1120
01:08:20,114 --> 01:08:22,324
...God has a plan."

1121
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:29,122
I was... I was so angry with her.

1122
01:08:31,209 --> 01:08:32,751
I was like:

1123
01:08:32,919 --> 01:08:34,753
"What about my plans?"

1124
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:36,672
You know?

1125
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,800
I had planned to have a family...

1126
01:08:39,968 --> 01:08:41,510
...with my husband.

1127
01:08:41,678 --> 01:08:44,596
Wasn't that plan
good enough for God?

1128
01:08:48,518 --> 01:08:50,352
Apparently not.

1129
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:57,734
How about you?
When did you lose your faith?

1130
01:08:58,903 --> 01:09:01,071
A long time ago.

1131
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:04,658
One day God just stopped listening.

1132
01:09:04,826 --> 01:09:06,118
I kept talking...

1133
01:09:06,286 --> 01:09:09,288
...but I got the distinct impression
he wasn't listening anymore.

1134
01:09:09,455 --> 01:09:12,708
How did you know she was listening
in the first place?

1135
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:17,629
Well, I guess I don't.

1136
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:20,716
I hate thoughts like that.

1137
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:24,136
But, you know,
they come to you with age.

1138
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:29,308
Because when you're a kid you never
question the whole faith thing.

1139
01:09:30,184 --> 01:09:32,895
God's in heaven, and he's...

1140
01:09:33,063 --> 01:09:36,441
She's always got her eye on you.

1141
01:09:40,946 --> 01:09:43,823
I'd give anything
to feel that way again.

1142
01:09:48,996 --> 01:09:52,165
Guess that's why
I got talked into this pilgrimage.

1143
01:10:00,424 --> 01:10:02,592
Where is this pilgrimage to?

1144
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,845
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

1145
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:08,264
All right, but I warned you.

1146
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:10,016
Okay.

1147
01:10:10,184 --> 01:10:13,686
I'm going to this church
in New Jersey.

1148
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:15,563
Really?

1149
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:20,068
Kerwood Mandel to car three.
Kerwood Mandel to car three.

1150
01:10:20,235 --> 01:10:23,613
See, I'm supposed to stop
a couple of angels...

1151
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:25,615
...from going into the church.

1152
01:10:27,576 --> 01:10:29,369
They're trying...

1153
01:10:29,536 --> 01:10:30,953
Shit.

1154
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:35,500
They're trying
to get back into heaven.

1155
01:10:38,545 --> 01:10:41,089
See, they got tossed
out of heaven...

1156
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:43,216
...years ago, right?

1157
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:45,885
And if they get back in...

1158
01:10:46,053 --> 01:10:47,805
...it proves God wrong...

1159
01:10:47,972 --> 01:10:51,058
...and since God is infallible...

1160
01:10:51,226 --> 01:10:52,893
...to prove her wrong...

1161
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:56,730
...would, you know,
unmake existence.

1162
01:10:58,108 --> 01:11:00,150
May I have your attention, please.

1163
01:11:00,318 --> 01:11:04,488
The dining car will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

1164
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:07,157
I feel so stupid...

1165
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:09,243
...just saying it.

1166
01:11:10,703 --> 01:11:12,996
The thing I don't get is, I mean...

1167
01:11:13,164 --> 01:11:15,749
...how am I supposed to stop
an angel?

1168
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:17,334
Two, even!

1169
01:11:22,507 --> 01:11:25,759
I guess I'm supposed to
talk them out of it or something.

1170
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:27,970
Maybe you're supposed to
kill them.

1171
01:11:28,138 --> 01:11:31,765
Oh, yeah, right. Kill them.

1172
01:11:32,642 --> 01:11:36,854
I mean, even if that were the case,
which it's not...

1173
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:41,358
...how do you kill an angel, Barry?

1174
01:11:44,696 --> 01:11:48,615
I don't suppose it's much different
from killing a human.

1175
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:52,661
Where the hell is everybody?
I wake up and...

1176
01:11:54,706 --> 01:11:56,540
- The apostle.
- Holy shit!

1177
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:59,626
Rufus, I want you to meet
my new friend Barry.

1178
01:12:03,048 --> 01:12:04,966
Don't be such a show-off, Barry.

1179
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:07,802
Take it easy, Bartleby.
Just let her go.

1180
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,138
- We can talk about this.
- Bartleby?

1181
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:13,808
After all this time, it comes down
to slaughter by a meat puppet?

1182
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:16,728
Get your fucking hands off me,
you dickless son of a bitch!

1183
01:12:16,896 --> 01:12:19,731
Save it, lady. Five minutes ago
you were aching to top me off.

1184
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:21,316
Loki!

1185
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,067
Holy shit. The apostle.

1186
01:12:23,235 --> 01:12:25,236
I didn't come in you, Pete,
I swear.

1187
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:26,529
What are you doing here?

1188
01:12:26,697 --> 01:12:29,324
This woman has to stop two angels
from entering a church.

1189
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:31,576
- She means us?
- No, two other fucking angels.

1190
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:35,079
I'd say there's a pretty good chance.
Rufus, we're to be liquidated?

1191
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:37,916
You haven't thought about
the consequences of your reentry.

1192
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,709
Consequences, schmonsequences.

1193
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:42,712
We're going home, okay?
No matter whose pride it may hurt.

1194
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,256
- It's not a matter of pride!
- Loki, kill the girl.

1195
01:12:45,424 --> 01:12:48,092
Are you high? I can't kill her
if she hasn't done anything.

1196
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,552
Fine. I'll kill her myself.

1197
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,930
What, I fall asleep
and everyone takes off?

1198
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:54,599
- These guys are fucking flat-leavers.
- Shut his mouth.

1199
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:06,277
Oh, shit!

1200
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:09,113
Jay!

1201
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:11,533
Biggie!

1202
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,077
The door! The door!

1203
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:20,125
Can't we talk about this?

1204
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:28,634
Why don't I just get off
at the next stop!

1205
01:14:08,675 --> 01:14:10,676
No ticket.

1206
01:14:13,388 --> 01:14:16,015
- The apostle is here.
- I noticed.

1207
01:14:16,182 --> 01:14:18,267
Then you know who the chick was,
don't you?

1208
01:14:18,435 --> 01:14:19,643
The scion, I imagine!

1209
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,521
Maybe we should rethink
this whole thing.

1210
01:14:22,689 --> 01:14:25,774
I mean, you heard the guy.
He said there are consequences.

1211
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:27,860
And Azrael tells us we're marked?

1212
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,820
There's more to this
than we thought of.

1213
01:14:29,988 --> 01:14:31,905
I was close.

1214
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:35,160
You know? I was so close
to slitting that bitch's throat.

1215
01:14:36,495 --> 01:14:39,664
You know how I felt? Righteous.

1216
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:41,333
Justified. Eager, even.

1217
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:43,460
You all right?
Your eyes are kind of...

1218
01:14:43,628 --> 01:14:45,670
My eyes are open.

1219
01:14:45,838 --> 01:14:47,672
For the first time I get it.

1220
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,551
When that little innocent girl
let her mission slip, I had an epiphany.

1221
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,388
See, in the beginning it was
just us and him, angels and God.

1222
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:57,223
Then he created humans.

1223
01:14:57,391 --> 01:15:00,310
Ours was designed to be
a life of servitude and worship...

1224
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:03,647
...and bowing and scraping
and adoration.

1225
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:06,107
He gave them more
than he ever gave us.

1226
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:08,151
He gave them a choice.

1227
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,529
They choose to acknowledge God
or choose to ignore him.

1228
01:15:11,697 --> 01:15:13,531
All this time
we've been down here...

1229
01:15:13,699 --> 01:15:16,201
...l've felt the absence
of the divine presence...

1230
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:19,579
...and it's pained me,
as I'm sure it must have pained you.

1231
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:23,375
And why?
Because of the way he made us.

1232
01:15:23,542 --> 01:15:27,087
Had we been given free will, we could
choose to ignore the pain like they do.

1233
01:15:27,254 --> 01:15:28,880
But no, we're servants.

1234
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:30,965
Okay.

1235
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:34,552
You know, all I'm saying here is that
one of us might need a little nap.

1236
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
Wake up!

1237
01:15:35,888 --> 01:15:38,556
Humans have besmirched
everything he's bestowed on them.

1238
01:15:38,724 --> 01:15:40,558
They were given paradise,
they threw it away.

1239
01:15:40,726 --> 01:15:43,061
They were given this planet,
they destroyed it.

1240
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:45,689
They were favored best
among all his endeavors...

1241
01:15:45,856 --> 01:15:49,109
...and some of them
don't even believe he exists!

1242
01:15:49,276 --> 01:15:51,278
And in spite of it all...

1243
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:55,074
...he has shown them
infinite fucking patience...

1244
01:15:55,242 --> 01:15:56,951
...at every turn.

1245
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,619
What about us?

1246
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,623
I asked you once...

1247
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,626
...to lay down the sword
because I felt sorry for them.

1248
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:07,545
What was the result?

1249
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,880
Our expulsion from paradise.

1250
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:12,550
Where was his
infinite fucking patience then?

1251
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:15,469
It's not right! It's not fair!

1252
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,513
We've paid our debt!

1253
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,684
Don't you think it's time?

1254
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:24,687
Don't you think it's time
we went home?

1255
01:16:26,398 --> 01:16:31,318
And to do that, I think we may have to
dispatch our would-be dispatchers.

1256
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,071
Wait. Wait, wait. Kill them?

1257
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:37,908
You're talking about the last scion,
for chrissake.

1258
01:16:38,076 --> 01:16:40,911
And what about Jay and Bob?
Those guys were all right.

1259
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:42,538
Don't. Don't, my friend.

1260
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:46,250
See, don't let your sympathies
get the best of you.

1261
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:47,835
They did me once.

1262
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,795
Scion or not...

1263
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:51,297
...she's just a human...

1264
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:54,508
...and by passing through that arch
our sins are forgiven.

1265
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,677
No harm, no foul.

1266
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,681
My God.
I've heard a rant like this before.

1267
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:03,601
What did you say?

1268
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:06,772
- I've heard a rant like this before.
- Don't you do that to me.

1269
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:09,858
- You sound like the morning star.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

1270
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:13,028
You sound like Lucifer, man!
You've fucking lost it!

1271
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,697
You're not talking about
going home, Bartleby.

1272
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:18,366
You're talking about
fucking war on God.

1273
01:17:19,827 --> 01:17:21,369
Well, fuck that.

1274
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:25,791
I have seen what happens to the proud
when they take on the throne.

1275
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:28,877
I'm going back to Wisconsin.

1276
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,172
We're going home, Loki...

1277
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:36,301
...and no one, not you,
not even the Almighty himself...

1278
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:38,303
...is gonna make that otherwise.

1279
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:46,311
Shit.

1280
01:17:47,522 --> 01:17:51,066
Why couldn't we stay on the train?
You threw those guys off.

1281
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,901
Very basic strategy.

1282
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:56,404
If your enemies know where you are,
then don't be there.

1283
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:57,572
Why are we enemies?

1284
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,034
Well, I know I'd perceive the person
sent to kill me as an enemy.

1285
01:18:01,202 --> 01:18:04,496
What does that mean? Since when
am I supposed to kill anybody?

1286
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:08,250
I'm tired of
all this cryptic bullshit.

1287
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,919
I'm physically and psychologically
exhausted, Rufus...

1288
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:14,214
...and I'm ready to kick back
and welcome the end of existence...

1289
01:18:14,382 --> 01:18:16,675
...unless you come clean right now.

1290
01:18:16,843 --> 01:18:18,844
Why me?

1291
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:22,431
Out of all the people on the
goddamn planet, why was I tapped?

1292
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:25,810
Imagine you're a 12-year-old boy.

1293
01:18:26,728 --> 01:18:30,690
You're told you're God's only son,
but more than that, you're God.

1294
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:34,360
How long would it take to come
to grips with something that huge?

1295
01:18:34,528 --> 01:18:37,113
Maybe, say, 18 years?

1296
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:42,285
In the Bible, Jesus suddenly goes
from age 12 to 30. Twelve to 30.

1297
01:18:42,452 --> 01:18:44,579
Now, that's some pretty bad
storytelling.

1298
01:18:44,746 --> 01:18:47,582
Where are the volumes of text
dealing with the missing 18 years?

1299
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:48,958
I'll tell you where.

1300
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:53,796
They were offered up as a sacrifice
to the god of ecumenical politics.

1301
01:18:53,964 --> 01:18:56,883
You make it sound like
there's some church conspiracy...

1302
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,719
...to cover up
"the truth about Christ."

1303
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:03,472
Oh, bullshit.

1304
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,558
Any important material
about Christ...

1305
01:19:05,726 --> 01:19:08,227
...would give people
a better understanding of God.

1306
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:12,315
- Why would they leave any of it out?
- Because it's tied in with his family.

1307
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:15,443
- His mother and father.
- His brothers and sisters.

1308
01:19:15,611 --> 01:19:19,780
Jesus didn't have brothers and sisters.
Mary was a virgin.

1309
01:19:19,948 --> 01:19:24,201
Mary gave birth to Christ without
knowing a man's touch. This is true.

1310
01:19:24,369 --> 01:19:26,203
But she did have a husband.

1311
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:29,999
Do you really think he would've stayed
married to her for all those years...

1312
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:31,667
...if he wasn't getting laid?

1313
01:19:31,835 --> 01:19:35,171
The nature of God and the virgin birth,
those are leaps of faith.

1314
01:19:35,339 --> 01:19:39,509
But to believe a married couple never
got down, that's just plain gullibility.

1315
01:19:39,677 --> 01:19:40,677
Meaning?

1316
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:42,679
The blood that flows
through your veins...

1317
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,474
...shares a chromosome or two
at the genetic level...

1318
01:19:45,642 --> 01:19:47,309
...with the one you call Jesus.

1319
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:50,270
Bethany, you are...

1320
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:53,732
...the great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great...

1321
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,361
...great-great-grandniece
of Jesus Christ.

1322
01:20:01,324 --> 01:20:05,285
So that would make Bethany
part black?

1323
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:12,000
I can't do this anymore.

1324
01:20:15,713 --> 01:20:20,384
Bethany, where you gonna go?
You know what I'm saying is right.

1325
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,219
- It's bullshit.
- Bethany.

1326
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:24,179
It's bullshit!

1327
01:20:27,976 --> 01:20:29,935
Let her go, man.

1328
01:20:30,103 --> 01:20:31,520
Give her time.

1329
01:20:38,903 --> 01:20:40,862
Why?!

1330
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,865
What the fuck do you want
from me?

1331
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:46,326
I fucking hate you!

1332
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:48,912
I hate you.

1333
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,248
He can't hear you, you know.

1334
01:20:57,089 --> 01:20:59,090
That's why we needed you.

1335
01:20:59,258 --> 01:21:01,426
Why didn't you tell me?

1336
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:03,219
Would you...?

1337
01:21:03,804 --> 01:21:06,055
Could you have believed me?

1338
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:09,350
It was something
you had to come to gradually.

1339
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:13,062
Only after everything you've seen...

1340
01:21:13,605 --> 01:21:14,856
...everything you've heard...

1341
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:19,902
...could you possibly be able
to accept the truth.

1342
01:21:20,446 --> 01:21:22,572
I don't want this.

1343
01:21:25,284 --> 01:21:27,285
It's too big.

1344
01:21:27,453 --> 01:21:29,037
That's what Jesus said.

1345
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,207
I had to tell him.

1346
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,464
You can imagine
how that hurt the Father...

1347
01:21:40,507 --> 01:21:42,800
...not to be able
to tell the son himself...

1348
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:45,970
...because one word from his lips
would destroy the boy's human form.

1349
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:49,140
So I had to deliver the news
to a scared child...

1350
01:21:49,308 --> 01:21:51,934
...who wanted nothing more
than to play with other children.

1351
01:21:52,102 --> 01:21:55,813
I had to tell this little boy
that he was God's only son...

1352
01:21:55,981 --> 01:21:58,816
...and it meant a life of persecution
and eventual crucifixion...

1353
01:21:58,984 --> 01:22:02,111
...at the hands of the very people
he'd come to enlighten and redeem.

1354
01:22:04,364 --> 01:22:06,532
He begged me to take it all back.

1355
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:09,495
As if I could.

1356
01:22:11,247 --> 01:22:13,999
He begged me to
"make it all not true."

1357
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:18,504
I'll let you in on something, Bethany,
it's something I've never told anyone.

1358
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:22,508
If I had the power...

1359
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:24,760
...I would have.

1360
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:26,678
It's unfair.

1361
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,432
It's unfair to ask a child
to shoulder that responsibility...

1362
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,810
...and to ask you
to do the same now.

1363
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:36,730
I sympathize. I do.
I wish I could take it all back.

1364
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:41,235
But I can't.

1365
01:22:44,114 --> 01:22:45,531
This...

1366
01:22:46,783 --> 01:22:48,867
...is who you are.

1367
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,330
Everything I am has been a lie?

1368
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,708
No, no, no.

1369
01:22:57,418 --> 01:23:01,964
Knowing what you now know doesn't
mean you're not who you were.

1370
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:04,842
You are Bethany Sloane.

1371
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:08,428
No one can take that away from you,
not even God.

1372
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:14,434
All this means is
a redefinition of that identity.

1373
01:23:14,602 --> 01:23:18,147
The incorporation of this new data
into who you are.

1374
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,399
Be who you've always been.

1375
01:23:21,484 --> 01:23:22,651
Just...

1376
01:23:23,654 --> 01:23:25,697
...be this as well...

1377
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:29,492
...from time to time.

1378
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:35,999
Guess this means
no more cheating on my taxes.

1379
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:38,334
To say the least.

1380
01:23:46,552 --> 01:23:49,053
Do you mind if we adjourn
to somewhere...

1381
01:23:49,221 --> 01:23:51,764
...a tad more habitable...

1382
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:53,892
...and a bit warmer?

1383
01:24:08,324 --> 01:24:10,950
Fuck, man, I think this shit
Just kicked in.

1384
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:13,912
Weren't we just in the woods?
What are we doing here now?

1385
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:15,955
Going out in style.

1386
01:24:16,123 --> 01:24:18,625
- The voice.
- The apostle.

1387
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,543
Now, who's this motherfucker?

1388
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,795
It's the voice of God.
Show some respect.

1389
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,298
Oh, the voice of God.
Where's the rest of him?

1390
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:27,634
Funny you should mention that.
We're not sure.

1391
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:30,470
- What?
- Come on. Didn't it ever occur to you...

1392
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:34,599
...that this Bartleby-Loki situation was
well within the sphere of his control?

1393
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:36,434
Yes, but then why was she tapped?

1394
01:24:36,602 --> 01:24:40,481
You know those constitutionals
that he likes to take?

1395
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:41,815
"Constitutionals"?

1396
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:44,401
I think we're beyond euphemisms
at this point.

1397
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:46,403
God's a skeeball fanatic.

1398
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:50,741
The Lord has a fancy for the game.
He's been playing it for years.

1399
01:24:50,909 --> 01:24:53,494
He assumes a human form
once a month and indulges.

1400
01:24:53,662 --> 01:24:56,580
Doesn't say where he's playing,
just goes away for a couple hours.

1401
01:24:56,748 --> 01:25:00,167
And he always gives his free points
away to neighborhood children.

1402
01:25:00,335 --> 01:25:01,669
Isn't that sweet?

1403
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:05,339
But she hasn't come back from
one of these day trips, is that it?

1404
01:25:05,507 --> 01:25:07,800
No, she hasn't...

1405
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,678
...and we've been
unable to locate her.

1406
01:25:10,845 --> 01:25:14,098
He could've been killed.
Human form does have that drawback.

1407
01:25:14,266 --> 01:25:18,519
No, there's a different sort
of foul play afoot, children.

1408
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:22,690
Whomever has set
the renegade angels on their path...

1409
01:25:22,857 --> 01:25:25,192
...and is keeping them
quite well hidden...

1410
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,237
...is also responsible
for the Lord's whereabouts.

1411
01:25:28,405 --> 01:25:30,572
Were he to be killed
in human form...

1412
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:33,325
...he'd have returned
immediately to heaven.

1413
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:35,369
Someone knew enough...

1414
01:25:35,537 --> 01:25:37,579
...to keep him biologically alive...

1415
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,624
...but incapacitate him
in another fashion.

1416
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:43,460
And as omnipotent
as we are above...

1417
01:25:43,628 --> 01:25:47,006
...I have to admit that we're
more or less lost without his presence.

1418
01:25:47,173 --> 01:25:49,008
We've looked everywhere for him.

1419
01:25:49,175 --> 01:25:53,929
I tapped her because I thought we'd be
able to smoke out whoever's behind it.

1420
01:25:54,098 --> 01:25:57,309
But whoever he is was clever enough
to send some lackeys after you...

1421
01:25:57,476 --> 01:25:59,477
...as opposed to showing up
themselves.

1422
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:01,313
Could it be Lucifer?

1423
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,772
Not Lucifer.

1424
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,401
If he was, he'd have made
his move by now to conquer Heaven.

1425
01:26:06,569 --> 01:26:09,404
And I know he's not responsible
for Bartleby and Loki...

1426
01:26:09,572 --> 01:26:12,699
...because he has just as much to lose
by their return as anybody else.

1427
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,242
So, what do we do now?

1428
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:17,162
Well, I say we get drunk,
because I'm all out of ideas.

1429
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,206
Why don't we just ask this guy
to close the church?

1430
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,083
I beg your pardon?

1431
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:24,169
It's the guy in charge
of the church thing.

1432
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,840
Cardinal Glick?

1433
01:26:29,008 --> 01:26:31,092
Maybe we can ask him
to shut down the church.

1434
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:34,512
If it's closed that day, those guys
can't get blessed or whatever, right?

1435
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,889
Good Lord.

1436
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,016
The little stoner's got a point.

1437
01:26:38,184 --> 01:26:42,687
Maybe we could talk this guy Glick into
canceling the rededication ceremony.

1438
01:26:42,855 --> 01:26:44,773
"We"?

1439
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:47,942
Are you saying you're back in,
Ms. I Can't Do This Anymore?

1440
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:55,617
I wouldn't want to let the family down,
now, would I?

1441
01:26:58,788 --> 01:27:00,580
Well...

1442
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:04,459
...the prophets finally
live up to their titles.

1443
01:27:05,002 --> 01:27:07,712
Mass attendance is at
an all-time low in this country...

1444
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,301
...but if we can let them know the
Catholic Church has a little panache...

1445
01:27:12,469 --> 01:27:15,429
...we can win them back,
even get some new ones.

1446
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:17,098
Excuse me.

1447
01:27:19,226 --> 01:27:20,768
Fill them pews, people.

1448
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:23,771
That's the key.
Grab the little ones as well.

1449
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:26,315
Hook them while they're young.

1450
01:27:26,483 --> 01:27:30,569
- Kind of like the tobacco industry.
- Christ, if only we had their numbers.

1451
01:27:30,737 --> 01:27:33,781
We really appreciate you seeing us
so late in the day, Your Eminence.

1452
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:37,451
My friends and I have been traveling
all night in hope of talking to you...

1453
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,995
...about the St. Michael's
rededication ceremony.

1454
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:42,581
So you looking to help out
in some way, I take it?

1455
01:27:42,749 --> 01:27:45,459
We'd like you to cancel
the ceremony.

1456
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:48,170
I beg your pardon.

1457
01:27:48,338 --> 01:27:52,258
There's gonna be a world of trouble
if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward.

1458
01:27:53,385 --> 01:27:56,178
Are you pro-choice?

1459
01:27:56,346 --> 01:27:57,847
No, no. The trouble's not from us.

1460
01:27:58,014 --> 01:28:01,267
It's from renegade angels that have
been stuck on Earth since the plagues.

1461
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:06,522
These guys,
they think they're renegade angels.

1462
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,816
See, padre, it goes down like this.

1463
01:28:08,984 --> 01:28:11,610
These guys think that
by passing through that archway...

1464
01:28:11,778 --> 01:28:13,612
...they can go straight to heaven.

1465
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,324
You want me to call off
the ceremony for that.

1466
01:28:18,452 --> 01:28:19,535
Who sent you?

1467
01:28:21,705 --> 01:28:24,665
We were sent
by him who is called I Am!

1468
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,335
Cute. Really cute.

1469
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:29,796
Kids, playtime with the cardinal
is over.

1470
01:28:29,964 --> 01:28:32,507
- Worked for Moses.
- Stay out of this.

1471
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,217
Your Eminence, it's not a joke.

1472
01:28:34,385 --> 01:28:37,387
I'm telling you, man,
this ceremony's a big mistake.

1473
01:28:37,555 --> 01:28:40,390
The Catholic Church
does not make mistakes.

1474
01:28:40,558 --> 01:28:43,435
Please! What about the Church's
silent consent of the slave trade?

1475
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:46,062
And its platform of noninvolvement
during the Holocaust?

1476
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:48,565
All right, mistakes were made.

1477
01:28:48,733 --> 01:28:51,860
But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church...

1478
01:28:52,028 --> 01:28:53,820
...responsible for
the oversights of old.

1479
01:28:53,988 --> 01:28:57,657
I'm an important man with important
matters that demand my attention...

1480
01:28:57,825 --> 01:28:59,242
...so if you please...

1481
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:02,078
- But tomorrow...
- Tomorrow goes off without a hitch.

1482
01:29:02,246 --> 01:29:03,497
Do I make myself clear?

1483
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:08,251
Neither you nor any other influence
short of the hand of God himself...

1484
01:29:08,419 --> 01:29:11,254
...is gonna keep this thing
from going off without a hitch.

1485
01:29:32,276 --> 01:29:34,277
I can see the headlines now...

1486
01:29:34,695 --> 01:29:36,279
...if there were gonna be any.

1487
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:37,948
"Existence Erased."

1488
01:29:38,115 --> 01:29:40,283
Don't worry about it.
We evened the score.

1489
01:29:40,451 --> 01:29:42,703
Hand it over, Silent Bob.

1490
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:46,374
What up?

1491
01:29:46,542 --> 01:29:48,709
You stole the cardinaI's driver?

1492
01:29:48,877 --> 01:29:52,797
That's what he gets for messing with
our girlfriend. Cross-dressing fuck.

1493
01:29:52,965 --> 01:29:55,675
That's sort of sweet.
Thanks, guys.

1494
01:29:57,135 --> 01:29:59,971
What do we do now
about Bartleby and Loki?

1495
01:30:00,138 --> 01:30:03,266
I guess we're gonna
have to try and kill them.

1496
01:30:03,433 --> 01:30:05,476
- You said they couldn't be killed.
- Correction.

1497
01:30:07,145 --> 01:30:09,814
They won't be killed.

1498
01:30:09,982 --> 01:30:12,942
And just to ensure that,
we're all gonna sit tight...

1499
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:17,363
...right here, until those two idiots
pass through that arch.

1500
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:21,158
Hey. There's only
one idiot here, Azrael...

1501
01:30:23,954 --> 01:30:26,038
...and I'm looking right at him.

1502
01:30:26,206 --> 01:30:27,665
Muse!

1503
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,128
Just in time to join us for a drink.

1504
01:30:32,296 --> 01:30:34,672
Hey. Where'd you come from?

1505
01:30:36,633 --> 01:30:38,467
- Where'd you come from?
- Me?

1506
01:30:38,635 --> 01:30:40,052
Nothingness.

1507
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:43,848
And that's where I'm returning to
in approximately, oh, one hour.

1508
01:30:44,016 --> 01:30:47,518
All right, Plato, sounds like
you've had enough already.

1509
01:30:47,686 --> 01:30:50,062
- Let's go.
- Oh, darn it!

1510
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:53,816
Come on, barkeep, just one drink.
One for the road, then I'm gone?

1511
01:30:53,984 --> 01:30:57,237
I was trying to find you to tell you
I figured out who was behind all this.

1512
01:30:57,405 --> 01:30:58,822
Is that who I think it is?

1513
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,198
- None other than.
- Who is he?

1514
01:31:00,366 --> 01:31:03,035
All right, one drink.
Then you're gone.

1515
01:31:03,202 --> 01:31:05,287
Give me a...

1516
01:31:05,455 --> 01:31:07,831
...Holy Bartender.

1517
01:31:07,999 --> 01:31:09,791
Never heard of it.

1518
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:13,712
He doesn't know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1519
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,714
You do, don't you, Muse?

1520
01:31:15,882 --> 01:31:16,882
Don't.

1521
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:20,719
Anybody? No?

1522
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:24,306
Well, I know how to make
a Holy Bartender.

1523
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:33,982
Get it?

1524
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:36,318
Sweet Jesus, Azrael! Why?

1525
01:31:36,486 --> 01:31:39,905
Come on, demon! Try that shit
on somebody who's already dead!

1526
01:31:40,073 --> 01:31:43,408
Oh, apostle, you maintain
that kind of an attitude...

1527
01:31:43,576 --> 01:31:46,536
...and you and the barkeep won't be
the only corpses in the room.

1528
01:31:46,704 --> 01:31:48,747
The Christ bitch will join you.

1529
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,000
Are you really that stupid?

1530
01:31:52,168 --> 01:31:55,587
You do know what's gonna happen
if those two jerks enter that church.

1531
01:31:55,755 --> 01:31:58,048
I'm actually counting on it.

1532
01:31:59,342 --> 01:32:01,426
And if my calculations
are correct...

1533
01:32:01,594 --> 01:32:04,262
...the pawns are moving
into checkmate as we speak.

1534
01:32:09,268 --> 01:32:12,772
"Holy Bartender." I get it.
That's a great one!

1535
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:17,068
I'd also like to acknowledge this great
state's governor, Elizabeth Dalton...

1536
01:32:17,236 --> 01:32:18,778
...for coming here this morning.

1537
01:32:18,946 --> 01:32:21,948
True, she's a Protestant, but we're
not gonna hold that against her.

1538
01:32:23,992 --> 01:32:28,287
Now, let me just tell you a little bit
of history about this particular...

1539
01:32:28,455 --> 01:32:31,040
...hundred-years-young
house of God.

1540
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,417
God's house?

1541
01:32:33,877 --> 01:32:36,504
God doesn't live here anymore.

1542
01:32:36,672 --> 01:32:39,382
He's grown weary
of your superficial faith.

1543
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,385
He's turned a deaf ear
to your lip-service prayers.

1544
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:44,804
- He has abandoned you...
- Sorry.

1545
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:47,807
...his favorites,
to the whim ofjudgment.

1546
01:32:47,975 --> 01:32:50,393
Hypocrites, charlatans...

1547
01:32:52,146 --> 01:32:54,647
...prepare to taste God's wrath.

1548
01:32:54,815 --> 01:32:56,023
Maybe we should just leave.

1549
01:32:56,191 --> 01:32:57,859
You wanted your body count.
You got it.

1550
01:32:58,026 --> 01:33:00,403
This lot is rife with sin.
We'll judge them all.

1551
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:01,738
Officer McGhee.

1552
01:33:02,614 --> 01:33:04,323
All right, mouthpiece...

1553
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:07,160
...let's leave the nice cardinal alone
and go for a ride.

1554
01:33:07,327 --> 01:33:09,662
Mr. McGhee, don't make me angry.

1555
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,664
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

1556
01:33:11,832 --> 01:33:13,583
Is that so?

1557
01:33:17,963 --> 01:33:19,630
Ladies and gentlemen...

1558
01:33:19,798 --> 01:33:25,178
...you have been judged as guilty of
violations against our Almighty God...

1559
01:33:25,345 --> 01:33:27,681
...and this very day...

1560
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:31,518
...I assure you, you will all
pay for your trespasses...

1561
01:33:31,686 --> 01:33:33,353
...in blood.

1562
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:35,689
- Wings. Now.
- I'm feeling a little exposed here.

1563
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:36,857
Do it!

1564
01:33:38,151 --> 01:33:40,778
- So he's a muse too?
- Former muse.

1565
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:45,866
He was kicked out.

1566
01:33:46,034 --> 01:33:48,368
Ever the fucking apple polisher.

1567
01:33:48,536 --> 01:33:49,536
Then what happened?

1568
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:51,789
Yes, what?

1569
01:33:51,956 --> 01:33:55,834
Well, Lucifer just had to start
his little war for the throne.

1570
01:33:56,002 --> 01:33:58,462
Heaven became divided
into two factions...

1571
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,714
...the faithful and the renegades.

1572
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:03,634
Oh, the ethereal plains
were chaotic with battle.

1573
01:34:03,802 --> 01:34:06,512
Angel against angel.

1574
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:10,015
And when it was all over,
God cast the rebels into perdition.

1575
01:34:10,183 --> 01:34:11,975
But Azrael refused to fight.

1576
01:34:12,143 --> 01:34:15,562
He remained in the middle, waiting
to see who came out victorious.

1577
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,731
What are you,
some kind of fucking chicken?

1578
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:19,233
No.

1579
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:23,237
I was an artist, stupid!

1580
01:34:23,404 --> 01:34:24,947
I was inspiration!

1581
01:34:25,114 --> 01:34:27,533
A muse has no place in battle.

1582
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,160
So after the fallen
were banished to hell...

1583
01:34:30,328 --> 01:34:32,329
...God turned on those
that wouldn't fight...

1584
01:34:32,497 --> 01:34:34,748
...and Azrael was sent down
with the demons...

1585
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,626
...something he considers
a great injustice.

1586
01:34:37,794 --> 01:34:39,878
Oh, come on.

1587
01:34:40,046 --> 01:34:43,006
Don't tell me you never questioned
the judgment, Serendipity.

1588
01:34:43,175 --> 01:34:45,844
No. It never bothered me.

1589
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:47,929
So you were an artist.

1590
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:49,764
Big deal!

1591
01:34:49,932 --> 01:34:51,933
Elvis was an artist...

1592
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:55,353
...but that didn't stop him from
joining the service in time of war.

1593
01:34:55,521 --> 01:34:57,355
That's why he is the king...

1594
01:34:57,523 --> 01:34:59,357
...and you're a schmuck.

1595
01:34:59,525 --> 01:35:00,608
Nice.

1596
01:35:00,776 --> 01:35:02,569
So all this is about revenge.

1597
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:05,613
You're gonna unmake existence
because of a grudge against God?

1598
01:35:05,781 --> 01:35:09,450
After the first million years? No.

1599
01:35:09,618 --> 01:35:13,371
Escape from hell
became my all-consuming reason.

1600
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:17,959
So I studied the religions and waited
for my opportunity to present itself...

1601
01:35:18,127 --> 01:35:19,544
...which it finally did...

1602
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:21,588
...in Catholicism.

1603
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:22,922
Plenary indulgence.

1604
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:24,883
But I couldn't exercise it.

1605
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,427
Demons can't become human.

1606
01:35:27,595 --> 01:35:29,637
No, we can't transubstantiate.

1607
01:35:31,223 --> 01:35:32,599
But angels can.

1608
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:35,143
Bartleby and Loki.

1609
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:39,898
After that it was a simple matter
of waiting for a church...

1610
01:35:40,065 --> 01:35:41,774
...to celebrate their centennial...

1611
01:35:41,942 --> 01:35:47,488
...and when it finally happened I sent
the pair an article laced with ideas.

1612
01:35:47,656 --> 01:35:49,490
An incantation
I picked up in the pit...

1613
01:35:49,658 --> 01:35:51,659
...kept them cloaked
and off heaven's radars.

1614
01:35:51,827 --> 01:35:54,913
And aside from the triplets here
and the Golgothan...

1615
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,792
...no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on.

1616
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,837
But the Almighty
could still putsch the whole deal...

1617
01:36:02,005 --> 01:36:05,424
...so I dispatched him
in a fairly ingenious fashion.

1618
01:36:05,592 --> 01:36:07,927
Her. And how?

1619
01:36:08,094 --> 01:36:10,596
That's the only thing
I couldn't figure out.

1620
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:13,599
Oh, no, I've seen way too many
Bond movies to know...

1621
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:16,602
...that you never reveal
all the details of your plan...

1622
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:20,105
...no matter how close
you may think you are to winning.

1623
01:36:20,273 --> 01:36:23,359
The only X factor was the involvement
of the last scion here.

1624
01:36:24,194 --> 01:36:28,822
But fat lot of good that did, right?
I mean, here you all are.

1625
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,787
Powerless to stop the inevitable.

1626
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:38,958
Look, asshole, I don't know
if anyone explained the rules to you...

1627
01:36:39,125 --> 01:36:42,962
...but if you succeed everything gets
blinked out of existence, even you.

1628
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:46,006
Human, have you ever
been to hell?

1629
01:36:46,174 --> 01:36:48,217
I think not.

1630
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:50,552
I'd rather not exist
than go back to that.

1631
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:55,015
And if everyone has to
go down with me, so be it.

1632
01:36:55,183 --> 01:36:57,559
Still thinking only about yourself...

1633
01:36:57,727 --> 01:36:59,561
...you fucking child!

1634
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:01,814
Now, now, now.

1635
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:05,693
Things are getting
too intense in here.

1636
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:08,320
Hey! What say
we watch a little TV?

1637
01:37:08,488 --> 01:37:10,406
Yo, put on Channel 9.
Davey and Goliath.

1638
01:37:11,866 --> 01:37:16,162
Actually, I was thinking more
along the lines of current events.

1639
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,665
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1640
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,584
I repeat,
men with huge fucking wings...

1641
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:23,795
...have laid waste to St. Michael's!

1642
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,297
Bullets don't seem to affect them!

1643
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:29,968
The remainder of the crowd
have dropped to their knees...

1644
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,429
...identifying this
as the fabled apocalypse.

1645
01:37:32,596 --> 01:37:35,390
Now, I'm not a man of faith,
but I'm inclined to agree.

1646
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:39,686
God, please, don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer! God, no!

1647
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,521
No!

1648
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:50,947
You see that?
And I told them to keep a low profile.

1649
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,617
I'd be pissed, but in a couple minutes
it's not gonna matter anyway.

1650
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,710
Oh, now what was that
all about?

1651
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,378
What?

1652
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,964
Oh, nothing.

1653
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,216
I had something in my eye.

1654
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:13,053
Now who's the fucking child?

1655
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:17,432
What did you tell him,
to hit me with the golf club?

1656
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,851
Are you serious?
I'm a fucking demon.

1657
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,770
You'd have him assault me
with a putter?

1658
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,898
You want to play? Then we'll play.

1659
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:26,775
One side, Red.

1660
01:38:27,526 --> 01:38:30,446
Go ahead, then. Pick it up.
Call it a gift.

1661
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,866
Come on.

1662
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,451
That's it.

1663
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,496
Take a shot.

1664
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,166
Take your best fucking shot.

1665
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,670
Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Take it. Come on.

1666
01:38:47,297 --> 01:38:49,548
Come on, bright boy.

1667
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,809
Don't you know anything?

1668
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:17,201
Bethany, bless the sink!

1669
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:19,161
- What?
- Just do it!

1670
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,205
Bless the sink, damn it!

1671
01:39:45,565 --> 01:39:47,691
That's what you get, motherfucker.

1672
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:52,404
But I'm a fucking demon.

1673
01:39:59,745 --> 01:40:00,996
What just happened?

1674
01:40:01,164 --> 01:40:03,707
He said it himself:
"I'm a fucking demon."

1675
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:08,170
Hit a demon with an instrument of God,
the pure side will do the most damage.

1676
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:10,255
Holy shit!
Silent Bob's an instrument of God?

1677
01:40:10,423 --> 01:40:14,259
No, but Glick's the kind of asshole
who'd bless his clubs for a better game.

1678
01:40:14,427 --> 01:40:17,429
- But the sink?
- You've got the divine heritage.

1679
01:40:17,597 --> 01:40:19,681
Sanctifying is just
one of the fringe benefits.

1680
01:40:19,849 --> 01:40:22,392
Remind me to try the water-to-wine
thing at my next party.

1681
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,353
- How far away is this church?
- Three towns over, about 10 miles.

1682
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:27,522
- Rufus, grab the gun.
- Ten steps ahead of you.

1683
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:29,858
Take the bartender's car.
He won't need it.

1684
01:40:30,026 --> 01:40:33,278
The whole fucking world's against us,
dude, I swear to God.

1685
01:40:44,999 --> 01:40:46,708
Oh, my God.

1686
01:40:59,472 --> 01:41:02,141
And people wonder why
I don't go to church anymore.

1687
01:41:02,309 --> 01:41:03,476
Are we too late?

1688
01:41:03,644 --> 01:41:06,145
To save these poor schmucks?

1689
01:41:07,981 --> 01:41:09,023
Yeah.

1690
01:41:09,191 --> 01:41:11,776
But we still exist.

1691
01:41:11,944 --> 01:41:13,653
Where are they?

1692
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,239
They could already be
in the church.

1693
01:41:16,406 --> 01:41:18,449
So if they come out,
nobody touches them.

1694
01:41:18,617 --> 01:41:19,825
Are you fucking shitting me?

1695
01:41:19,993 --> 01:41:22,828
The brother is gonna shred them
with his angel-be-good special...

1696
01:41:22,996 --> 01:41:23,996
...ain't you, homey?

1697
01:41:24,164 --> 01:41:26,165
If they pass through that arch,
they're clean.

1698
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:28,251
And if they die, they go straight up.

1699
01:41:28,418 --> 01:41:30,753
And, hello!
We know what happens then, right?

1700
01:41:30,921 --> 01:41:33,172
- Why don't they kill themselves?
- It's a mortal sin.

1701
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:36,175
Die with a mortal sin and you burn.
They don't wanna go to hell.

1702
01:41:36,343 --> 01:41:40,012
Then what are we supposed to do,
wait for a solution to fall from the sky?

1703
01:41:44,309 --> 01:41:45,601
Friend of yours?

1704
01:41:45,769 --> 01:41:47,645
No, that was a cardinal.

1705
01:41:47,813 --> 01:41:51,524
You can't tell from his face,
but the rosaries are a dead giveaway.

1706
01:41:51,692 --> 01:41:54,193
It's one of them!
Kill that motherfucker!

1707
01:41:54,361 --> 01:41:55,528
Don't you listen?

1708
01:41:55,696 --> 01:41:58,614
- We can't touch him!
- I wasn't. I was gonna shoot his ass.

1709
01:41:58,782 --> 01:42:00,950
He's been at it for a while now.

1710
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:02,702
Please! Please!

1711
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:05,705
We ran out of parishioners...

1712
01:42:05,872 --> 01:42:10,167
...so he just started picking up folk
off the road and just dropping them.

1713
01:42:10,335 --> 01:42:13,462
This is just eons of repression
getting purged.

1714
01:42:14,506 --> 01:42:16,549
If only they'd let us jerk off,
you know?

1715
01:42:18,469 --> 01:42:19,720
Take a step back.

1716
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,517
Let me go!

1717
01:42:26,728 --> 01:42:28,895
Why? What are you trying to prove?

1718
01:42:29,063 --> 01:42:32,399
- All these people!
- Hey, this wasn't my idea!

1719
01:42:33,526 --> 01:42:34,860
Jesus Christ!

1720
01:42:36,237 --> 01:42:38,071
I just wanted to go home.

1721
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:40,032
But him, you know...

1722
01:42:40,199 --> 01:42:42,492
...he just lost it.

1723
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:45,746
He realized who you were
and what you were gonna have to do.

1724
01:42:45,913 --> 01:42:47,331
He just snapped.

1725
01:42:47,498 --> 01:42:51,001
And the funny thing is, this guy could
never even stand to see me work.

1726
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:54,212
He said he felt sorry
for you people.

1727
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,757
Now look at him.

1728
01:42:56,924 --> 01:42:58,925
This guy's fucking drunker
than hell.

1729
01:42:59,093 --> 01:43:01,511
Which means he's human now.

1730
01:43:02,930 --> 01:43:05,015
His wings have been cut off.

1731
01:43:05,516 --> 01:43:07,100
Loki...

1732
01:43:09,729 --> 01:43:11,438
Loki.

1733
01:43:11,606 --> 01:43:13,482
The muse?

1734
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:15,692
Oh, no way!

1735
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,570
I haven't seen you...
You look terrific.

1736
01:43:18,738 --> 01:43:20,781
What's with the tits? Can I...

1737
01:43:20,948 --> 01:43:23,116
Have you walked
through the arch yet?

1738
01:43:26,537 --> 01:43:30,040
Tell me. Have you gone in and
come out through the archway yet?

1739
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:31,458
No!

1740
01:43:36,882 --> 01:43:37,965
He's back.

1741
01:44:01,365 --> 01:44:03,282
We were awaiting your arrival.

1742
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:06,411
Bartleby, wait. Stop. Listen to me.

1743
01:44:06,578 --> 01:44:09,163
You can't go through with this.
Azrael was just using you.

1744
01:44:09,331 --> 01:44:10,498
If you go back...

1745
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,209
I've become aware
of the repercussions.

1746
01:44:13,377 --> 01:44:14,419
I know what I'm doing.

1747
01:44:15,963 --> 01:44:17,505
You sick, twisted fuck!

1748
01:44:19,174 --> 01:44:20,341
Bethany.

1749
01:44:23,595 --> 01:44:26,848
You, of all people, should understand
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

1750
01:44:27,015 --> 01:44:29,851
You too know what it feels like
to be cast aside.

1751
01:44:30,018 --> 01:44:33,020
But you've only dealt with the pain
a few years.

1752
01:44:33,188 --> 01:44:35,606
I've dealt with it for a millennia.

1753
01:44:35,774 --> 01:44:37,859
And while you never see
your ex-husband...

1754
01:44:38,026 --> 01:44:41,362
...or how blissful he is
with his new wife...

1755
01:44:42,322 --> 01:44:43,531
And he is.

1756
01:44:46,743 --> 01:44:51,457
- seeing you people every day on this
perfect world he created for you...

1757
01:44:51,624 --> 01:44:53,208
...is a constant reminder...

1758
01:44:53,376 --> 01:44:56,378
...that though my kind came first...

1759
01:44:56,546 --> 01:44:59,131
...your kind was most revered.

1760
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:02,134
And while you know forgiveness...

1761
01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:04,219
...we know only regret.

1762
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,055
The lesson must be taught.

1763
01:45:07,223 --> 01:45:08,974
All are accountable...

1764
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:10,392
...even God.

1765
01:45:11,728 --> 01:45:13,854
Soon a cadre of police will arrive...

1766
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:17,733
...just in time to kill us
as we exit the church.

1767
01:45:18,485 --> 01:45:21,904
Then this failed experiment
called existence...

1768
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:23,489
...will cease to be.

1769
01:45:23,656 --> 01:45:25,157
No. Hey. Hey!

1770
01:45:25,825 --> 01:45:27,743
No. No.

1771
01:45:27,911 --> 01:45:29,745
I can't let you do that, Bartleby.

1772
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:31,914
This has gone too far.

1773
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:36,418
I might have to take you down.

1774
01:45:37,921 --> 01:45:39,713
It's okay.

1775
01:45:39,881 --> 01:45:41,423
I'll do it.

1776
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:48,096
My compatriot.

1777
01:45:49,557 --> 01:45:51,975
Genocide takes a lot out of him.

1778
01:45:52,143 --> 01:45:53,352
He's weakened.

1779
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,853
You're weak.

1780
01:45:55,021 --> 01:45:57,773
More importantly,
he's also a human being...

1781
01:45:57,941 --> 01:46:00,067
...a condition which carries
two liabilities.

1782
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:03,696
A conscience...

1783
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:05,949
...and...

1784
01:46:08,953 --> 01:46:11,454
...a short life span.

1785
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:14,374
I'm sorry, old friend,
but you lost the faith.

1786
01:46:42,152 --> 01:46:44,070
Oh, my God. He's lost it.
We're fucked.

1787
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,447
- We're absolutely fucked!
- I hear that shit.

1788
01:46:47,908 --> 01:46:49,242
I can't believe this shit.

1789
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:51,995
We're on the brink of nonexistence
and God's still missing.

1790
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:55,123
- What kind of deity gets kidnapped?
- Amen to that.

1791
01:47:02,006 --> 01:47:04,132
What the hell are you doing?

1792
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,677
If the whole world's gonna end,
you said you'd fuck me.

1793
01:47:11,849 --> 01:47:14,684
- You're a pig.
- Nobody's gonna beat that thing.

1794
01:47:14,852 --> 01:47:18,354
We can lay here all comatose like that
John Doe Jersey bastard over there...

1795
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:21,358
...or we can get making with the love.
- What did you say?

1796
01:47:21,526 --> 01:47:23,527
Make with the love.
It's a nice way of saying boning.

1797
01:47:23,695 --> 01:47:25,154
No, about John Doe Jersey.

1798
01:47:29,034 --> 01:47:31,869
That guy they won't take off
life support, John Doe Jersey.

1799
01:47:32,037 --> 01:47:34,038
This is where he's at,
St. Michael's Hospital.

1800
01:47:35,707 --> 01:47:37,041
Where's the nearest boardwalk?

1801
01:47:37,208 --> 01:47:39,793
I ain't got time to win you a prize.
We gotta get to the fucking.

1802
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:42,338
- Where is it?
- Asbury Park, about five miles away.

1803
01:47:42,505 --> 01:47:44,381
- Have you been there?
- Once, with a chick.

1804
01:47:44,549 --> 01:47:47,551
We were about to fuck on the carousel
and I got sick, started puking.

1805
01:47:47,719 --> 01:47:49,511
- Do they have skeeball there?
- Yeah.

1806
01:47:53,016 --> 01:47:54,892
That's what I'm talking about.

1807
01:48:02,901 --> 01:48:05,903
Whatever you do, stall Bartleby
from going into that church.

1808
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:08,155
Bob, come with me. Come on!

1809
01:48:08,323 --> 01:48:10,908
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Think of something!

1810
01:48:11,076 --> 01:48:13,243
I already did, but it takes two of us!

1811
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,330
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1812
01:48:16,498 --> 01:48:18,165
This is the apocalypse.

1813
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:21,001
Please exit the hospital
in an orderly fashion.

1814
01:48:21,169 --> 01:48:22,836
Thank you.

1815
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,896
Hey, Big Bird!

1816
01:48:40,856 --> 01:48:42,440
Ready for the counting game?

1817
01:48:42,608 --> 01:48:44,192
No!

1818
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:49,197
Count the shells, Suck-a-Duck.

1819
01:49:17,435 --> 01:49:19,310
No more bullets.

1820
01:49:19,478 --> 01:49:21,604
Now, what the fuck
would you do that for?

1821
01:49:21,772 --> 01:49:24,607
Angels have to cut their wings off
to become human.

1822
01:49:24,775 --> 01:49:26,776
You just did him a favor, stupid!

1823
01:50:13,533 --> 01:50:16,202
I hope you're the skeeball type.

1824
01:50:57,369 --> 01:50:59,745
Oh, Bartleby.

1825
01:50:59,913 --> 01:51:03,499
Was Wisconsin really that bad?

1826
01:51:03,667 --> 01:51:05,668
Bow down, stupid!

1827
01:51:24,272 --> 01:51:26,189
I'm sorry.

1828
01:51:49,046 --> 01:51:51,715
Anyone who isn't dead
or from another plane of existence...

1829
01:51:51,883 --> 01:51:55,594
...would do well to cover their ears
right about now.

1830
01:51:55,761 --> 01:51:57,721
What the fuck?

1831
01:52:03,895 --> 01:52:05,896
Thank you.

1832
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:39,680
It never ends!

1833
01:52:59,409 --> 01:53:01,494
Get off of me.
I wanna see what's up.

1834
01:53:02,037 --> 01:53:04,038
What the fuck is this shit?

1835
01:53:04,206 --> 01:53:05,831
Who the fuck are you, Lady?

1836
01:53:05,999 --> 01:53:08,376
Why the fuck did you hug my head?

1837
01:53:08,543 --> 01:53:11,379
Quite a little mouth on him,
isn't there?

1838
01:53:11,546 --> 01:53:14,382
What the fuck is this, The Piano?
Why ain't this broad talking?

1839
01:53:14,549 --> 01:53:19,845
I believe the answers that you seek
lie within my companion's eyes.

1840
01:53:20,013 --> 01:53:23,182
What the fuck does that mean?
Has everyone gone fucking nuts?

1841
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:26,227
What the fuck happened
to that guy's head? I want some...

1842
01:53:43,871 --> 01:53:45,539
Where was she?

1843
01:53:46,249 --> 01:53:48,166
Imprisoned in a body.

1844
01:53:48,334 --> 01:53:51,670
Bethany figured it all out.
She's a clever girl, that one.

1845
01:53:52,714 --> 01:53:54,256
Hang on a minute.

1846
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:30,709
You missed a bit.

1847
01:54:32,253 --> 01:54:35,130
Well, then, you ready
to go back, apostle?

1848
01:54:35,298 --> 01:54:37,632
You ready to make those changes
I been talking about?

1849
01:54:37,967 --> 01:54:40,552
We'll see. Muse?

1850
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,180
Seeing as how you
just had to get involved...

1851
01:54:43,347 --> 01:54:45,557
...you're welcome
to return with us as well.

1852
01:54:45,725 --> 01:54:48,518
First I gotta say goodbye to Bethany.
Where is she?

1853
01:54:48,686 --> 01:54:50,103
Oh, no.

1854
01:55:11,335 --> 01:55:13,795
Metatron, is she...?

1855
01:55:13,962 --> 01:55:16,172
Afraid so.

1856
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:20,218
One of the drawbacks to being
a martyr is that you have to die.

1857
01:55:20,385 --> 01:55:22,345
But no matter.

1858
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:34,774
All is being taken care of.

1859
01:55:35,526 --> 01:55:37,235
How so?

1860
01:55:38,028 --> 01:55:41,155
Wax on, wax off.

1861
01:56:04,721 --> 01:56:05,805
How did I...?

1862
01:56:05,973 --> 01:56:07,557
She can rebuild you.

1863
01:56:07,724 --> 01:56:09,226
She has the technology.

1864
01:56:09,394 --> 01:56:13,397
She can make you better,
stronger, faster.

1865
01:56:19,404 --> 01:56:20,737
That's...

1866
01:56:21,781 --> 01:56:24,575
A very relieved deity.

1867
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:28,662
You did well, little girl.
I knew you'd come around.

1868
01:56:29,205 --> 01:56:31,165
Your kind always does.

1869
01:56:32,417 --> 01:56:34,835
So you might wanna
take good care of yourself.

1870
01:56:35,003 --> 01:56:37,671
We're gonna need you
down the road.

1871
01:56:37,839 --> 01:56:40,716
I know. I'm the last scion.

1872
01:56:42,927 --> 01:56:46,013
Well, you're half right.

1873
01:56:46,181 --> 01:56:49,099
You were the last scion.

1874
01:56:50,894 --> 01:56:52,603
But now...

1875
01:56:53,313 --> 01:56:54,855
...this...

1876
01:56:55,607 --> 01:56:57,608
...is the last scion.

1877
01:57:00,737 --> 01:57:02,654
I'm pregnant?

1878
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,117
Can't put anything past you.

1879
01:57:10,455 --> 01:57:12,956
Take care of that parcel for us.

1880
01:57:13,124 --> 01:57:16,960
She has a world of work
ahead of her.

1881
01:57:28,474 --> 01:57:30,433
Thank you for...

1882
01:57:30,601 --> 01:57:32,477
...I don't know...

1883
01:57:32,645 --> 01:57:33,811
...everything.

1884
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,985
God, there's a million things
I wish I could ask you...

1885
01:57:41,153 --> 01:57:43,154
...most of it questioning
your great plan...

1886
01:57:43,322 --> 01:57:45,156
...and that'd be arrogant of me,
I know.

1887
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:48,076
But there is one I need to ask.

1888
01:57:48,244 --> 01:57:51,788
I'm sure you get it all the time, but
how many chances like this will I get?

1889
01:57:53,832 --> 01:57:55,667
Why are we here?

1890
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:15,270
Didn't I tell you she was funny?

1891
01:58:22,152 --> 01:58:24,696
I really enjoyed meeting you.

1892
01:58:25,489 --> 01:58:27,615
It was an honor.

1893
01:58:32,329 --> 01:58:35,581
You did so well.

1894
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:42,798
I told you she was a woman.

1895
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:47,094
She's not really a woman.

1896
01:58:47,262 --> 01:58:49,638
She's not really anything.

1897
01:58:49,806 --> 01:58:51,890
She's something, all right.

1898
01:58:52,642 --> 01:58:54,810
Crisis of faith over?

1899
01:58:54,978 --> 01:58:57,813
I think I'm now burdened
with an overabundance.

1900
01:58:57,981 --> 01:58:59,815
When it rains, it pours.

1901
01:58:59,983 --> 01:59:02,192
Are you saying you believe?

1902
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,404
No. But I have a good idea.

1903
01:59:05,572 --> 01:59:07,156
Yes.

1904
01:59:10,994 --> 01:59:12,786
The man was right about you.

1905
01:59:12,954 --> 01:59:15,956
Now I'm gonna go home
and tell him so.

1906
01:59:16,875 --> 01:59:18,751
And if you clean up your language...

1907
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:21,253
...I just might put in
a good word for you too.

1908
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:23,339
Thanks.

1909
01:59:24,883 --> 01:59:27,426
Why don't you name the kid
after me?

1910
01:59:29,804 --> 01:59:31,555
Rufus.

1911
01:59:58,042 --> 02:00:00,418
Yo, we should go to Quick Stop.

1912
02:00:05,257 --> 02:00:07,133
You guys wanna
hear something sick?

1913
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:10,136
- I got half a stalk when she kissed me.
- Jay!

1914
02:00:10,304 --> 02:00:12,639
I couldn't help it. The bitch was hot.

1915
02:00:12,807 --> 02:00:17,268
You can't talk to me that way anymore.
I'm gonna be somebody's mother.

1916
02:00:17,436 --> 02:00:18,895
You're pregnant?

1917
02:00:20,564 --> 02:00:24,025
Yo, I heard pregnant women can
have sex into their third trimester.

1918
02:00:24,193 --> 02:00:26,111
I'll keep that in mind.

1919
02:08:06,119 --> 02:08:10,038
So that would make Bethany
part black?
