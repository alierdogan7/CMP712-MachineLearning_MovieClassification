[Man Narrating]
In ancient times, the land
lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:41,844
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,725
Back then, man and beast
lived in harmony,

4
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:51,924
but as time went by, most
of the great forests were destroyed.

5
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:56,722
Those that remained were guarded
by gigantic beasts...

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,560
who owed their allegiance
to the Great Forest Spirit,

7
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:04,400
for those were the days
of gods and demons.

8
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:08,604
[Rustling, Growling]

9
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:46,678
Yakul! Come on, boy.
[Grunts]

10
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,835
- Girls!
- Ashitaka!

11
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,280
There's something strange going on.
You have to hurry.

12
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,356
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

13
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,322
- We just came from Ji-san.
- Did he see something?

14
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,202
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

15
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,923
- The birds have gone.
- The animals too.

16
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,757
I'll go to the watchtower
and check with Ji-san.

17
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:02,756
You three hurry back home
and be quick about it.

18
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,676
All right.
Be careful!

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,638
Huh?

20
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,720
[Rumbling]

21
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,795
Something's there.

22
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:51,684
- Ji-san, did you see it too?
- I did. It isn't human.

23
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,235
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

24
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,202
There. Look.

25
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,315
- It's some kind of demon!
- A demon?

26
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,034
[Roaring]

27
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:50,078
Run, Yakul! Run!

[Screaming]

29
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,759
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

30
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:18,518
Prince Ashitaka, wait!
Be careful!

31
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,914
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

32
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,042
Here, Yakul!
[Whistles]

33
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:47,363
Calm your fury, o mighty lord!

34
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:52,599
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

35

[Shouting]

36
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,240
- The monster!
- Come on!

37
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:14,603
Go back! Please!
Leave our village alone!

38
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,516
Stop! Please! Stop!

- He killed it!
- Ashitaka!

46
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,994
- Fetch the wise woman!
- Don't put the fire out yet.

47
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:23,714
- [Groaning]
- Ashitaka!

48
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,636
Are you all right?

49
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:29,274
- Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.
- The prince has been hurt.

50
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,481
- Where is the wise woman?
- [Man] Here she comes!

51
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,159
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

52
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:39,035
- What shall we do?
- Take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.

53
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,437
- All right.
- [Groans]

[Laboured Breathing]

55
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:55,601
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

56
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:58,563
I bow before you.

57
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:03,924
A mound will be raised and
funeral rites performed on this
ground where you have fallen.

58
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,678
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

59
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:10,121
Disgusting little creatures,

60
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:12,878
soon all of you
will feel my hate...

61
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:17,481
and suffer
as I have suffered.

62
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,558

[Rattling Continues]

66
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:56,881
I'm afraid this is very bad.

67
00:07:56,964 --> 00:08:00,718
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

68
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:04,638
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad,

69
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:08,194
a poisonous hatred that consumed
his heart and flesh...

70
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,640
and turned him
into a demon monster.

71
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,318
- Prince Ashitaka?
- Yes?

72
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,441
Show everyone
your right arm.

73
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,556
- [Gasping]
- What's it mean?

74
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,080
My prince, are you
prepared to learn...

75
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,632
what fate the stones
have foretold you?

76
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:35,239
Yes, I was prepared
the very moment that
I let my arrow fly.

77
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:37,155
Mmm.

78
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:41,476
The infection will spread
throughout your whole body,
bone and flesh alike.

79
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:46,001
It will cause you great pain
and then kill you.

80
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,915
Is there no way
we can stop it?

81
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,394
The prince got that wound
by defending our village
and saving our lives!

82
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,679
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

83
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:57,279
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

84
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:00,720
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

85
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:02,681
Look at this.

86
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:07,519
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

87
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,674
This is what hurt him so.

88
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:14,280
It shattered his bones and
burned its way deep inside him.

89
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:17,117
This is what turned him
into a demon.

90
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:21,914
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

91
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:26,395
It's your fate to go there
and see what you can see
with eyes unclouded by hate.

92
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,282
You may find a way
to lift the curse.

93
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:31,195
- You understand?
- Yes.

94
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,516
We are the last
of the Emishi.

95
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:39,313
It's 500 years since the Emperor
destroyed our tribe...

96
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:42,874
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

97
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:46,240
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

98
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:51,444
but the blood of our tribe
has grown thinner and weaker
with each generation.

99
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,518
Now our last prince must
cut his hair and leave us,
never to return?

100
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:59,596
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

101
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:16,077
Our laws forbid us from watching you go,
Ashitaka.

102
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,634
Whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever.

103
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,476
Farewell.

104
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:51,115
- Ashitaka!
- Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

105
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,081
Do you think
I care about that?

106
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,439
I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

107
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,881
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

108
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:05,036
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

109
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,322
You must take it with you.
Please, I want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.

110
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:13,033
Kaya, you know I could
never forget you.

No. A massacre.

Where are you going?
Come back here, you coward!

- My arm! What's happening to me?
- Stop him!

124
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,884
Hurry! Stop him
before he gets away!

125
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,353
Let me pass!
I'm warning you!

126
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,115

- [Man] Who's that?
- [Man #2] I've never seen him.

131
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:07,353
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

[Child]
Mommy! Look!

133
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:13,161
There he is now.

134
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:17,994
[Man]
I wouldn't get too close to him.

135
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,678
- Will this be enough?
- Hey! What are you trying to pull?

136
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:23,915
This isn't money.
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

137
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:27,280
- Excuse me, but might I inspect that?
- Go ahead.

138
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:30,162
Mmm? My God!

139
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,042
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

140
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:37,561
However, if it's money you want,
I'll pay for the rice and take
this nugget off your hands.

141
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,521
What do ya say?

142
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:42,676
My good people, is there
a money changer who could
tell us how much this is worth?

143
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,834
No? All right.

144
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:48,439
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags
of rice at least.

145
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,516
That's right, maybe even more.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

146
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,435
Where are you going?
Give me my gold!

147
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,913
Hey! You can't
just rush off now.

148
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,234
We've only just met.

149
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:00,963
We have got your rice,
and everything's fine.

150
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:03,478
You're a man of few words.
I understand.

151
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:06,317
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

152
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,793
In fact, I should be
thanking you, really.

153
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:11,352
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

154
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,153
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

155
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,200
I see you noticed
we're being followed.

156
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,514
That's what we get for waving that
gold nugget around.

157
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:23,119
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

158
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:28,915
What to you say we give 'em
a little demonstration
of how fast we can run, huh?

159
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:40,599
So the demon monster turned out to be
a giant boar.

160
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:43,118
I followed its trail westward through
the mountains...

161
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,354
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers.

162
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,594
- But then...
- You lost it. That's life.

163
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,720
See this place here?

164
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:53,922
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

165
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:57,121
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide or a fire.

166
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,798
The only sure thing
is that everybody's dead.

167
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,913
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

168
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,598
dead from wars,

00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:31,001
That's just great!
How are you gonna drive the ox
now all banged up and mangled?

337
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:33,040
- But, my little flower...
- You scared me half to death.

338
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,354
Don't you "little flower" me.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

339
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:38,004
Then maybe I could have
found a real husband!

340
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:40,393
Sweetness, can we
discuss this later?

341
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:44,193
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

342
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:47,594
And as for you, Gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,

343
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:50,482
always strutting and
throwing your weight around
once the danger's over.

344
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,395
You never do a lick
of work around here.

345
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,315
That's unfair and untrue.

346
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:57,680
Thanks, stranger.
My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

347
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:02,633
That's a relief. I was starting
to think I'd done something
wrong by bringing him back home.

348
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:05,682
[Laughing]

349
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:09,279
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

350
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,195
[Woman] Gonza?

351
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,514
Bring the stranger
to me later.

352
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,754
I would like
to thank him personally.

353
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:18,483
- Kohroku.
- Uh, yes?

354
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:22,034
- I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
- Uh, okay.

355
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:24,354
Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

356
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,355
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

357
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:31,154
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

358
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:33,838
Oh, that's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

359
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:38,634
the wolves would have eaten
everyone, and then we'd all have
to find ourselves new husbands.

360
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:43,161
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

361
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:49,233
Oh, hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

362
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:52,760
[Pounding]

363
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:58,558
[Pounding Continues]

364
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:02,404
- Pull!
- [Grunting]

365
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:10,757
[Chattering]

366
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:18,480
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

367
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,395
Just dish it out!

368
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,952
- [Chattering]
- There he is!

369
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,080
- Where is he?
- Over there in the back.

370
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:27,359
Toki was right.
He is handsome.

371
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,400
- Yeah, not bad.
- But he's so young!

372
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:32,874
- That never stopped you before.
- [Women Laughing]

373
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,795
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

374
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,114
Yeah, there's lots of
gorgeous men in here, honey!

375
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,115
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

376
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,843
Listen, stranger.
Why don't you come over to our place?

377
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,801
You don't want to stay
in this stinking old barn.

378
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:46,398
Look, woman! We risked our lives
to bring you the rice...

379
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:48,361
you're all eating tonight,
so watch your mouth.

380
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,595
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice, huh? Tell me that.

381
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:54,881
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

382
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,717
Actually, if it's not too much
trouble, ladies, I would like
to see where you work.

383
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,682
- You would?
- We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

384
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,595
Lend me your lipstick.

385
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,515
- Don't be a stranger.
- Don't forget now.

386
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:06,435
We'll be waiting for you.

387
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:11,234
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

388
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,997
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

389
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,279
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

390
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:19,834
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

391
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:22,757
Women like that... It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

392
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:27,201
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract of
every brothel girl she can find.

393
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,559
Milady has a kind heart,
that's all.

394
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,521
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

395
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:34,914
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

396
00:33:35,004 --> 00:33:37,996
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

397
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,156
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

398
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:43,883
- Who's Nago?
- "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.

399
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,795
He used to rule
this whole forest.

400
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:48,603
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

401
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,959
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,

402
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,875
starin' at a bunch
of angry boars.

403
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,637
Mm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

404
00:33:55,724 --> 00:34:00,718
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain, but Nago
wasn't gonna stand for that.

405
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:04,558
The problem was, before
we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

406
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,475
and that's what
made the boar angry.

407
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:10,477
[Screaming]

408
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:17,800
[Screaming]

409
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:21,960
[Laughing]

410
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:24,842
He's feeling no pain.

411
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,915
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

412
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:41,602
[Shrieking]

413
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:57,834
Young man, what's wrong?

414
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:03,116
Is something
hurting your arm?

415
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:06,514
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

416
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,199
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

417
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,438
[Hammering Continues]

418
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:18,403
Forgive me for keeping you
waiting, stranger.

419
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,315
That's good iron.

420
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:24,033
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

421
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,955
Let's have a rest.

422
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:29,002
- You may tell the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

423
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:32,679
Some think you're either a spy
for the Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano
and his samurai.

424
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:36,518
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

425
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,640
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

426
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,673
I believe
you'll recognize this.

427
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:49,756
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

428
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:52,438
rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.

429
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:55,800
I fought with him,
and for that I was cursed
with this mark on my arm,

430
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:57,715
and soon it will kill me.

431
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:01,558
Where is it you come from?
I've never seen a red elk
like that before.

432
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:06,593
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

433
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:09,756
[Growls] Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

434
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:12,404
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

435
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:16,159
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

436
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:20,954
"Eyes unclouded"?
[Laughing]

437
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,393
That explains it.

438
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:26,952
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

439
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:30,002
- Is that wise, milady?
- Gonza, take over for me.

440
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:33,042
Oh. [Grunts]

441
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,955
[Chattering]

442
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:10,116
[Grunting]

443
00:37:28,364 --> 00:37:31,640
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

444
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:36,400
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

445
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:44,916
- [Clucking]
- Good evening.

446
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:50,794
[Chattering, Laughing]

447
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:54,394
[Woman] We've only just
finished it, milady.

448
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,520
It's still too heavy.

449
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:58,481
Perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?

450
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:01,362
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

451
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,594
I trust you to figure it out.

452
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:06,437
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

453
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:08,401
[Woman]
That'll be something to see.

454
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:11,874
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

455
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,159
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

456
00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:19,159
These will kill
forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

457
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:22,202
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

458
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,957
I'm sorry to have
to push you all so hard.

459
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:27,717
- I'll have wine sent down later.
- Oh, that'll be nice.

460
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:32,355
First you steal
the boar's forest from him and
then transform him into a demon.

461
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,639
Now you're making
even deadlier weapons!

462
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:37,318
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

463
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:40,874
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,
and I'm sorry that you suffer.

464
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,795
I truly am.

465
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:45,956
That brainless pig.
I'm the one he should have
put a curse on, not you.

466
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:57,324
[Grunting]

467
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:58,883
- No!
- [Gasping]

468
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:05,840
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

469
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:08,916
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

470
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,154
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

471
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:14,156
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

472
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:18,123
Milady, Osa has
something to say.

473
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:22,273
Forgive me, milady.

474
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:25,800
You must not make light
of the boy's strength.

475
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:29,797
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

476
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:32,034
and grief and helplessness.

477
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:36,754
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

478
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:41,634
She is the only one
who saw us as human beings.

479
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:45,842
We are lepers.
The world hates and fears us,

480
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:49,997
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

481
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:53,520
- [Coughing]
- Osa?

482
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,720
Life is suffering.

483
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:57,999
It is hard.
The world is cursed,

484
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:03,112
but still, you find reasons
to keep living.

485
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

486
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:08,042
[Wolf Howling]

487
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,833
Oh, they just keep coming back.

488
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,438
Every night they're
out there planting trees,

489
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:30,719
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

490
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:34,080
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

491
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,315
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

492
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:41,716
Without that ancient god the
animals here would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

493
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,079
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

494
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:46,917
this desolate place will be
the richest land in the world,

495
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,835
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

496
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,994
Princess Mononoke?

497
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:54,793
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

498
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:57,079
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

[Ringing]

500
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:06,002
The legends say the blood
of the Great Forest's Spirit
can heal anything.

501
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:08,552
Perhaps it could cure
my poor lepers.

502
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:11,442
Might even be able to lift
your curse, Ashitaka.

503
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:15,119
Milady! How does the action feel to you?
Better?

504
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,957
Smooth as silk, the perfect
thing for ruling the world.

505
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,274
- Ah!
- It's still too heavy for the girls.

506
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,195
All right.

- Well, look who's here.

511
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:53,122
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

512
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:56,719
- Well, I guess so.
- [Grunts]

513
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:59,602
- Excuse me. May I try it?
- Huh?

514
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,118
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

518
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,034
Well, that won't be long.

519
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:20,763
Oops! Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

520
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:23,802
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

521
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:26,114
- It's hard work, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

522
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,718
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

523
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:31,272
You must lead hard lives here.

524
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:35,915
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city, huh?

525
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:39,440
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

526
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,756
- Unless we want 'em to!

- No!
- But you can't leave tomorrow.

531
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:28,314
- Can't you stay a little longer?
- You can stay and work here.

532
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:31,998
Thank you all, but there's
someone I have to find
out there in the forest.

00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:28,996
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

544
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,682
Here! She's here!

545
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,402
- She's on the roof
- Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

546
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:38,759

- Toki, she's on the roof.
- [Gasping]

551
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:57,598
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

552
00:44:57,683 --> 00:44:59,719
Whatever happens, we can't
let those fires go out.

553
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:01,998
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

554
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,119
She can't escape.
We have her cornered.

555
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,433
You know she means
to kill you this time.

556
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:08,673

Come on.

Can you hear me,
Princess of Beasts?

560
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,872
If it's me you want,
here I am.

561
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:24,352
If you seek revenge for
all the animals we've killed,

562
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:27,594
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

563
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,073
They want revenge as well for
husbands killed by your wolves.

Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

Stay back.

580

Cut off a wolf's head,
and it still has the power to bite.

This is what it does
when it catches hold of you.

00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,676
It's eating me alive,

this morning. Now I'm going
to leave the same way.

Tell me while you're still alive.

00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:58,555
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

670
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:02,602
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

671
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:05,959
I knew that from
the first moment I saw you.

672
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:10,514
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

674
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:16,312
That woman is evil, and there's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:18,712
No. Live.

676
00:53:18,803 --> 00:53:21,192
That's enough! I'm not
listening to you any more!

All right!
What do you want here?

683
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:50,593
Apes, how dare you show such
disrespect to the wolf clan.

684
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:53,755
This is our forest.

685
00:53:53,843 --> 00:53:56,232
The human...
give him to us.

686
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:58,518
Give us the human and go.

687
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:01,401
You go before
my fangs find you.

688
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:05,954
- We will not go.
- We will eat the human.

689
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:09,274
Yes, let us eat
the man creature.

690
00:54:09,363 --> 00:54:13,242
Are you crazy?
Just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

691
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:15,837
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

692
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:19,677
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

693
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:22,038
and we will drive
the other humans away.

694
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:23,954
Give us
the man creature.

695
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:28,241
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

696
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:30,439
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

697
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,354
something even worse
than human.

698
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:38,040
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.
The forest does not come back.

we will save the forest.

You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

Go on planting your trees
and someday we'll beat them.

702
00:54:48,283 --> 00:54:53,311
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

I'll stay here and deal with the human.

- What about the elk?
- Yes.

Can we eat him?

Quick, you idiots.
It's the Nightwalker.

You'd risk everything
on one last battle?

834
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:11,720
That's just
what the humans want.

835
01:09:11,803 --> 01:09:15,682
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

836
01:09:15,763 --> 01:09:17,594
Even if every one of us dies,

837
01:09:17,683 --> 01:09:21,835
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.

- Hyah! Hyah!

843
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:05,916
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

[Shouting]

845
01:10:08,363 --> 01:10:12,402
Get ready now.
Little bit closer. Fire!

Attack...

849
01:10:26,883 --> 01:10:28,521
Ready...

850
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:38,072
Well, I see somebody
is going to have to go
play the peacemaker.

851
01:10:38,163 --> 01:10:40,199
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

852
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:42,114
Yes, sir.

853
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:47,152
- Let's go.
- And stay there
till I send for you.

854
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,519
Come on! Let's keep the oxen moving!
We have to get back to Irontown!

855
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:01,954
- There they are!
- Where?

856
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:04,511
Coming around the pass.

857
01:11:07,003 --> 01:11:09,563
The hunters are ready, sir.

858
01:11:09,643 --> 01:11:11,713
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

859
01:11:11,803 --> 01:11:14,920
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

860
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:16,994
Yes, sir.

861
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:20,994
Greetings, Jigo.

862
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,472
Well, I've got the Emperor
breathing down my neck,

863
01:11:23,563 --> 01:11:25,918
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

864
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:29,916
And you would have nothing to do
with Lord Asano being here,
now, would you?

865
01:11:30,003 --> 01:11:32,358
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

866
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:35,116
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

867
01:11:35,203 --> 01:11:37,034
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

868
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:40,195
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

869
01:11:40,283 --> 01:11:43,400
Listen, Eboshi, the boars
are gathering for battle.
And you know what that means.

870
01:11:43,483 --> 01:11:47,112
You made me a promise.
Now, once you get me
the head of the Forest Spirit,

871
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:50,115
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together, huh?

872
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:53,593
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

873
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:01,473
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

874
01:12:01,563 --> 01:12:05,795
- We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:10,035
- Welcome back, milady!

[Whinnying]

878
01:12:16,523 --> 01:12:19,401
Lady Eboshi,
mistress of Irontown!

879
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:21,792
I bring a message to you
from my Lord Asano.

880
01:12:21,883 --> 01:12:27,480
You have fought valiantly and well.
Now, open your gates
that we may speak with you.

881
01:12:27,563 --> 01:12:29,713
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

882
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,113
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

883
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:35,433
And now that it's worth
something, you want it!

884
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:37,639
- Well, you won't get it!
- The brazen impudence!

885
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,554
You ladies need to be
taught some respect!

886
01:12:39,643 --> 01:12:41,474
Respect? What's that?

887
01:12:41,563 --> 01:12:44,282
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

[Laughs]
They are really something.

893
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:01,515
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

894
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:05,482
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

895
01:13:07,003 --> 01:13:09,119
Impressive for
a piece of paper.

896
01:13:09,203 --> 01:13:12,559
Well, you know, it's gotten me all
the best hunters and trappers around.

897
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:15,077
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

898
01:13:15,163 --> 01:13:16,994
Girls, come here.

899
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,074
Yes, milady, what is it?

900
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:23,315
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?
From the Emperor himself.

901
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,917
- That's nice. Who's he?
- Is he supposed to be important?

902
01:13:26,003 --> 01:13:29,962
- I'm serious. Who's he? Should we know?
- Yes! They're really something.

903
01:13:30,043 --> 01:13:32,079
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

904
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:33,994
Yes, milady.

905
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:38,793
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron, the forest
and its creatures grow weaker.

906
01:13:38,883 --> 01:13:41,192
My way, there is
no loss of life, Jigo.

907
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,797
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

908
01:13:43,883 --> 01:13:48,161
When you needed riflemen,
I sent them, and without those riflemen,
you lose Irontown.

909
01:13:48,243 --> 01:13:50,313
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

910
01:13:50,403 --> 01:13:52,678
Don't tell me
the Emperor believes...

911
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:56,073
that wives' tale about
the Great Spirit's head
granting immortality.

912
01:13:56,163 --> 01:13:59,678
I'm sure I don't know
what the Emperor believes.

913
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:01,594
I'm just a humble monk.
I'm just trying to get by.

914
01:14:01,683 --> 01:14:05,756
I keep my promises.
Anyway, we have fought the boars before.

915
01:14:05,843 --> 01:14:08,562
They're much easier to kill
than Moro and her wolf cubs,

916
01:14:08,643 --> 01:14:13,159
So you can call out
that shady bunch you've got
hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

917
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:16,997
[Laughs]
So I've been found out.

918
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,199
Oh, just one more thing, milady.

919
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:22,559
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

920
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,874
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

921
01:14:25,963 --> 01:14:29,000
Came and went.

922
01:14:45,923 --> 01:14:48,039
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

923
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:50,159
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

924
01:14:50,243 --> 01:14:52,074
- They're killers.
- Killers?

925
01:14:52,163 --> 01:14:54,472
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

926
01:14:54,563 --> 01:14:56,394
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

927
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:59,441
What if something goes wrong
and we're stuck here?
We can't help you.

928
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:01,479
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

929
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,238
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

930
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:08,395
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

931
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:12,396
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

932
01:15:12,483 --> 01:15:14,792
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head...

933
01:15:14,883 --> 01:15:16,919
or will he be after
my ironworks as well?

934
01:15:17,003 --> 01:15:19,722
Jigo's riflemen
may turn on us.

935
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:23,113
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

936
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:25,637
Remember,
you can't trust men.

937
01:15:25,723 --> 01:15:27,679
Don't worry
about her ladyship.

938
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:29,913
I'll be right at her side,
protecting her.

939
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,312
- That's what we're afraid of.
- What?

940
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,236
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

- [Moro] You know,
you could always jump, boy.

955
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:47,192
End it all.

956
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:52,198
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

957
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:55,719
It feels like I must
have been asleep for weeks.

958
01:16:55,803 --> 01:16:58,920
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

959
01:16:59,003 --> 01:17:02,120
I was hoping you'd cry out
in your sleep.

960
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:05,240
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

961
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:09,475
It's a beautiful forest. Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

962
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:12,794
Yes, the boars are marching.

963
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:16,671
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

964
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:20,722
I lie here.
I listen to the pain of the forest...

965
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,636
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest...

966
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:28,319
and dream of the day when I will
finally crunch that gun woman's
head in my jaws.

967
01:17:28,403 --> 01:17:32,112
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

968
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:34,080
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

969
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:36,996
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

970
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,233
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

971
01:17:39,323 --> 01:17:42,599
And what happens to San?
What's your plan,
to let her die with you?

972
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:46,392
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

973
01:17:46,483 --> 01:17:50,237
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

974
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:52,678
When the forest dies,
so does she.

975
01:17:52,763 --> 01:17:55,277
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

976
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:57,479
Silence, boy.

977
01:17:57,563 --> 01:18:00,475
How dare you speak
to a god like that.

978
01:18:00,563 --> 01:18:04,033
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

979
01:18:04,123 --> 01:18:06,796
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

980
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:09,955
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

981
01:18:10,043 --> 01:18:14,798
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

982
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:17,522
How could you help her?

983
01:18:17,603 --> 01:18:20,561
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

984
01:18:20,643 --> 01:18:23,760
[Laughing] How?

985
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:27,438
Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

986
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:30,799
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

987
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:34,114
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

988
01:18:34,203 --> 01:18:36,797
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

989
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:41,115
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

Oh. Ah. [Grunts]

1000
01:20:06,603 --> 01:20:10,437
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak, huh?

1001
01:20:38,203 --> 01:20:41,957
It's so quiet. I wonder where
our friends the little kodama went.

1003

Ah. I can smell the ironworks.

01:20:57,403 --> 01:21:02,841
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!

1005
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:05,801
Will you please give this
to San for me?

1006

It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

1009
01:21:46,563 --> 01:21:50,761
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

1010
01:21:50,843 --> 01:21:52,674
It's that damn woman again.

She knows we're out here.

- It's a trap and a stupid one.
- What?

1014
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:09,562
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

1015
01:22:09,643 --> 01:22:12,999
- No.
- The humans are planning something.

1016
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:16,837
Then we have to find Okkoto
while there's still time to stop
him or else they'll be killed!

1017
01:22:16,923 --> 01:22:20,996
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

1018
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:25,395
They may even know it's a trap.
The boars are a proud race.

- To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

Lord Asano's samurai thought
they'd try and ambush us
while our men were away.

She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

get a message to Lady Eboshi.

- We haven't got a lot of time.
- Those samurai bastards.

for us to leave Irontown.

Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

to stop her, call her back.

- The forest is too big!

a chance of finding her!

When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

as bait to lure the boars in.

or saving your town?

Those riflemen with milady
belong to Jigo.

1159
01:34:19,123 --> 01:34:22,638
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

1160
01:34:24,563 --> 01:34:27,680
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

1161
01:34:30,803 --> 01:34:33,271
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

1162
01:34:43,763 --> 01:34:47,995
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

1163
01:34:51,283 --> 01:34:53,797
- Sir.
- Yes? Ah, have you spotted them?

1164
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:55,714
Okkoto's badly wounded.

1165
01:34:55,803 --> 01:34:58,601
He and the Wolf Girl
are making their way to
the realm of the Forest Spirit.

1166
01:34:58,683 --> 01:35:02,437
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they?
Keep after them,

1167
01:35:02,523 --> 01:35:05,640
but stay out of sight or you'll
frighten the Forest Spirit away.

1168
01:35:05,723 --> 01:35:07,679
Yes, sir. I understand.

1169
01:35:07,763 --> 01:35:10,994
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

1170
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:14,393
Uh-huh, a little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

[Laboured Breathing]

1172
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:23,313
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

1173
01:35:23,403 --> 01:35:26,236
Just a little farther.
Keep going.

1174
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:37,439
[Gasps, Groans]

1175
01:35:40,243 --> 01:35:44,031
- [Rustling]
- What was that?

1176
01:35:47,003 --> 01:35:49,312
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

1177
01:35:49,403 --> 01:35:53,715
- Something's out there.
- What? With so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

1178
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:55,634
- [Rustling]
- [Gasps]

1179
01:35:56,923 --> 01:36:00,472
[Gasps, Grunts]
I should have known it was you!

1180
01:36:00,563 --> 01:36:04,556
- You did this!
- Because of you, the forest will die!

1181
01:36:04,643 --> 01:36:08,875
You're wrong!
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?

1182
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:13,673
- You bring bad things!
- Bad things coming,
neither human or animal.

1183
01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:17,119
- What do you mean,
"neither human or animal"?
- [Squeaking]

1184
01:36:17,203 --> 01:36:19,034
[Squeaking]

1185
01:36:22,483 --> 01:36:24,792
- They're coming!
- It's the end for us!

[Gasps]

1187
01:36:42,403 --> 01:36:46,715
- They're warriors.
- [Sniffing]

1188
01:36:46,803 --> 01:36:49,271
They've come back.

1189
01:36:49,363 --> 01:36:52,719
- [Gasps]
- My warriors!

1190
01:36:52,803 --> 01:36:56,239
They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

1191
01:36:56,323 --> 01:36:59,474
[Roars]

1192
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:01,872
- Forward, my warriors!
- Okkoto, listen!

1193
01:37:01,963 --> 01:37:04,477
- Forward to the pool
of the Forest Spirit!
- Okkoto, no, wait!

- [Gasps]
- [Growling]

1195
01:37:10,603 --> 01:37:14,835
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

1196
01:37:19,163 --> 01:37:23,395
Those are humans wearing
the skins of your warriors
to hide their scent!

1197
01:37:23,483 --> 01:37:25,599
It's a trick!

1198
01:37:25,683 --> 01:37:30,393
Don't you understand?
It's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

1199
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:32,280
[San Gasps]

1200
01:37:34,283 --> 01:37:38,481
Come out, Forest Spirit!
If you are truly master here,

1201
01:37:38,563 --> 01:37:42,841
give my warriors the power to slay
the humans and be victorious!

1202
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:45,721
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

1203
01:37:45,803 --> 01:37:49,557
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

1204
01:37:49,643 --> 01:37:52,441
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

1205
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:56,755
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

1206
01:37:56,843 --> 01:37:59,596
She'll know what to do.

1207
01:37:59,683 --> 01:38:04,473
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

1208
01:38:04,563 --> 01:38:07,077
Go on now.

1209

Stay back or you die!

1212
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:29,719
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

[Grunting]

1218
01:38:54,323 --> 01:39:00,000
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

[Screams]

1220
01:39:02,563 --> 01:39:05,441
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon!

01:39:07,283 --> 01:39:10,593
Lord Okkoto!
[Groans]

1222
01:39:10,683 --> 01:39:12,321

[Wolf Howling]

1224
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,751
- Is it San?
- She's in danger.

1225
01:39:17,843 --> 01:39:19,674
Let's go.

No! I don't want
to become a demon!

1233
01:39:58,323 --> 01:40:00,200

- Eboshi!

You keep going!

1241
01:40:39,843 --> 01:40:43,074
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

1242
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,518
- Hold your fire!
- What is it you want?

1243
01:40:45,603 --> 01:40:48,481
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

1244
01:40:48,563 --> 01:40:50,793
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

1245
01:40:50,883 --> 01:40:53,477
Forget about
the Forest Spirit!

1246
01:40:53,563 --> 01:40:57,078
Your men are already
heading back to Irontown,
but they need you to lead them!

1247
01:40:57,163 --> 01:40:59,472
What proof is there
this isn't a lie?

1248
01:40:59,563 --> 01:41:03,317
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

1249
01:41:03,403 --> 01:41:07,282
So it's don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

1250
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:11,720
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

1251
01:41:13,723 --> 01:41:16,954
- Just whose side is he on anyway?
- Shouldn't we go back?

1252
01:41:17,043 --> 01:41:20,479
The women are on their own now.
I've done all I can for them.

1253
01:41:20,563 --> 01:41:22,997
They can take care
of themselves.

1254
01:41:24,483 --> 01:41:28,158
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

1255
01:41:28,243 --> 01:41:30,996
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

1256
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,677
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

1257
01:41:33,763 --> 01:41:37,039
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

And here I was saving
the last of my strength...

But I must save San.

Well done, men. Now, fall back

01:47:44,363 --> 01:47:47,275
The trick is not to fear him.

1325
01:48:02,563 --> 01:48:05,316
No! Stop!

1326
01:48:05,403 --> 01:48:08,076
- [Grunts]
- Eboshi!

1327
01:48:12,603 --> 01:48:14,673
- [Clicks]
- [Gasps]

1328
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:23,720
You will die!

1329
01:48:25,563 --> 01:48:26,791
[Gasps]

1330
01:48:29,483 --> 01:48:31,439
[Grunting]

1331
01:48:31,523 --> 01:48:34,162
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

1332
01:48:52,163 --> 01:48:56,315
[Screaming]

1333
01:49:09,363 --> 01:49:14,437
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

1334
01:49:14,523 --> 01:49:18,880
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

1335
01:49:18,963 --> 01:49:22,876
Be careful not
to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!

1336
01:49:25,843 --> 01:49:28,835
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

1337
01:49:28,923 --> 01:49:31,312
- [Gasps, Grunts]
- Watch out!

1338
01:49:33,043 --> 01:49:34,681
[Screams]

1339
01:49:36,483 --> 01:49:38,678
Milady!

1340
01:49:38,763 --> 01:49:41,072
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.

1341
01:49:41,163 --> 01:49:44,200
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

1342
01:49:44,283 --> 01:49:46,114
- Hurry!
- It's coming, sir!

1343
01:49:49,203 --> 01:49:51,956
- Run!
- Run!

1344
01:49:59,443 --> 01:50:01,274
[Gonza Whimpers]

1345
01:50:04,643 --> 01:50:08,113
[Gasps] Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

1346
01:50:08,203 --> 01:50:12,037
- Island? I can't swim!
- Then walk along the bottom.

1347
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,677
[Inhales Deeply]

1348
01:50:15,763 --> 01:50:17,799
[Gasps]

1349
01:50:29,843 --> 01:50:31,674
[Gasps]

1350
01:50:37,323 --> 01:50:40,235
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

1351
01:50:40,323 --> 01:50:43,474
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

1352
01:50:43,563 --> 01:50:47,317
- Lady Eboshi.
- Help me. [Grunts]

1353
01:50:49,523 --> 01:50:51,957
Don't waste your sympathy.
Ow!

1354
01:50:52,043 --> 01:50:55,319
- I promised Toki that
I'd bring you back to Irontown.
- [Crashing]

1355
01:50:55,403 --> 01:50:58,873
[Growling]

1356
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:03,600
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

1357
01:51:03,683 --> 01:51:06,072
San, you have got to help us.

1358
01:51:06,163 --> 01:51:08,836
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

1359
01:51:08,923 --> 01:51:10,754
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

1360
01:51:10,843 --> 01:51:13,277
San?

1361
01:51:13,363 --> 01:51:16,799
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

1362
01:51:16,883 --> 01:51:20,080
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

1363
01:51:20,163 --> 01:51:23,838
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

1364
01:51:23,923 --> 01:51:26,562
- San?
- Stay back!

1365
01:51:26,643 --> 01:51:30,033
[Gasps] Oh.

1366
01:51:31,563 --> 01:51:34,361
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

1367
01:51:34,443 --> 01:51:37,833
[Growling]

1368
01:51:40,443 --> 01:51:45,119
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

1369
01:51:54,003 --> 01:51:58,360
Nothing is over.
The two of us are still alive.
Now, will you help me, San?

1370
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:25,041
[Jigo] Hey, wait!
Come back! Help us!

1371
01:52:25,123 --> 01:52:27,796
A little crisis
and they panic. Whoa!

1372
01:52:30,483 --> 01:52:33,600
Whoa! What are you doing?
This way!

1373
01:52:33,683 --> 01:52:35,833
[Screaming]

1374
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:39,677
[Groans]
Look! The head is moving!

1375
01:52:42,163 --> 01:52:45,439
- It's calling him to us!
- [Grunting]

1376
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:12,594
[Tapping]

1377
01:53:24,083 --> 01:53:26,153
- [Tapping Continues]
- There you go.

1378
01:53:26,243 --> 01:53:28,962
- It shouldn't jam any more.
- Thanks.

1379
01:53:29,043 --> 01:53:31,841
- It's awfully quiet.
- Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1380
01:53:31,923 --> 01:53:35,836
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1381
01:53:35,923 --> 01:53:38,232
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1382
01:53:38,323 --> 01:53:41,281
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1383
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:45,515
- [Snores, Yawns]
- Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1384
01:53:45,603 --> 01:53:48,800
- Hey, Kohroku!
- Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1385
01:53:48,883 --> 01:53:50,635
- [Rumbling]
- Huh?

1386
01:53:58,883 --> 01:54:02,637
- What's that?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

1387
01:54:13,363 --> 01:54:15,240
It's the Nightwalker!

1388
01:54:15,323 --> 01:54:18,599
[Shouting]

1389
01:54:18,683 --> 01:54:23,199
- [Shouting]
- [Crashing]

1390
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:28,435
[Whinnying]

1391
01:54:28,523 --> 01:54:31,162
Everybody, hold your positions!

1392
01:54:31,243 --> 01:54:34,155
- Toki, it's coming right at us.
- Run! We've gotta go!

1393
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:39,795
[Toki] No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1394
01:54:44,203 --> 01:54:46,239
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1395
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:52,314
Get everyone out!

1396
01:54:52,403 --> 01:54:55,839
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1397
01:54:55,923 --> 01:54:58,483
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1398
01:54:58,563 --> 01:55:01,600
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1399
01:55:01,683 --> 01:55:05,517
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1400
01:55:05,603 --> 01:55:09,881
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1401
01:55:09,963 --> 01:55:12,557
- What are we gonna do now?
- It'll kill us all!

1402
01:55:12,643 --> 01:55:14,759
- We'll never get out now!
- That's enough!

1403
01:55:14,843 --> 01:55:19,155
Get everyone down to the lake
and stay calm. We can carry
the sick and the wounded.

1404
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:26,678
[Screaming]

1405
01:55:28,203 --> 01:55:33,118
- Not that way! Stop!
- [Screaming]

1406
01:55:42,003 --> 01:55:44,915
[Whimpering]

1407
01:55:45,963 --> 01:55:47,794
Oh! There it goes!

1408
01:55:52,523 --> 01:55:54,354
We're done for!

1409
01:55:54,443 --> 01:55:56,752
Once the forge burns, that's it.
That'll be the end of Irontown.

1410
01:55:56,843 --> 01:56:00,882
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1411
01:56:18,003 --> 01:56:19,880
There they are!

1412
01:56:30,803 --> 01:56:32,475
Go!

1413
01:56:32,563 --> 01:56:34,758
Stop right there!

1414
01:56:34,843 --> 01:56:38,392
Whoa! Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1415
01:56:38,483 --> 01:56:41,759
I'm giving the creature back its head.
Put the box down and back away.

1416
01:56:41,843 --> 01:56:44,641
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1417
01:56:44,723 --> 01:56:46,873
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1418
01:56:46,963 --> 01:56:49,761
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1419
01:56:49,843 --> 01:56:51,834
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1420
01:56:51,923 --> 01:56:54,118
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1421
01:56:54,203 --> 01:56:56,956
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1422
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,874
But I might
actually get it.

1423
01:56:58,963 --> 01:57:00,681
Don't force me to kill you.

1424
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:03,072
Oh, dear, you make it sound
so very easy.

1425
01:57:03,163 --> 01:57:06,792
You really
ought to... relax!

1426
01:57:06,883 --> 01:57:11,035
- [Growls]
- [Both Grunting]

1427
01:57:11,123 --> 01:57:15,639
Get going!
[Grunting]

1428
01:57:15,723 --> 01:57:19,557
- [Groans]
- [Panting]

1429

[Whimpering]

1430
01:57:25,763 --> 01:57:28,721
- [Whimpering]
- Oh!

1431
01:57:30,363 --> 01:57:32,923
Ashitaka!

1432
01:57:33,003 --> 01:57:35,119
I got it! Whoa! Ooh!

1433
01:57:35,203 --> 01:57:39,833
Everything's... Oof!
Under control! Oof!

1434
01:57:39,923 --> 01:57:41,754
This is bad.

1435
01:57:44,283 --> 01:57:46,399
Master, we're surrounded!
[Screams]

1436
01:57:46,483 --> 01:57:49,520
- Come on, sun! Rise!
- Open the box!

1437
01:57:49,603 --> 01:57:51,639
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1438
01:57:51,723 --> 01:57:54,396
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1439
01:57:54,483 --> 01:57:58,158
- Human hands must return it!
- [Groans]

1440
01:57:58,243 --> 01:58:02,395
[Grunts]
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1441
01:58:10,603 --> 01:58:13,401
[Gasps]

1442
01:58:13,483 --> 01:58:15,792
Forest Spirit!

1443
01:58:15,883 --> 01:58:18,955
We give you back your head!

1444
01:58:19,043 --> 01:58:21,955
Take it and be at peace!

1445
01:58:29,803 --> 01:58:32,601
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1446
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:46,718
[Gasping]

1447
01:59:01,363 --> 01:59:03,194
Well, I think it's over.

1448
01:59:03,283 --> 01:59:04,955
- [Man] Hello!
- It's the men.

1449
01:59:05,043 --> 01:59:07,557
- [Shouting]
- The men! The men are back!

1450
01:59:07,643 --> 01:59:11,272
I really can't believe we made it.
I never thought I'd live
to see home again.

1451
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:15,197
[Wind Howling]

1452
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:20,759
- Milady! You're here!
- Her ladyship has been injured.

1453
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:50,077
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1454
01:59:55,403 --> 01:59:57,712
[Toki] Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1455
02:01:01,243 --> 02:01:05,475
Huh? I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1456
02:01:30,803 --> 02:01:32,634
[Moans]

1457
02:01:34,363 --> 02:01:37,355
[Gasps] San. San, look.

1458
02:02:06,243 --> 02:02:09,519
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest any more.

1459
02:02:09,603 --> 02:02:12,037
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1460
02:02:12,123 --> 02:02:15,752
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1461
02:02:15,843 --> 02:02:18,721
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1462
02:02:18,803 --> 02:02:20,680
that it's time
for us both to live.

1463
02:02:28,403 --> 02:02:30,280
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1464
02:02:30,363 --> 02:02:32,718
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1465
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:36,478
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1466
02:02:36,563 --> 02:02:40,636
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you...

1467
02:02:40,723 --> 02:02:42,953
whenever we can, all right?

1468
02:02:52,883 --> 02:02:57,593
Amazing. The wolves and
that crazy little Wolf Girl
helped save us all.

1469
02:02:57,683 --> 02:03:01,517
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1470
02:03:01,603 --> 02:03:05,721
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1471
02:03:05,803 --> 02:03:09,796
Well, I give up.
You can't win against fools.

1472
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,354
[Clicking]

1473
02:03:35,283 --> 02:03:40,403
In the moonlight
I felt your heart

1474
02:03:40,483 --> 02:03:45,477
Quiver like
a bowstring's pulse

1475
02:03:45,563 --> 02:03:51,593
In the moon's mere light
you looked at me

1476
02:03:51,683 --> 02:03:57,235
Nobody knows your heart

1477
02:03:57,323 --> 02:04:02,681
When the sun has gone
I see you

1478
02:04:02,763 --> 02:04:07,553
Beautiful and haunting
but cold

1479
02:04:07,643 --> 02:04:13,673
Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet

1480
02:04:13,763 --> 02:04:19,235
Nobody knows your heart

1481
02:04:19,323 --> 02:04:24,795
All of your sorrow
grief and pain

1482
02:04:24,883 --> 02:04:30,162
Locked away
in the forest of the night

1483
02:04:30,243 --> 02:04:36,637
Your secret heart
belongs to the world

1484
02:04:36,723 --> 02:04:42,161
Of the things
that sigh in the dark

1485
02:04:42,243 --> 02:04:49,354
Or the things
that cry in the dark
