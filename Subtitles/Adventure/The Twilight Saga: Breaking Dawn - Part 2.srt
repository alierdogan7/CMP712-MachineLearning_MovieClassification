I won't stand against the Volturi.

729
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,491
I'm gonna get the water running.

730
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,684
BELLA: Alice made sure
only I would get the message.

731
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,861
Because only my mind
would be safe from Aro.

732
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,800
JACOB: I'm surprised
you took a break from Jedi training.

733
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,678
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad,
he'll come to us.

734
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,345
27 vampires, one human.

735
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,411
Not so great.

736
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,319
I know that's what you told Edward.

737
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,218
- (EXHALES)
- Whatever.

738
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,393
I'm just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers.

739
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,000
(SCOFFS)

740
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:12,501
I'm sorry.

741
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,194
I know.

742
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,196
They're the good guys.

743
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:18,941
But come on,

744
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,367
Dracula One and Two are

745
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,406
- creepy.
- (BOTH LAUGHlNG)

746
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,354
CHARLlE: There she is. Come here.

747
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:42,824
Oh!

748
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,392
Wow! Look at you.

749
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,928
You've grown half a foot!

750
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:48,737
Seriously.

751
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,632
Like 6 inches.

752
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,703
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

753
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,141
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

754
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:58,141
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

755
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,544
I'll be back soon, okay?

756
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,548
- CHARLlE: Come on. Let's go.
- (RENESMEE LAUGHS)

757
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,821
(ENGlNE STARTS)

758
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,453
BELLA: Alice's note
gave me a new sense of hope.

759
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,455
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

760
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,567
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.
