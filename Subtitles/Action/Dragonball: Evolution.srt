In a time before
many can remember,

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,460
our planet faced
its greatest challenge.

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,464
A warlord named Piccolo
came from beyond the stars,

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,384
bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peaceful world.

5
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,845
Aided by his disciple Oozaru,

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,683
the evil pair brought
the human race to the brink
ofannihilation.

7
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,811
Cities and countries
crumbled beneath them.

Countless lives were lost.

created the Ma Fu Ba,

that imprisoned Piccolo
deep within the Earth.

12

With his master captured,
Oozaru disappeared,

13
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,086

slowly restored to our world.

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,618
He was murdered.

384
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,662
I will avenge him.

385
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,999
But before he—

386
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,544
he died,
he asked me to find you...

387
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,297
and to tell you that
Piccolo has returned.

388
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,341
He said that
you would know what to do.

389
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,385
He also told me a poem.

390
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,888
It was "Seven Dragonballs."

391
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:36,101

told to us by ancient master.

397
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:56,246

It's a nursery rhyme.

Yes. Because before tonight,
I could make no sense of it.

Okay, Goku.

but a lowlife bandit.

Just think it over,

498
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,432
'cause after the sun comes out,
it's gonna be hot, hot, hot.

00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,990
We have no marshmallows,
but I do have a story.

503
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,992
2,000 years ago,

504
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,370
the Earth was nearly destroyed.

505
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,081
Not by man but by gods
from the sky.

506
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:46,007
Their names were
Piccolo and Oozaru.

507
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:50,261
Seven mystics banded together
to fight the invaders.

508
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:55,058
They sacrificed their lives
to cast the Ma Fu Ba,

509
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,103
a powerful curse
that imprisoned Piccolo.

510
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,732
Now, Piccolo has
somehow escaped.

511
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,070
In two days, the blood moon
will eclipse the sun...

512
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,532
and bring forth Oozaru,
his disciple.

513
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,450
To stop Piccolo,

514
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,662
whoever can find
all seven Dragonballs...

515
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,331
can resurrect
the power ofShen Long...

516
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,500
and be granted one perfect wish.

517
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,296
Unless we find
the Dragonballs...

518
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,925
and use our wish
to banish Piccolo from this world,

519
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,179
we will have no defense
against the onslaught.

520
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,974
What a crock.
[Chuckles]
You expect me to believe that?

521
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:41,020
I do not. I thinkyou
are the kind of person who
does not believe in anything.

522
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,772
I feel sorry foryou.

523
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,733
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm not the one
stuck in the hole.

00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,278

The Dragonball's close.

00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,876
But I think
it's buried underground.

530
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,590
Enough games.
We have no time to waste.

531
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,592
- Send down a net.
- Hey, Rosh.

532
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,887
We're gonna need
some tools to excavate!

533
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,643
How would you like to make more money
than you ever dreamed of?

the ball you're looking for is
right here. Let's go. Come on!

00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,120
You have no right to give away
a third ofthe royalties
to my invention.

538
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,664
One day Dragonballs
could power the world.

539
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,753
Don't worry.
A third ofzero is still zero.

540
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,971
Done. Whoo!
Ooh, yeah.

00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,350
[Exhales]
Well, I guess
ifyou hadn't robbed us,

542
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,561
we wouldn't be able
to get this Dragonball.

543
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,898

for a reason, bro.

I followed Muten Roshi as directed.

548

He is training the boy...
San-Goku.

549
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,182
I could disrupt them.

550
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,855

more than a disruption.

[Roars]

558
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:35,153
So, after we get the seven Dragonballs,
how soon can I expect some profit?

559
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,530
Huh? A month?

560

They've been speaking to you.
Yeah.

They are showing you a future.
There's this demon—

Oozaru. The Destroyer.

603
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,230
He will kill you.

And Bulma. And Yamcha.

700
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,571
That's cheating.

701
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,698
You're supposed to light
the torches with your ki.

702
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,492
Have you been watching me?

703
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,914
- Then I guess you know why
I have to cheat.

705
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,839
You know, my grandpa
always said in order to master my ki,

706
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:26,095
I have to be at one
with myselfand with my enemy.

707
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,722
I still don't know
what that means.

708
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,474
Maybe you need an incentive.

709
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,851
Whoa.

710
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,980
There are five unlit torches
in this courtyard.

711
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,148
You're five paces
away from me.

712
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,526
Every time you light a torch,

713
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,904
you get to take
one step closer to me.

714
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,825
What happens after I light
all five torches?

715
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:51,203
[Clears Throat]
Then you'll be standing
right next to me—

716
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,290
where I can reach you.

00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,208

It doesn't feel right.
I must be missing something.

You have to make
every move your own.

You can do this.

I think the next move,

739
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,968
it would be better
to blow out all the torches.
