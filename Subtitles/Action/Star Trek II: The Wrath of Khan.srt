00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,600
Captain's Log:
Stardate 8130.3.

3
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,603
Starship Enterprise
on training mission

4
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,648
to Gamma Hydra,
Section 14,

5
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,650
coordinates 22-87-4.

6
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,445
Approaching neutral zone.

7
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,574
All systems normal
and functioning.

8
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,076
Leaving Section 14
for Section 15.

9
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,120
Stand by.

10
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,665
Project parabolic course
to avoid entering neutral zone.

11
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,666
Aye, Captain.

12
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,837
Course change projected.

13
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,338
Captain,
I'm getting something

14
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,756
on the distress channel.

15
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,425
On speakers.

16
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,718
Imperative.

17
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,469
This is Kobayashi Maru.

18
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:44,057
We've struck a gravitic mine
and have lost power.

19
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,060
Our hull is penetrated
and we have sustained...

20
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,438
This is the starship
Enterprise.

21
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,940
Your message
is breaking up.

22
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,942
Can you give us your
coordinates?

23
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,446
Our position is Gamma Hydra,
Section 10.

24
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,448
In the neutral zone.

25
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,741
Hull penetrated.

26
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,743
Life support
systems failing.

27
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,369
Can you assist us,
Enterprise?

28
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,496
Data on Kobayashi Maru.

29
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,875
Vessel is third-class
neutronic fuel carrier,

30
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,336
crew of 81,300 passengers.

31
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,755
Damn.

32
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,427
Mr. Sulu,
plot an intercept course.

33
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,348
May I remind you that if the starship
enters the zone...

34
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm aware of my responsibilities,
mister.

35
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,942
Estimating two minutes
to intercept.

36
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,280
Now entering
the neutral zone.

37
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,991
Warning.
We have entered neutral zone.

38
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,994
We are now in violation
of treaty, Captain.

39
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,496
Stand by,
transporter room,

40
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,498
ready to beam
survivors aboard.

41
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,084
Captain,
I've lost their signal.

42
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,629
Alert. Three Klingon cruisers
bearing 3-1-6 mark 4,

43
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,880
closing fast.

44
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:57,965
Visual.

45
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,511
Battle stations.
Activate shields.

46
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,847
Shields activated.

47
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,558
Tell them we're
on a rescue mission.

48
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,184
They're jamming
the frequencies.

49
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,395
Klingons on attack course
and closing.

50
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,896
We're over our heads.

51
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,399
Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here.

52
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,942
I'll try, Captain.

53
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,820
Alert. Klingon torpedoes
activated. Alert.

54
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,863
Evasive action.

55
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,786
Engineering, damage report.

56
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,371
Main energizer hit,
Captain.

57
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,873
Engage auxiliary power.

58
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,583
Prepare to return fire.

59
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,877
Aah!

60
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,879
Shields collapsing,
Captain.

61
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,509
Fire all phasers.

62
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,012
No power
to the weapons, Captain.

63
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,351
Captain, it's no use.

64
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,188
We're dead in space.

65
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,190
Activate escape pods.

66
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,275
Send out the log buoy.

67
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,776
All hands abandon ship.

68
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,737
All right, open it up.

69
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,081
Any suggestions, Admiral?

70
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,958
Prayer, Mr. Saavik.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,419
The Klingons
don't take prisoners.

72
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,921
Lights.

73
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,923
Blowers on.

74
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,760
Captain.

75
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,101
Trainees,
to the briefing room.

76
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,938
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

77
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,317
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

78
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,985
Physician, heal thyself.

79
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,364
Is that all?
What about my performance?

80
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,199
I'm not
a drama critic.

81
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,870
Staying with
a sinking ship?

82
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,997
Permission
to speak candidly, sir.

83
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,082
Granted.

84
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,585
This was not a fair test
of my abilities.

85
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,586
Why not?

86
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,048
Because there was
no way to win.

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,051
A no-win situation
is always possible.

88
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,554
Has that never
occurred to you?

89
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,556
No, sir, it has not.

90
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,559
Dealing with death
is at least as important

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,561
as dealing with life.

92
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,564
That thought had not
occurred to me.

93
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,400
Now you have something new
to think about.

94
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,568
Carry on.

95
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,571
Engineering Cadets,
assemble on C Level.

96
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:30,742
Admiral, why not put
an experienced crew on the ship?

97
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,744
Galloping around the cosmos

98
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,581
is a game for the young.

99
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,000
Now, what does that mean?

100
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,591
Aren't you dead?

101
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,095
I assume you're
loitering around here

102
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,599
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets.

103
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,101
I am understandably curious.

104
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,604
They destroyed
the simulator room

105
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,522
and you with it.

106
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,524
The Kobayashi Maru
scenario

107
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,028
frequently wreaks havoc with students
and equipment.

108
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,531
You took the test
three times yourself.

109
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,034
Your final solution
was unique.

110
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,286
That was its virtue.

111
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,040
Oh, by the way,
thank you for this.

112
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,543
I know of your fondness
for antiques.

113
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,671
"It was the best of times,

114
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,716
it was the worst of times."

115
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,218
Message, Spock?

116
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,346
None that I know.
Except, of course, happy birthday.

117
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,556
Surely the best of times.

118
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,682
Captain Spock,

119
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,560
space shuttle leaving
in 15 minutes.

120
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,188
Where are you off to?

121
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,441
The Enterprise,
to check in before your inspection.

122
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,026
And you?

123
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,987
Home.

124
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,506
Bless me, Doctor,
what beams you

125
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,509
into this neck
of the woods?

126
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,511
Beware Romulans
bearing gifts.

127
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,515
Happy birthday, Jim.

128
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,016
Thanks.

129
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,562
Romulan ale.

130
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,022
Why, Bones,
this is illegal.

131
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,525
I only use it
for medicinal purposes.

132
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,528
I got aboard a ship
that brings it in.

133
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,114
Now, don't be a prig.

134
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,448
2283.

135
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,536
Well, it takes this stuff
a while to ferment.

136
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,538
Here, give me.

137
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,040
Now, you open this one.

138
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,042
I'm almost afraid to.

139
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,087
What is it?
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

140
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,505
No.

141
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,634
Bones, this is...

142
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,178
charming.

143
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,180
For most patients
your age,

144
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,432
I'd recommend
Retinax 5.

145
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,142
I'm allergic
to Retinax.

146
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,810
Exactly. Cheers!

147
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,437
Cheers.

148
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,696
Ahh.

149
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,406
Happy birthday.

150
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,744
I don't know
what to say.

151
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,704
You could say thank you.

152
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,247
Thank you.

153
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,130
Damn it, Jim,
what the hell's the matter with you?

154
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,425
Why are we treating your birthday
like a funeral?

155
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,428
Bones, I don't want
to be lectured.

156
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,430
What the hell
do you want?

157
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:44,937
This is not about age,
and you know it.

158
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,940
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

159
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,026
when you want to be
out there hopping galaxies.

160
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,945
Spare me
your poetry.

161
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,947
We all have
assigned duties.

162
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,448
Bull!

163
00:10:56,532 --> 00:11:00,327
You're hiding- hiding behind
rules and regulations.

164
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,995
From whom?

165
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,373
From yourself, Admiral.

166
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,421
Don't mince words, Bones.

167
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,924
What do you really think?

168
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,434
Jim, I'm your doctor,
and I'm your friend.

169
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,436
Get back your command.

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,439
Get it back
before you turn

171
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,942
into part
of this collection,

172
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,654
before you
really do grow old.

173
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:55,966
Starship Log:
Stardate 8130.4.

174
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,844
Log entry
by First Officer Pavel Chekov.

175
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,764
Starship Reliant on orbital approach
to Ceti Alpha VI

176
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,893
in connection
with Project Genesis.

177
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,270
We are searching
for a lifeless planet

178
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,272
to use as a test site

179
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,773
for the Genesis experiment.

180
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,275
So far, no success.

181
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,776
Standard orbit, please.

182
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,405
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

183
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,907
Negative.

184
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,910
Limited atmosphere
dominated by kraylon gas,

185
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,912
sand, high-velocity winds.

186
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,581
incapable of supporting life forms.

187
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,918
Does it have to be
completely lifeless?

188
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,920
Have you found something?

189
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,423
We picked up
a minor energy flux

190
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,425
on one dynoscanner.

191
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,427
Damn. Are you sure?

192
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,430
Maybe the scanner's
out of adjustment.

193
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:47,434
I suppose it could be a particle
of preanimate matter

194
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,436
caught in the matrix.

195
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,940
Get on the Comm-pic
to Dr. Marcus.

196
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,441
Aye, sir.

197
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,444
Maybe it's something
we can transplant.

198
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,447
You know what she'll say.

199
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,949
Let me get this straight-

200
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,408
something you can transplant?

201
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,327
Yes, Doctor.

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,412
Something you can transplant?

203
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,916
I don't know.

204
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,670
But it may only be
preanimate matter.

205
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,089
Then again, it may not.

206
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,093
There can't be
so much as a microbe,

207
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,136
or the show's off.

208
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,515
Have a look.
If it can be moved-

209
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,767
You bet, Doctor.
we're on our way.

210
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,942
Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis will work.

211
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,445
They'll remember you
with Newton, Einstein, Surak.

212
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,448
Thanks. No respect
from my offspring.

213
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,450
Par for the course.

214
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,954
You teaming up
with me for bridge?

215
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,455
Maybe.

216
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,457
What is it?

217
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,460
Whenever we deal
with Starfleet,

218
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,462
I get nervous.

219
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,965
We are dealing
with something

220
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,886
that could be perverted
into a dreadful weapon.

221
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,388
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout

222
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,390
you hung around with?

223
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,893
Jim Kirk
was many things,

224
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:14,396
but he was never
a boy scout.

225
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,276
Captain Terrell,
standby to beam down.

226
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,958
Chekov,
are you sure

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,586
these are
the correct coordinates?

228
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,422
Captain, this is
the garden spot

229
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,466
of Ceti Alpha VI.

230
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,969
I can barely see it.

231
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,980
There's nothing here.

232
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,983
The tricorder
must be broken.

233
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,208
Chekov, over here.

234
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,843
Those look like
cargo carriers.

235
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,437
Hey, give me a hand.

236
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,686
What the hell happened?

237
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,688
If they crashed,

238
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,774
where's the rest
of the ship?

239
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,456
What the hell is that?

240
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,846
Botany Bay?

241
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,183
Botany Bay!

242
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,977
Oh, no!

243
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,272
We've got to leave now!

244
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,774
What about-

245
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,776
Never mind that. Hurry!

246
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,278
Chekov, what's wrong
with you?

247
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,404
Chekov?

248
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,658
Come on! Hurry!

249
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,216
Starship Reliant
to Captain Terrell.

250
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,635
This is Commander Kyle.

251
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,096
Will you please
respond, Captain?

252
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,600
Captain Terrell,
respond, please.

253
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,108
Let's give them
a little more time.

254
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,101
Khan.

255
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,743
I don't know you.

256
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,835
But you...

257
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,464
I never forget a face.

258
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,341
Mr...

259
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,552
Chekov.

260
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,305
Isn't it?

261
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,894
I never thought
to see your face again.

262
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,896
Chekov,
who is this man?

263
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,856
A criminal, Captain.

264
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,360
A product of 20th-century
genetic engineering.

265
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,321
What do you want?
I demand to be-

266
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,700
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

267
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,203
I, on the other hand,

268
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,706
am in a position
to grant nothing.

269
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,210
What you see
is all that remains

270
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,421
of the ship's company
and crew

271
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,423
of the Botany Bay,

272
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,761
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

273
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,639
Listen,
you men and women-

274
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,724
Captain, Captain.

275
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,729
Save your strength,
Captain.

276
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,148
These people had sworn

277
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,569
to live and die
at my command

278
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,238
200 years
before you were born.

279
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,244
Do you mean he never
told you the tale?

280
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,246
To amuse your Captain?

281
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,747
No?

282
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,208
Never told you

283
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,752
How the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay

284
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,256
lost in space
from the year 1996,

285
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,177
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

286
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,470
I've never even met
Admiral Kirk.

287
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,763
Admiral?

288
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,182
Admiral.

289
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,684
Admiral.

290
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,274
Never told you

291
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:36,778
how Admiral Kirk
sent 70 of us into exile

292
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,281
on this barren sand heap

293
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:44,203
with only the contents
of these cargo bays

294
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,412
to sustain us?

295
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:49,249
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V,
there was life.

296
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,751
A fair chance-

297
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,836
This is Ceti Alpha V!

298
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,180
Ceti Alpha VI exploded

299
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,184
six months after
we were left here.

300
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,686
The shock
shifted the orbit

301
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,688
of this planet,

302
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,483
and everything
was laid waste.

303
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,194
Admiral Kirk
never bothered to check

304
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,696
on our progress.

305
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,702
It was only the fact

306
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,205
of my genetically
engineered intellect

307
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,707
that allowed us
to survive.

308
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,713
On earth...

309
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,717
200 years ago...

310
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,222
I was a prince...

311
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:49,142
with power over millions.

312
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,228
Captain Kirk
was your host.

313
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,729
You repaid
his hospitality

314
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,482
by trying
to steal his ship

315
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,025
and murder him.

316
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,706
You didn't expect
to find me.

317
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:15,043
You thought
this was Ceti Alpha VI.

318
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,713
Ahh.

319
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,466
Why are you here?

320
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,936
Why?

321
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,237
Allow me
to introduce you

322
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,239
to Ceti Alpha V's

323
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,035
only remaining
indigenous life form.

324
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,339
What do you think?

325
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,675
It killed
20 of my people...

326
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,764
including my beloved wife.

327
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,615
Oh, not all at once.

328
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:34,456
And not instantly,
to be sure.

329
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,219
You see,

330
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,222
their young enter
through the ears

331
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:53,225
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

332
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:57,229
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

333
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:01,859
extremely susceptible
to, uh...suggestion.

334
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:07,698
Later, as they grow...

335
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:11,577
follows madness...

336
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,246
and death.

337
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,214
Khan, listen to me.

338
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,552
These are pets,
of course.

339
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,225
Not quite domesticated.

340
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,643
Khan,

341
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,480
Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty.

342
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,450
Aah!

343
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:56,997
Aaaahh!

344
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,135
That's better.

345
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,433
Now, tell me,
why are you here?

346
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,936
And tell me

347
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,440
where I may find
James Kirk.

348
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,445
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

349
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,947
You're cleared for docking.

350
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,407
Approach portside
torpedo bay.

351
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,914
Enterprise, this is
Admiral Kirk's party on final approach.

352
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,875
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

353
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,724
I hate inspections.

354
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

355
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,784
I'm glad you're at the helm
for three weeks.

356
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,953
These kids
can't steer.

357
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,180
Open the air lock.

358
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,183
Permission to come aboard.

359
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,352
You're welcome.
You know my training crew.

360
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,563
Certainly they know you.

361
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:48,025
We've been through
death and life together.

362
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,198
Mr. Scott, you old space dog,
you're well.

363
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,700
I had a wee bout, sir,

364
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,203
but Dr. McCoy
pulled me through.

365
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,163
Wee bout of what?

366
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,165
Shore leave, Admiral.

367
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,668
Who do we have here?

368
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,672
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
Engineer's Mate, sir.

369
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,175
First training voyage,
Mr. Preston?

370
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,176
Yes, sir.

371
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,511
I see.

372
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:19,181
Shall we start
with the engine room?

373
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,683
We'll see you there.
Everything is in order.

374
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,187
That'll be a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Scott.

375
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,899
I'll see you
on the bridge, Admiral.

376
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,276
Company, dismissed.

377
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,872
Well, Mr. Scott,
are your cadets capable

378
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,332
of handling
a minor training cruise?

379
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,333
Give the word, Admiral.

380
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,335
The word is given.

381
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,837
Aye, sir.

382
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,299
What about the rest
of the inspection?

383
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,772
This is
Starfleet operations.

384
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,816
Enterprise is clear
for departure.

385
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,860
Admiral on the bridge.

386
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,787
Running lights on.

387
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,293
Very well,
Mr. Saavik.

388
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,795
You may clear
all moorings.

389
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,089
Aye, sir.

390
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,800
All moorings are cleared,
Captain.

391
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:20,093
Thank you.

392
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:24,848
Lieutenant,

393
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,103
have you piloted a starship
out of space dock?

394
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,313
Never, sir.

395
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,825
Take her out,
Mr. Saavik.

396
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,329
Aye, sir.

397
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,340
For everything there is
a first time, Lieutenant.

398
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,342
Don't you agree, Admiral?

399
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,343
Uh-huh.

400
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,345
Aft thrusters,
Mr. Sulu.

401
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,722
Aft thrusters.

402
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,349
Would you like
a tranquilizer?

403
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,852
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

404
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,896
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

405
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,385
We are free
to navigate.

406
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,804
Course heading, Captain?

407
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,890
Captain's discretion.

408
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,475
Mr. Sulu,

409
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,020
you may...
indulge yourself.

410
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,481
Aye, sir.

411
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,676
Does that
about do it?

412
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,678
I doubt
we could squeeze

413
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,722
any more information
into the memory banks.

414
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,224
We'll design
a bigger one.

415
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,725
Who would build it?

416
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,227
Dr. Marcus,
Comm-pic coming in

417
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,479
on the hyperchannel.

418
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,982
It's the starship Reliant.

419
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,401
On the screen, Jedda.

420
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,319
Come in, please.

421
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,823
This is the Reliant
callingRegula-1.

422
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,826
Repeat,
this is U.S.S. Reliant.

423
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,828
Commander, we are receiving.

424
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,830
This is Regula-1 .

425
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,832
Ah, Dr. Marcus. Good.

426
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,834
We're en route to you

427
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,838
and should be there
in three days.

428
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,841
We weren't expecting you
for three months.

429
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,926
Has something happened?

430
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,889
No. Ceti Alpha VI
has checked out.

431
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,349
Then why
are you coming-

432
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,185
We have new orders.

433
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:59,354
All materials
of Project Genesis

434
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,441
will be transferred
to this ship

435
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:05,319
fortesting
on Ceti Alpha VI.

436
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,322
Who do they
think they are?

437
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:11,491
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

438
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:14,203
I have my orders.

439
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,331
Pin him down, mother.
Who gave the order?

440
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:20,626
The order comes from...

441
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,214
Admiral James T. Kirk.

442
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,216
I knew it!

443
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,134
The military's
been waiting

444
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:32,137
to get
their hands on it.

445
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,640
I have no intention
of allowing Reliant

446
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,141
or any unauthorized personnel

447
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:37,893
access to our work.

448
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,979
I am sorry
that you feel that way.

449
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,066
Admiral Kirk's orders
are confirmed.

450
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,902
Please prepare
to deliver Genesis to us

451
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,403
upon our arrival.

452
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,530
Reliant out.

453
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,660
Well done, Commander.

454
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,163
You realize, sir,
they will attempt

455
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,165
to contact Admiral Kirk

456
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,084
and confirm the order.

457
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,640
Hold, please.

458
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,519
Thank you, sir.

459
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,939
Lieutenant,

460
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,025
are you wearing
your hair differently?

461
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,861
It's still regulation, Admiral.

462
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,448
May I speak, sir?

463
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,203
Self-expression
doesn't seem to be

464
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,205
one of your problems.

465
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,085
You're bothered
by your performance

466
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,670
on the Kobayashi Maru.

467
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,672
I failed to resolve
the situation.

468
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,174
There's no correct resolution.

469
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,176
It's a test
of character.

470
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:55,679
May I ask how you
dealt with the test?

471
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,600
You may ask.

472
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,354
That's a little joke.

473
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:08,108
Humor. It is
a difficult concept.

474
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:11,153
It is not logical.

475
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,530
We learn by doing.

476
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,533
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

477
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,035
Thank you, sir.

478
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,579
She change
her hair style?

479
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,080
I hadn't noticed.

480
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:25,209
Wonderful stuff,
that Romulan ale.

481
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,668
Admiral Kirk.

482
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,086
Kirk here.

483
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,088
I have
an urgent Comm-pic

484
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,591
from Space Lab
Regula-1 for you.

485
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,676
Dr. Carol Marcus.

486
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,765
I'll take it
in my quarters.

487
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,601
It never rains
but it pours.

488
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,604
As a physician,
you should appreciate

489
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:48,232
the dangers of reopening
old wounds.

490
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,444
Sorry.

491
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,863
Jim, can you read me?

492
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,534
I can hear you, Carol.
What's wrong?

493
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:02,037
Why are you taking
Genesis from us?

494
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,873
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

495
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:06,834
Who is taking Genesis?

496
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:10,379
I can see you,
but I can't hear.

497
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,257
Jim, did you
give the order?

498
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,759
What order?
Who's taking Genesis?

499
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,262
I won't let them
have Genesis

500
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,389
without proper authorization.

501
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,600
On whose authority
can they do this?

502
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:25,394
No one's authority.

503
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:26,562
Jim-

504
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,438
Uhura, what's happening?

505
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,941
Transmission jammed
at the source.

506
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,944
Alert Starfleet headquarters.

507
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:35,529
Aye, sir.

508
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:38,782
I want to talk
to Starfleet command.

509
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,368
We must have order
in here.

510
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,787
This has to be a mistake.

511
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,831
Mistake.

512
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,332
We're all alone here.

513
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,836
They waited until everyone
was on leave.

514
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,839
Reliant is at our disposal,
not vice versa.

515
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,841
I can't believe
Starfleet-

516
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,843
I tried to tell you

517
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,804
scientists are always
pawns of the military.

518
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:03,807
Starfleet has kept peace
for 1 00 years.

519
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,810
I cannot subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

520
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,812
You may be right, Doctor,

521
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,314
but what about Reliant?

522
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,191
She's on her way.

523
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,036
We have a problem.

524
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,914
Something may be wrong
on Regula-1 .

525
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,875
We've been ordered
to investigate.

526
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,293
If memory serves,

527
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,796
Regula-1 is a scientific
research laboratory.

528
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,798
I told
Starfleet command

529
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:39,801
all we had was
a boatload of children,

530
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:43,305
but we're the only ship
in the quadrant.

531
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,807
Spock, these cadets
of yours-

532
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:49,311
How will they respond
under real pressure?

533
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,813
As with all
living things,

534
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,316
each according
to his gifts.

535
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,319
Of course,
the ship is yours.

536
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,821
No, that won't
be necessary.

537
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:03,492
Just get me
to Regula-1 .

538
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,870
As a teacher on
a training mission,

539
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,873
I am content to command
the Enterprise.

540
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,875
If we go on duty,

541
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,628
the senior officer
must assume command.

542
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,381
It may be nothing.

543
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,383
Garbled communications.

544
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,886
You take the ship.

545
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,889
You proceed from
a false assumption.

546
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,891
I am a Vulcan.

547
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,394
I have no ego
to bruise.

548
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,981
You're about
to remind me

549
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,899
logic alone
dictates your actions?

550
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,402
I would not
remind you

551
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,904
of that which
you know so well.

552
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:42,906
It was a mistake

553
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,367
for you to accept
promotion.

554
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:49,413
Commanding a starship
is your first, best destiny.

555
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,916
Anything else is
a waste of material.

556
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,003
I would not presume
to debate you.

557
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,880
That is wise.

558
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:01,341
In any case,
were I to invoke logic,

559
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,344
Logic dictates that the needs
of the many

560
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,847
outweigh the needs
of the few.

561
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,933
Or the one.

562
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,399
You're my
superior officer.

563
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,902
You are
also my friend.

564
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:24,573
I have been and
always shall be yours.

565
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,911
Stop the energizers.

566
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,913
Put me on speakers.

567
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,417
An emergency situation
has arisen.

568
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,920
By order
of Starfleet command,

569
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:42,090
I'm assuming command
of this vessel.

570
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,843
So note in Ship's Log.

571
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,804
Plot a new course
for Regula-1 .

572
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,848
Mr. Scott.

573
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,350
Aye, sir.

574
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:54,228
We'll be going
to warp speed.

575
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,356
Course plotted
for Regula-1 , Admiral.

576
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,691
Engage warp engines.

577
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,860
Prepare for warp speed.

578
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,362
Ready, sir.

579
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:07,616
I know none of you
were expecting this.

580
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:12,746
I'm asking you to grow up
sooner than you expected.

581
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:14,873
Warp five, Sulu.

582
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,670
So much for the little
training cruise.

583
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,556
Course to intercept
Enterprise ready, sir.

584
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,349
Excellent.

585
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,392
Helmsman?

586
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,519
Sir. May I speak?

587
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,902
We're all
with you, sir.

588
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,904
But consider this-

589
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:47,906
We are free.

590
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,411
We have the means
to go where we will.

591
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,913
We have escaped
permanent exile

592
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,957
on Ceti Alpha V.

593
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,377
You have proved
your superior intellect

594
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,380
and defeated the plans
of Admiral Kirk.

595
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:07,384
You do not need
to defeat him again.

596
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,387
He tasks me.

597
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,391
He tasks me,
and I shall have him.

598
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,395
I'll chase him
round the moons of Nibia

599
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:22,399
and round
the Antares Maelstrom

600
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:23,901
and round
perdition's flames

601
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,403
before I give him up.

602
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,366
Prepare to alter course.

603
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:35,370
Space Station Regula-1 ,
please come in.

604
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,873
Dr. Marcus,
please respond.

605
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,877
This is
Enterprise call-

606
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,879
It's no use.

607
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,881
There's no response.

608
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,883
But no longer jammed.

609
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:49,885
No, sir.
No nothing.

610
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:58,143
There are
two possibilities-

611
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:00,145
they are unable
to respond,

612
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,064
they are unwilling
to respond.

613
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,857
How far?

614
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:06,860
12 hours, 43 minutes,
present speed.

615
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:11,365
"Give up Genesis,"
she said.

616
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,867
Give it up to whom?

617
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:17,871
It might help if I knew
what Genesis was,

618
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:19,873
beyond the biblical
reference.

619
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:23,877
Have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

620
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,880
Mr. Saavik,
you have the con.

621
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:34,888
Well, I've got
sickbay ready.

622
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,891
Please tell me
what's going on.

623
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,894
Computer, request
security procedure

624
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,314
and access to
Project Genesis summary.

625
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:47,651
Identify for retina scan.

626
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,903
Kirk, Admiral James T.

627
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:00,414
Security scan approved.

628
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:01,748
Summary, please.

629
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,421
Project Genesis.

630
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,090
A proposal
to the Federation.

631
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,842
Carol Marcus.

632
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,135
Yes.

633
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,345
What exactly is Genesis?

634
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,347
Well, put simply,

635
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:20,893
Genesis is life
from lifelessness.

636
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:24,396
It is a process
where by molecular structure

637
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,399
is reorganized
at the subatomic level

638
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,903
into life-generating matter
of equal mass.

639
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:34,406
Stage One was conducted
in the laboratory.

640
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:38,911
Stage Two will be attempted
in a lifeless underground.

641
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:42,915
Stage Three will be processed
on a planetary scale.

642
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:46,418
We intend to introduce
the Genesis device

643
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,422
into an area
of a lifeless space body-

644
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:53,425
a moon or other dead form.

645
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,428
The device is delivered,
instantaneously causing

646
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,431
what we call
the Genesis Effect.

647
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:02,851
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

648
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,368
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

649
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:22,371
capable of sustaining
whatever life forms

650
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,874
we see fit
to deposit on it.

651
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,376
Fascinating.

652
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,878
The reformed moon
simulated here

653
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,880
represents the merest fraction

654
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:33,882
of the Genesis potential,

655
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,885
should the Federation
fund these experiments.

656
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,890
When we consider the problems
of population and food supply,

657
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:45,727
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

658
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,439
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you.

659
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,401
It literally is Genesis.

660
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,112
Power of creation.

661
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,907
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

662
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:01,368
The tape was made
last year.

663
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,496
I assume they've
reached Stage Two.

664
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,876
Dear Lord, do you think we're
intelligent enough to...

665
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:12,379
Suppose...
What if this were used

666
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,548
where life
already exists?

667
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,383
It would destroy
such life

668
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:19,136
in favor
of its new matrix.

669
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,054
Its new matrix.

670
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,391
Do you know
what you're saying?

671
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,895
I was not evaluating
its moral implications.

672
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,564
As a matter
of cosmic history,

673
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,941
it's been easier
to destroy

674
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:34,443
than to create.

675
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,404
Not anymore.
Now we can do both simultaneously.

676
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:41,909
According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.

677
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,120
Now Genesis will do it
in six minutes.

678
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:48,665
Really, Dr. McCoy, you must
govern your passions.

679
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,168
They will be
your undoing.

680
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,337
Logic suggests-

681
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,007
My God, the man's
talking about logic.

682
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,510
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

683
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,304
You green-blooded,
inhuman-

684
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:06,141
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area

685
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,809
closing fast.

686
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,312
What do you
make of her?

687
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:12,314
It's one of ours.
It's Reliant.

688
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:13,482
Reliant?

689
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,612
Try the emergency channels.

690
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,035
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

691
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:43,846
Slow to 1/2 impulse power.

692
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,348
Let's be friends.

693
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,560
Slowing to 1/2
impulse power.

694
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,019
Reliant
in our section.

695
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:53,856
This quadrant, sir,
and slowing.

696
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:56,859
Sir, may I quote
general order 1 2?

697
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:59,862
"When communications
have not been established-"

698
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:02,281
The Admiral is well aware

699
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,283
of the regulations.

700
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:06,285
Aye, sir.

701
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:12,791
Could their Comm system
have failed?

702
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,794
It would explain
many things.

703
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:18,297
They're requesting
communication, sir.

704
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,966
Let them eat static.

705
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:25,596
They're still running
with shields down.

706
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:26,805
Of course.

707
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:29,808
We are one big happy fleet.

708
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:33,812
Ah, Kirk,
my old friend.

709
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:36,857
Do you know
the Klingon proverb

710
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:40,360
that tells us
revenge is a dish

711
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:42,863
that is best served cold?

712
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:48,577
It is very cold in space.

713
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,880
This is damn peculiar.

714
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:03,091
Yellow alert.

715
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:04,801
Energize defense fields.

716
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,809
I'm getting
a voice message.

717
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:16,855
Their chambers coil is overloading
their Comm system.

718
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:17,898
Spock?

719
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,024
Scanning.

720
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,943
Their coil emissions
are normal.

721
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,114
They still haven't raised
their shields.

722
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,616
Raise ours.

723
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:31,203
Shields going up.

724
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,121
Lock phasers on target.

725
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,999
Locking phasers
on target.

726
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,084
Locking phasers.

727
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,085
Raise shields.

728
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:39,086
Fire!

729
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:50,639
Aah!

730
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,519
Get those shields up!

731
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:56,520
Trying, sir.

732
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,128
I can't get power.

733
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:24,173
Scotty!

734
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:26,967
Get off those channels!

735
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,677
Mr. Scott
on the screen.

736
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,763
I'm just
hanging on, sir.

737
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,765
The main energizer's out.

738
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,851
Try auxiliary power.

739
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,227
Aye, aye, sir.

740
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:38,270
Damage report.

741
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:47,821
They knew exactly
where to hit us.

742
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:50,824
Who? Who knew where
to hit us? And why?

743
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:52,367
One thing is certain.

744
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,870
We cannot escape
on auxiliary power.

745
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:57,873
Visual.

746
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,044
Sulu, divert power
to phasers.

747
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,253
Too late.

748
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:04,630
Hang on!

749
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:17,726
Scotty, what's left?

750
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:19,228
Just the battery, sir.

751
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,231
I can have auxiliary power
in a few minutes.

752
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:24,775
We don't have
a few minutes!

753
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,907
Can you give me
phaser power?

754
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,659
A few shots, sir.

755
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,494
Not enough against
their shields.

756
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,037
Who the hell are they?

757
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,790
Admiral, the Reliant's
commander is signaling.

758
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:42,334
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

759
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,554
Put it on screen.

760
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:54,555
Admiral.

761
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:56,390
Do it!

762
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,392
While we still have time.

763
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,566
On screen, sir.

764
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,075
Khan.

765
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:18,287
You still remember, Admiral.

766
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,248
I cannot help
but be touched.

767
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,792
I, of course,
remember you.

768
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:26,253
What's the meaning
of this attack?

769
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,255
Where's the crew
of the Reliant?

770
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,758
Surely, I have made
my meaning plain.

771
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:35,512
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

772
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,514
I deprived your ship
of power,

773
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:39,016
and when I swing around,

774
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:42,436
I mean to deprive you
of your life.

775
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,938
But I wanted you
to know first

776
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,608
who it was
who had beaten you.

777
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,068
Khan...

778
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:55,032
if it's me you want,

779
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,576
I'll have myself
beamed aboard.

780
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,161
Spare my crew.

781
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,955
I make you
a counterproposal.

782
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,666
I'll agree
to your terms if...

783
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,084
if...

784
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,586
in addition
to yourself,

785
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:12,090
you hand over to me
all data and material

786
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:15,260
regarding the project
called Genesis.

787
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,970
Genesis? What's that?

788
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,890
Don't insult
my intelligence, Kirk.

789
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:23,268
Give me time to recall
the data on our computers.

790
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:26,522
I give you
60 seconds, Admiral.

791
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:34,404
Clear the bridge.

792
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,121
At least we know he doesn't
have Genesis.

793
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:46,124
Keep nodding as though
I'm still giving orders.

794
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,627
Mr. Saavik,
punch up the data charts

795
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,045
of Reliant's
command console.

796
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,588
Reliant's Command?

797
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,589
Hurry.

798
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:53,924
The prefix code?

799
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:54,967
It's all we've got.

800
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,850
Chart's up, sir.

801
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:03,851
Admiral.

802
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,352
We're finding it.

803
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,397
Admiral.

804
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,441
Please. Please,
you've got to give us time.

805
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:12,985
The bridge is smashed.

806
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,486
The computer's inoperative.

807
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:17,114
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

808
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:25,789
Damn!

809
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:28,083
Admiral?

810
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,169
It's coming through
now, Khan.

811
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,718
Reliant's prefix number
is 1 6309.

812
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,219
I don't understand.

813
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,222
You have to learn why things work
on a starship.

814
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,184
Each ship has its own
combination code...

815
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:49,563
to prevent an enemy from doing
what we're attempting.

816
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,440
We're using
our console

817
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:54,443
to order Reliant
to lower her shields.

818
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,445
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination.

819
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:58,030
He's quite intelligent.

820
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,948
1 5 seconds, Admiral.

821
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:07,414
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

822
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:10,417
I've given you
no word to keep, Admiral.

823
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:13,712
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

824
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,425
I see your point.

825
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,179
Stand by to receive
our transmission.

826
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,724
Mr. Sulu,
lock phasers on target

827
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:27,226
and await my command.

828
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,560
Phasers locked.

829
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:32,689
Time's up, Admiral.

830
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,942
Here it comes.

831
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,443
Now, Mr. Spock.

832
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,452
Sir, our shields are dropping.

833
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,413
Raise them!

834
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:51,166
I can't!

835
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,838
Where's the override?
The override?

836
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,214
Fire!

837
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,009
Fire!

838
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:06,849
Fire!

839
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,850
Fire!

840
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,351
We can't, sir!

841
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,853
Why can't you?

842
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,605
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive.

843
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,107
We must withdraw!

844
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,191
No! No!

845
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,192
We must!

846
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:25,742
Enterprise will wait.

847
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,370
She's not
going anywhere.

848
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,921
Sir, you did it.

849
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,841
I did nothing...

850
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:43,844
except get caught
with my britches down.

851
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,846
I must be
getting senile.

852
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:50,392
Mr. Saavik, you go right
on quoting regulations.

853
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,894
Meantime, let's find out

854
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,896
how badly
we've been hurt.

855
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,779
Is the word given, Admiral?

856
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,280
The word is given.

857
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,408
Warp speed.

858
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,079
Aye.

859
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:10,722
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

860
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,391
Admiral, this is Spock.

861
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:14,810
Yes, Spock.

862
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,813
Engine room reports
auxiliary power restored.

863
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,357
We can proceed
at impulse power.

864
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,443
Best speed to Regula-1 .
Kirk out.

865
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,945
I'm sorry, Scotty.

866
00:57:26,855 --> 00:57:30,359
Approaching Regula
at Space Lab Regula-1.

867
00:57:30,442 --> 00:57:31,860
Space Station Regula-1,

868
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,737
this is
the starship Enterprise.

869
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,239
Please come in.

870
00:57:38,784 --> 00:57:41,704
Space Station Regula-1,
do you read?

871
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:47,001
Space Station Regula-1,
this is Enterprise.

872
00:57:47,084 --> 00:57:48,210
Please acknowledge.

873
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:53,215
This is Enterprise.
Do you read me?

874
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:58,721
Space Station Regula-1 ,
do you read?

875
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:00,514
Please come in.

876
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:02,016
There's no response, sir.

877
00:58:05,603 --> 00:58:06,604
Sensors, Captain.

878
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,564
Scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

879
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:11,567
There's no way to ascertain
what's inside the station.

880
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:15,070
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

881
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:16,155
Precisely.

882
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:19,074
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

883
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:21,577
Regula is Class D.

884
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,830
It consists of various
unremarkable ores,

885
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:26,832
essentially
a great rock in space.

886
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:29,376
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

887
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,003
A distinct possibility.

888
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:34,173
Engineering.

889
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:35,507
Aye, sir.

890
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:39,386
Mr. Scott, do you have enough power
for transporters?

891
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,888
Barely, sir.

892
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,350
I'm going down there.

893
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,851
Khan could be
down there.

894
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:48,354
He's been there.
Can you spare someone?

895
00:58:48,395 --> 00:58:49,855
There may be people hurt.

896
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,357
Yeah. I can spare me.

897
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:52,858
Begging the Admiral's pardon.

898
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,360
General order 1 5.

899
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,862
"No flag officer shall beam
into a hazardous area

900
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:58,405
without armed escort."

901
00:58:58,489 --> 00:58:59,990
There's no such regulation.

902
00:59:04,578 --> 00:59:05,996
All right.
Join the party.

903
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,498
Mr. Spock,
the ship is yours.

904
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,708
Jim, be careful.

905
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:11,835
We will.

906
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:37,528
Indeterminate life signs.

907
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:42,741
Phasers on stun.

908
00:59:46,745 --> 00:59:47,705
Move out.

909
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:51,060
Aah.

910
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:54,063
Jim!

911
01:01:04,782 --> 01:01:06,617
Well, rigor hasn't set in.

912
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:09,703
This couldn't have happened
too long ago, Jim.

913
01:01:09,787 --> 01:01:11,038
Carol.

914
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:14,041
This is Enterprise
calling Space Lab Regula-1 .

915
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:15,125
Respond, please.

916
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:18,170
Admiral. Over here.

917
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:20,464
Dr. Marcus,
come in, please.

918
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:46,740
Oh, my God.

919
01:01:46,824 --> 01:01:48,742
Please acknowledge signal.
Please-

920
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:51,745
Commander Uhura,
this is Lieutenant Saavik.

921
01:01:51,787 --> 01:01:55,708
We're all right.
Please standby. Out.

922
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,503
Oh, sir,
it was Khan.

923
01:01:59,587 --> 01:02:02,464
We found him
on Ceti Alpha V.

924
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:03,465
Easy. Easy.

925
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:04,466
He...

926
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:09,471
he put creatures
in our bodies

927
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:12,391
to control our minds.

928
01:02:12,474 --> 01:02:15,394
It's all right.
You're safe now.

929
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,396
Made us say lies...

930
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:18,898
do things...

931
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:20,900
but we beat him.

932
01:02:20,983 --> 01:02:25,404
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

933
01:02:25,487 --> 01:02:26,906
The Captain was strong.

934
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:27,990
Captain...

935
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:30,618
where's Dr. Marcus?

936
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:33,996
Where are the
Genesis materials?

937
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,497
He couldn't find them.

938
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:38,000
Even the data banks
were empty.

939
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,418
Erased?

940
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:41,420
He tortured
those people.

941
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:44,423
But none of them
would tell him anything.

942
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:46,425
He went wild.

943
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:48,427
He slit their throats.

944
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:52,932
He wanted to tear the place apart,
but he was late.

945
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:55,434
He had to get back
to the Reliant

946
01:02:55,517 --> 01:02:57,978
in time
to blow you to bits.

947
01:02:58,062 --> 01:03:00,564
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

948
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,777
Marooned
on Ceti Alpha V.

949
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,278
He's completely
mad, Admiral.

950
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:09,323
He blames you for the death
of his wife.

951
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:12,326
I know what
he blames me for.

952
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,999
The escape pods
are all in place.

953
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,336
Where's the transporter room?

954
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:24,922
Did he make it
down here?

955
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,423
It was not
my impression.

956
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:28,425
He spent most
of his time

957
01:03:28,509 --> 01:03:31,428
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

958
01:03:31,512 --> 01:03:32,429
Anything?

959
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:34,431
The unit's been left on,

960
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:37,351
which means nobody remained
to turn it off.

961
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:38,852
Those people back there

962
01:03:38,894 --> 01:03:41,939
bought escape time for Genesis
with their lives.

963
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,941
This is not logical.

964
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:46,443
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

965
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:48,946
a planetoid we know
to be lifeless.

966
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,992
If Stage Two
is completed,

967
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:54,994
it was going
to be underground.

968
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:57,997
It was going to be
underground, she said.

969
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,498
Stage Two of what?

970
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,376
Kirk to Enterprise.

971
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:03,544
Spock here.

972
01:04:03,627 --> 01:04:05,588
Captain Spock,
damage report.

973
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:08,591
Admiral,
if we go by the book,

974
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:10,092
like Lieutenant Saavik,

975
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:12,303
hours could seem
like days.

976
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:15,306
I read you, Captain.
Let's have it.

977
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,308
The situation
is grave, Admiral.

978
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:20,311
We won't have main power
for six days.

979
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:22,813
Auxiliary power
has temporarily failed.

980
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:26,066
Restoration maybe possible
in two days.

981
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,610
By the book, Admiral.

982
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:30,613
Meaning you can't
even beam us back?

983
01:04:30,654 --> 01:04:32,114
Not at present.

984
01:04:34,658 --> 01:04:35,743
Captain Spock...

985
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:38,662
if you don't hear from us
within one hour,

986
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:41,749
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

987
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,752
take the Enterprise to the nearest
star base,

988
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:47,171
and alert
Starfleet command.

989
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:49,173
Sir, we won't
leave you behind.

990
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:51,675
Uhura, if you don't
hear from us,

991
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:55,179
there won't be anybody behind.
Kirk out.

992
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:58,182
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

993
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,184
If it's all the same,
Admiral,

994
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:03,020
we'd like
to share the risk.

995
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:04,980
Right. Let's go.

996
01:05:05,022 --> 01:05:05,981
Saavik?

997
01:05:07,274 --> 01:05:09,193
Go? Where are we going?

998
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:10,694
Where they went.

999
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,823
Suppose they went nowhere?

1000
01:05:14,865 --> 01:05:17,826
Then this will be
your big chance

1001
01:05:17,868 --> 01:05:20,329
to get away
from it all.

1002
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:49,233
Admiral.

1003
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,416
Genesis, I presume.

1004
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,301
Phasers down!

1005
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:17,970
You!

1006
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:27,271
Where's Dr. Marcus?

1007
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:28,772
I'm Dr. Marcus.

1008
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:29,773
Jim!

1009
01:06:42,953 --> 01:06:44,371
Is that David?

1010
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:48,292
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

1011
01:06:49,752 --> 01:06:52,254
Oh, of course he didn't.

1012
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:54,757
David, you're just
making this harder.

1013
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,759
I'm afraid
it's even harder

1014
01:06:56,842 --> 01:06:58,510
than you think, Doctor.

1015
01:06:58,594 --> 01:07:00,095
Please...

1016
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:01,722
don't move.

1017
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:02,890
Chekov?

1018
01:07:02,973 --> 01:07:05,392
I'm...

1019
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:06,685
sorry, Admiral.

1020
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:11,065
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

1021
01:07:14,443 --> 01:07:17,279
I have indeed, Captain.

1022
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:18,614
You have done well.

1023
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:21,617
I knew it.
You son of a bitch!

1024
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:24,870
Don't move, anybody!

1025
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:26,205
Captain?

1026
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:28,082
We are waiting.

1027
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,042
What's the delay?

1028
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,544
All is well, sir.

1029
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:34,255
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

1030
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:39,593
First things first, Captain.

1031
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:44,473
Kill Admiral Kirk.

1032
01:07:54,858 --> 01:07:57,528
Sir, it is difficult. I...

1033
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:59,530
I try to obey, but...

1034
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:01,198
Kill him.

1035
01:08:01,282 --> 01:08:02,449
I...

1036
01:08:04,326 --> 01:08:05,244
Aah!

1037
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,918
Kill him, Terrell, now!

1038
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:19,258
Aah!

1039
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:26,181
Aah!

1040
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,735
God sakes!

1041
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,280
What is it?

1042
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,302
Khan, you bloodsucker!

1043
01:09:03,427 --> 01:09:06,138
You'll have to do
your own dirty work now.

1044
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,641
Do you hear me?
Do you?

1045
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:11,644
Kirk.

1046
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,150
Kirk, you're still alive,
my old friend.

1047
01:09:18,192 --> 01:09:22,154
Still, "old friend."

1048
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:25,157
You've managed to kill just about
everyone else.

1049
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,159
But like
a poor marksman,

1050
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:29,411
you keep missing
the target!

1051
01:09:38,504 --> 01:09:41,715
Perhaps I no longer
need to try, Admiral.

1052
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:48,806
Oh, no!

1053
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:50,307
They can't take it.

1054
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:54,228
Khan?

1055
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,569
Khan, you've got Genesis,

1056
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,987
but you don't
have me.

1057
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,489
If you're going
to kill me, Khan,

1058
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:08,993
you're going to have to
come down here!

1059
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:12,079
I've done far worse
than kill you.

1060
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:17,668
I've hurt you,

1061
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,547
and I wish to go on
hurting you.

1062
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:26,844
I shall leave you
as you left me-

1063
01:10:26,927 --> 01:10:29,263
as you left her-

1064
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:31,473
marooned for all eternity

1065
01:10:31,515 --> 01:10:34,768
in the center
of a dead planet.

1066
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:38,230
Buried alive.

1067
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:41,442
Buried alive.

1068
01:10:41,525 --> 01:10:43,152
Khan!

1069
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:46,864
Khan!

1070
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:54,622
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise.

1071
01:10:54,705 --> 01:10:56,874
Can you read us?

1072
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:58,876
This is Lieutenant Saavik.
Calling Enterprise.

1073
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:00,377
Can you read us?

1074
01:11:00,461 --> 01:11:01,837
He's coming around.

1075
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:03,714
Can you read us?

1076
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,843
It's no use, Admiral.

1077
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:10,095
They're still jamming
all channels.

1078
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,098
If the Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

1079
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:16,310
If she couldn't obey,
she's finished.

1080
01:11:16,393 --> 01:11:18,812
So are we,
it looks like.

1081
01:11:20,397 --> 01:11:23,317
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?

1082
01:11:24,693 --> 01:11:26,111
Who is Khan?

1083
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:28,155
Well, it's a long story.

1084
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,658
We appear to have
plenty of time.

1085
01:11:33,911 --> 01:11:35,829
Is there
anything to eat?

1086
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:38,832
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

1087
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,336
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

1088
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:44,630
First order
of business-survival.

1089
01:11:44,713 --> 01:11:47,633
There is food
in the Genesis cave,

1090
01:11:47,716 --> 01:11:50,135
enough to last
a lifetime...

1091
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,138
if necessary.

1092
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,099
We thought
this was Genesis.

1093
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,141
This?

1094
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:01,397
It took the Starfleet
corps of engineers

1095
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,442
1 0 months in space suits
to tunnel out all this.

1096
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:09,113
What we did in there,
we did in a day.

1097
01:12:09,196 --> 01:12:12,324
David, why don't you show

1098
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:13,826
Dr. McCoy
and the lieutenant

1099
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,327
our idea of food?

1100
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:17,246
We can't just sit here.

1101
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:20,541
Oh, yes, we can.

1102
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:25,045
This is just to give us
something to do, isn't it?

1103
01:12:26,547 --> 01:12:27,506
Come on.

1104
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:36,390
Admiral?

1105
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,270
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond to say,

1106
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:44,773
I like to think that there always
are possibilities.

1107
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:58,787
I did what you wanted.

1108
01:12:58,871 --> 01:13:00,289
I stayed away.

1109
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:04,001
Why didn't you tell him?

1110
01:13:05,794 --> 01:13:08,923
How can you
ask me that?

1111
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:11,425
Were we together?

1112
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,844
Were we going to be?

1113
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:16,972
You had your world,
and I had mine.

1114
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,601
And I wanted him in mine,

1115
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:23,604
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

1116
01:13:34,365 --> 01:13:35,366
Actually...

1117
01:13:37,076 --> 01:13:39,119
he's a lot like you...

1118
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:41,038
in many ways.

1119
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,418
Please tell me
what you're feeling.

1120
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:55,261
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 1 5 years

1121
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:56,762
who's trying to kill me.

1122
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:02,685
You show me a son
that would be happy to help.

1123
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:05,729
My son.

1124
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:13,237
My life that
could have been...

1125
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,738
and wasn't.

1126
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,451
What am I feeling?

1127
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:24,915
Old.

1128
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:29,712
Worn-out.

1129
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:40,180
Let me show you something

1130
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:43,225
that will
make you feel young

1131
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:45,728
as when the world
was new.

1132
01:14:58,866 --> 01:15:00,618
Impulse power restored.

1133
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,954
Excellent.

1134
01:15:03,996 --> 01:15:06,957
More than a match
for poor Enterprise.

1135
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:30,898
You did all this
in a day?

1136
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:33,651
The matrix formed
in a day.

1137
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:35,653
The life forms
grew later

1138
01:15:35,736 --> 01:15:38,906
at a substantially
accelerated rate.

1139
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:45,037
Jim! This is incredible!

1140
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:47,540
Have you ever
seen the like?

1141
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,961
Can I cook
or can't l?

1142
01:16:10,688 --> 01:16:12,273
Where is she?

1143
01:16:17,695 --> 01:16:20,656
Sir, may I ask you
a question?

1144
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:22,116
What's on your mind?

1145
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,118
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

1146
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:26,662
You're asking if we're playing out
that scenario?

1147
01:16:26,704 --> 01:16:28,163
On the test, sir.

1148
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:31,125
Will you tell me
what you did?

1149
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,127
I would really like
to know.

1150
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:37,548
Lieutenant, you're looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

1151
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,551
who ever beat
the no-win scenario.

1152
01:16:40,593 --> 01:16:41,844
How?

1153
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:43,345
I reprogrammed
the simulation

1154
01:16:43,429 --> 01:16:46,015
so it was possible
to rescue the ship.

1155
01:16:46,098 --> 01:16:47,725
What?

1156
01:16:47,766 --> 01:16:49,351
He cheated.

1157
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:52,354
Changed the conditions
of the test.

1158
01:16:52,438 --> 01:16:55,232
Got a commendation
for original thinking.

1159
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:57,276
I don't like to lose.

1160
01:16:57,318 --> 01:17:00,321
Then you never faced
that situation...

1161
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:01,405
faced death.

1162
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:04,283
I don't believe
in the no-win scenario.

1163
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:07,578
Kirk to Spock.

1164
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,580
It's two hours.
Are you ready?

1165
01:17:09,622 --> 01:17:12,708
Right on schedule.
Just give us your coordinates,

1166
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,210
and we'll
beam you aboard.

1167
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:15,211
All right.

1168
01:17:18,923 --> 01:17:20,799
I don't like to lose.

1169
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,301
We were immobilized.

1170
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:25,137
Captain Spock said
it would be two days.

1171
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:26,639
You go by the book.

1172
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,140
Spock, you know Dr. Marcus.

1173
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:29,141
Of course.

1174
01:17:29,183 --> 01:17:30,643
Hello, Mr. Spock.

1175
01:17:30,684 --> 01:17:32,102
I'm taking them
to sickbay.

1176
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:33,604
By the book?

1177
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:36,232
By the book.
Regulation 46a-

1178
01:17:36,315 --> 01:17:39,360
"If transmissions are being
monitored during battle...

1179
01:17:39,443 --> 01:17:41,862
no uncoded messages
on an open channel."

1180
01:17:45,115 --> 01:17:46,033
You lied.

1181
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,369
I exaggerated.

1182
01:17:48,452 --> 01:17:50,037
Hours instead of days.

1183
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,040
Now we have minutes
instead of hours.

1184
01:17:56,252 --> 01:17:57,711
They're inoperative
below C-Deck.

1185
01:17:57,753 --> 01:17:59,213
What is working
around here?

1186
01:17:59,255 --> 01:18:01,715
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

1187
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:02,633
That's it?

1188
01:18:02,716 --> 01:18:04,843
Best we can do
in two hours.

1189
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:25,072
Admiral on the bridge.

1190
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:26,073
Battle stations.

1191
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:30,077
Tactical.

1192
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:33,664
Uh-oh.

1193
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:39,128
She can still outrun us
and outgun us,

1194
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:42,631
But there is the Mutara Nebula
at 153 mark 4.

1195
01:18:42,715 --> 01:18:44,758
Scotty, can we make it inside?

1196
01:18:44,842 --> 01:18:47,303
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree,

1197
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:49,805
so don't give me
too many bumps.

1198
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:51,307
No promises.
On your way.

1199
01:18:51,348 --> 01:18:52,808
Trouble with
the nebula, sir,

1200
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,810
is all that static
discharging gas

1201
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:56,312
clouds our
tactical display.

1202
01:18:56,353 --> 01:18:59,356
Visual won't function,
and shields will be useless.

1203
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:03,068
Sauce for the goose,
Mr. Saavik.

1204
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:06,322
The odds will be even.

1205
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:41,565
Alley clear, sir.

1206
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:44,401
Repairing second.

1207
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:46,403
Ready to fire away 1 .

1208
01:19:52,243 --> 01:19:54,995
There she is!

1209
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:57,122
There she is.

1210
01:19:57,206 --> 01:19:59,750
Ahh.

1211
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:03,629
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

1212
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:05,214
So much the better.

1213
01:20:30,155 --> 01:20:34,702
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

1214
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:38,289
Reliant is closing.

1215
01:20:47,673 --> 01:20:51,093
If they go in there,
we'll lose them.

1216
01:20:51,176 --> 01:20:52,887
Explain it to them.

1217
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,690
That was close.

1218
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:07,359
They just don't want us
going in there.

1219
01:21:15,034 --> 01:21:16,952
One minute
to nebula perimeter.

1220
01:21:17,036 --> 01:21:18,537
Why are we slowing?

1221
01:21:19,914 --> 01:21:22,875
We daren't follow them
into the nebula, sir.

1222
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:24,877
Our shields
would be useless.

1223
01:21:27,713 --> 01:21:30,090
They are reducing speed.

1224
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:31,800
Uhura, patch me in.

1225
01:21:31,884 --> 01:21:33,761
Aye, sir.

1226
01:21:33,844 --> 01:21:35,262
You're on, Admiral.

1227
01:21:36,513 --> 01:21:37,932
This is Admiral Kirk.

1228
01:21:38,015 --> 01:21:40,434
We tried it once
your way, Khan.

1229
01:21:40,517 --> 01:21:42,561
Are you game
for a rematch?

1230
01:21:42,645 --> 01:21:44,438
Khan.

1231
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:48,484
I'm laughing at
the superior intellect.

1232
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:52,905
Full impulse power.

1233
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:54,448
No, sir!

1234
01:21:54,531 --> 01:21:57,493
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you-

1235
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:59,078
Full power!

1236
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:00,454
Damn you!

1237
01:22:05,793 --> 01:22:08,712
I'll say this for him-
he's consistent.

1238
01:22:10,214 --> 01:22:13,175
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

1239
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:23,310
Emergency lights.

1240
01:22:45,749 --> 01:22:46,876
Oh!

1241
01:22:53,883 --> 01:22:54,800
Tactical.

1242
01:22:57,011 --> 01:22:58,137
Inoperative.

1243
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:03,309
Raise the shields.

1244
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:07,438
As I feared, sir-
not functional.

1245
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:08,939
I'm reducing speed.

1246
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:51,982
Target, sir.

1247
01:23:52,066 --> 01:23:53,525
Phaser lock
inoperative, sir.

1248
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:56,403
Best guess, Mr. Sulu.
Fire when ready.

1249
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:05,621
Oh!

1250
01:24:05,704 --> 01:24:07,706
Aft torpedoes, fire!

1251
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,758
Hold your course.

1252
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:41,657
Phasers starboard!

1253
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,002
Aah!

1254
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:54,003
Fire!

1255
01:25:16,066 --> 01:25:17,526
Damage, Mr. Scott.

1256
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:23,490
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

1257
01:25:23,574 --> 01:25:25,534
It's radiation...

1258
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:26,952
Scotty.

1259
01:25:27,036 --> 01:25:28,412
Joachim.

1260
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:31,624
Yours...

1261
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,586
is a superior...

1262
01:25:43,427 --> 01:25:44,887
I shall avenge you.

1263
01:25:55,272 --> 01:25:58,234
Could you use
another hand, Admiral?

1264
01:25:58,275 --> 01:26:00,527
Man the weapons console,
Mr. Chekov.

1265
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:06,784
Spock.

1266
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:09,453
Sporadic energy readings,
port side aft.

1267
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:11,455
Could be
an impulse turn.

1268
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:16,544
He won't
break off now.

1269
01:26:16,627 --> 01:26:19,547
He followed me this far.
He'll be back.

1270
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:23,884
But from where?

1271
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:27,429
He's intelligent,
but not experienced.

1272
01:26:27,513 --> 01:26:30,891
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

1273
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:38,566
Full stop.

1274
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:40,067
Full stop, sir.

1275
01:26:41,402 --> 01:26:42,861
Z minus
10,000 meters.

1276
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:44,363
Stand by
photon torpedoes.

1277
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:39,627
Torpedoes ready, sir.

1278
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,306
Look sharp.

1279
01:27:56,268 --> 01:27:57,603
Fire.

1280
01:28:03,192 --> 01:28:04,151
Aah!

1281
01:28:04,193 --> 01:28:05,236
Fire.

1282
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:10,199
- Aah!
- Aah!

1283
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:16,789
Aah!

1284
01:28:37,935 --> 01:28:38,394
Uhura...

1285
01:28:38,394 --> 01:28:39,728
Uhura...

1286
01:28:39,812 --> 01:28:42,773
send to Commander, Reliant.

1287
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,275
Prepare to be boarded.

1288
01:28:44,316 --> 01:28:45,234
Aye, sir.

1289
01:28:46,944 --> 01:28:49,405
Commander, Reliant.
This is Enterprise.

1290
01:28:49,446 --> 01:28:53,200
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

1291
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:54,702
Enterprise to Reliant.

1292
01:28:54,785 --> 01:28:57,204
You are ordered to
surrender your vessel.

1293
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:58,205
Respond.

1294
01:29:09,466 --> 01:29:11,093
Reliant. Come in, Reliant.

1295
01:29:12,303 --> 01:29:15,139
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel.

1296
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,640
Enterprise to Reliant.

1297
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:19,852
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel. Respond.

1298
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:36,202
No, Kirk.

1299
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:39,496
The game's not over.

1300
01:30:16,116 --> 01:30:20,371
To the last
I will grapple with thee.

1301
01:30:34,677 --> 01:30:36,136
Admiral.

1302
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:39,723
Scanning an energy
source on Reliant.

1303
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:42,226
A pattern I've
never seen before.

1304
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:49,316
It's the Genesis wave.

1305
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:50,317
What?

1306
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:53,737
They're on a build-up
to detonation.

1307
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:54,738
How soon?

1308
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:56,574
We encoded four minutes.

1309
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:59,076
We'll beam aboard
and stop it.

1310
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:00,077
You can't.

1311
01:31:02,872 --> 01:31:05,833
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes

1312
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,376
or we're all dead.

1313
01:31:08,627 --> 01:31:10,045
No response, Admiral.

1314
01:31:10,129 --> 01:31:11,338
Scotty.

1315
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,300
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

1316
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:15,301
Aye, sir.

1317
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:55,591
Are you out
of your Vulcan mind?

1318
01:31:55,633 --> 01:31:58,093
No human can tolerate
the radiation in there!

1319
01:31:58,135 --> 01:32:00,596
As you are so fond
of observing, Doctor,

1320
01:32:00,638 --> 01:32:02,097
I am not human.

1321
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:04,975
You're not going in there.

1322
01:32:07,019 --> 01:32:08,812
Perhaps you're right.

1323
01:32:08,854 --> 01:32:11,357
What is
Mr. Scott's condition?

1324
01:32:11,398 --> 01:32:13,359
Well, I don't think
that he-

1325
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,818
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1326
01:32:14,902 --> 01:32:17,821
I have no time
to discuss this logically.

1327
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:23,077
Remember.

1328
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:35,881
Spock! Get out of there!

1329
01:32:35,965 --> 01:32:37,132
Spock!

1330
01:32:37,216 --> 01:32:39,176
Spock, get out of there!

1331
01:32:50,062 --> 01:32:51,480
Time, from my mark.

1332
01:32:51,564 --> 01:32:53,857
2 minutes, 10 seconds.

1333
01:32:53,899 --> 01:32:55,818
Engine room...

1334
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:56,819
what's happening?

1335
01:32:56,902 --> 01:32:59,196
Spock! Scotty...

1336
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,907
Good God, man!
Get out of there!

1337
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:03,033
No! Don't!

1338
01:33:03,117 --> 01:33:04,535
Spock! Spock!

1339
01:33:04,618 --> 01:33:05,870
Don't!

1340
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,775
Time.

1341
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:40,863
3 minutes, 30 seconds.

1342
01:33:46,702 --> 01:33:48,370
Distance from Reliant.

1343
01:33:48,454 --> 01:33:50,414
4,000 kilometers.

1344
01:33:50,497 --> 01:33:53,167
We're not going
to make it, are we?

1345
01:34:05,012 --> 01:34:06,347
No.

1346
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:10,392
No, you can't get away.

1347
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:17,149
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

1348
01:34:18,817 --> 01:34:21,111
For hate's sake,

1349
01:34:21,195 --> 01:34:26,200
I spit my last breath
at thee.

1350
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:40,756
Sir, the mains
are back on line.

1351
01:34:40,839 --> 01:34:42,591
Bless you, Scotty.
Go, Sulu!

1352
01:35:26,343 --> 01:35:28,804
My God, Carol,
look at it.

1353
01:35:40,733 --> 01:35:41,859
Engine room.

1354
01:35:43,569 --> 01:35:45,863
Well done, Scotty.

1355
01:35:45,946 --> 01:35:47,615
Jim...

1356
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:50,826
I think you'd better
get down here.

1357
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:51,869
Bones?

1358
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,663
Better hurry.

1359
01:35:57,917 --> 01:35:59,376
Saavik, take the con.

1360
01:36:27,747 --> 01:36:30,332
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

1361
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,334
He'll die.

1362
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:33,586
Sir, he's dead already.

1363
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,508
It's too late.

1364
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:03,407
Spock!

1365
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:35,231
Ship...

1366
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:38,150
out of danger?

1367
01:37:39,944 --> 01:37:40,945
Yes.

1368
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:47,076
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1369
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:51,163
It is logical.

1370
01:37:54,834 --> 01:37:58,004
The needs of the many
outweigh...

1371
01:38:00,339 --> 01:38:02,216
The needs of the few...

1372
01:38:03,384 --> 01:38:04,844
Or the one.

1373
01:38:13,644 --> 01:38:18,149
I never took
the Kobayashi Maru test...

1374
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:20,735
until now.

1375
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:26,115
What do you think
of my solution?

1376
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:29,493
Spock...

1377
01:38:39,378 --> 01:38:40,296
I...

1378
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:43,299
I have been...

1379
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,885
and always
shall be...

1380
01:38:45,926 --> 01:38:47,261
your friend.

1381
01:38:53,351 --> 01:38:54,810
Live long...

1382
01:38:56,437 --> 01:38:57,355
and prosper.

1383
01:39:19,627 --> 01:39:20,586
No.

1384
01:39:40,898 --> 01:39:43,526
We are assembled here today

1385
01:39:43,609 --> 01:39:46,529
To pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1386
01:39:52,118 --> 01:39:54,036
And yet it should be noted

1387
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,539
that in the midst
of our sorrow,

1388
01:39:56,622 --> 01:40:00,376
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

1389
01:40:00,418 --> 01:40:03,045
the sunrise of a new world,

1390
01:40:03,087 --> 01:40:05,214
a world
that our beloved comrade

1391
01:40:05,297 --> 01:40:07,133
gave his life to protect.

1392
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,010
He did not feel

1393
01:40:09,093 --> 01:40:12,013
this sacrifice a vain
or empty one,

1394
01:40:12,096 --> 01:40:14,515
and we will not debate
his profound wisdom

1395
01:40:14,598 --> 01:40:16,017
at these proceedings.

1396
01:40:19,395 --> 01:40:22,314
Of my friend,
I can only say this-

1397
01:40:26,986 --> 01:40:31,365
of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

1398
01:40:31,449 --> 01:40:32,867
his was the most...

1399
01:40:36,662 --> 01:40:37,621
human.

1400
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:41,292
Honors...

1401
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:42,293
Hup.

1402
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:07,336
Come.

1403
01:42:11,132 --> 01:42:13,050
I don't mean to intrude.

1404
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:16,095
No, not at all.

1405
01:42:16,178 --> 01:42:18,848
I should be
on the bridge.

1406
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:21,892
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1407
01:42:21,934 --> 01:42:25,187
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1408
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:26,731
Lieutenant Saavik
was right.

1409
01:42:28,024 --> 01:42:29,942
You never have
faced death.

1410
01:42:39,702 --> 01:42:41,120
No, not like this.

1411
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,667
I haven't faced death.

1412
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:48,169
I've cheated death.

1413
01:42:51,047 --> 01:42:54,008
I've tricked my way
out of death

1414
01:42:54,091 --> 01:42:57,511
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1415
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:02,266
I know nothing.

1416
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:04,268
You knew enough
to tell Saavik

1417
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:05,770
that how we faced death

1418
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:10,149
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1419
01:43:10,232 --> 01:43:11,484
Just words.

1420
01:43:11,567 --> 01:43:12,985
But good words.

1421
01:43:14,487 --> 01:43:16,947
That's where ideas begin.

1422
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:19,450
Maybe you should
listen to them.

1423
01:43:21,952 --> 01:43:23,871
I was wrong about you...

1424
01:43:24,997 --> 01:43:26,457
and I'm sorry.

1425
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,879
Is that what
you came here to say?

1426
01:43:33,798 --> 01:43:34,715
Mainly.

1427
01:43:41,472 --> 01:43:43,599
And also that I'm...

1428
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:46,018
proud.

1429
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:50,022
Very proud...

1430
01:43:50,106 --> 01:43:51,524
to be your son.

1431
01:44:21,178 --> 01:44:24,849
Captain 's Log. Stardate 8141.6.

1432
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:27,852
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1433
01:44:27,935 --> 01:44:30,855
to pick up the crew
of U.S.S. Reliant.

1434
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:32,356
All is well.

1435
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,859
And yet
I can't help wondering

1436
01:44:34,942 --> 01:44:37,069
about the friend
I leave behind.

1437
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:42,116
,'There are always
possibilities, ,'Spock said.

1438
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:45,161
And if Genesis is indeed

1439
01:44:45,202 --> 01:44:47,121
life from death...

1440
01:44:48,372 --> 01:44:51,334
I must return
to this place again.

1441
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,131
He's really not dead...

1442
01:44:58,424 --> 01:45:00,843
as long as
we remember him.

1443
01:45:06,974 --> 01:45:09,894
It's a far, far
better thing I do

1444
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:12,396
than I have
ever done before.

1445
01:45:14,273 --> 01:45:19,070
A far better
resting place I go to

1446
01:45:19,153 --> 01:45:21,155
than I have ever known.

1447
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:22,698
Is that a poem?

1448
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:23,699
No.

1449
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:27,370
Something Spock was trying
to tell me

1450
01:45:27,453 --> 01:45:28,871
on my birthday.

1451
01:45:28,954 --> 01:45:30,706
You OK, Jim?

1452
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,001
How do you feel?

1453
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:37,838
Young.

1454
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:43,928
I feel young.

1455
01:46:56,709 --> 01:47:00,838
Space,
