1
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:02,789
lt began so innocently.
They said it was strange a woman...

2
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:06,122
would want to publish a defense
of D.H. Lawrence...

3
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:10,357
and that his words are considered
an incitement to sex.

4
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:14,800
- Then he said, ''You write about sex--''
- With some authority, Miss Nin.

5
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,565
You must've led a rather free life.

6
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,005
Free?

7
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,235
You must've had a lot
of experience.

8
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,244
You know, affairs.

9
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,147
l'm interested in how you came...

10
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:31,981
to have such insights
into the erotic.

11
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:35,852
For literature.
Yes, l love Proust and--

12
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:45,725
l suppose my real awakening
came when my husband Hugo and l...

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,463
first arrived in Paris
and rented a bachelor apartment...

14
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:51,903
for the summer.

15
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:55,237
One day, l was tidying up.

16
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:58,472
As l was going through the closets...

17
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:01,913
where the owner left his belongings...

18
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,574
l discovered--

19
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,686
ln that closet...

20
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:18,623
l became familiar with the endless
varieties of erotic experience.

21
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,990
Come here.

22
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:34,507
- Hugo!
- l thought you might need a lift.

23
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,012
Are you all right, Pussy Willow?

24
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:53,456
- He kissed me.
- What? Oh, my God!

25
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,824
lt was just one kiss.

26
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,734
He kisses me once.

27
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,472
Then he caresses all of my body.

28
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:14,707
He seeks my breasts...

29
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:18,878
and my most secret,
sensitive part.

30
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,319
His hands are deft.

31
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:24,846
l'm tempted by unknown pleasures.

32
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,792
When l see that l have let him
be aroused...

33
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:31,524
l let him release his desire
between my legs.

34
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:33,532
l just let him...

35
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,534
out of pity.

36
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,696
l tell Hugo...

37
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,900
only part of the story.

38
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,896
Pussy Willow!

39
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,027
Remember to meet me at 8:00 tonight.

40
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:13,733
Oh, Hugo, would you mind very much
if l didn't go this evening?

41
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,671
l would mind.

42
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:21,613
l'm sorry, but all they talk about are
bad loans, trusts or estate planning.

43
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,549
Estate planning can be very creative!

44
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:36,121
Look, the bank is how we got to Paris.

45
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:40,496
l need this job and l admit
l sometimes enjoy it. Why not?

46
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,000
Why not?

47
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,601
You're changing into someone else.

48
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:49,904
You are even beginning to smell
like the bank.

49
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,411
l'm working so you can write.

50
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:57,409
l need to know people who are alive.

51
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:57,070
You're not consummating.
You're holding back.

52
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,078
Do it again.

53
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,281
l can't seem to concentrate anymore,
Eduardo.

54
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:11,381
My life? Sometimes l think
l need something else.

55
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,154
An older man,
a man stronger than l am.

56
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,057
You like to make me suffer.

57
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,459
l've loved you
since we were children, Anais.

58
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,767
But, l've always had a fear that...

59
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,773
l wouldn't be able to.

60
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:35,645
Look at them.
They're so exquisite.

61
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:39,777
lf l were a man,
l'd be swept away.

62
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:43,289
They don't move me like you do.

63
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:22,921
Hell of a place you got here, Hugo.
Peaceful.

64
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,689
Been here long?

65
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,497
-Just since the Crash.
-Since the Crash? How'd you live before?

66
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,504
We lived well.

67
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,870
This is Henry Miller, the American
writer Osborn is putting up. My wife.

68
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,914
- Anais Nin.
- How are you, Anais?

69
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,208
Eduardo Sanchez, Anais' cousin.

70
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:49,449
Anais, you ought to read Henry's stuff.
He's got it over D.H. Lawrence.

71
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:52,390
- l'd love to read what you've written.
- Henry hasn't been published yet.

72
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,427
And you're comparing him to Lawrence?

73
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,759
l don't want to be compared to Lawrence.
He would've hated the way l write.

74
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:01,392
-Henry writes for the man on the street.
-l don't care for his writing.

75
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,868
Anais has been writing a book
about Lawrence.

76
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,303
Perhaps his sexuality
is too strong for you.

77
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:09,069
Too strong? He's childish.
He's prudish.

78
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:12,942
The French have been writing
about this. Rabelais, Flaubert!

79
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:16,710
l can't imagine any modern writer
not to owe a debt to Lawrence.

80
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:17,875
We should eat.

81
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:21,580
He makes too much out of sex.
He makes a damn gospel out of it.

82
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:24,419
To my way of thinking,
sex is natural...

83
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,482
like birth or death.

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,552
l'm not interested in literature
or poetry as we know it.

85
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,564
What are you interested in?

86
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,998
- Henry writes about fucking.
- Fucking?

87
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,160
l'm writing about self-liberation.

88
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,966
- lt's definitely about fucking.
- We should eat something.

89
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,007
Amelia's waiting.

90
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:48,140
l flipped through more pages,
and l realize...

91
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:52,049
this is my own novel l'm reading
with some joker's name on it...

92
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,350
written in French, being sold
in the best bookstore in Paris.

93
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:58,880
- Unbelievable.
- How's that possible?

94
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,451
Remember last year when some guy stole
my briefcase with my manuscript in it?

95
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,365
This guy swiped my manuscript, but what
he doesn't realize is l'll get him.

96
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:11,871
The souffle is from
an old family recipe.

97
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:14,304
So this is a souffle!

98
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,442
l hope it's substantial enough.

99
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,045
This joker doesn't know l'll get him
because l'm a copyright lawyer.

100
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:31,716
l'll go after him
like l went after the other joker.

101
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,556
- The guy who stole your play.
- That's on Broadway.

102
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:38,325
That's on Broadway--
l told you this already?

103
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:42,129
About how this guy must've stolen
my play out of my briefcase?

104
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:44,966
l'd be a well-received writer by now
if it weren't for these jokers.

105
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:48,303
But l'll get them. l'm not taking
any chances. This is my new baby.

106
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,370
You're laughing at me?

107
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,109
l just feel so good. Wonderful.

108
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:59,016
What a fine moment we have here.
A free lunch.

109
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:02,487
Fire in the fireplace.
Wonderful wines.

110
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:07,821
The colors blue and orange.
lt's wonderful! No other word for it.

111
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:17,326
What do you write,
poetry or something?

112
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:20,862
Most of my writing
is in these diaries.

113
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:30,407
No, l never let anyone read it.

114
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,483
l never show it to anyone...

115
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,216
except Hugo...

116
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,723
sometimes.

117
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:47,627
l always wanted to read The Captive.
La Prisonnier.

118
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,712
l want you to have it.

119
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:05,275
l'll borrow it. Thanks.

120
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,979
Pussy Willow!

121
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:14,691
l used to go to the six-day bike races
we had in Brooklyn.

122
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,957
Yeah, l love bikes.

123
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,868
- But l couldn't take it.
- l want you to have it.

124
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,337
- What will you use?
- l'll borrow yours.

125
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:30,069
You can't ride a man's bike.
Henry should take mine.

126
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:33,673
Hey, thanks, Hugo.

127
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:37,478
That's swell of ya.
l can really use this.

128
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,018
l'll visit.

129
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,612
Come on, Eduardo, l'll race you
back to Paris before it gets dark.

130
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,623
On your mark.
Come on.

131
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:47,819
l don't race anymore. To me, a bike
is just a means of getting home.

132
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:49,589
Get set.

133
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:52,723
- You're no match for me.
- Are you set, Eduardo?

134
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,461
- l warn you l used to race.
- Go!

135
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:05,702
- l'd love to read something he wrote.
- Fat chance. He'll never get published.

136
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,849
l've met Henry Miller.

137
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,647
He is virile, flamboyant.

138
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,085
He is a man life intoxicates.

139
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,092
He is like me.

140
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,754
But he doesn't know it yet.

141
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,593
Henry's quite a character.

142
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,069
Good night.

143
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:33,969
'Night, Hugo.

144
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,412
- Let me help you.
- l'll be fine.

145
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,220
Osborn said he'd be home,
and l want to surprise Henry.

146
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,659
l thought you could use a hand.
You're all right?

147
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,993
Yes, l'm fine!

148
00:13:58,064 --> 00:14:00,396
l'll take the train,
and meet you home later.

149
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,731
l'll wait a minute just in case.

150
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:06,067
l don't want you to wait.

151
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,300
l'll see you tonight.

152
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:13,203
See you tonight.

153
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,992
Henry?

154
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,227
Osborn?

155
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,296
- Oh, excuse me!
- Oh, God, l forgot.

156
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,963
- l'm sorry.
- No, l'm sorry.

157
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:32,303
Oh, l'm sorry, l'm sorry. Wait.

158
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:11,095
Hiya, kid.
Slumming, huh?

159
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:15,171
l went to Osborn's place.
He told me where to find you.

160
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,678
l brought my typewriter.
l thought you should have it.

161
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,712
Can we go and sit down somewhere?

162
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,516
Why not?

163
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,718
There's a little cafe back here.

164
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:32,385
Come on.

165
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,331
That actress in the film...

166
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,240
she reminds you of someone.

167
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,639
A woman who obsesses you.

168
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,013
l know that feeling.

169
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,848
l'm often obsessed.

170
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,253
You oughta eat something, kid.
You eat like a bird.

171
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,495
All right, l'll tell ya.

172
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,022
June appeared like an angel.
l offered her a fool's fate.

173
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,035
She was a taxi dancer.

174
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,004
l paid my dime.

175
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,132
She put her head on my shoulder.

176
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,540
But then the lies began.

177
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,806
She told me her mother
was a Gypsy.

178
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,905
Her father was a count.

179
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:30,385
Later l saw a film and realized she
swiped her childhood out of the film.

180
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,118
And so?

181
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,556
So l married her.

182
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:43,322
She gave me the courage to quit my job
to write full time. She believed in me.

183
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:47,802
Somehow she got some money so
we could buy strawberries in the winter.

184
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,361
We're broke,
living in a dump in Brooklyn...

185
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,272
but we're living like kings.

186
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:05,410
Then one day she meets an artist.

187
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:08,286
Brings her home to live with us.

188
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,427
Pretty soon we're supporting Jean, too.

189
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,064
How is she getting the money?

190
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,070
- Pop.
- Pop?

191
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,505
Pop's her scam.

192
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:29,671
l found out about Pop only after
she barged in with a fistful of money...

193
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,407
and suggests l go to Paris to write.

194
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,813
Then she'll join me later.

195
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:38,047
l take one look into her lying eyes,
and say...

196
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,688
''Anything you say.''

197
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,521
Pack my bags
and l'm off to Europe.

198
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,695
But...

199
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,693
l'm not quite the sap
she takes me for.

200
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:56,128
Something tells me to double back...

201
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:57,968
and take a see.

202
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,919
But when l confront her,
she gets furious with me!

203
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:26,394
She said we would've starved
without Pop. ''Pop's my patron saint.''

204
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,259
Your patron saint?

205
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,322
Yeah. That's what she calls him.

206
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,733
Only she's been telling Pop
that it's her writing.

207
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:38,865
That's why Pop's been buying it,
because of her.

208
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,205
How you doing? Bonjour.

209
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,007
And l should be grateful.
She's done it all for me.

210
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,084
Then she says, ''l love you.''

211
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,551
And everything else vanishes.

212
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,612
ln that moment, l lived eternities.

213
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,626
Why does she get angry, hurt,
jealous or cruel?

214
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:02,061
Why does she lie?
That l can't understand.

215
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,998
Maybe you're not asking
the right questions.

216
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,535
Oh, yeah?
What would you ask?

217
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,565
l'd asked:
What makes her lies necessary?

218
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,336
What is she afraid of?

219
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,503
Who is she afraid of?

220
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,672
The kinds of things a woman would ask.

221
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:21,111
A woman?

222
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:25,882
Excuse me, pal. Could you spring
for a few francs? l'm short today.

223
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,388
Beat it!

224
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,552
l could give you some money
if you need it.

225
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:34,289
Thanks. That's swell of ya.

226
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,558
Careful.

227
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,600
See you, kid.
You can get home okay?

228
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,158
Yes, of course. l'll be fine.

229
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,832
Should be taxis all the time.
A lot of your swanky types come here.

230
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:46,534
See ya.

231
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:40,887
l'm getting interesting
shadowy images.

232
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,734
l like it.

233
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,009
You fall in love
with people's minds.

234
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,483
l'm afraid l could lose you
to Henry.

235
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,389
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,381
He's so rough!

237
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,487
He calls me ''kid.''

238
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,263
l hate him.

239
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,835
He's a parasite, an egoist.

240
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,668
Maybe it's just jealousy.

241
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,905
What are you jealous of?

242
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:35,539
His life seems
so full of pain and chaos.

243
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,178
He has someone who drives him
to pain and chaos.

244
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:12,912
Anais, meet my wife June.

245
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:18,422
Thanks for taking care of Henry.

246
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,327
He didn't describe you right.

247
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,366
You didn't, Henry.

248
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:31,506
The colors you've used!

249
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:35,100
lt's as if you painted each room
for a different mood, Anais.

250
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,745
lt's Anais.

251
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,486
Henry gets everything wrong.

252
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,594
Oh, sorry!

253
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,942
- Always merry and bright.
- You said it!

254
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:47,278
What's the title of your book
going to be?

255
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,544
l'm knocking around a couple.

256
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:53,054
l Sing the Equator
and Tropic of Cancer.

257
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:56,057
- l like Sing the Equator.
- No!

258
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,151
- Tropic of Cancer.
- Without question.

259
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:02,823
You are so absolutely right.

260
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:06,493
You see, Henry, l told you so.

261
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:19,510
So?

262
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,606
What do you think of her?

263
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,651
June? Not much.

264
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,847
You're afraid of her?

265
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,293
l just don't trust her.
Do you?

266
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:31,189
Trust her?

267
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,195
Of course not.

268
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:36,960
But you do think she's beautiful,
don't you?

269
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:42,630
No. That's the truth.

270
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,440
You have no aberrations...

271
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:49,638
no cruelty.

272
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:52,841
l don't want to be cruel.

273
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,444
l hate men who are afraid
of a woman's strength.

274
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,547
l'm not afraid of your strength!
l love it.

275
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:02,649
The stronger, the better.

276
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:05,019
Come here.

277
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,796
You don't hate me, do you?

278
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:21,444
Tell me some more truth.

279
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,672
Or some lies!

280
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:26,477
Whisper to me.

281
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:31,843
How would you lie to June...

282
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,789
if you were making love to her?

283
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,792
Making love to her?

284
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,555
Yes.

285
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,596
To her body.

286
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:43,155
Her voluptuous body.

287
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,027
She's so perverse, so naked.

288
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,470
Tell her that you love her.

289
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,666
l love you!

290
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,545
Hold tighter.

291
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,138
Possess her like a man.

292
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,844
l want to fuck her like a man.

293
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,916
- Fuck her.
- l am.

294
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:14,088
l am fucking her, Pussy Willow.

295
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,065
Pretty good, Hugo.

296
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,791
l used to pace the six-day
bike races in Brooklyn.

297
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:52,664
- You're pretty damn good to keep up.
- Let's go!

298
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:57,400
l guess it's natural with me.
l've always loved sports.

299
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,210
Hey, come on!

300
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,245
That was fun.

301
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:20,918
A little different than horseshoes.

302
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:22,925
Match that.

303
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:54,482
- lt's a tie!
- Okay. lt's a tie.

304
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:59,954
You're like the schoolteacher.
l'm like the young girl.

305
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,982
Always merry and bright.

306
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,188
What's your name?

307
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,792
l'm Count Bruggar!

308
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,988
Where do you come from?

309
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,861
Count Bruggar's been on the stage.

310
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:45,400
That's why he's so spoiled.

311
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:48,494
Count Bruggar is not spoiled!

312
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:51,005
Jean made Count Bruggar.

313
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,975
She's an artist.
Her hands are incredible.

314
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:56,444
Her beauty's more like a man's.

315
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,913
She's no ordinary woman.

316
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:03,078
No ordinary woman
could make Count Bruggar!

317
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:05,644
- Quiet. We're talking.
- Shut up.

318
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,289
You shut up, too!

319
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:15,263
- Where did you learn how to do this?
- My parents were show people.

320
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:19,028
My father was a magician in the circus.
My mother was a trapezist.

321
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,468
l was born on the road.

322
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,740
What has Henry told you?

323
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:27,003
Nothing. Really.

324
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:29,736
He mention Pop?

325
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,309
No. Who's Pop?

326
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,147
Pop is a patron saint of the arts
l know.

327
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:40,213
Henry's jealous of him
because Pop's rich.

328
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,488
Henry sees a lecher under every rock.
You know how men get.

329
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,729
Do you love women?

330
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,001
What do you mean?

331
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,227
What about Jean?

332
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,705
Did Henry tell you about Jean and me?

333
00:35:57,774 --> 00:36:00,766
No! You've been telling me
about her.

334
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:04,075
Sometimes he has a way of making...

335
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,172
everything ugly.

336
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,582
- He's not sleeping with you, is he?
- What?

337
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,782
l guess not.

338
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:18,620
- Did we pay?
- Let me.

339
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:21,664
Good. l've got to book my passage.

340
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:24,199
Passage? To where?

341
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:27,100
Home to New York.

342
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:30,198
Come on, Bruggar.

343
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:33,401
l've got my own life to lead.
So many things up in the air.

344
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:38,937
My friends, my acting. There's
an audition l don't want to miss.

345
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:46,287
Excuse me,
this is all the money you have?

346
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:50,049
Yes.

347
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,287
Sorry. l can't do anything for you.

348
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,335
What do you want me to do, swim?

349
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:01,734
Of course not.

350
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:04,467
We'll find a solution.

351
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,746
Something's happened.
l don't know.

352
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,118
The price has gone up,
or the exchange rate's gone down.

353
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:23,785
l tried to get a reduction, but l don't
have enough even for third class.

354
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,761
- Here. Let me--
- l couldn't.

355
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,321
Please, take this.

356
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,827
lt's swell of you.

357
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,336
Thanks.

358
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:53,051
About that boat.

359
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:58,194
So, did you find a solution?

360
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:03,465
l hope so.

361
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,464
- l'd really like to travel first-class.
- lt's possible.

362
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:12,269
Maybe you know a place
we could meet for a drink.

363
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:14,833
Let's say 6:00.

364
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:18,039
- 7:00's better.
- 7:00.

365
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,218
- Thanks.
- See you then.

366
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:46,074
Here l am.

367
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:50,238
This character, Mona.
She's supposed to be me?

368
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:52,213
Why?

369
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:53,544
Nothing.

370
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:55,743
lt's so good.

371
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,351
l always wanted you to be...

372
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,789
Dostoyevsky.

373
00:39:03,693 --> 00:39:06,560
- ls that good?
- Good?

374
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:09,291
l struggled, suffered...

375
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:10,923
for this?

376
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:16,432
This isn't me.
This is not me!

377
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:19,407
Of course it's you.
lt's the you inside me.

378
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:22,069
lt's a distortion.

379
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,578
Henry, look at me.

380
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:29,610
Look!

381
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:33,884
You can't see me or anyone
as they are.

382
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:38,087
l wanted Dostoyevsky.

383
00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:41,062
Who can be Dostoyevsky with you?

384
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,155
You make that impossible!
What do you want?

385
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:45,166
- What do l want?
- Yeah?

386
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,327
After l brought the world to you?

387
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:49,633
After l told you all of my stories?

388
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:53,107
Sing my praises!

389
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:55,906
Make me an admirable character.

390
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,346
- l'm not a portrait painter.
- l'll say you're not.

391
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:02,179
Look what you've done to Anais.

392
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:05,277
You make everything ugly.

393
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:08,415
Beauty is a joke to you.

394
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,618
You're so negative.

395
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:13,491
You're a failure as a writer.

396
00:40:14,597 --> 00:40:17,589
You're not a man.
You're a child!

397
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,191
You use women!

398
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:22,533
You used me, you fucker!

399
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:28,839
You fuck!

400
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:19,525
Get rid of her.

401
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:21,856
l'll drive you wild.

402
00:42:23,763 --> 00:42:25,594
l love you.

403
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:51,944
l wanna be drunk.

404
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:56,052
And make...

405
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,953
you drunk.

406
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:04,495
Because l'm intimidated by you.

407
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:13,404
l need to feel free to say anything
and know that you'll forgive me.

408
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:27,886
l want to tell you things
so you won't stumble through life.

409
00:44:29,189 --> 00:44:32,784
l've done the vilest things...

410
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:34,656
foulest things.

411
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:41,165
But l've done them superbly.

412
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:47,168
l feel innocent now.

413
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,401
Do you believe that?

414
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:51,637
You are innocent.

415
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:54,612
l want to be innocent like you.

416
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:58,879
l want to experience everything
you've experienced.

417
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:04,083
Take care of Henry for me.

418
00:45:05,158 --> 00:45:07,285
l'll be leaving in the morning.

419
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,225
What?

420
00:45:09,295 --> 00:45:10,990
The morning?

421
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:16,101
But when will you come back?

422
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:18,262
Maybe soon.

423
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:20,499
Maybe never.

424
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:26,270
There is so much l wish
l could've done with you.

425
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:29,406
l wish l could've taken opium with you.

426
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:33,117
Give me your wrist.

427
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:38,215
No! You have so few things.

428
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:42,154
l wanted to give you more.

429
00:45:44,898 --> 00:45:47,332
l wanted to hold you.

430
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:29,671
She's crazy. Don't you see it?

431
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:34,509
No, l don't see.
l don't care.

432
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:36,708
She's just using you.

433
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:43,449
You just don't understand.
You're jealous of her.

434
00:46:44,657 --> 00:46:46,682
No, l'm not.

435
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:51,196
Besides, you'll never see her again.

436
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:54,432
Where did you get this?

437
00:46:56,502 --> 00:46:58,436
Show me!

438
00:46:59,372 --> 00:47:02,967
Does she think she can love anything
in you l haven't loved?

439
00:47:50,189 --> 00:47:53,818
Henry, you may have genius
and passion...

440
00:47:55,228 --> 00:47:57,992
but something is definitely missing.

441
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,365
Oh, yeah? What?

442
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:03,095
Compassion.

443
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:04,659
Compassion for whom?

444
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:06,762
June, for instance.

445
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:12,511
Might as well have compassion
for the moon.

446
00:48:12,578 --> 00:48:14,671
l'm going to write a book about June.

447
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:19,444
l'm writing about her.

448
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,817
l know more than anybody will know
about her.

449
00:48:21,888 --> 00:48:26,848
l'm talking about something
totally different. As a woman.

450
00:48:26,926 --> 00:48:29,451
From the inside out.

451
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:33,295
l can get into the poetry of June.

452
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:38,864
Hey, she's my fucking wife.

453
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:43,068
You don't understand
your own fucking wife.

454
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:47,642
l kissed her.

455
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,050
Write about whatever you want
to write about, for Christ's sake.

456
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,093
And more power to ya.

457
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:25,980
- l gotta get back to work.
- Stay longer if you can.

458
00:49:26,052 --> 00:49:29,385
She's been under stress.
Just getting back on her feet.

459
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:34,422
Say, they've got Haitian drums
up there.

460
00:49:34,494 --> 00:49:36,519
That fellow said l might sit in.

461
00:50:57,276 --> 00:51:00,473
l saw your true nature
when you were dancing.

462
00:51:02,148 --> 00:51:04,173
You don't understand.

463
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:11,212
Maybe l'm just a peasant,
and only whores can understand me.

464
00:51:32,578 --> 00:51:35,138
You wanna dance?

465
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:36,647
Dance.

466
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:39,909
Move your legs wider.

467
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,539
l love you.

468
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:08,045
l need you.

469
00:52:22,028 --> 00:52:25,589
What are you doing?
You're driving me wild.

470
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:48,552
Perhaps l am a demon to be able
to pass from Henry's arms into Hugo's.

471
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:55,924
Hugo lies next to me
as l write this.

472
00:52:57,096 --> 00:52:59,360
l love Hugo.

473
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:03,095
And l feel innocent.

474
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,077
Did l ever tell you about when l was
a little boy growing up in Puerto Rico?

475
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:18,340
My father used to take me
to the carnival.

476
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:24,755
There were wild drums beating
and frightening masks.

477
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:30,827
There was something going on that was
terrifying, that l didn't understand.

478
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:37,234
l said to my father,
''l'm not afraid.

479
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,372
But give me your hand.''

480
00:53:58,457 --> 00:53:59,856
l have to go.

481
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:06,031
Hello, Mr. Richards.

482
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,361
Hello, Hugo.
Mr. Grant can't join us till Friday.

483
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:33,255
Anais, l don't know how much
l dare write you.

484
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:36,488
l would call you,
only l'm afraid Hugo would answer.

485
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:39,395
God forgive if this letter's
ever opened by mistake.

486
00:54:43,636 --> 00:54:45,797
l can't help it.

487
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,896
l want you. l love you.

488
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:52,634
l've been living with you constantly.

489
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:56,180
But l've been afraid to tell you.

490
00:54:56,248 --> 00:54:58,682
l thought it would terrify you.

491
00:55:02,188 --> 00:55:06,124
But today as l watched Dreyer's
Passion of Joan of Arc...

492
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:09,093
l saw the mad monk
played by Antonin Artaud.

493
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:11,925
l thought of you like Joan...

494
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:15,262
in all your youth and purity
and single-minded madness.

495
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:18,360
And l saw myself in Artaud.

496
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:21,600
A hungering monk in love with you
and with my madness...

497
00:55:21,674 --> 00:55:23,665
and your madness.

498
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,610
And the demon in Artaud's eyes
was like the demon in your eyes.

499
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:31,371
We fit so well together.

500
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:34,640
With Hugo, it's so difficult sometimes.

501
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:37,705
We have to use Vaseline.

502
00:56:37,783 --> 00:56:40,877
His penis is so big.

503
00:56:40,953 --> 00:56:43,751
But you and l fit so well.

504
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:46,986
Oh, Henry, l want to know
what you know.

505
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:50,392
l want my life to match your life.

506
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:17,703
Look at that, will ya?
lsn't that something?

507
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,987
Just read your goddamn book
on D.H. Lawrence...

508
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,824
and my, oh, my
it's one hell of a book.

509
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:40,997
Shows me l didn't know shit
about Lawrence when l spoke.

510
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:44,037
Who am l to go shooting off
at the mouth about him?

511
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,301
He was much greater, finer
than l ever thought.

512
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:51,310
Never mind how he failed
or triumphed as a man.

513
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:54,006
As an artist, did he succeed?

514
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:57,573
l say magnificently.

515
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:59,744
He tried to liberate literature.

516
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,916
And that's our task:
liberation, freedom.

517
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:09,760
Let's toast to Lawrence.
Let's toast to our defects.

518
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,162
Toast...

519
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:14,394
to our friendship.

520
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,164
Drink cold, piss warm.

521
00:59:17,238 --> 00:59:18,671
To Henry.

522
00:59:25,746 --> 00:59:28,044
Fuck the Huns.

523
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:32,510
You know who l really am?

524
00:59:32,586 --> 00:59:36,215
lt's only me from over the sea.
l'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

525
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,748
l'm all lit up like a Christmas tree
l'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

526
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:43,024
l'll sail the sea until l croak
l'll fight and swear and drink and smoke

527
00:59:43,097 --> 00:59:46,589
But l can't swim a bloody stroke
l'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

528
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,932
l'll put my mast in whom l please
l'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

529
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:53,462
l'll drink and fight and fuck and smoke
But l can't swim a bloody stroke

530
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,907
l'm Barnacle Bill the sailor
Barnacle Bill the sailor

531
01:00:25,005 --> 01:00:26,632
Perverts yourselves!

532
01:00:35,749 --> 01:00:37,182
- Fuck you.
- Jack.

533
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:39,310
- What?
- Say, fuck you, Jack.

534
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,648
Fuck you, Jack!

535
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:07,579
Twelve meters.

536
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:10,473
Pull it.

537
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,417
Yeah, scram.

538
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:13,009
Everybody says sex is obscene.
The only true obscenity is war.

539
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:17,976
l'd believe only in a god...

540
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:20,849
who understood how to dance.

541
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:23,389
lsn't that something?

542
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:25,687
Nietzsche says that at the same time...

543
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:30,753
the Huns and Germany are gearing up,
perverting, what he says.

544
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:35,564
We're given this gift:
the ability to understand.

545
01:02:35,636 --> 01:02:37,968
Yet no one wants to understand.

546
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,371
We're given the ability to read.

547
01:02:41,442 --> 01:02:44,240
Read Nietzsche, Thomas Mann...

548
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:47,439
read Spengler, Joyce, Rambaud.

549
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,972
Read fucking Alice in Wonderland.
Huh, Osborn?

550
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:54,043
Everything's out of whack.

551
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:57,557
People just worry about money
and deny their inner self.

552
01:02:57,624 --> 01:02:59,489
What is money, anyway?

553
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,222
There's an old Portuguese saying--

554
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:08,097
''lf shit had value,
the poor wouldn't have asses.''

555
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,001
Money. Money.

556
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:14,836
They walk through the night crowd
protected by money...

557
01:03:14,908 --> 01:03:17,706
lulled by money, dulled by money.

558
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:20,440
No single object anywhere
that is not money.

559
01:03:20,514 --> 01:03:23,210
Money everywhere and still not enough.

560
01:03:23,283 --> 01:03:26,810
Then no money or little money
or less money or more money.

561
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,287
But money. Always money!

562
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:32,223
lf you have money or don't have money,
it's the money that counts.

563
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:34,783
And money makes money.
But what makes money make money?

564
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,421
l say, what the hell!

565
01:03:38,499 --> 01:03:42,026
We gotta die to the world
like the clowns. Right, clowns?

566
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:51,709
l've never seen the sun rise in Paris.

567
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,347
l've never been up all night.

568
01:03:56,717 --> 01:04:00,448
l've never been with a woman
l could be so sincere with.

569
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:05,851
l feel so free to write now.

570
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,156
l'll help you.

571
01:04:08,228 --> 01:04:10,219
And l'll help you.

572
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:13,663
l feel so pure.

573
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:15,827
So strong.

574
01:04:15,903 --> 01:04:18,337
So new, Henry.

575
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:22,205
You and l together,
not any man or woman together.

576
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:27,978
l'm gonna demand everything of you.

577
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,710
Even the impossible.

578
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:35,387
Because you encourage it.

579
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,424
Maybe l should get down on my knees
and worship you.

580
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,789
l'm gonna undress you.

581
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:49,194
Vulgarize you a bit.
Lift up your dress.

582
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:51,999
No, not here.

583
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:02,243
Don't look around.

584
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,477
You little aristocrat.

585
01:05:07,054 --> 01:05:08,954
Don't care.

586
01:05:09,022 --> 01:05:11,286
l want to fuck you...

587
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:13,485
teach you things...

588
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,793
humiliate you a little.

589
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,191
Wrap your leg around me.

590
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,170
l'm gonna make you come with me.

591
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:35,142
Remarkable.

592
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:39,585
This is one of the most beautiful things
l've ever read.

593
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:45,985
l've never shown this diary
to anyone before.

594
01:05:49,563 --> 01:05:51,793
No one will ever know these things...

595
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,323
but you.

596
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:58,497
You're becoming all the things
you wished to be as a little girl.

597
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:11,077
- l had a cricket.
- What?

598
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:13,984
A little cricket in a cage.

599
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:16,722
l love your accent.

600
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,452
l carried it everywhere with me.

601
01:06:19,526 --> 01:06:22,984
But when we arrived in America,
they took it away at immigration.

602
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:28,559
The only thing they let me keep
in America was my diary.

603
01:06:30,103 --> 01:06:31,866
And my accent.

604
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:40,802
l love you at 11.

605
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,717
l love you now.

606
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:51,784
l will love you at 100.

607
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:30,443
Here. Take a look.

608
01:07:34,653 --> 01:07:36,678
What have you got here?

609
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:51,198
This is good.
Powerful.

610
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,295
Yours, too.

611
01:07:56,275 --> 01:07:59,540
You tell the truth with such...

612
01:07:59,612 --> 01:08:00,874
delicacy.

613
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:13,158
- l hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

614
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:16,991
Why should l mind?
l welcome constructive criticism.

615
01:08:17,063 --> 01:08:18,758
Good.

616
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:21,129
lf it's constructive.

617
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:32,411
- What are you doing?
- Just a few things.

618
01:08:32,478 --> 01:08:36,744
Here it's all shrieks...

619
01:08:36,816 --> 01:08:38,716
and abstracts.

620
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:40,877
lt's too melodramatic.

621
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:43,717
You gotta take time to expand.

622
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:45,518
You're enjoying this.

623
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:48,359
- What?
- Cutting me up.

624
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:51,225
l don't want to write
the way you write.

625
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:55,523
l don't want you to write
the way l write.

626
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:58,399
You've got to write in your own voice.
l'm just making a few suggestions.

627
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:02,066
lt's tight in places.
Here.

628
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:04,473
Read it out loud
and see how it sounds.

629
01:09:04,543 --> 01:09:07,876
- l won't give you that pleasure.
- Pleasure?

630
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:10,916
Hold on a minute here.

631
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:14,612
Can't you take it?
You gotta take a few taps on the chin.

632
01:09:14,687 --> 01:09:17,053
A few taps on the chin?

633
01:09:17,123 --> 01:09:19,387
Amuse yourself with someone else.

634
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,927
A prizefighter, for instance.

635
01:09:22,995 --> 01:09:25,759
You're right exactly.
A prizefighter.

636
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:30,097
You've got to get knocked down
occasionally to acquire ring tactics.

637
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:33,400
The strategy,
the art of fighting.

638
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:35,736
You can't just shadowbox in your room.

639
01:09:35,808 --> 01:09:37,935
You wouldn't last two minutes
when you step into the ring.

640
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,912
l am not interested
in stepping into a ring with you.

641
01:09:41,981 --> 01:09:45,007
The world will give us
plenty of beatings.

642
01:09:45,084 --> 01:09:47,109
We need each other's support.

643
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,753
Should l criticize you
like an outsider?

644
01:09:51,824 --> 01:09:54,486
Should l say you write
caricatures?

645
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,462
That you write only from a man's point
of view and can't understand women?

646
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:02,695
Should l say that sometimes there's
a touch of the brute in your writing?

647
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:06,636
That you're too much of a realist?

648
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:14,946
What's the matter?
Can't you take it?

649
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:17,410
Like a prizefighter.

650
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:18,916
Knock it off.

651
01:10:20,886 --> 01:10:22,854
You want to fight, huh?

652
01:10:37,436 --> 01:10:38,869
Don't.

653
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:42,670
Leave it. lt looks nice that way.

654
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:45,604
Wild.

655
01:10:45,678 --> 01:10:47,509
Loose.

656
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,639
You never like the way l look.

657
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:52,115
l do love your hair.

658
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:55,848
l just think it shouldn't be so severe.

659
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:57,445
So tight.

660
01:10:57,523 --> 01:10:59,491
Like my writing?

661
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:02,152
No, not like your writing.
l love your writing.

662
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:04,594
l believe in you.

663
01:11:04,663 --> 01:11:09,066
Last night l thought that you were
the woman l should've been married to.

664
01:11:12,004 --> 01:11:14,370
You're always ironizing with me.

665
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,536
''lronizing''? There's no such word.
lt's ''to be ironic.''

666
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:21,412
Look it up.

667
01:11:51,577 --> 01:11:54,944
Then he steals my ideas
and puts them in his novel.

668
01:11:55,014 --> 01:11:56,948
Henry wouldn't do that.

669
01:11:57,016 --> 01:11:59,610
l'm sure of it.
Somehow...

670
01:11:59,685 --> 01:12:02,245
he got into my briefcase
and swiped my ideas.

671
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,551
Those phrases are mine.

672
01:12:04,623 --> 01:12:09,356
That way of expression,
that rhapsodizing, it's mine.

673
01:12:09,428 --> 01:12:13,489
Nietzsche?
l introduced him to Nietzsche.

674
01:12:13,565 --> 01:12:17,763
l introduced him to Hugo and you.
He stole you from Hugo.

675
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,396
- Don't, Richard.
- He stole you from me.

676
01:12:21,607 --> 01:12:23,040
That's true.

677
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:27,135
lt was my idea to become your lover.

678
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:31,376
He betrayed me by stealing you from me
and from my best friend, your husband.

679
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,543
This man is treacherous to the core.

680
01:12:34,486 --> 01:12:37,080
This Neanderthal from Brooklyn
is trying to murder me.

681
01:12:43,295 --> 01:12:48,164
For all his pretended friendship, his
most intimate friends are only fodder...

682
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:52,465
for the unrolling of his own sanctified
destiny, his own creative urges.

683
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:57,138
l leave the two of you
to your destiny.

684
01:12:58,177 --> 01:13:00,611
And one more thing.

685
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:04,410
No more sex in my apartment.
l won't stand for it.

686
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,084
l won't stand for it.

687
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,213
l love that guy.

688
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:14,418
He understands me,
even though he is--

689
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:18,521
Pas maintenant. Later.

690
01:13:18,597 --> 01:13:21,623
Even though he is ironizing.

691
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:51,592
l have only three desires now:

692
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:53,722
to eat...

693
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:55,232
to sleep...

694
01:13:56,135 --> 01:13:58,399
and, uh--

695
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,700
And?

696
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:26,731
- Jerks out there.
- lt's just the Art Students Ball.

697
01:14:26,799 --> 01:14:29,359
Maybe you just don't want it tonight.

698
01:14:34,907 --> 01:14:36,340
lt's fine.

699
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:38,775
l understand.

700
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:41,678
lt's natural.

701
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,243
l've read about such moments.

702
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:52,284
lt happens to women, too,
only women can conceal it.

703
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:14,576
Sorry.

704
01:15:14,646 --> 01:15:16,079
Don't be.

705
01:15:22,921 --> 01:15:26,220
You feel that you have to fuck me
or l'll be disappointed.

706
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,225
But you don't always
have to fuck me.

707
01:15:28,293 --> 01:15:31,194
Don't say that word.

708
01:15:31,263 --> 01:15:32,696
What word?

709
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:35,232
Fuck?

710
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:40,402
lt just bothers me now.

711
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:46,601
Maybe it's the accent.

712
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:56,012
Maybe it's just because you can't fuck.

713
01:16:07,799 --> 01:16:11,132
lt's important not to imagine
terrible things...

714
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:13,637
like being impotent from now on.

715
01:16:23,282 --> 01:16:26,877
lt's nothing.
We should just laugh about it.

716
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:21,350
l love you, Pussy Willow.

717
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:25,029
l love you, too, Hugo.

718
01:19:42,914 --> 01:19:46,372
l gave myself with such feelings
against Henry...

719
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:50,478
that l experienced
a great physical pleasure.

720
01:19:50,555 --> 01:19:53,456
My first infidelity to Henry...

721
01:19:53,525 --> 01:19:56,460
was with my own husband.

722
01:19:56,528 --> 01:19:57,961
l've changed.

723
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:01,694
l feel restless, spirited...

724
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,200
adventurous.

725
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:09,129
To be truthful, l hope secretly
to meet someone else.

726
01:20:09,207 --> 01:20:11,300
l have erotic imaginings.

727
01:20:13,145 --> 01:20:15,079
l want pleasure.

728
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:38,998
Every time l go out with you
l love you more than ever.

729
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:42,509
You seem so wild tonight.

730
01:20:42,577 --> 01:20:44,943
Tonight l could do anything.

731
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,714
l could, too.

732
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:51,343
We need to think of something
that will stimulate us both.

733
01:20:53,488 --> 01:20:56,457
Anything you say, kiddo.

734
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,485
Henry told me about this place.

735
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:36,553
This ought to be something.

736
01:21:37,632 --> 01:21:39,065
Wait here.

737
01:21:57,085 --> 01:22:00,145
- l'm with you.
- We'll just look.

738
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:25,944
What's an exhibition?

739
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:28,413
Then you must choose two.

740
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,853
An exhibition is...

741
01:22:33,921 --> 01:22:38,881
us watching a man and a woman
doing it?

742
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,397
No man. Only women.
One pretends to be the man.

743
01:22:44,766 --> 01:22:46,700
lt is better that way.
N'est-ce pas?

744
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:48,201
Of course.

745
01:22:48,269 --> 01:22:52,706
You will not be disappointed.
You will see everything.

746
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:55,299
And now you must choose.

747
01:23:10,358 --> 01:23:11,791
Her.

748
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:15,153
And--

749
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:38,946
There are 66 ways
in which to make love.

750
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,715
Oh? Really?

751
01:23:42,156 --> 01:23:45,057
They will show you love
in a taxi.

752
01:23:45,126 --> 01:23:48,562
Love when one of the partners
is sleepy.

753
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:52,531
Love in the street.
Etcetera, etcetera.

754
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,524
You like something else?

755
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:07,964
Yes. Stop pretending to be a man.

756
01:26:57,785 --> 01:27:00,117
Would you like to join us?

757
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:08,591
As you wish. You're the boss.

758
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,026
Anais, what?

759
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,160
l love your green eyes, Eduardo.

760
01:29:39,947 --> 01:29:43,075
l want to show you things.

761
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:45,084
Teach you things.

762
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,713
l want you to relax.

763
01:29:53,694 --> 01:29:55,662
Relax, Eduardo.

764
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,847
l had a dream.
A nightmare.

765
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:26,581
June had suddenly returned.

766
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,322
We shut ourselves in a room.

767
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:42,259
l began to undress.

768
01:31:44,538 --> 01:31:46,836
l begged her to undress.

769
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,827
l asked to let me see between her legs.

770
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:04,874
As she lay over me...

771
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,414
l felt a penis touching me.

772
01:33:12,126 --> 01:33:14,560
Aren't you glad?

773
01:33:57,371 --> 01:33:59,635
Aren't you glad?

774
01:34:04,144 --> 01:34:07,113
l'm passing through a crisis, Eduardo.

775
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:14,977
Be careful, Anais.

776
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:18,024
Abnormal pleasures kill the taste
for the normal ones.

777
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:44,976
l hate you, Henry...

778
01:34:45,052 --> 01:34:48,886
because l now realize l love you
as l have never loved anyone.

779
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:52,289
l miss your voice,
your hands, your body...

780
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:56,455
your tenderness,
your bearishness and your goodness.

781
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:59,363
Most of all,
l miss our friendship.

782
01:38:38,915 --> 01:38:40,439
l'm finished.

783
01:41:18,074 --> 01:41:21,601
Pussy Willow!
l'm home!

784
01:41:25,148 --> 01:41:26,581
l'm home!

785
01:41:38,661 --> 01:41:42,495
Henry's exhausted.
Hasn't slept for two days.

786
01:41:42,565 --> 01:41:44,590
He's just finished his novel.

787
01:42:04,254 --> 01:42:05,949
Henry.

788
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:18,360
This is wonderful.

789
01:42:19,269 --> 01:42:21,066
Stupendous.

790
01:42:21,137 --> 01:42:23,799
- Come and join us.
- Lay down with us, Henry.

791
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:30,008
l hope you don't mind.
Anais was reading this.

792
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:32,639
l'm a nosy guy,
so l took a peek.

793
01:42:32,715 --> 01:42:34,148
l love it.

794
01:42:34,217 --> 01:42:36,742
l've been trying
to write something about it.

795
01:42:36,819 --> 01:42:40,619
About how necessary this book is
for our times.

796
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:42,783
You give us a blood transfusion.

797
01:42:42,859 --> 01:42:44,793
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

798
01:42:58,141 --> 01:43:00,507
Wait till June reads this.

799
01:43:00,577 --> 01:43:02,977
She'll be so thrilled
that you've finished your book.

800
01:43:06,216 --> 01:43:08,480
Each mention of her name...

801
01:43:08,551 --> 01:43:12,317
each page l read is painful.

802
01:43:12,388 --> 01:43:15,118
Well, this was a swan song.

803
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:18,126
lt was a way to understand her
so l could free myself from her.

804
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:23,290
- lt's finished now.
- Not yet.

805
01:43:23,366 --> 01:43:26,267
- Now we've got to get it published.
- Published?

806
01:43:26,336 --> 01:43:29,635
Who will publish it?
l know what they'll say.

807
01:43:29,706 --> 01:43:32,641
There's even laws against
what l've written.

808
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:34,768
But l feel good now.

809
01:43:34,844 --> 01:43:37,506
l'm ready to celebrate my failure.

810
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:40,743
l won't let you be a failure.

811
01:43:40,817 --> 01:43:44,150
l'll make the world listen to you.
l promise.

812
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,381
l'm ready now to call on the pope...

813
01:43:46,456 --> 01:43:48,549
and all the kings...

814
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:51,890
and all the editors and publishers
in the world to get them to support you.

815
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:42,208
lt's Anais.

816
01:44:57,859 --> 01:45:01,317
- Eduardo.
- Hello, Henry.

817
01:45:01,396 --> 01:45:03,489
- Where's Hugo?
- Hugo's gone on business.

818
01:45:03,564 --> 01:45:05,691
Osborn's gone, too.
Gone crazy.

819
01:45:05,767 --> 01:45:07,894
Really.

820
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,300
Totally.

821
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:13,170
We're celebrating Osborn's madness.
This is a rare occasion.

822
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:17,871
lt doesn't happen every day. l hope
he's really insane and not faking it.

823
01:45:17,945 --> 01:45:21,346
- They came and took him away.
- He was a monster.

824
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,884
That was his best side.

825
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:32,720
We've got the whole place to ourselves.

826
01:45:35,029 --> 01:45:37,657
You ever see what
a good contortionist can do?

827
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:39,165
Yeah.

828
01:45:47,608 --> 01:45:50,042
l'll get you something to drink.

829
01:46:00,421 --> 01:46:03,219
Sorry l couldn't keep in touch.

830
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,725
l thought of you every day.

831
01:46:07,428 --> 01:46:09,862
You know me with writing.
l have a terrible time.

832
01:46:11,232 --> 01:46:13,200
l don't have the gift
like you and Henry.

833
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:16,934
l found your book
lying around here.

834
01:46:17,004 --> 01:46:19,234
l hope you don't mind.

835
01:46:21,209 --> 01:46:22,642
l took a peek.

836
01:46:24,612 --> 01:46:26,807
House of lncest?

837
01:46:28,182 --> 01:46:30,878
lt's nice.

838
01:46:30,952 --> 01:46:33,250
ls this character Sabina
supposed to be me?

839
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:44,460
''The muffled, close half talk
of soft-fleshed women.

840
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:50,001
Deep into each other
we turned our hollowed eyes.''

841
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:56,298
lt seems like poetry sort of.

842
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:02,440
lt's so damn sweet of you
to try to write something about me.

843
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:07,586
l really--

844
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:10,757
l really expected something more--

845
01:47:12,193 --> 01:47:15,754
l don't know.
More real.

846
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,263
More real?

847
01:47:17,331 --> 01:47:22,098
Yeah. More about, you know, life.

848
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,868
Hey, don't get upset.

849
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:34,604
Some of it's really beautiful.

850
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,809
l promise l'll read it again.

851
01:47:39,253 --> 01:47:42,120
Things have been so damn tough for me.

852
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:44,123
The acting didn't pan out.

853
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:47,126
Then Jean, my friend, left.

854
01:47:49,363 --> 01:47:53,959
Anais, what's happened to Henry?

855
01:47:54,035 --> 01:47:55,468
He's so changed.

856
01:47:56,704 --> 01:47:59,070
June, l don't know.

857
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:05,245
l don't know what to say.
l've been busy.

858
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:10,876
l've seen him occasionally. We work
on our writing together sometimes.

859
01:48:11,752 --> 01:48:15,153
But, l don't know.

860
01:48:21,929 --> 01:48:23,863
l've been seeing someone.

861
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,860
- You mean you have a lover?
- Yes.

862
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,974
That man you came with?

863
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:37,010
Yes. Eduardo.

864
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:43,609
Anais, l'm so happy for you.

865
01:48:48,422 --> 01:48:51,050
l don't know who l came back for.

866
01:49:09,977 --> 01:49:13,913
Don't let it come between us.
Please.

867
01:49:13,981 --> 01:49:15,915
l need your faith.

868
01:49:38,272 --> 01:49:40,570
That could be good luck, too.

869
01:49:42,176 --> 01:49:43,666
Could be.

870
01:50:21,716 --> 01:50:23,547
Jack, you've come.

871
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:25,107
How are you?

872
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:33,158
June, l'd like you to meet Jack...

873
01:50:33,227 --> 01:50:35,320
the man who wants to publish my book.

874
01:50:35,396 --> 01:50:37,489
- My wife June.
- Hiya, Jack.

875
01:50:37,565 --> 01:50:40,159
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Miller.

876
01:50:40,234 --> 01:50:43,499
l feel l already know you intimately
from reading Henry's book.

877
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:46,301
Yeah? What do you think?

878
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:50,309
l think it's strong meat.
That's how we'll market it.

879
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:54,005
- What's our cut?
- Your cut?

880
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:56,379
lt'll be 5%.

881
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:58,680
A crummy 5%?

882
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,885
Henry spends years
writing the book.

883
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:06,893
Lives like a bum.
Busts his nuts.

884
01:51:06,961 --> 01:51:10,624
- Stay out of this, June.
- l scrape by and do without.

885
01:51:10,698 --> 01:51:14,964
And pour my heart and soul in making him
some kind of Dostoyevsky.

886
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:17,003
And all we get is 5%?

887
01:51:17,071 --> 01:51:19,665
With me, the percentage
will mean something.

888
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:22,072
What does ''mean something'' mean?

889
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:24,236
l believe it's a fair deal.

890
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:25,903
Well, l'll be.

891
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:28,949
Of course, if you don't want
to publish it--

892
01:51:30,584 --> 01:51:33,052
Henry just doesn't get business.

893
01:51:34,455 --> 01:51:36,116
Let's us talk.

894
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:41,322
By all means. But as l've said,
before we can do anything...

895
01:51:41,395 --> 01:51:44,990
it's absolutely necessary to have
the money to print it.

896
01:51:45,065 --> 01:51:47,863
Jack, l've told you.
l'll get the money.

897
01:51:58,179 --> 01:52:02,172
l guess l was naive about
how things work in your business.

898
01:52:02,249 --> 01:52:05,309
l hope l didn't upset you.

899
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:09,447
l was wondering if some advance
might be possible.

900
01:52:09,523 --> 01:52:13,084
Or maybe there's room
to improve in the percentage.

901
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,128
Let's not discuss it now.

902
01:52:15,196 --> 01:52:17,426
Here is not the place.

903
01:52:17,498 --> 01:52:20,626
Maybe you know a place
where we could have lunch?

904
01:52:20,701 --> 01:52:23,602
l certainly do.
A marvelous place.

905
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:28,500
lt's done then.
lt's been so good to meet you.

906
01:52:28,576 --> 01:52:30,908
Really. lt's been wonderful
having you.

907
01:52:30,978 --> 01:52:32,411
You, too.

908
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:34,880
Good night.

909
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:39,142
- Yes.
- See you.

910
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,653
Good-bye.

911
01:52:44,558 --> 01:52:47,391
Who's he trying to kid?

912
01:52:47,461 --> 01:52:50,362
A crummy 5%.

913
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:53,764
He hasn't dealt with
this Brooklyn girl yet.

914
01:52:53,834 --> 01:52:57,497
- Let's go for a nightcap, Henry.
- Go ahead. We'll join you later.

915
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:03,541
- Always merry and bright.
- To you, too.

916
01:53:05,746 --> 01:53:08,476
- l should go.
- No, Anais.

917
01:53:08,549 --> 01:53:12,178
Don't go. You can catch up
with Eduardo later.

918
01:53:12,253 --> 01:53:13,720
All right, Eduardo?

919
01:53:38,474 --> 01:53:40,408
Say, you know...

920
01:53:41,944 --> 01:53:43,878
l don't know.

921
01:53:45,515 --> 01:53:50,452
l was thinking maybe it's not time
to publish Henry's book just now.

922
01:53:51,921 --> 01:53:53,354
Not publish?

923
01:53:55,491 --> 01:53:57,789
What the hell you talking about?

924
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:00,852
l'm talking about the crappy deal.

925
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:04,161
And the fact that you're
taking advantage of Anais.

926
01:54:05,568 --> 01:54:07,593
And Hugo, too.

927
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:10,571
They're not made of gold, Henry.

928
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:13,040
Am l right, Anais?

929
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:15,304
Yes, but-- No.

930
01:54:15,378 --> 01:54:18,370
We believe we have to publish it.

931
01:54:18,447 --> 01:54:20,540
l'll get it published.

932
01:54:20,616 --> 01:54:25,178
The right way,
just like l always have.

933
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:28,917
We've always managed to survive,
you and me.

934
01:54:30,793 --> 01:54:34,661
Besides, it needs work.

935
01:54:35,531 --> 01:54:37,965
- What?
- lt's not ready.

936
01:54:38,034 --> 01:54:40,468
lt's better than
when l first read it...

937
01:54:40,536 --> 01:54:42,731
but it could be even better.

938
01:54:42,805 --> 01:54:46,172
There's too much anger in the book.

939
01:54:46,242 --> 01:54:47,675
Too much anger?

940
01:54:48,878 --> 01:54:50,812
Too much fucking anger?

941
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:54,941
Even Anais agrees that you
distorted me in your book.

942
01:54:55,017 --> 01:54:57,485
She had to write her own book.

943
01:54:57,553 --> 01:55:00,647
- lsn't that right?
- No.

944
01:55:00,723 --> 01:55:03,954
l did tell June you failed to perceive
certain things.

945
01:55:04,026 --> 01:55:07,962
- Don't.
- After all l've done for him.

946
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:12,194
He owes me for all the years
l sacrificed.

947
01:55:12,268 --> 01:55:15,431
Your sacrifices just add
to your greatness.

948
01:55:15,504 --> 01:55:17,995
- l don't owe you a thing.
- You don't what?

949
01:55:18,074 --> 01:55:20,565
What Henry really means is--

950
01:55:20,643 --> 01:55:23,271
For Christ's sake,
can't you see what she's doing?

951
01:55:23,346 --> 01:55:27,442
- Don't yell at me!
- He treats you like a child.

952
01:55:27,516 --> 01:55:31,919
- She's a woman, Henry.
- l know she's a woman.

953
01:55:31,988 --> 01:55:35,583
- l'll bet you do.
- What the fuck do you mean by that?

954
01:55:35,658 --> 01:55:37,091
l'm leaving.

955
01:55:38,294 --> 01:55:41,559
How can you treat her this way?

956
01:55:41,631 --> 01:55:43,064
You're drunk.

957
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,924
So what?

958
01:55:46,002 --> 01:55:47,435
You're weak.

959
01:55:48,471 --> 01:55:51,963
l hate when you get weak.
Be a man!

960
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,975
God, that's it!

961
01:55:58,014 --> 01:55:59,447
Violence.

962
01:56:02,284 --> 01:56:04,980
l hate your violence.

963
01:56:05,054 --> 01:56:06,783
Men.

964
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,499
Anais, don't go.

965
01:56:17,566 --> 01:56:19,534
l love you.

966
01:56:21,303 --> 01:56:23,863
You're cruel and clever.

967
01:56:23,939 --> 01:56:26,237
You're both cruel and clever.

968
01:56:27,376 --> 01:56:30,106
l'm afraid of both of you.

969
01:56:30,179 --> 01:56:31,612
Oh, God.

970
01:56:33,115 --> 01:56:35,549
l'm the wrong woman for you, Henry!

971
01:56:37,319 --> 01:56:40,083
l'm the wrong woman for you, Anais.

972
01:56:43,693 --> 01:56:45,661
Leave me alone.
Don't touch me.

973
01:56:47,596 --> 01:56:50,121
l'm so terribly sick.

974
01:56:53,502 --> 01:56:55,436
Give me peace.

975
01:57:00,743 --> 01:57:02,677
l love you.

976
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,394
Get some sleep, Anais.

977
01:58:02,872 --> 01:58:07,775
l don't know why l keep thinking of
this little Chinese restaurant...

978
01:58:07,843 --> 01:58:11,745
Henry and l used to go to
after l got off work.

979
01:58:11,814 --> 01:58:16,183
He'd wait for me outside the dance hall
at 2:00 in the morning.

980
01:58:16,252 --> 01:58:19,050
And we'd rush through
the freezing cold...

981
01:58:19,121 --> 01:58:21,089
holding each other tight.

982
01:58:22,191 --> 01:58:26,025
We'd get there
just before closing time.

983
01:58:26,095 --> 01:58:28,757
Sit in the booth by the window
eating chow mein...

984
01:58:29,932 --> 01:58:32,162
watching the snow swirl by.

985
01:58:34,436 --> 01:58:38,566
There was some kind of unbelievable
thrill in the air between us.

986
01:58:42,745 --> 01:58:45,236
l feel kind of honored by it now.

987
01:58:46,415 --> 01:58:47,848
Chin Lee's.

988
01:58:50,219 --> 01:58:52,119
lt's funny.

989
01:58:52,188 --> 01:58:54,122
lt seems like a dream.

990
01:58:58,961 --> 01:59:00,826
Your eyes make me shy.

991
01:59:00,896 --> 01:59:03,296
Don't be shy.

992
01:59:03,365 --> 01:59:06,095
You're so lovely.

993
01:59:06,168 --> 01:59:09,069
So small.

994
01:59:19,949 --> 01:59:22,679
l burnt myself out.

995
01:59:24,553 --> 01:59:27,579
June, l worship you.

996
01:59:27,656 --> 01:59:29,783
l don't want worship.

997
01:59:29,859 --> 01:59:32,794
l want understanding.

998
01:59:32,862 --> 01:59:34,796
l understand you.

999
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,333
We should go away somewhere together...

1000
01:59:41,403 --> 01:59:43,871
where there's lots of snow.

1001
02:00:44,166 --> 02:00:46,361
How little you are.

1002
02:00:46,435 --> 02:00:47,868
So thin.

1003
02:00:57,279 --> 02:00:59,543
l could break you in two.

1004
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:07,454
l feel innocent now.

1005
02:02:01,377 --> 02:02:04,710
Let yourself go.

1006
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,441
Relax.

1007
02:02:06,515 --> 02:02:08,449
You're still holding back.

1008
02:02:09,785 --> 02:02:11,878
Let me see your body.

1009
02:02:11,954 --> 02:02:14,184
lt isn't beautiful enough.

1010
02:02:14,256 --> 02:02:16,247
Beautiful June.

1011
02:02:19,294 --> 02:02:21,728
l heard a noise out there.

1012
02:02:22,731 --> 02:02:24,460
Henry was listening.

1013
02:02:24,533 --> 02:02:28,526
No. Once Henry falls asleep,
nothing can wake him up.

1014
02:02:31,673 --> 02:02:32,935
Yeah?

1015
02:02:38,347 --> 02:02:39,871
l'm sorry.

1016
02:02:39,948 --> 02:02:42,883
- l lost my head. l was drunk.
- Don't be sorry.

1017
02:02:44,486 --> 02:02:49,355
This new lover of yours
has really made you bloom.

1018
02:02:49,425 --> 02:02:52,223
- lt's chilly.
- Tell me more about him.

1019
02:02:53,162 --> 02:02:55,562
Did you make curtains for him?

1020
02:02:55,631 --> 02:02:57,656
Did you give him books to read?

1021
02:02:57,733 --> 02:03:00,463
Did you give him a typewriter?

1022
02:03:05,074 --> 02:03:07,008
No, you don't understand.

1023
02:03:07,076 --> 02:03:09,135
l don't understand?

1024
02:03:09,211 --> 02:03:11,338
What don't l understand?

1025
02:03:12,781 --> 02:03:14,305
That l love you.

1026
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,212
Love?

1027
02:03:16,285 --> 02:03:20,051
You just want experience.
You're a writer.

1028
02:03:20,122 --> 02:03:22,215
You make love to whatever you need.

1029
02:03:23,392 --> 02:03:27,260
- You're just like Henry.
- No, l'm just like you.

1030
02:03:27,329 --> 02:03:30,298
l can see exactly what you're doing.

1031
02:03:30,365 --> 02:03:34,426
You're so slippery.
So slippery.

1032
02:03:34,503 --> 02:03:35,902
You bitch!

1033
02:03:37,406 --> 02:03:39,840
Liar, trickster.
You bought his love!

1034
02:03:39,908 --> 02:03:41,603
Shut up!

1035
02:03:42,478 --> 02:03:44,776
You both robbed me blind.

1036
02:03:44,847 --> 02:03:47,407
You stole everything.

1037
02:03:47,483 --> 02:03:51,078
- What do l care? l've got more to give.
- Shut up.

1038
02:03:51,153 --> 02:03:55,021
To someone new.
Some truly great writer.

1039
02:03:57,092 --> 02:04:00,550
Henry said you just took us in
because you were bored.

1040
02:04:06,068 --> 02:04:07,535
That's a lie.

1041
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:12,472
A lie.

1042
02:04:23,852 --> 02:04:26,082
l was dreaming about you.

1043
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:28,622
Anais.

1044
02:04:29,892 --> 02:04:31,325
What's wrong?

1045
02:04:34,329 --> 02:04:36,263
She lies.

1046
02:04:36,331 --> 02:04:39,562
She lies.
What is she afraid of?

1047
02:04:39,635 --> 02:04:43,662
l don't understand.
l tried to give her everything.

1048
02:04:43,739 --> 02:04:45,673
l know.

1049
02:04:47,075 --> 02:04:50,909
Very pretty.
Just like l figured it.

1050
02:04:52,281 --> 02:04:54,272
Now l know everything.

1051
02:04:55,551 --> 02:04:59,954
l wanted to return something
before l leave.

1052
02:05:00,022 --> 02:05:02,149
Some books l borrowed.

1053
02:05:08,063 --> 02:05:09,997
June, you're wrong!

1054
02:05:10,065 --> 02:05:12,898
We're just friends.
l never touched her.

1055
02:05:12,968 --> 02:05:15,198
Get rid of her, Henry.

1056
02:05:19,208 --> 02:05:22,541
All right, you made your choice.

1057
02:05:22,611 --> 02:05:25,409
l've only got one more thing
l can give you.

1058
02:05:26,415 --> 02:05:28,212
Your last chapter.

1059
02:05:28,283 --> 02:05:29,716
Watch closely.

1060
02:06:05,354 --> 02:06:07,822
What are you doing out here?
lt's freezing.

1061
02:06:10,058 --> 02:06:12,959
l thought she'd do something crazy.
l never know.

1062
02:06:16,131 --> 02:06:18,929
l looked all over for her.

1063
02:06:19,001 --> 02:06:20,434
She's gone.

1064
02:07:00,918 --> 02:07:02,476
This is mine.

1065
02:07:09,793 --> 02:07:11,727
This is mine, too.

1066
02:07:19,937 --> 02:07:21,905
l feel like the war's over.

1067
02:07:30,681 --> 02:07:33,809
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.

1068
02:07:36,654 --> 02:07:38,588
Leave that there.

1069
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:48,189
Stay with me, for Christ's sake.
We gotta talk.

1070
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,797
l can't.

1071
02:07:51,869 --> 02:07:55,066
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1072
02:07:55,139 --> 02:07:56,629
What?

1073
02:07:59,109 --> 02:08:00,542
Yeah.

1074
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:04,276
Hugo.

1075
02:08:04,348 --> 02:08:06,282
l love him, too.
You married a great guy.

1076
02:08:08,953 --> 02:08:10,511
Fuck you, Jack.

1077
02:08:14,091 --> 02:08:16,059
That won't do it.

1078
02:08:17,227 --> 02:08:19,161
That won't get rid of me.

1079
02:08:20,397 --> 02:08:22,365
You're my friend.

1080
02:08:23,634 --> 02:08:25,864
l'm going to come after you.

1081
02:08:31,141 --> 02:08:35,043
Hey, how can you leave me
at a time like this?

1082
02:08:35,112 --> 02:08:36,773
l need you.

1083
02:08:37,848 --> 02:08:40,078
l need you.

1084
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:19,949
l thought you might need a lift.

1085
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,653
ls everything all right?

1086
02:11:06,964 --> 02:11:09,091
Hey, Henry.

1087
02:11:17,274 --> 02:11:19,834
Give me your hand.

1088
02:11:31,255 --> 02:11:33,746
That morning l wept.

1089
02:11:35,826 --> 02:11:39,853
l wept because l loved the streets
that took me away from Henry...

1090
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:41,955
and would lead me back to him.

1091
02:11:44,034 --> 02:11:48,903
l wept because the process
by which l had become a woman...

1092
02:11:48,972 --> 02:11:50,405
was painful.

1093
02:11:52,309 --> 02:11:54,368
l wept because from now on...

1094
02:11:54,444 --> 02:11:56,435
l would weep less.

1095
02:11:58,749 --> 02:12:01,411
l wept because l had lost my pain...

1096
02:12:01,485 --> 02:12:04,249
and l was not yet accustomed
to its absence.
