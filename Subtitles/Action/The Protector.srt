1
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,906
Those are the four Jatubaht warriors

2
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:47,202
that protect the King's elephant.

3
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:48,871
Why do they have to protect it?

4
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,249
The elephant is so big! Who can hurt it?

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,961
Because the King is riding on the elephant.

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,839
That is why we have to be careful at the bottom.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,299
Careful of what Dad?

8
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,260
You see,

9
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,514
If we lose our sword we need to use Muay Thai

10
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:08,487
Muay Thai crushes your opponent.

11
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:09,438
Careful of what Dad?

12
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,399
I can't tell you now

13
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,320
But I’m going to be Jatubaht

14
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:15,738
So I must know!

15
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,617
Not now Kham,

16
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,704
But one day you'll know.

17
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,393
Sawadee krup

18
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:20,986
Sawadee krup

19
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:27,995
Sawadee ka

20
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,460
Splash here

21
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,839
Splash here son

22
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,301
Splash here son

23
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:43,181
Dad! Por Yai is bullying me again!

24
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,517
Por Yai, you're bullying him?

25
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:48,563
Por Yai, don't bully him!

26
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:52,526
Splash here

27
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:10,132
Dad I’m here!

28
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,335
Come join

29
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:23,681
Dad! Dad! Where is Por Yai going?

30
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,061
Let him be Kham

31
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,830
Pull it tight

32
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,416
Pull it tight

33
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,251
Yeah, yeah

34
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,171
Like that

35
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:38,300
If, one day, Dad has the chance to offer Por Yai to the King

36
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,724
It would be the greatest thing ever to happen to me

37
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:50,565
At least it won’t be a waste, to be born into a Jatubaht warrior family

38
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:25,317
Korn! Look at this! Is it pretty?

39
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,967
This year Songkran [Thai New Year] should be fun

40
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,295
Mr. Sutem is hosting everything

41
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,466
Hosting a huge party!

42
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,554
Well his son just won a position in the senate recently

43
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:50,982
It’s actually good, returning
Favors to the villagers

44
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:54,645
Koi! Hey there is going
To be a elephant checkup

45
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,814
Why don’t you take your elephant there?

46
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:58,483
Maybe you'll get good luck!

47
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,123
Say your farewell to Por Yai, Kham

48
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:17,257
Tomorrow after checkup, we may never see him again.

49
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,641
It is your chance, don’t worry about us.

50
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,720
Uncle! Over here!

51
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:56,723

52
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,060
Pa! He's here

53
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,114
Sawadeep krup Uncle

54
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,149
Uncle, please go inside

55
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,692
Everything is ready

56
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:11,157
Hey kid, just wait outside

57
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,786
Let uncle go in alone, it'll be alright

58
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:21,887
This is Mr. Sumpot, my friend

59
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,297
Sawadee krup

60
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:28,304
He'll take care of everything for you

61
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:35,938
Elephant collar bell for sale! Collar bells!

62
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:43,240
Can I choose one?

63
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:44,574
Yes choose

64
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,286
Gives good fortune

65
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:48,087
How much is this?

66
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,539
Twenty five Baht, it’s not expensive

67
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,210
Buy a collar bell for elephants! For good luck!

68
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,171
Thank you

69
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,345
Let me see

70
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,182
Wow! Beautiful

71
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,145
Let’s go..

72
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:22,330
Jungo!

73
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,789
He punches left

74
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,334
Wow! Amazing

75
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:26,377
He dodges it!

76
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,340
Oh no, he falls!

77
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:26,868
Let's go

78
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:28,913
Let's do it

79
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,000
What? You're taking him today?!

80
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,753
Yes, today Uncle

81
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,214
Why don't you go home and relax

82
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,841
And I’ll send you news later

83
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:45,892
Hurry up

84
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,561
Go closer

85
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:49,647
Go!

86
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,234
Hurry up!

87
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,321
You can't take him!

88
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,574
I won't let you have him!

89
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,878
You stubbon old farmer

90
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,130
Who cares if you die!

91
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:19,310
Shit! Let's go!

92
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,625
Couldn't you see the car! For fucks sake!!

93
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,387
Dad!

94
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,264
What happened?

95
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:01,103
Kham, go look for Por Yai.

96
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,615
Gooo!

97
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,285
Hey!

98
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,874
Who the fuck are you?

99
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,126
Have you met with a foot before?

100
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:26,268
Go! Goo!

101
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,375
Go! Goo!

102
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,207
Where are Por Yai and Korn?

103
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,668
Where are they?!

104
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,879
You don't know!?

105
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,966
Johnny took them!

106
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,802
They're in Sydney!

107
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,516
Hey, where is he?

108
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:33,944
Shoot!

109
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,855
Shoot him Pa!

110
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,043
Hurry up, there he goes!

111
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,340
Hurry!

112
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:51,508
Wow! Mangoes look so good

113
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:52,634
Sawadee ka

114
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,261
How much are they?

115
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:55,471
You want some mangoes?

116
00:24:55,856 --> 00:24:57,808
Don't worry about it

117
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:59,810
Here, take them!

118
00:25:00,987 --> 00:25:02,522
How much?

119
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:03,940
Don't worry

120
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:05,150
Oh, you sure that's okay?

121
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:06,443
Of course, don't worry!

122
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:08,238
Since you insist, I’ll take another two

123
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:10,282
Thank you very much

124
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,199
You're welcome

125
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,060
Look at you, ugly guy!

126
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,350
Shit, Tui! You stupid twat!

127
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:12,977
What the hell are you doing?

128
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:14,645
Sergeant, how'd you know it was me?

129
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:16,355
You have a fucking long face

130
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,357
Who wouldn't recognize you?

131
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:18,025
Drop the gun!

132
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:20,452
Don't come any closer

133
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:21,529
Or I’ll shoot you sergeant!

134
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,406
Hey... I don't care if you shoot me

135
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:25,325
But... Your Mum

136
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:26,326
If your Mum comes, you're going to be dead

137
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:27,494
She comes, you're dead

138
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,704
Don't try to trick me

139
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,039
My Mum's not here!

140
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,125
Not here? Really! Look behind you

141
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,399
Go, go, go! Damn you!

142
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,209
You confused?!

143
00:28:35,677 --> 00:28:37,045
Confused, bitch!?

144
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,421
Go, go, go!

145
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,135
Shit, when was it cut?

146
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:35,430
From the front door to the room

147
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,808
We have people on guard every ten meters

148
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,605
Uncle, I have already prepared everything

149
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:46,110
I hired the best cook in this town,
especially to make Pao Hue soup

150
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,489
For our other important guests to eat also

151
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:52,160
I hope that everyone will enjoy it, especially you Uncle

152
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:55,205
Eat up, so you will have good health

153
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,624
When you are in good health

154
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,045
You will continue to manage the business
of our family for a long time to come

155
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,227
You sure this is Pao Hue?

156
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:17,984
Not salty, doesn't smell good,
not sweet, tastes like damn worms!

157
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,530
You all know worms?

158
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:27,287
Crawling creature that has
both sexes in a single body

159
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:34,487
You can't do anything right?! What has happened to you, Rose?

160
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,173
You can't even take care of the taste of the food

161
00:30:36,224 --> 00:30:38,343
How are you going to protect me?

162
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:43,599
My personal safety is now the concern of Cheun

163
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:51,026
Ever since her dad has been alive,
Cheun has taken care of this anyway

164
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,949
Her actions are considered as not respectful to others

165
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:03,124
All the people that we will be talking to
are representatives from the government

166
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,293
If we are on the same side with them

167
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,005
Our business has a massive potential for growth

168
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:12,552
And for you, you can take care of a small restaurant

169
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:17,475
For you, even this should be enough, Rose

170
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,195
That stupid old man! He embarrasses me in front of everyone!

171
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,491
He's not crazy

172
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,330
And there is no need to rush

173
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:40,086
When you already have this thing, haven't you

174
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:50,266
I think my fate is greater than that old man's fate

175
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:12,418
What you doing round here?

176
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:14,921
What? You're Thai?

177
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,758
Well, I'm speaking Thai!

178
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,259
Where do you think I'm from?!

179
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:20,971
Are you an illegal immigrant in Sydney?

180
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,307
No, I'm looking for Por Yai and my brother

181
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,193
Looking for your relatives?

182
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:25,894
Yes!

183
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:27,271
What do they look like?

184
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:28,480
Chang (elephant)

185
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:34,780
Chang? Hmm... That name sounds familiar

186
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,617
Let's just go talk down at the station

187
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:46,961
Sawadee ka

188
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,381
How's it going Goong?

189
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:49,757
Getting a lot of customers?

190
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:50,842
Not at all!

191
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,469
It's because you never come and support my restaurant

192
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,138
I'm very busy at work

193
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,973
Hey, look we have a new promotion for lunch

194
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,101
I'll make sure I come when I'm free

195
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,233
The name of the restaurant is Thai

196
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,652
Tom yum goong soup is even Thai food

197
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:09,031
I wonder why they let a Vietnamese like Johnny be the manager?

198
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,659
Johnny! Johnny!

199
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:14,872
See you later

200
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:16,583
Ok, back to work

201
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,625
Me too

202
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:22,306
Hey, don't cause problems

203
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:23,591
Follow him! Hurry!

204
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:24,592
Quiet, quiet

205
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:30,266
They're the ones who kidnapped Por Yai and Korn

206
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,935
You don't have any evidence

207
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:33,145
You can't accuse someone just like that

208
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:35,689
I have a picture but it's in the taxi

209
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,901
Just shut up, we'll talk at the station

210
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:17,658
Johnny! Where the hell are my elephants?

211
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,912
Give me back my elephants!

212
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,150
Johnny! Give me back my elephants!

213
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:52,369
Hey, I want to warn you since were both Thai

214
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:53,996
Don’t mess with them, they're big trouble

215
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:51,250
Damn! Your face gets scarier every day

216
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,895
The King is riding the elephant

217
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,446
That is why we have to be careful at the bottom

218
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,495
Enemies will attack there

219
00:49:57,009 --> 00:50:00,045
The four Jatubaht warriors will protect the elephant’s legs.

220
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:07,096
What's the crucial technique dad?

221
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,397
One day... You'll know Kham.

222
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:39,352
Tui?

223
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:41,646
What the fuck are you doing?

224
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,232
Sergeant... They forced me... I...
