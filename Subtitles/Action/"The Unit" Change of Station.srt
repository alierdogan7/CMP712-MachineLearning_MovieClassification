 <i>MERCI,</i> DOCTOR.

358
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:07,167
YEAH, IT'S A CASE
FOR A TACTICAL ATTACK.

359
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:10,067

BRAVO, QUEBEC, 00242321.

366
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,701
ARE YOU CALLING
IN AN AIR STRIKE?

367
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,967
CIA HAS LOCATED
AHZMEH TOURS.

368
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:29,768

IN THE NAME OF AHZMEH TOURS.

00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,734

PARTY OF 19

371
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,833
FROM LAHORE TO NEW DELI.

372
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,601
THE CLOSEST AIRFIELD
WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE

373
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,634
A 20 PAX PLANE
IS KERIAPUR.

374
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,701
HERE.
20 MILES FROM OUR TEAM.

375
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:44,401
CIA REQUESTS WE EYEBALL
AND IDENTIFY THE TARGET
FOR AN AIR STRIKE.

376
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,867
SO, LET HIM GET
ON THE PLANE, AND
THEN TAKE IT OUT?

377
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,234
THAT'S RIGHT.

378
00:23:58,501 --> 00:24:00,701
RYAN.
GO FOR PINNACLE.

379
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,367
YES, SIR.

380

00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:08,334
THE PACKAGE WILL BE AIRBORNE
BY THAT TIME.

383
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,134
YOUR EQUIPMENT IS DOWN?

384
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,900
HOW LONG IS YOUR HOLD?

385
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,900
NO, SIR. THAT IS OUTSIDE
THE WINDOW.

386
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,768
YOU WANT MY MEN TO WHAT?

387
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,301
PUT THE BUS ON THE GROUND.
DELAY THE BUS.

388
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,800
NO, SIR.

389
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,567
I WILL NEITHER INSTRUCT
NOR ADVISE MY MEN,

390
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:29,301
AND I WOULDN'T DO IT IF
I WAS STANDING AT HIS ELBOW.

391
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,401
YOU CAN BE THE PROUD PARENT
OF THIS OPERATION,

392
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,900
OR YOU CAN GET THE HELL
OFF MY PHONE.

393
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,601
SNAKE DOC?

00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:38,567

GET READY, EM.

396
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,967
MISSION SHIFT.

397
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,267
AIR FORCE FAST
MOVER CAME UP BLANK?

398
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,200
FAST MOVER DIDN'T
COME UP BLANK.

399
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,634
IT'S POLITICAL.

400
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,534
MAN ON THE GROUND
IS DENIABLE.

401
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,000
F-16 IS NOT.

402
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:56,734
SNAKE DOC, THAT BUS HAS
GOT TO CEASE TO EXIST.

403
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,701
NEGATIVE, I DO NOT HAVE
THAT ORDINATES FOR YOU.

404
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:00,701
NEGATIVE.

405
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,034
THE AIR FORCE IS ON BREAK.

406
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,900
YOU'RE THE MAN ON THE GROUND.

407
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,034
I UNDERSTAND.

408
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,034
NO ORDINATES,
AIR SCOUT'S ON BREAK.

409
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,567
NO, SIR.

410
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:09,867
SUICIDE'S A SIN,

411
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,701
AND I ALREADY GOT TOO
MANY POINTS ON MY LICENSE.

412
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:12,900
SNAKE DOC OUT.

413
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,000
MR. GREY.

414
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,134
BOSS?

415
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,501
MISSION HAS SHIFTED.

416
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,833
YOU WILL EXFILL THE GIRL

417
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,167
AND THE PACKAGE
AS PER THE FALLBACK PLAN.

418
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,933
YOUR TEAM,
MR. GREY.

419
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:30,967
GOT A BUSLOAD
OF INFECTED TOURISTS
TO NEW DELHI.

420
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:34,000
FROM NEW DELHI
OUTBOUND TO LONDON,
CHICAGO, MADRID.

421
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,000
BUSLOAD OF TOURISTS?

422
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,134
THAT'S RIGHT.

423
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,301
WHAT ARE THEY
BRINGING WITH THEM?

424
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,401
THEY AIN'T BRINGING
NOTHING WITH THEM,

425
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,467
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

426
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,100
BUT WHAT ARE THEY
PLANNING ON BRINGING?

427
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,501
YOU'VE ALL HAD
YOUR SMALL POX SHOTS?

428
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,301
UH-HUH.
SHE HASN'T.

429
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:52,867
SHE'S BEEN UNDER
SINCE BEFORE THE '04
IMMUNIZATION MANDATE.

430
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,567
GOT TO GET HER
SOME HELP.

431
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:57,867
BOSS.

432
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,501
KERIAPUR.

433
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,234
LOOK, LET THEM FLY
IN TO LAHORE, BOSS.

434
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,401
LET THE AIR FORCE DEAL
WITH THEM ONCE THEY'RE THERE.

435
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:06,301
BY THEN, THEY WILL HAVE
SPREAD THE DISEASE.

436
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,267
WE'LL TURN THEM OVER
TO PAKISTANI SECURITY.

437
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,800
HALF OF THEM'S
AL QAEDA.

438
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,034
NO, WE'RE GOING
TO STOP THEM HERE.

439
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,301
SHOW ME.

440
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,200
ONE ROAD
TO KERIAPUR AIRSTRIP.

441
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,367
FLYING OUT IN--

442
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:18,701
THERE, THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

443
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:21,634
I'M GOING TO RUN
THEM OFF THE ROAD
AND GO FROM THERE.

444
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:22,800
MR. GREY.

445
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:24,900
MOVE YOUR TEAM OUT.

446
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:25,900
[MUMBLING]

447
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,134
PUT HER OUT.

448
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,867
YOU GOT A PLAN, JONAS?

449
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,668
I ALWAYS GOT PLAN.

450
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:36,734
YOU GOT A PLAN
TO MEET UP WITH THE TEAM
FOR EXFILL?

451
00:26:38,134 --> 00:26:39,967
SEND THE KID AFTER ME.

452
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:56,367
"THE 1921 SMALLPOX
A-STRAND IS INDICATED

453
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:57,933

1921 SMALLPOX A-STRAND, YES.

456
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,100
WE ARE AWARE OF THAT.

457
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,434
I'VE GOT RELATIVES
IN CHICAGO.

458
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,434
MANY PEOPLE DO.

459
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,067
I SAY IT'S A DISGRACE.

460
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,267
AND I SAY IT WITH YOU.

461
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,367
WHAT ARE THE ARMY CHILDREN
SUPPOSED TO DO?

462
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:43,967
FOR HELP--FOR HELP
OUTSIDE THE FAMILY.

463
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:45,534
WHAT ARE THE CHILDREN
SUPPOSED TO DO?

464
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,900
WHO DO THEY GO TO?

465
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,200
WE'VE GOT MONEY FOR EVERY
HALF-BAKED, FOOLISH STUDY

466
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,401
ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

467
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:53,367
WHO CAN THEY TURN TO?

468
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:54,734
THEIR TEACHERS.

469
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,501
MRS. GERHARDT?

470
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,967
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING AWAY FOR?

471
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,367
NOW, SAM.

472
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:02,367
THE ARMY, AS YOU
UNDERSTAND IT,

473
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:05,434
CONTROLS
AND MUST CONTROL
THE MOVEMENT OF TROOPS.

474
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,668
BUT HOW LONG ARE
YOU GOING AWAY FOR?

475
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,634
THIS ISN'T
YOUR FIRST BASE.

476
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:10,768
NO.

477
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,634
AND IT ISN'T
MINE EITHER,

478
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:14,668
AND WE'VE
BEEN REASSIGNED.

479
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,601
[KNOCKING]

480
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,234
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

481
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:30,401
NOW, THIS IS MY NUMBER
AND SHOULD YOU,

482
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,634
AT ANY TIME, NEED HELP--

483
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:35,701
EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP
OR SOMEONE TO TALK TO--

484
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:37,401
SOMEONE A LITTLE
BIT MORE SENIOR.

485
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,534
HE FELL OFF THE SWING
SET IN THE BACKYARD?

486
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,734
THAT'S RIGHT.

487
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,134
THERE ISN'T A SWING SET.

488
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:51,501
SOMEONE TO TALK TO
IN ADDITION, OF COURSE,

489
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,933
TO YOUR MOTHER
AND YOUR FATHER.

490
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,234
MY FATHER BEATS ME.

491
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,501
WHERE'S MOM?

492
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,534
SHE IS OUT
WITH AUNT MOLLY.

493
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:22,567
STRESSFUL
CIRCUMSTANCE MOMENT.

494
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:23,867
YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

495
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:25,200
DAD?

496
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:28,100
NOBODY FORCED YOU
TO JOIN THE ARMY.

497
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,434
LOOK AT ALL THESE FORMS.

498
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,900
DRIVE ANYBODY INSANE,

499
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:37,768
BUT I DIDN'T JOIN THE ARMY
TO DO HOMEWORK, DID I?

500
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,900
I JOINED THE ARMY
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE BIG MONEY WAS.

501
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:47,967
TILL THEY TOOK AWAY
MY CLOTHING ALLOWANCE
AND MY COMBAT PAY.

502
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,134
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

503
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,367
BUT I WONDER IF I'M GOING
TO LIKE THIS NEW BASE.

504
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:01,134
WHY ARE WE MOVING?

505
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:11,401
WE'RE GOING
TO BE NEAR THE BEACH.

506
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,734
NEAR YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

507
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,534
BUT WHY?

508
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,434
I'VE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME, BABY.

509
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,900
BUT YOU LOVE THIS JOB.

510
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,900
AND I PROMISED
YOUR MAMA A CHANGE.

511
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:26,134
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT ME TO BREAK
MY PROMISE, WOULD YA?

512
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,768
DADDY?

513
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,434
YEAH.

514
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,234
ARE YOU ALWAYS STRONG?

515
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,668
NOBODY'S ALWAYS STRONG.

516
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:45,601
MS. GERHARDT
WAS THE YOUNG BOY'S
TEACHER 3 YEARS AGO.

517
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:46,734
3 YEARS AGO?

518
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,000
HE CAME TO HER FIRST,

519
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,467
BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS CLOSE.

520
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:53,134
HIS PARENTS?

521
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,100
I DO NOT KNOW.

522
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,967
WE BROUGHT HIM HOME AND HE...

523
00:30:58,134 --> 00:30:59,900
HE SAID THAT
HIS FATHER BEATS HIM.

524
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,768
HIS FATHER
BROKE HIS ARM?

525
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,301
HE SAID THAT HE FELL
FROM A SWING SET.

526
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,267
WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM HOME,

527
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:09,401
HE CHANGED HIS STORY
AND SAID THAT HIS FATHER--

528
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,900
HIS FATHER BEAT HIM.

529
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,768
HIS FATHER'S
NOT HERE NOW.

530
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,567
HE CAME TO
YOUR MS. GERHARDT--

531
