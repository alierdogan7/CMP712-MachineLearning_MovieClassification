Oh, it's fine. Slow.

21
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,655
I'm glad we're
only a quarter full.

22
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,247
Same up here.

23
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,587
Did you hear something
about the weather front?

24
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,026
Yeah. These things
used to bother me.

25
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,084
The weather?

26
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,425
No.

27
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,558
That we're gonna be delayed
getting into Paris.

28
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,090
Ha ha ha!

29
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,330
Please tell me you plan
on getting some sleep tonight.

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,896
Oh, I can promise you
we'll be in bed early.

31
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,797
Emily, why don't
you go out with us?

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,832
It'll be so fun.

33
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,401
Wow. Paris at night.

34
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,435
Zee Champs Elysees,
zee clubs...

35
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,177
- zee mademoiselles.
- I will be busy.

36
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,878
Now, if you'll
please excuse me, ladies...

37
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,545
I've got some work to do.

38
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,918
Okay.

39
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,354
That's a hint.

40
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,948
- Yaah!
- Aye, aye.

41
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,298
So what's the deal
with the special cargo?

42
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,366
It was
some last-minute, top-level...

43
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,036
government contractor shipment.

44
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,580
This says there's
an armed guard in the hull.

45
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,912
That's a first.

46
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,145
What are we carrying?

47
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,085
I'm not sure I want to know.

48
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,453
Well, looks like
all the signatures check out...

49
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,651
so we are free to drop it
with the S.O.C.

50
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,332
All right, it says here if there
are any abnormalities...

51
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,460
involving the cargo area-

52
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,199
Abnormalities?

53
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,802
We're to contact a Dr. Bennett
and Dr. Sebastian.

54
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,369
These were the guys
that secured the cargo.

55
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,539
They're in first class.

56
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,048
Abnormalities.

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,415
I'm glad this is my last flight.

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,475
Yeah.

59
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,273
Lucas, you need to settle down.

60
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,807
No, you're not listening!

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,979
We could lose Kelly,
and I won't let that happen.

62
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,421
- Do you underst--
- Would you calm down?

63
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,684
You're makin' a scene here.

64
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,750
Now, I told you, I will
bring Kelly out of stasis...

65
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,090
when we have
a controlled environment...

66
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,187
not before.

67
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,220
We all know
this is highly unorthodox.

68
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,254
We had to move quickly.

69
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,825
This is our--
our only way out.

70
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,892
Unorthodox?

71
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,131
Hey, she would have died,
and we saved her.

72
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,070
If we hadn't intervened,
she'd be dead.

73
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,700
You goddamn well know that.

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,039
Now, were we able
to reach our friend?

75
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,241
Kolinsky's made
all the arrangements...

76
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,375
for the transport,
and we'll see him in Prague.

77
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,680
In Prague?

78
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,812
I thought we had a lab
set up in Toulon?

79
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,549
Crazy.
Our files have been hacked.

80
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,749
That'll be
the first place they look.

81
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,122
We are running out of time!

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,558
There have always been risks...

83
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,720
but think of the good
we are doing.

84
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,661
We will save loved ones.

85
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,858
We will bring them back.

86
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,730
It's why we all have sacrificed.

87
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,235
Kelly knew the risks
goin' into this.

88
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,259
Ah, that's easy for you to say.

89
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,203
That's not your wife
down there, is it?

90
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,228
Is it?!

91
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,263
Shh. Calm down.

92
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,366
Sit down. Sit down.

93
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,104
Come on. Come on.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,701
That's it.

95
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,270
Now, listen,
I know how you feel.

96
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,407
I really do.

97
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,349
But do you, for one minute,
think I don't know...

98
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,114
what's at stake here?

99
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,712
My entire company depends on
the success of this project...

100
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,985
and I am less concerned
about losing one life...

101
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,390
than I am of saving thousands.

102
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,553
So I'm not gonna
let you or your wife...

103
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,530
or some petty little bureaucrat
jeopardize this project.

104
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,965
So shut the fuck up
and get back to your seat...

105
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,332
because this subject
is closed for good.

106
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,803
Are we clear on this, doctor?

107
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,500
We're clear.

108
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,368
Excuse me.

109
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,910
He's not gonna let this go.

110
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,041
Don't worry about it.

111
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,176
Dr. Thorp will
not be leaving Paris...

112
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,653
not with us at any rate.

113
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,722
Excuse me, Miss...

114
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,825
I'll, uh, take
a rum and Coke, please.

115
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,733
Oh, sorry, Burrows.

116
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,396
Rude of me. Make that two.

117
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,731
Right.

118
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,339
How about a Coke?

119
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,109
If a little bit of Bacardi were
to find its way in there...

120
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,015
it would be
our little secret, huh?

121
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,776
Uh, yes.

122
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,019
Anything for you, Mr...

123
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,357
Uh, Burrows, Truman.
But, no, thank you.

124
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,224
And I'm Frank,
Frank Lee Strathmore.

125
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,824
It's a name rich with tradition.

126
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,300
MY, uh...My family--

127
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,769
She doesn't need to know
your family history, Frank.

128
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,437
Look, I don't expect
to be tied up long.

129
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,343
Just a couple of parking ticket
kind of things, really.

130
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,812
I mean, how about you and I...

131
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,247
meet at the Eiffel Tower
around midnight?

132
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,012
I'm sorry to disappoint you...

133
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,246
but, uh, Frank here,
he's gonna be a little busy.

134
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,720
That's okay.

135
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,251
Truman, if you guys need
anything, let me know, okay?

136
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,351
Thank you.

137
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,218
Okay.

138
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,128
Truman?

139
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,334
Truman, hmm.

140
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,597
I guess that pretty well
does it for me.

141
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,969
Looks like if you
play your cards right...

142
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,632
she could be cuff in' you later.

143
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,006
<i>Mmm.</i>

144
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,311
You're gonna shut up
and drink your Coke.

145
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,315
HEY, guys.

146
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,418
Hey.

147
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,255
My God, you are are lovely.

148
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,731
Stewardess, do you think...

149
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,324
I could get some sugar
with my coffee?

150
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,664
Down, boy.

151
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,537
So, is Ally packed?

152
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,303
Aw, she's been packed
for five years.

153
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,241
The legendary Ray Bashore
retiring.

154
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,009
So, why isn't she with you
on your final flight?

155
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,449
She insisted on staying home...

156
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,475
to get things
ready for our trip.

157
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,489
Oh. So, where are you two going?

158
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,752
Summer vacation
with the grandkids...

159
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,419
then we're on a slow
ocean cruise to Alaska...

160
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,951
just the two of us.

161
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,327
That's so romantic.

162
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,923
Yeah, the ocean cruise maybe,
but the kids?

163
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,264
Ooh, sounds like a nightmare.

164
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,930
Hey, that's great Ray, really.

165
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,097
Thank you.

166
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,902
Looks bad ahead, huh?

167
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,670
Oh, not to worry.

168
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,244
Boring flight, boring flight.

169
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,046
So, I can't wait to go shopping
at Chanel in Paris.

170
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,684
Courtney says that we have
to go to Cartier first...

171
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,284
and then we can go to--

172
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,058
Yeah. Well, I can't wait
to go surfing in Biarritz.

173
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,823
Surfing?

174
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,458
Oh, yeah, we're goin' surf in'.

175
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,332
You can go surfing.

176
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,597
Good.

177
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,333
You and that slut Jackie
can go surf in' all you want.

178
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,432
Whoa. Hey, Tony's
my friend, all right?

179
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,464
Mm-hmm.

180
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,068
We're here to surf,
and you know that.

181
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,705
And, hey, his girlfriend's
a total bitch...

182
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,214
and you know that.

183
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,910
What the hell is it
with you two?

184
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,617
I don't like her, okay?

185
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,882
Whatever, okay.

186
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,787
Whatever yourself.

187
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,122
Hey, yo, Tone.

188
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,220
- Yeah?
- Gotta go long, buddy.

189
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,286
Oh.

190
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,993
Nice.

191
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,667
Oh, Oh!

192
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,500
- It hurts to get scored on.
- Geez, Peter, stop it!

193
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,527
Thank you.

194
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,198
Child.

195
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,132
Whoa. Nice toss.

196
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,542
Hey!

197
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,546
I'll give it back to you
when I'm done playing with it.

198
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,911
Hey.

199
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,142
Dude, she cannot take the ball.

200
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,741
Obviously, she can.

201
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,046
Nice toss.

202
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,700
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Freeman?
- Yeah?

203
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,233
Uh, could I--
Could I get your autograph?

204
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,437
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

205
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,175
That--That final putt
on the last day of The Masters?

206
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,080
Man, that was poetry.

207
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,345
Oh. poetry, huh?

208
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,374
Yeah.

209
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,477
All right. Here you go.
Thank you.

210
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,579
- Thanks, Mr. Freeman. Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

211
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,320
Why can't they
just leave us alone?

212
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,952
You told me this was
a trip away from golf...

213
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,362
and everything
that goes with it.

214
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,025
I know, and it is.

215
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,832
Look, I promise
that for the rest of the trip...

216
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,966
I'm just gonna be
plain old Billy, all right?

217
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,669
You won't even know
Long Shot exists...

218
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,177
I promise you that.

219
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,509
Okay.

220
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,014
Love that smile.

221
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,277
Excuse me, Mr. Freeman.

222
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,305
Yeah?

223
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,410
Captain Bashore
would love to meet you.

224
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,250
When he has a break
later in the flight...

225
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,222
would you mind
if he stops by for a visit?

226
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,089
Yeah. It's not a problem.
Thank you.

227
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,186
Great.

228
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,719
You know, while you're at it...

229
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,358
if you're done fawning
over my husband...

230
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,096
I'd love another Bloody Mary.

231
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,262
Anna.

232
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,966
William, I'm on vacation.

233
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,305
I'll get your drink
right away, Mrs. Freeman.

234
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,207
Yeah, and make sure you put
some vodka in it this time...

235
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,939
'cause that's
how I like to tee off.

236
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,071
Hey.

237
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,605
There's no reason
to be so rude, all right?

238
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,844
Oh.

239
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,977
You know, I'm sure there's
someone back in coach...

240
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,544
that hasn't got
your autograph yet.

241
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,580
Well, maybe I'll go back there
and give it to him.

242
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,991
You knew what you were gettin'
into when you married me.

243
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,461
I thought I did.

244
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,166
Yeah, you just keep twirling
that little putter of yours...

245
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,673
'cause that's all you're gonna
be twirling on this trip.

246
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,471
Wasn't so little
last night, was it?

247
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,704
You know you've
got the wrong man.

248
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,874
Yeah.

249
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,904
That's why Interpol
has your picture...

250
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,178
all over the Internet.

251
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,812
It's a classic case
of mistaken identity.

252
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,015
Yeah.

253
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,556
Hey.

254
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,885
Hey.

255
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,331
Burrows, you can't
treat me like this.

256
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,728
I'm not guilty.

257
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,099
It's not fair, bouncing me
all over the world...

258
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,734
to stand trial here and there
for something I did not do.

259
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,276
I'm not guilty.

260
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,739
I'm not guilty.

261
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,146
No, I have a clear conscience.

262
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,274
I'm--I'm not guilty.

263
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,612
Yeah.

264
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,448
What is it going to take
to convince you I'm innocent?

265
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,619
An act of God.

266
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,029
Now shut up
before I make you eat...

267
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,725
that flotation device
you're sittin' on.

268
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,228
<i>Mmm.</i>

269
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,341
Here we go.

270
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,348
We can fly around it,
but not above it...

271
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,818
and this is a huge system.

272
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,447
It's about 150 miles
east and west of course...

273
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,253
so it looks like either way
we go, we are screwed.

274
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,186
It's either that, or we fly
all the way back around...

275
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,391
but that's gonna add 30 minutes
to our flight at least.

276
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,560
Hmm...Paris weather
is not good for our arrival.

277
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,167
I'm gonna deviate left
and thread the needle.

278
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,005
That gap might be our only shot
at getting around this system...

279
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,738
without landing for fuel.

280
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,456
Folks, looks like it's gonna
get a little bumpy ahead.

281
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,087
Like you to remain in your seats
and wear your seatbelts.

282
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,927
Probably be through this
in ten or fifteen minutes.

283
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,456
Thank you very much.

284
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,153
Oh! Ow! Ow!

285
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,715
Ow!

286
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,397
Oh, God!

287
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,662
Did you hear that?

288
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,261
Something must have
shifted and fell.

289
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,749
As you know, Mr. Madison...

290
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,657
a combined strike team
of the CIA and FBI...

291
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,560
seized the headquarters
of Medcon Labs in Los Angeles.

292
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,927
A number of arrests were made...

293
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,864
but we've been
unable to determine...

294
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,232
the whereabouts
of four key individuals.

295
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,760
The first one,
Dr. Leo Bennett.

296
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,070
He's a head research scientist
and founder of Medcon...

297
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,337
known for his work
with retroviruses...

298
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,470
and synthetic biology.

299
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,104
He was investigated
two years ago...

300
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,046
for illegal cloning research.

301
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,982
Unfortunately,
that investigation...

302
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,644
failed to produce
any indictments.

303
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,017
So far, I've seen nothing...

304
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,817
that warrants
disturbing the President.

305
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,255
Can we get to the point here?

306
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,190
Look, we're
trying to reconstruct...

307
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,488
Bennett's hard drive...

308
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,722
and we think there
is cause for alarm.

309
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,695
We believe Leo Bennett
is responsible...

310
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,499
for the development of a new
strain of the malaria virus...

311
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,937
and the containment
and transportation...

312
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,235
of Dr. Kelly Thorp.

313
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,639
Malaria?

314
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,666
Initially,
we thought it was malaria.

315
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,737
However, we discovered
that it's something new...

316
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,009
something different.

317
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,407
Bennett obtained a DNA sample
from a mosquito...

318
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,613
native to a remote area
in Vietnam...

319
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,021
which had a 100 percent
mortality rate within seconds...

320
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,050
which then regenerates
that same organism...

321
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,527
for a few seconds or longer...

322
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,894
depending
upon the subject organism.

323
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,796
What Bennett has
developed is a mutation...

324
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,995
of this same mosquito virus
to restart major organs...

325
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,732
for an indefinite period
of time.

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,266
So, what you're saying is
that his virus kills organs...

327
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,742
and then brings them
back to life?

328
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,370
Not just organs.

329
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,813
He apparently was experimenting
on the resurrection...

330
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,407
of the entire human body
after death.

331
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,112
Oh, impossible. I can't go
to the President with this.

332
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,211
Jerry, come on.

333
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,815
From what we've uncovered,
we believe he's succeeded.

334
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,323
Ohh! Ohh!

335
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,390
Help me.

336
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,981
Oh...Oh!

337
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,253
Aah.

338
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,898
Hello?

339
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,278
What--

340
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,222
What is going on?

341
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,194
What is happening to me?

342
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,213
Aah!

343
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,112
Aah-haa!

344
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,440
Aah! Aah!

345
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,318
God damn it.

346
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,432
Jesus.

347
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,594
What now?

348
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,570
We got electrical
and communication problems.

349
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,309
And we just had
a temperature drop...

350
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,743
in the cargo hold.

351
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,277
This is Concord 2-3-9 to base.

352
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,286
This is Concord 2-3-9 to base.

353
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,556
Great. No radio and this crap
for the next hour.

354
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,581
Perfect.

355
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,685
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

356
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,990
I'm sick.

357
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,220
I need help.

358
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,459
I need help!

359
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:34,471
I'm a scientist
with Medcon Labs.

360
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,574
Where the hell is Dr. Bennett?

361
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,710
Aah! Aah!

362
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,478
I need to talk to someone!

363
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,516
I'm coming out!

364
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,152
Don't shoot!

365
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,163
Come out. I won't shoot.

366
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,166
Aah!

367
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,570
Aah!

368
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,893
What the fuck? Fuck.

369
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,554
Where is she?

370
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,091
Oh, God! Help!

371
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,577
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

372
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,508
Okay.

373
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,987
Hey, will you grab me
a Diet Coke on the way back?

374
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,546
Sure, honey.

375
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,716
Thanks, babe.

376
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,368
Check out that dime.

377
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,703
Wow. That is
one hot little be-otch.

378
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,901
Uh-huh.

379
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,305
Ow! Fuck, that hurt!

380
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,475
Oh, hi, honey.

381
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,539
Busted.

382
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,542
So, I guess
that mid-flight blowjob...

383
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,350
is out of the question?

384
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,856
Such a Pi!!-

385
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,913
Sweetheart?

386
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,786
What?

387
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,228
Did you see that?

388
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,096
Come here.

389
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,837
Um...

390
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,813
Hey, hey, hey, he!!-

391
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,309
What?

392
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,613
What's wrong?

393
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,019
I mean, what
if somebody sees us?

394
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,216
What are you talk--

395
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,247
We're in a bathroom.

396
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,281
What are you talking about?

397
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,988
No. I--
You know what I mean.

398
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,959
You're Peter's best friend.

399
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,228
So what?

400
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,082
Oh! I'm sorry.

401
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,253
Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry.

402
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,489
I didn't mean to scare you.

403
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,519
- No. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

404
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,553
I wasn't paying attention.

405
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,792
Sir, you actually,
you need to take your seat.

406
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,129
The "fasten seat belt" sign
is on.

407
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,362
Yeah, yeah, um...

408
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,698
Can I get you
some more coffee? Okay.

409
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,726
Yes, thank you.

410
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,466
You're welcome.

411
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,973
Uh, "Mee-gan,"
rhymes with vegan.

412
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,168
- I was a vegan...
- Yeah?

413
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,198
For two days.

414
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,574
"Mee-gan" Vegan...Ha!

415
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,873
It's actually "Meh-gan."

416
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,905
"Meh-gan."
Oh, no, I know that. Um...

417
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,280
Sir, you actually need
to take your seat.

418
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,682
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,447
I just--You need to be
more careful.

420
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,749
I mean,
people sneakin' up on you.

421
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,517
There's strange people here.

422
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,649
You never can tell...

423
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,818
what's gonna happen
on these flights.

424
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,849
Sir, you need
to take your seat.

425
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,327
Okay. Thanks, thanks.

426
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,761
- You're welcome.
- Buckle up.

427
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,264
Yes.

428
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,180
Jesus.

429
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,460
Ha! Wow.

430
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,033
Cool, huh?

431
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,541
Yeah.

432
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,659
Maybe this little diversion...

433
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,460
will keep my mind off
your tasteless, cheap suit.

434
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,794
Would you feel better...

435
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,860
if I was in a bitch-ass
orange jumpsuit...

436
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,030
like the one
you're gonna be wearing...

437
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,367
the rest of your life?

438
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,896
There you go
getting nasty again...

439
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,738
when I am merely
offering a criticism...

440
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,938
of this sartorial horror show
you call a suit.

441
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,742
However, I do like the shirt.

442
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,749
Does it come in a man's style?

443
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,681
And for your information,
the jumpsuits in France...

444
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,849
are a sort of burgundy, yeah.

445
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,450
Oh, you should look nice
in that color.

446
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,654
Now I know what color corsage
to get you...

447
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,594
when big Pierre
makes you his wife.

448
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,928
Someone sounds
a wee bit jealous.

449
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,297
Yeah.

450
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,237
.Aah!
.Aah!

451
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,455
Aah!

452
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,922
Aah!

453
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,562
- Ow!
- Ha!

454
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,145
Ow!

455
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,214
Anna.

456
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,861
I'm gonna descend a little.

457
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,092
Is it over yet?

458
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,195
Let's find out.

459
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,565
This is Randy.

460
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,236
It's Stacy.

461
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,643
I--I think
some of the passengers...

462
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,045
might have been hurt.

463
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,139
How bad?

464
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,474
I don't know.
It's a mess down here.

465
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,679
Well, we'll do the best we can.

466
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,187
Just stand by.

467
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,021
Looks like we're okay
for a few minutes.

468
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,758
Give 'em the go-ahead to check.

469
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,265
Let me know what's what.

470
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,231
Well, folks, we apologize...

471
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,934
for the heavy turbulence
we just experienced.

472
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,999
It appears as though
we're clear for the moment.

473
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,137
However, we're traveling
through some unstable air...

474
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,148
so, as a precaution,
I would like you...

475
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,912
to remain in your seats
for the time being.

476
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,818
At this time, I would only
like our flight attendants...

477
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,253
up and about the cabin.

478
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,517
Thank you.

479
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,626
Would you make sure
everyone's all right?

480
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,287
Then have
one of the doctors...

481
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,126
uh, Bennett or Sebastian...

482
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,530
check the cargo
situation out with you.

483
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,828
The cargo?

484
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,600
I'll get my tools.

485
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,307
Is she okay?

486
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,542
It's her head.

487
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,482
Looks like Tony got hurt.

488
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,580
Damn.

489
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,197
You all right, dude?
You take one?

490
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,224
Fucking bag
hit me in the head.

491
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,203
Come on, that was fun.
It's just turbulence.

492
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,637
My God, don't be such a baby.

493
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,661
It didn't hit you.

494
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,730
Relax.

495
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,734
What is your problem, girl?

496
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,372
Oh, are you scared
we're gonna crash?

497
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,711
Relax, bitch. Enjoy the ride.

498
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,910
Whoa, Jesus,
pipe down, you psycho.

499
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,674
Shut up.

500
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,846
What the hell's wrong
with you?

501
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,822
- Hey!
- What?

502
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,948
You are a psycho.

503
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,823
You know, and you're
a fucking skank.

504
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,122
I am so sick of your shit!

505
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

506
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,792
- Bring it.
- Fuck off!

507
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,527
Stop it! Hey, come on!
Everyone just calm down.

508
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,761
Take your seats.

509
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,461
And you take your seats, too.

510
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,062
Take your seats.

511
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,842
What is wrong with you?

512
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,106
We have
several warning lights...

513
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,878
we don't usually get,
even with this weather.

514
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,979
It's probably nothing,
but we should look just to see.

515
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,387
I agree.

516
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,617
Why don't you two go with him?

517
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,387
Both of us?

518
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,854
Right.

519
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,625
Well, whoever's going,
meet me by that exit door.

520
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,826
It usually takes a few minutes
to get down there...

521
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,459
and there's no easy way to go.

522
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,099
God damn it. I told you.

523
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,130
I told you both.

524
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,164
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

525
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,939
Just go check on our passenger.

526
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,581
If it was a malfunction,
Kelly might be dead.

527
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,141
Yeah, listen,
don't take your eye off him.

528
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,743
Make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid.

529
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,089
Are you guys Okay?

530
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,253
I'm fine.

531
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,321
But, uh, do you think we can
move up to business class?

532
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,128
I mean, the plane's
really empty and all.

533
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,293
He's kidding. We're fine.

534
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,393
- Okay.
- Thank you.

535
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,730
Hey, I am trying
to help you out here.

536
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,537
She wants you. Make your move.

537
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,544
Go, boy, go.

538
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,278
I'm sorry if this is a problem.

539
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,307
No problem.

540
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,719
We'll take care of it.

541
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,245
It could be dangerous.

542
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,820
Only if you're afraid
of the dark.

543
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,227
Come on, bro.

544
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,794
I need to go to the sandbox.

545
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,822
What?

546
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,856
I gotta pee.

547
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,891
No.

548
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,835
You heard the P.A.
Sit down and hold it.

549
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,005
Fine.

550
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,478
Oh, if you should happen
to feel something warm...

551
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,208
just move
a little to your right.

552
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,775
You're like a five-year-old.

553
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,784
Come on, let's go.

554
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,823
Oh!

555
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,554
Easy. Take it slow.

556
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,925
Yes, of course!

557
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,230
Burrows?

558
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,177
Burrows?

559
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,052
Mr. Burrows?

560
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,388
Truman.

561
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,018
Oh, my God.

562
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,957
All right, gentlemen.
Here we go.

563
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,082
Oh, my God. Truman.

564
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,244
Ohh.

565
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,411
Truman?

566
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,476
<i>Mmm?</i>

567
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,382
What?

568
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,956
Mmm...

569
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,293
Mmm...

570
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,322
Oh.

571
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,261
Oh.

572
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,274
Aw, that little shit.

573
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,293
Flight deck.

574
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,421
Captain, this is Megan
at door four-L.

575
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,489
We've got a problem back here.

576
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,432
Okay. How bad is it?

577
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,629
Mr. Burrows, the cop who brought
the prisoner on board...

578
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:25,300
was knocked out cold,
and his prisoner is missing.

579
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,321
Excuse me.

580
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,849
You guys seen a, uh,
funny-lookin' skinny guy...

581
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,021
blue sweatshirt, turtleneck,
walk through here?

582
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,121
No.

583
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,995
No? No? All right.

584
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,210
Well, that explains
the communication problem.

585
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,910
Frey? Dr. Thorp!

586
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,445
Kevin!

587
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,762
Frey's not in the jump seat.

588
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,061
My God.

589
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,629
This can't be happening.

590
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,197
We need to get out of here now!

591
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,230
Come on!

592
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,470
We need to seal the hatch now!

593
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,444
- What's wrong?
- Come on!

594
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,572
Lucas.

595
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,777
Kelly. Oh, God.

596
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,153
No! Aah!

597
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,556
Aah!

598
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,650
No!

599
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,651
Run!

600
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,236
Aaah! Aaah!

601
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,762
Tony?

602
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,599
Tony?

603
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,582
Asshole.

604
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,721
Ah ha ha ha!

605
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,224
Don't scare me like that.

606
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,624
What? Where the fuck
are you goin'?

607
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,855
Ow, that hurts.

608
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,261
And don't use that kind
of language around me, either.

609
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,069
Over here. Come over here.

610
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,779
Hey, you two.

611
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,551
You need to be in your seats
with your belts fastened.

612
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,718
Why don't you make yourself
a fuckin' sandwich...

613
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,092
while you're at it?

614
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,798
What have you done?

615
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,368
You son of a bitch, what
have you brought on board?!

616
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,610
Take your seats, everyone!

617
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,880
Please take your seats!

618
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,652
Okay, if everyone
could just calm down.

619
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,680
Please take your seats now.

620
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,748
Do you know what's goin' on?

621
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,053
Ray, open up!

622
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,152
What's wrong? Randy!

623
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,358
Ray, bring the plane down!

624
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,458
Ray, bring the plane down!

625
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,298
Bring the plane down right now,
or we're all gonna fuckin' die!

626
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,928
Oh, shit.

627
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,508
Tell me what the hell
happened down there.

628
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,774
It's the fucking...

629
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,509
The fucking--
The fucking scientists...

630
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,312
they let something
out of the cargo hold.

631
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,319
What are you talking about?
Where are the doctors?

632
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,342
They're dead!
All right, they're dead!

633
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,376
Settle down!

634
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,787
Look at me, man!

635
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,882
Everyone's gonna fuckin' die!
They killed 'em!

636
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,086
Sit down and calm down!

637
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,992
Sit down!

638
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,860
Now! Sit down!

639
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,530
What happened to you?

640
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,196
Listen to me.

641
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,864
Just listen to me, Ray.

642
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,865
- If you don't land this plane now...
- Slow.

643
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,572
You, me, Emily...

644
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,342
everybody on this
fucking plane is gonna die.

645
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,941
You know I can't bring
her down without warning...

646
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,076
and no place to land.

647
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,711
Think about it!

648
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,221
There is something...

649
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,515
that's not human
down there, man...

650
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,550
and it's gonna kill
everybody on board...

651
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,755
unless we land this plane.

652
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,821
So whatever you do,
I don't care how you do it--

653
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,197
- Look, I need you to calm down.
- Just find a place, Ray,

654
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,530
and land the fucking plane!

655
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,968
Find a piece
of straight fuckin' road!

656
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,766
This storm isn't
helping our situation.

657
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,397
If it's clear,
we can try to cross...

658
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,567
but I'm turning around
and heading back.

659
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,577
There's a TSA man aboard.

660
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,739
Find out which passenger he is
and get him up here!

661
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,248
Now!

662
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,510
Ray...

663
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,455
Are you sure that's the guy?

664
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,017
Okay, they're dead...

665
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:57,458
and you say whatever
killed them wasn't human.

666
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,154
I know it sounds insane.

667
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,389
I saw this happen.

668
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,795
I mean, those things...

669
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,232
I mean,
they ripped those men apart...

670
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,792
and they were eating them.

671
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,963
You said there was
a fugitive on board.

672
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,473
Is it possible
you saw him down there?

673
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,806
No. I told you,
there were two of them...

674
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:19,747
and these--
These things aren't human.

675
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,044
You know what?

676
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,051
I'm gonna go find out
what was in those containers.

677
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,245
Where are you going?

678
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,948
I'm gonna go talk
to that asshole, Bennett...

679
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,046
because he knows.

680
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,613
Sit down.

681
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,522
I'll check it out.

682
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,687
I'll report back.

683
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,172
Everything okay? Okay.

684
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,298
Any sign of him?

685
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,070
No.

686
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,134
How's your head?

687
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,112
Uh, better than my ego.

688
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,012
Aw, come on,
he can't hide forever.

689
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,277
As soon as
the turbulence settles...

690
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,648
I'm gonna look for him
some more.

691
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,710
Don't go alone.

692
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,221
Why? ls he dangerous?

693
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,951
Well, he's probably
never owned a weapon before...

694
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,516
but he's more of a con artist
than anything.

695
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,118
What did he do?
Can you tell me?

696
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,493
Um...

697
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,054
He posed as an accountant...

698
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,396
skimmed $35 million
off the Russian mob...

699
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,231
stole their jet,
crash landed it,

700
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,827
and we finally caught up to him.

701
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,860
Everybody wants him.

702
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,032
Wow.

703
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,302
Why are you taking him
to Paris?

704
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,370
Oh!

705
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,680
Are you okay?

706
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,910
I'm okay.

707
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,542
You should take your seat.

708
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,177
Okay. Be careful.

709
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,482
- Okay.
- All right.

710
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,692
Hey, take a look at this.

711
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,696
I think I found Concord 2-3-9.

712
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,629
Nobody's been able to reach them
for over an hour.

713
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,037
Los Angeles dispatch,
this is Yellowknife Center.

714
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,804
I believe I have
your Concord 2-3-9 on my screen.

715
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,903
It's in the middle
of two huge weather fronts...

716
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,914
and transponder indicates
it's off course.

717
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,715
No. No radio contact yet.
I'll try now.

718
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,581
Concord 2-3-9,
Yellowknife Center.

719
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,188
Concord 2-3-9,
Yellowknife Center.

720
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,956
Los Angeles dispatch.

721
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,056
I need you to put this
on speaker-phone right away.

722
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,498
Yes, I understand.

723
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:27,242
I repeat, you must tell 2-3-9
to return to U.S. airspace.

724
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:30,040
The Canadian government
will not permit them to land...

725
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,377
or continue to fly
in their airspace.

726
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,541
This decision has come...

727
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,277
from the highest level
of the Canadian government...

728
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,115
as well as the U.S. State
Department and the CDC.

729
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,143
Is that clear?

730
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,087
Can you tell me what it is...

731
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,648
you're transporting
in the cargo hold?

732
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,058
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,084
My cargo is
a highly classified project...

734
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,528
linked to
our nation's security...

735
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,964
and you don't have
the necessary clearance.

736
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,594
I'm with the TSA,
Federal Air Marshal.

737
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,262
I need to know
what's down there.

738
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,533
Well, how fortunate for us...

739
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,507
to have a man of
your obvious talents aboard.

740
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,102
You seem a bit nervous, doc.

741
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,081
Is everything all right?

742
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,913
I just don't like flying.

743
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,976
Isn't it true
your two colleagues...

744
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,921
accompanied the co-pilot
down to the cargo hold...

745
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,617
because there was some problem?

746
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,818
No, no problems.

747
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,190
No problem?

748
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,922
Just a routine
in-flight inspection.

749
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,054
Routine.

750
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,895
What I can tell you, while
my cargo isn't dangerous...

751
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,836
it is highly perishable
and extremely valuable...

752
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:33,137
so the cargo area is off-limits
to unauthorized personnel.

753
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,506
Well, can you tell me--

754
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,669
No, I'm sorry.

755
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,339
I've said more than
I should have already.

756
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,104
You Burrows?

757
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,574
Yeah.

758
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,735
I'm Paul Judd, TSA.

759
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,644
I believe your prisoner's
in the cargo hold.

760
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,808
Ready?

761
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,061
Hey, Frank!

762
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,175
Frank!

763
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,647
Frank, get out here!

764
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:51,244
Dr. Thorp! Dr. Sebastian!

765
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,494
Anybody out there?

766
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,027
That's a lot of blood.

767
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,054
Somebody was in trouble.

768
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,363
Yeah, if it's Frank's,
he needs help now.

769
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,943
Check that out.

770
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,852
Looks like he escaped
through the ducts.

771
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,617
I don't know.

772
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,022
That's an awful lot of blood...

773
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
for a skinny little shit
like Frank.

774
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,326
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

775
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,592
Meet back in five.

776
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,327
All right.

777
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,115
Hey, Frank?

778
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,351
You there, buddy?

779
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,831
Now, why don't you come on out
and talk to me, man?

780
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,629
Everything's all right.
It's cool.

781
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,797
We can just talk.
It's just me.

782
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,108
Frankie?

783
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,181
I'm gonna kill that little shit.

784
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,645
All right!

785
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,553
I'm comin' up.

786
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,093
Yes?

787
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,797
You're sure?

788
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,076
Outstanding.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

789
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,708
We have located
Bennett and his team.

790
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,183
Hallelujah.

791
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,478
Aw...

792
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,909
Ohh...

793
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,535
Ohm

794
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,614
You know, Frank, sometimes
this job is really boring.

795
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,777
This is not
one of those times, bud.

796
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,985
You're makin' this
real exciting.

797
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,755
Ohm

798
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,429
Son of a bitch.

799
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,152
Paul?

800
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,434
Frank?

801
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,444
Raah!

802
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,774
Get off!

803
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,040
Aah!

804
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,142
Aah!

805
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,123
Oh, my God!

806
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,158
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be sick!

807
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,192
Oh, my God!

808
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,329
Cara, where the fuck
are you goin'?

809
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,362
Where are you--
What the fuck?

810
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,341
Tony, this bitch
just got shot, dude.

811
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,311
There's fuckin' bullets
comin' from somewhere.

812
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,210
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

813
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,173
Oh!

814
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,016
Please take your seats.
Everything's fine.

815
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,614
Take your seats, okay?

816
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,954
Please take your seats.
We're gonna be fine.

817
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,390
Thank you.

818
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,892
Ray, it's total chaos down here.

819
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,805
There were gunshots or something
that freaked out the passengers.

820
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,566
Aah!

821
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,011
Aah!

822
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,447
Aah! Aah-Ha! Aah!

823
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,611
Emily!

824
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,086
Go. Take the gun.

825
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,427
Oh.

826
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,287
Ohh...

827
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,867
Ohm

828
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,812
Oh, God,
this can't be happening.

829
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,307
Get back.

830
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,612
Go back to your seats
and stay there!

831
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,380
Go back!

832
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,479
Aah!

833
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,315
Move, move, move, move!

834
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,515
Aah!

835
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,545
Get out of my way!

836
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,422
Cara! Cara!

837
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,790
Cara, open the door!

838
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,816
What's going on here?

839
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,590
Move! Cara!

840
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,064
Aah! Aah!

841
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,658
Hold on, Cara!
I'm coming! Cara!

842
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,169
Aah!

843
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,192
Aah!

844
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,398
Go!

845
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,466
Oh, shit.

846
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,497
Dude, what the--

847
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,703
Get back!
Get back! Get back!

848
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,234
Get back!

849
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,405
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

850
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,436
Oh, my God!

851
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,109
Cara! Cara!

852
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,276
Stay right there!
Stay back there!

853
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,308
What the fuck, dude?
What is this?

854
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,480
Christ!

855
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,223
Holy shit!

856
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,853
Get off him!
Get off him! Get off him!

857
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,862
Aah! Aah!

858
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,356
What is this shit?!

859
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,901
Help me!

860
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,374
Aah!

861
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,679
Aah!

862
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,740
Aah!

863
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,086
Aah! Aah! Aah!

864
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,688
Fuck! What the fuck?

865
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,903
What the fuck was that?

866
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,236
Please, please!

867
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,709
Please go back to your seats!

868
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,302
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

869
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,177
Oh, my God!

870
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:12,215
Oh, my God, Tony,
what happened?

871
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,585
What the fuck happened?

872
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,364
Please take your seats.

873
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,277
Flight deck.

874
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,245
Ray, something's
happened down here.

875
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,947
Something attacked
one of the passengers...

876
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,416
and he's dead.

877
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,579
You got to get us down, Ray.

878
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,882
Oh, my God.

879
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:47,911
Megan, listen to me.

880
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,252
No, no, you don't understand.

881
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,953
There's blood everywhere,
and--and--and Stacy...

882
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,824
and one of
the other passengers was hurt.

883
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,796
How did it happened?
Who attacked?

884
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,325
I don't know.

885
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,925
Maybe the escaped prisoner?

886
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,435
I can't think of anyone else.

887
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,460
Look, Megan,
we've turned around...

888
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,530
and we'll land
the first place we can find.

889
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,940
And the only way back is
through the center of the storm.

890
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,012
You need to get the passengers
back to their seats now.

891
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,743
Okay.

892
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,607
Ow.

893
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,947
Oh.

894
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,963
I'm scared, Meg.

895
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,310
Aah!

896
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,408
Oh, God!

897
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,420
God!

898
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,916
.Aah!
.Aah!

899
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,516
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

900
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,724
Aah! Aah!

901
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,862
Aah! Fuck!

902
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,332
Get out!

903
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,068
Help! Help me!

904
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,973
Help me! Help me!

905
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,534
Oh, shit!

906
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,637
They're gonna kill us all!

907
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,944
I should go check
on the passengers.

908
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,357
Open the door! Help me!

909
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,365
For Christ's sake,
they're gonna kill us all!

910
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,264
Open this fuckin' door!

911
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,065
God damn it! Help me!

912
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,431
Aah!

913
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,158
Aah! Aah! Aah!

914
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,661
Aah!

915
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:55,432
Aah! Aah!

916
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,440
Bill!

917
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,776
Hey, hey, what's goin' on?

918
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,550
- Oh, shit!
- Doc, what's goin' on, man?

919
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,750
Oh, shit! I can't explain!

920
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,780
We got to get out of here!

921
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:11,883
They're gonna kill us!

922
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:16,193
Wait! Calm down!

923
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,699
Calm down. What's goin' on?

924
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,325
I don't want to die.

925
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,994
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

926
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,766
Be very quiet.

927
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,500
Don't let them come get us!

928
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,300
Aaah!

929
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,706
Come on.

930
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,514
What happened?

931
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,325
Bill, where are you going?

932
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,030
Come on, come on! Go!

933
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,474
Where?

934
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,341
The back galley-
the floor's two-feet thick.

935
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,402
It's the only safe place.

936
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,209
No, I can't. I can't.
My wife is upstairs.

937
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,083
Oh, shit.

938
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,177
Well, get her and get back there
as soon as you can.

939
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,585
Come on, now! Come on!

940
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,925
Aah! Aah!

941
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,862
Aah!

942
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,962
Aah!

943
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,270
Come on!

944
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,809
Aah! No!

945
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,220
- Hey, hey, you go.
- Tell me something.

946
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,522
- Help me get this open.
- What's going on?

947
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,553
It's the only place
we can find.

948
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,586
Hey. shh! Shh!

949
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,621
Tell me something.

950
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,793
Be quiet.
Good, good, good.

951
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,427
Hey, you, you get in there.

952
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,960
- Wait!
- See if you can see anything.

953
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,404
Go on. Get up. Get up.

954
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:41,164
Do you see anything?

955
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,540
Do you see anything?

956
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,566
Okay, be very quiet.

957
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,600
Come on, baby.

958
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:45,704
Gimme a hand.
Gimme a hand.

959
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:49,080
God damn it.
You know you fucked up, right?

960
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,140
Asshole.

961
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,780
Stacy?

962
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,557
No--oh!

963
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,524
Ohm

964
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,156
- Duck!
- Aah!

965
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,027
Aah!

966
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,331
Aah!

967
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,681
Oh, my God.

968
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,048
You all right?

969
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,313
No bites? No--

970
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:26,479
We thought...We thought...

971
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,149
What? That it was me gnawing
on all the passengers?

972
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,555
No. I'm a vegetarian.

973
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,696
Ugh!

974
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,234
Hey!

975
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,738
Let go of me!

976
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:52,509
The overall feeling among the
scientists working on this...

977
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,539
is that we're dealing
with a serum transfer virus.

978
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:59,781
This virus is without
a known vaccine or cure...

979
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:03,689
but this type virus transfer
is only through bodily fluid...

980
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,919
and then most effectively...

981
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,554
blood from an infected victim
enters a cut or saliva.

982
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,860
The Medcon scientists believed
they could make this work...

983
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,298
despite the side effects...

984
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,096
that are being brought back
from the dead.

985
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,932
In fact, they looked upon
these side effects as a benefit.

986
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,959
Mm-hmm.

987
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,597
Let me paraphrase these notes...

988
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,006
that we found
on Dr. Bennett's desk.

989
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,567
They wanted this virus
as a bioweapon...

990
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,376
to keep soldiers fighting after
they were mortally wounded...

991
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,680
to release a captive enemy
infected with the virus...

992
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,414
and let him infect others
until they all kill each other.

993
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,324
I'm going to recommend to you
and to the President...

994
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,488
that we destroy
Flight 2-3-9...

995
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,964
before it can reach
a populated area.

996
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,228
Let me get this straight.

997
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:50,032
You want our forces to follow
a shoot-to-kill order...

998
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,766
regarding
this civilian aircraft?

999
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,434
We've had no communication
with the aircraft.

1000
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,376
We must assume the cargo
has been breached...

1001
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,401
and that the virus has spread...

1002
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,811
throughout
the passenger section.

1003
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,215
The only chance we have to
contain this is to vaporize...

1004
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,412
every living thing
aboard that aircraft...

1005
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:09,218
before the virus can reach
a major population center.

1006
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,191
Do you concur?

1007
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:14,524
I'm afraid I do.

1008
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,670
Can you get me
the President, please?

1009
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,143
Dear God...

1010
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,050
Oh!

1011
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,587
Get off of her! Get off!

1012
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:45,649
Get off!

1013
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,899
Oh! Oh, my God.

1014
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,669
Aah!

1015
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,542
Aah!

1016
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,184
Aah! Aah!

1017
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,650
Get her up!

1018
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,087
Oh, my God.

1019
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,132
- Oh!
' Shh!

1020
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,875
Why? Why'd you do this, huh?

1021
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,077
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, man!

1022
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,414
It wasn't me.

1023
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,785
I was just following orders.

1024
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,484
They told me it was
an experiment to extend life.

1025
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,687
I had no idea there'd be
these crazy side effects.

1026
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,218
Well, look around you, asshole.

1027
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,992
Your side effects have
eaten half the passengers.

1028
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,965
Hey. Hey, I don't have
to listen to you.

1029
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,092
You were
the one that seemed like...

1030
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,328
you were givin' all the orders.

1031
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,802
You were the one that
the cop was talking to...

1032
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:03,860
and you were the one
that sent the others below.

1033
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,338
I heard all of that.

1034
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,431
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1035
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,600
It wasn't me, I tell you.

1036
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,371
Hey, keep your voice down.

1037
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,139
Yeah, well,
you just keep talking.

1038
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,942
You'll draw their attention.

1039
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,210
Aaah!

1040
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,757
Aah! Aah!

1041
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,471
Aah!

1042
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,175
Aah!

1043
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,222
Aah!

1044
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,355
Oh!

1045
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,718
It's startin' to get
really tight in here.

1046
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,854
Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,660
I think we're getting closer.

1048
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:59,214
Ray! Ray, I'm hurt!

1049
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,914
Open up! Hurry!

1050
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,781
Ray!

1051
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,285
Hurry!

1052
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,027
God!

1053
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,819
Aah!

1054
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,049
Aah!

1055
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,854
Oh, my God.

1056
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,401
I don't know
if that's gonna work.

1057
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,462
It has to work.

1058
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,269
Oh, God.

1059
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:58,968
Oh!

1060
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,071
Let's get the other side, hmm?

1061
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,174
Okay.

1062
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,854
Two in the chest,
one in the balls...

1063
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,088
that's what I say.

1064
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,724
It's barricaded.

1065
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,166
Ah, Frank, I see you!

1066
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,534
He did that?

1067
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,593
Busy little beaver.

1068
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,101
Raah!

1069
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,667
Come on.

1070
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,114
Oh, my God.

1071
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,488
Come here, Frank.

1072
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,821
Aah!

1073
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,851
Where have you been?

1074
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,885
Where have I been?
Where have you been?

1075
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:50,920
Where have you been?

1076
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:51,954
Where have you been?!

1077
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,022
I have been up and down
this plane!

1078
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,056
So have I!

1079
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,090
Back off!

1080
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,694
Oh, my God.

1081
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,944
Aaah!

1082
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,082
- Shit! Aah!
- Aah!

1083
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:17,313
Aah! Aah!

1084
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,826
Aah! Aah!

1085
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,765
Aah! Aah!

1086
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,165
Statistically speaking,
the tail section...

1087
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,726
is the safest place
to be in a crash.

1088
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,862
Of course--

1089
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:31,894
Frank, not now.

1090
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:32,928
Help me with this.

1091
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,134
Yeah, man.

1092
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,046
Go! Get something else!

1093
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,070
Get something else!

1094
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:43,606
- I am!
- Do it!

1095
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,982
Right there! Right there!

1096
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,915
I can't lift--
There's a--Wait.

1097
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,218
Frank!

1098
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,162
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

1099
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,062
Quiet, quiet.

1100
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,623
Listen.

1101
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,133
I don't hear anything.

1102
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,542
Go.

1103
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,409
Hold on! Hold on!

1104
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,683
- Ohhh!
- Aah!

1105
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,088
Bennett!

1106
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,728
Oh, my God, Tammy!

1107
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:42,967
- We got to go. We got to go.
- Huh?

1108
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:43,999
We got to go. We got to go.

1109
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,536
GO. Go! go'

1110
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,569
All right,
we need to find anything...

1111
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,911
that can be used as a weapon.

1112
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,678
Does anyone have anything sharp?

1113
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,152
They confiscated
my toenail clippers...

1114
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,485
pearl handle,
with matching tweezers...

1115
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,457
quite lovely.

1116
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,753
Damn, Frank.
You should have brought those.

1117
01:11:58,781 --> 01:11:59,782
You could have saved the day.

1118
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,089
You never know.

1119
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,186
How much ammunition
you have left?

1120
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,821
I got five in here
and one clip.

1121
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,853
What about you?

1122
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,264
One full clip, five more.

1123
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:07,858
Shit.

1124
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:13,231
Hey, maybe we could
electrocute the bastards.

1125
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,764
No, don't do that!

1126
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,640
Aah!

1127
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,407
I guess that
could have gone better.

1128
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,472
Frank, you stupid shit.

1129
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,778
Please tell me you're dead.

1130
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,285
Megan!

1131
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,184
Aaah!

1132
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,521
Where'd you find him?

1133
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,257
The auxiliary lights.

1134
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,286
Oh, my God.

1135
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,300
The auxiliary lights will come
on any second...l hope.

1136
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,426
Frank, fix 'em.

1137
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,168
We need to find weapons.

1138
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,451
Still no answer
from the cockpit.

1139
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,481
Oh, my God.

1140
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:08,188
I can't believe everyone's dead.

1141
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,719
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

1142
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,129
Megan, listen to me.

1143
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,723
Listen to me.
We're not gonna die.

1144
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:13,825
No. Okay.

1145
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,927
No, we're not gonna die,
I promise you.

1146
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,438
- I need your help.
- Right.

1147
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,303
- I need you to be strong.
- Right.

1148
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,842
Oh! Oh!

1149
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,070
Unh!

1150
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,188
Did you see that?

1151
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,521
What the hell was that?

1152
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:48,829
Listen.

1153
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,734
Someone's up there.

1154
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,511
Don't shoot!

1155
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,184
Aah!

1156
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:19,228
We need to have a plan
to get this plane down safely.

1157
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,029
Does anyone know if
the pilot's still alive?

1158
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,126
I tried to reach him.

1159
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,329
Try him again.

1160
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,632
Okay.

1161
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:36,416
Nothing?

1162
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,644
No, no.

1163
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,653
The captain's dead.
We're on autopilot.

1164
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,814
So, what? We just fly
around until they get us?

1165
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,551
Or until we run out of fuel.

1166
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,614
Actually,
that might be preferred.

1167
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,647
Run out of fuel?

1168
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,716
Yeah!

1169
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:47,749
Hey, hey, hey, we got to get
to the flight deck...

1170
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:48,784
and check on the captain.

1171
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,353
We got to do this now before
they start coming at us.

1172
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,455
I don't think
you have enough bullets...

1173
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,488
to make it to the cockpit.

1174
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,194
The guard down below
has a weapon.

1175
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,896
We need that weapon.
That's our only chance.

1176
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,767
So, what?
You're just gonna go down there?

1177
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,067
- Down there?
- Yes!

1178
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:00,437
How do we know he didn't
use all the ammo already?

1179
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,907
We don't know, Frank.

1180
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,163
It's good to know you
still have a sense of humor...

1181
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,073
at a time like this.

1182
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,668
I know it's not much to look at,
but with any luck...

1183
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,440
it's gonna buy me enough time
to get that weapon...

1184
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,744
and get back here
without tearing the plane apart.

1185
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,147
Why are you doing this?

1186
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,345
I made a promise to someone.

1187
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,911
I keep my promises.

1188
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:03,625
I have radar contact
with Concord 2-3-9.

1189
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,570
Should have visual
in two minutes.

1190
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,475
Burrows, in case this blows up
anything, uh, important...

1191
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,037
do you mind if I take
out your new girlfriend?

1192
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,721
Hey, Bennett!

1193
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,654
Got something for you!

1194
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,711
Aah!

1195
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,264
Aah!

1196
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,555
Roger. Try to establish contact.

1197
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,187
You have three minutes
from my mark.

1198
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,392
Mark minus three minutes.

1199
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,332
Roger that. Minus three minutes.

1200
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,801
Try to establish contact.

1201
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:52,465
I'm gonna circle and signal.

1202
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:54,474
Look.

1203
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:58,376
I'd like to think
that's the cavalry, but, um...

1204
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,538
What do you mean?

1205
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,881
We don't have much time.

1206
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,616
Aren't they gonna save us?

1207
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,123
No, they're not gonna save us.

1208
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,386
There's just us.

1209
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,087
Unless we let him know
we're alive...

1210
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,117
he's gonna shoot us down.

1211
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,322
They can't do that.

1212
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,694
He's right.

1213
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:18,720
Unless we answer them...

1214
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,927
they're gonna fire
the missile at us.

1215
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,230
What do we do?

1216
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,294
We answer 'em.

1217
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:27,864
Someone needs to get to
the cockpit and signal that jet.

1218
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,807
Does anybody know
how to fly a jet?

1219
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,572
Anyone? Anyone?

1220
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,574
You can fly a jet?

1221
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,447
Well, not officially,
but I know most of the basics.

1222
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,917
Basics?

1223
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,419
Course, it's been awhile.

1224
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,719
We just need to get
to the radio and use it.

1225
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,157
We need to go now, Frank.

1226
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,252
Aww.

1227
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,354
All right. Count me in.

1228
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,160
No, no, no,
Billy, don't leave me here.

1229
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,257
I'll go. I'll go

1230
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,494
No, no. You stay here.

1231
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:55,968
I'm gonna do my part.

1232
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,063
- Why?
- I'll see you soon, baby.

1233
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,869
I'll see you soon.

1234
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,307
Let's go.

1235
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,871
I got such a big mouth.

1236
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,006
Nice drive.

1237
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,650
Command, this is 4-3-1.

1238
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,056
Go ahead.

1239
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,651
Two-three-nine has no one
in control that I can see.

1240
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,855
Repeat. Two-three-nine...

1241
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,864
has no one
in control that I can see.

1242
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,533
Aah!

1243
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,705
Billy! Billy!

1244
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,612
- No, wait!
- Let me go!

1245
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,275
Billy!

1246
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,912
Aaah!

1247
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,926
Billy!

1248
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,657
Come on, baby!

1249
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:37,601
Aah!

1250
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,965
Aah!

1251
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,578
Get out of my way,
you stupid bitch!

1252
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,914
Aah! Aah!

1253
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,474
Aah!

1254
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,179
Yah!

1255
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,655
You don't know
who you dealin' with!

1256
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,494
Come on, let's go!

1257
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,795
Come on!

1258
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,593
No, no, no, that's it.

1259
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:12,627
That's it, I'm done.

1260
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,662
You guys go. You guys go.

1261
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:14,799
I gotta wait for Anna.

1262
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,069
Go! Go!

1263
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,311
No response to my signals.

1264
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,441
You are clear to engage 2-3-9.

1265
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,212
Command, please repeat.

1266
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,743
You are clear to engage 2-3-9.

1267
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,155
Roger that.
Clear to engage contact 2-3-9.

1268
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,988
<i>L</i> 901 you.

1269
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:34,220
Aaah!

1270
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:37,388
Aah!

1271
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,662
Aaaah!

1272
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:45,963
Aah!

1273
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,171
Hold on, baby.

1274
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,279
I love you.

1275
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,687
I love you, too, baby.

1276
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,089
I always have.

1277
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:16,959
Is that you, Bennett?

1278
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:19,565
Shit.

1279
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,270
Come on, motherfucker.

1280
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,238
I want to make sure you keep...

1281
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,477
that shit-eating grin
on your face...

1282
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,814
all the way to hell.

1283
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,322
Aaah!

1284
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,700
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1285
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,671
Aah! Aaah!

1286
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,298
Aah!

1287
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:04,083
Command, this is 4-3-1.

1288
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,642
It appears that
engine number three is burning.

1289
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,890
Aaah!

1290
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,335
Aaah! Aah!

1291
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,707
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1292
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,337
She's gummin' me to death.

1293
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,015
Damn you! Ohh!

1294
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,787
Go, go, go, go, go!

1295
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,123
Where's the autopilot?

1296
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:53,860
I don't know!
You're asking me, Frank?

1297
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,992
This is different!

1298
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,900
This is different!
Don't yell at me!

1299
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,462
I'm not yellin'!

1300
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:08,208
I have lock.

1301
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,884
Um...uh, we're alive.

1302
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:13,852
Repeat, we're alive.

1303
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:16,481
Abort. Abort.

1304
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:22,853
Missile away.

1305
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:26,161
Incoming object.

1306
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,531
Incoming object.

1307
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,035
They must have launched
the missile.

1308
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:31,128
Frank, we got seconds!

1309
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,036
I know!
Where is the autopilot?!

1310
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,131
I don't know!

1311
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:35,163
Collision imminent.

1312
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,231
Collision imminent.

1313
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:41,805
Here, here.

1314
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:42,837
Autopilot off.

1315
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,872
All right.

1316
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:44,940
What are you doin'?

1317
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,554
- Ready?
- Uh.

1318
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:51,784
We got live civilians.

1319
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,850
Aborting. Repeat, I am aborting.

1320
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:58,921
I'm out!

1321
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,267
Aah!

1322
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,535
Hold on!

1323
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,487
Pull up.

1324
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,287
Pull up.

1325
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,691
Pull up.

1326
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,760
Pull up.

1327
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,426
Pull up.

1328
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,628
Pull up.

1329
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,203
Aah!

1330
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:48,909
Aaah!

1331
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:52,917
Hold on! Hold on!

1332
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:09,927
Aah!

1333
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,995
Aah!

1334
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,270
Aaaah!

1335
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,678
Jesus!

1336
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,818
Pull up.

1337
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,789
Pull up.

1338
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:33,685
Pull up.

1339
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,686
You did it, Frank.

1340
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,494
Whoo!

1341
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,399
Sure.

1342
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,211
Oh, shit.

1343
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,043
Frank?

1344
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:56,139
Frank!

1345
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,342
Yes!

1346
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,407
Mountain!

1347
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,095
Pull back!

1348
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:15,727
Back!

1349
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,601
Mountain!

1350
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:22,664
Mountain!

1351
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,087
Ohm

1352
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:05,774
We did it.

1353
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:08,716
We did it, my friend.

1354
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,883
Would you ever consider
goin' out with an ex-cop?

1355
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:14,052
I went out with a cop once.

1356
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,052
Oh, yeah?

1357
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,621
Yeah. The only thing
he was good for...

1358
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,190
was scratching my back
when I couldn't reach.

1359
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:22,963
Do you ever get
that itch anymore?

1360
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:25,199
All the time.

1361
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,658
