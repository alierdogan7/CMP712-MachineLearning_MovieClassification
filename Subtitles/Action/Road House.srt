235

AII you have to do

236
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:11,069
One: never underestimate your opponent.

237
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,446
Expect the unexpected.

238
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,533
Two: take it outside.

239
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:21,288
Never start anything inside the bar
unIess it's absoIuteIy necessary.

240
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:25,375
And three: be nice.

Come on.

242
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:32,632
If somebody gets in your face and caIIs
you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.

243
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,343
OK.

244
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,431
Ask him to waIk, be nice.

245
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:42,601
If he won't waIk, waIk him. But be nice.

246
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:45,687
If you can't waIk him,
one of the others wiII heIp you.

247
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:47,856
And you'II both be nice.

248

249

- It's nothing personaI.
- Uh-huh.

250

Being caIIed a cocksucker isn't personaI?

251

No. It's two nouns combined

Don't ever do that.
It just takes the energy right out of you.

- Looks Iike a knife wound.
- Like I said.

403
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,586
- You're a bouncer.
- Mm-hm. DoubIe Deuce.

404
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:49,049
Nice pIace. They send
a Iot of business my way.

405
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:53,678
- I'm hoping to change that.
- AII by yourseIf?

406
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:03,230
WeII, Mr DaIton, you may add nine stapIes

That's an estimate, of course.

- Pain don't hurt.

- No, boss, you didn't.

Now I Ieave it up to you to decide which
one of you wants to say ''I'm sorry.''

442
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:29,728

00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:40,488
Now try it again. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a man who's untruthfuI.

446
00:43:40,614 --> 00:43:44,201
- I'm sorry, boss.
- I hate a man who can't admit he's wrong.

447
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:47,954
- I swear to God, boss, I'm sorry.
- You disgust me. Wanna know why?

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,831
No, why, boss?

449
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:55,837
