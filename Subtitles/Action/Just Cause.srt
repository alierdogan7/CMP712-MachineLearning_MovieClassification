00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,162
Well, there wasn't any.

00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,542
- There wasn't?
- No. No, she was penetrated.

If there was no semen, how did you
establish the O-positive blood?

346
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,173
Yeah, we got that
from the teeth and gums.

Hmm.

00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,181
And you said here that
you examined Bobby Earl's hand...

349
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,435

attributed to teeth marks.

the dental plate to the cuts.
