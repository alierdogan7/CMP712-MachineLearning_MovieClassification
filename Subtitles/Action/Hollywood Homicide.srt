Could be something, could be nothing.

185
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,089
Good work, kid.

186
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,591
Did you get the puddle of piss

187
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,172
and the shoe prints in
the electrical closet?

188
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,303
Yeah, I got it, Joe.

189
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,056
I'm going to go hammer on
the owner a little more.

190
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,735
How come you got no
video surveillance,

191
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,385
big-ass place like this?

192
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,848
What kind of security you got?

193
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,763
I ain't never had no problems in my place.

194
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,056
Well, you got a problem now.

195
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,691
Two guys sneak in here with guns.

196
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,601
Who does your security, anyway?

197
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,442
A bunch of off-duty L.A.P.D. cops.

198
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,072
Well, that's your first mistake.

199
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,778
Man, why you ragging on me?

200
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,490
All I'm trying to do is just business.

201
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,973
Julius, you're making me curious.

202
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,993
How come you live in a hotel?

203
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,452
I just sold my crib.

204
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,958
The new one fell through,

205
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,290
so I'm sort of like looking right now.

206
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,585
You're sort of like
looking for a new house?

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,921
That's what I said.

208
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,139
Julius, look, in my other career,

209
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,642
I'm a real estate broker.

210
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,604
Real estate broker?
You got two jobs?

211
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,139
We work a lot of overtime.

212
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,522
We get a lot of time off.

213
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,810
A lot of guys have three jobs.

214
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,444
So what you saying, cop?

215
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,694
What I'm saying to you

216
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,150
is I got a beautiful
3,400 square-foot house

217
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,360
up on Mt. Olympus.

218
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,992
New roof, partial view.
Owner's desperate.

219
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,029
Man, I don't want no
crap on no Mt. Olympics.

220
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,534
Well, what you looking for?

221
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,419
I'm looking for a big house,

222
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,830
something with class.

223
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,173
How much you willing to pay

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,549
for something with class?

225
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,428
Not a penny more than six.

226
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,513
Six?

227
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,926
That's what I said.
Six.

228
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,308
Million'?

229
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,848
I was not soliciting.
I was doing research.

230
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,983
Research is not soliciting.

231
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,564
I've never had to pay for sex.

232
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,354
I have four BAFTA nominations.

233
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,692
Hey.

234
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,981
Evening, Gloria.

235
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,321
Do you know who I am?

236
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,911
Here's our dead guys.

237
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,492
Thanks.

238
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,204
Puddle of piss makes me
think we got a witness.

239
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,122
Sit down there and shut up!

240
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,632
I can't work here.
This place is a zoo.

241
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,214
Let's get out of here
before Boardner's closes.

242
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,472
The doctor's in.
Help is on its way.

243
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,974
Thanks, Hank.

244
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,186
Something wrong, Joe?

245
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,768
What do you mean, something wrong?

246
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,524
You seem down.

247
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,027
Down?
Me?

248
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,063
Lately.

249
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,697
We've been partners for what, four months?

250
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,905
Now you want to be my shrink?

251
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,867
Sometimes it helps to talk.
That's all I'm saying.

252
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,791
All right.

253
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,583
Let me paint you a picture.

254
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,425
Portrait of Joe Gavilan.

255
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,965
Seven, eight years ago,
I sold off the results

256
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,011
of my entrepreneurial
efforts up to that point.

257
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,020
Three tanning salons

258
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,898
and two original silk-tip nail parlors

259
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,278
in the Antelope Valley,
and I started attending

260
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,564
weekend real estate seminars

261
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,403
at the Airport Hyatt.

262
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,819
You know, "How to Make
$1 Million in Real Estate

263
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,703
with Very Little Money Down."

264
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,330
Sounds good.

265
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,129
Started out with a condo in Sherman Oaks.

266
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,496
Slapped some paint on the walls.

267
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,002
Refaced the kitchen cabinets.

268
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,128
Traded up to a smoke-damaged ranch

269
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,713
in Tarzana, then a Spanish on Outpost

270
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,925
and a fake Mediterranean in Los Feliz.

271
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,343
Pretty soon, I had everything
I've got tied up in this...

272
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,264
this monstrosity... on Mt. Olympus,

273
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,651
at the corner of Hercules and,
I shit you not, Achilles.

274
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,186
So what's the problem?

275
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,605
The problem is if I don't
score a big commission

276
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:44,619
or get rid of this...
piece of shit on Mt. Olympics...

277
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,826
Well, the word Titanic comes to mind.

278
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,158
Joe, I know a girl who works

279
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,826
for some rich producer.

280
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,166
Says that he might be selling his place.

281
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,955
Maybe you can get the listing.

282
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,419
Got a name?

283
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,022
Well, her name's, like, Mimi or Moma

284
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,510
or something like that.
I don't remember.

285
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,681
Not the girl, hot rocks.
The producer.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,720
I don't know the producer.
Way before my time. I...

287
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,649
Hey, Joe, you ready for something?

288
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,060
Shoot.

289
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,729
I don't think I want to be a cop anymore.

290
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,703
Come on, you need some fresh air.

291
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,659
Put this on my tab, Hank.

292
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,243
What tab?

293
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,249
Hey, I got it.

294
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,081
I got it.
It's okay.

295
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,496
Here.

296
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,688
Well, if you don't want to be a cop,

297
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,380
what do you want to be?

298
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,343
I want to be an actor.

299
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,727
You want to be what?

300
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,980
An actor.

301
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,232
What?

302
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,358
Okay...

303
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,187
You're gay.
I can deal with that.

304
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,571
You know I'm not gay.

305
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,233
Why do you want to do
something stupid like acting?

306
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,949
Because it's my bliss...

307
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,660
and I have to follow my bliss.

308
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,495
Turning into Oprah around here.

309
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,752
I rented a theater up
on Highland Friday night.

310
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,912
I invited some agents and producers.

311
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,547
It's called a showcase.

312
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,002
What are you going to showcase?

313
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,417
My talents.

314
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,927

Wanda...

Some trick's thumping on prostitutes.

328
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,727
We put our best female officer undercover

329
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,067
