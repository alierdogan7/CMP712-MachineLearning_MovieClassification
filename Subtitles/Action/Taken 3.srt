On the rite of God we fell

1603
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,860
You were plush and I laid bare

1604
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,660
You had me howling

1605
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,660
Cold, I fell into your skin

1606
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,340
On the night you led me under your sin

1607
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:45,340
You had me howling

1608
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,864
You had me howling

1609
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,351
Golden siren

1610
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,701
Under-exposing

1611
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:41,426
Come lay your weakness down

1612
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:48,307
On the floor in the backseat

1613
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:55,380
Gold, I swam into your spell

1614
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:59,260
On the rite of God we fell

1615
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:03,100
You were plush and I laid bare

1616
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:06,020
You had me howling

1617
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:10,860
Cold, I fell into your skin

1618
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,460
On the night you led me under your sin

1619
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:19,460
You had me howling

1620
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:23,382
You had me howling

1621
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:28,271
Ooh, ooh, blush

1622
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:35,991
Ooh, ooh, blush

1623
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:43,665
Ooh, ooh, blush

1624
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:51,709
Ooh, ooh, blush

1625
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:14,431
Ooh, ooh, blush

1626
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:22,385
Ooh, ooh, blush

1627
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:29,746
Ooh, ooh, blush

1628
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:37,790
Ooh, ooh, blush

1629
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:00,266
Ooh, ooh, blush

1630
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:08,264
Ooh, ooh, blush

1631
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,941
Ooh, ooh, blush

1632
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,346
Ooh, ooh, blush

1633
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:02,230
Ooh, ooh, blush
