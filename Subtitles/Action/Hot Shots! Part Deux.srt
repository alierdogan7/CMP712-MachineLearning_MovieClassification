00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,080
Hots Shots Part Deux - 25.0 fps

2
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,320
Arsenio Hall!

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,320
Team Two take the prison.
We get the villa.

4
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,920
Little Sister, this is Big Brother,
we are in the ball park.

5
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Big Brother, Little Sister.
We're at the prison.

6
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Little Sister, this is Big Brother.
Are you in position?

7
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,520
Big Brother, Little Sister,
affirmative. Attack in 30.

8
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Starting now.

9
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
Six...

10
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,880
...five, four, three, two--

11
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,080
It's an ambush!

12
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,320
Ahka-Seltzer!

13
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
Big Brother!
Harbinger, where are you?

14
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,920
Surrender, Yankee infidels!
You have no chance.

15
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,920
Off to prison, American Satans.

16
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Good evening. Americans were shocked today
by the announcement of the failure...

17
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,880
...of yet another mission to
rescue our hostages from the Middle East.

18
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Informed sources reveal that the
rescue team itself has been captured...

19
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,360
...and added to those
already being held.

20
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Preliminary reports also indicate that
an attempt on the life...

21
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,040
...of a terrorist dictator
was thwarted at the same time.

22
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,520
With the president election just 10 days away, 
this could be a setback for the White House.

23
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards, campaigning in _______

24
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,520
...commented on the failed mission.

25
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,800
This is no time for partisan politics.

26
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,040
Bringing our people home
should be the nation's number one priority.

27
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,400
Despite this current crisis, the president
put on his best political face...

28
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
...continuing on
his campaign schedule.

29
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,480
Benson 's 20 point lead
in the poll six months ago...

30
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,760
...has plummeted since
the hostage crisis began.

31
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,160
The CNN/Victoria Secret
catalog poll...

32
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
...now has the president
and Edwards running neck and neck.

33
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,000
This afternoon, Benson made a brief stop
in Fergus Falls, Virginia...

34
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,040
...for the groundbreaking
of his presidential library.

35
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,440
The five living
former chief executives...

36
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,200
...Presidents Bush, Reagan,
Carter, Ford and Nixon...

37
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
...were on hand for
this groundbreaking ceremony.

38
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,440
White House correspondent Jeri Kelter
reports on this historic moment.

39
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,080
The library is to be built the ____
Fergus Falls Civic Center.

40
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,400
President Benson made no statements 
_______ one about his bussiness.

41
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,800
Publicly, it seemed he was unaware of
the political blow he had been dealt.

42
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,720
Privately, aides marveled at his spirit
as he performed his usual morning routine...

43
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,680
...by milking the White House goats...

44
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
...and finishing the second helping
of grapefruit and creamed corn.

45
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,160
Tonight, the president and his top
advisers will be burning the midnight oil.

46
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Sabotage.

47
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,640
My God man, what does it mean?

48
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,840
We must tighten security, sir.
Find out who's behind it.

49
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,320
No, no, no. The word “sabotage.”
What does it mean?

50
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,640
It mean someone's trying to subverting 
our mission, sir.

51
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,760
One of our people can be
working for the enemy.

52
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,080
Come in!

53
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,920
Mr. President.

54
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,880
Oh, Jesus! Don't you ever, ever sneak up
on me like that again.

55
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
What is it, Bob?

56
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
If Edwards hears of this,
he'll use it against you in the campaign.

57
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,960
-Will try to prove that you're incompetent.
-I can prove that as well as he can.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000 
Mr. President, the CIA can't
afford another failure.

59
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,640
We want to send Colonel Walters
to get our people out.

60
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
And to ensure success,
we need Topper Harley.

61
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
We think we've located him in the Far East.

62
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Topper Harley.

63
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,720
We've served together before, sir.
There's no one better.

64
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,840
-Cookie?
-Not me, sir.

65
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
-Young lady?
-No, thank you.

66
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,920
No, no, I was just
offering him a young lady.

67
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, yeah, Topper Harley.

68
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,800
Right, good. I love the boy.
Kid's got guts.

69
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,920
There isn't a fighting man
on this planet that can...

70
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
Gotcha!
Listening at the door, huh?

71
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
Well, Walters, looks like
we've got our saboteur.

72
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
That's your wife, sir.

73
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah, so it is.

74
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,920
Lavinia. You're looking
as lovely as the day we met.

75
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Find out what she knows.

76
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
As for you, get me Topper Harley.

77
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,280 
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles!

78
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles....

79
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
You fight!

80
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
Aisle 5, mezzanine, to your left.

81
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,080
Get your program right here.
Program!

82
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
One pig snout sandwich.

83
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,840
Both fighters starting to show sick
signs of fatigue.

84
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,560
They aren't moving around
the ring as much. Walking around.

85
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Hey, this is where
your conditioning pays off.

86
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
You win!

87
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Topper, Topper, Topper, Topper...

88
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Topper Harley!

89
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,680
Topper.

90
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
I don't believe it.

91
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,920
-Topper.
-Colonel.

92
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,720
-Good to see you again.
-Yeah, you too.

93
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
You want to tell me about it?

94
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
Well, they let me live here.

95
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,360
I help out fixing things.

96
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,920
It's peaceful. Quiet.

97
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,120
No one is allowed to talk.

98
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
And that dim sum fighting
in the warehouse yesterday?

99
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,680
I just do that for the extra money.

100
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,800
And to satisfy my male cravings
to kill and win.

101
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Colonel, who are they?

102
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
She's CIA.

103
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
The other man's an extra.

104
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,800
What does she do?

105
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,240
Heads up covert operations on the Middle East.

106
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Reports directly to President Benson.

107
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,200
Colonel, these men have taken
a supreme vow of celibacy.

108
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,160
Like their fathers and the fathers before them.

109
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,480
They haven't seen a woman in decades.

110
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,920
Miss Huddleston!

111
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,280
This is Michelle Huddleston.

112
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
Topper Harley.

113
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,720
Pleasure.

114
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
-You're not easy to find.
-Why are you keeping track?

115
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
It's like the colonel says:

116
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,520
Good men are hard to find.

117
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,960
I don't know how much you know
about ______ the last war but...

118
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,520
...several of our men
were missing in action.

119
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,720
Since then on two occasions we sent in
squads to rescue those men.

120
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,960
Both missions failed.

121
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,880
Now we have to go and get the men who went to
get the men who went to get the men.

122
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,520
-My job is to make sure we don't fail again.
-What's this got to do with me?

123
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm going this time.

124
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,560
-We want you to go with him, Topper.
-Why me, ma'am?

125
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
Because you're the best
of what's left.

126
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
My war is over.

127
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,920
This will cost you a few extra dollars now.

128
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
But you'll make that back
and more on your heating bill winter.

129
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Later we'll be cocking the ashram
if you want to stop by.

130
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
Thanks, Bob.

131
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,720
This mission's important Topper.
We've got to take care of our people.

132
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,520
Come with me.

133
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,120
When are you gonna
put Ramada behind you?

134
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,760
-What are you talking about?
-You say your war is over.

135
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe the one out there is,
but not the one inside you.

136
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
You running away from the pain,
but it won't solve anything.

137
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,320
Because wherever you go,
you take the pain with you.

138
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,280
You've come an awful long way to burn me lecture, 
haven't you colonel?

139
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,600
I know you were hurt
when that woman left.

140
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,560
But you're just using that to hide
from who you really are.

141
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,120
-That was a long time ago.
-(Thank you. Next!)

142
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,480
I don't want it.

143
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,920
Nice butt.

144
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,760
Topper, let me tell you
a little story.

145
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,520
It seems there were three bears.

146
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,920
And one morning when their porridge was
too hot, they went for a walk.

147
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,960
And a little blond girl came
skipping through the woods...

148
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,120
...she ate their porridge
and she sat in their chairs...

149
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,800
...she slept in their beds.

150
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,400
And when those bears returned
and discovered that mess....

151
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
-Do you know what happened then Topper?
-No.

152
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,720
That little blond girl get scared.

153
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,120
Ran away.

154
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,760
So you're saying is that little blond girl is me.

155
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,440
If it is 'bout me coloring my hair...

156
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,320
Topper, they didn't make you this
fighting machine.

157
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,080
They just cooked up the porridge
and went for a walk.

158
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,080
And you'll never stop running
until you face your three bears.

159
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
Ramada.

160
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,040
Colonel.

161
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,080
I'm sorry.

162
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,160
It got to end for me sometime.

163
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
If you should change your mind...

164
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,000
...here's my 900 number.

165
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,920
It's $5.00 a minute.
I'll waive the charges.

166
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,320
(your three bears...)

167
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,920
(Ramada, Ramada, Ramada...)

168
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320 
Don Corleone. 

169
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,320
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

170
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,400
I love you so much.

171
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,360
But it's such a crazy world.
I just don't want anything to happen to us.

172
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
Don't worry.

173
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,920
Couple of days,
we'll be on the train to Hawaii.

174
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,600
We'll find a minister to marry us,
and we'll never be apart again.

175
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
But if something should keep us apart?

176
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,880
If one of us can't make it
to Blenheim Train Station?

177
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,560
Like, for instance...

178
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,520
...if something came up unexpectedly.

179
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,600
Not that I think it would.
Or it already has.

180
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,120
Wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that...

181
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,120
Kiss me.

182
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,520
Kiss me like you've
never kissed me before.

183
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,480
You will denounce the criminal acts
against our people by your president.

184
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
Sign here.
Initial here, here, and here.

185
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,840
Phil!

186
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,000
Sign the document.

187
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,840
I see you're no stranger to pain.

188
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,040
I've been married.

189
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,720
-Twice.
-Oy!

190
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,160
Like the previous six, this victim
was found folded neatly in half...

191
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,680
...in place inside the glove compartment
of a sanitation truck.

192
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,760
Police are baffled.

193
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,160
This just in:

194
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,600
Presidential military adviser
Colonel Denton Walters...

195
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,600
...has been captured during an
aborted attempt to free our hostages.

196
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,760
This tape was delivered
to us just moments ago.

197
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,920
They are treating me good here.

198
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,160
The food is tasty and nourishing.

199
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,920
The peaceful leader
of this great country...

200
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,600
...has asked me to appeal
to you, President Benson...

201
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,920
...to stop your vicious, imperialistic
tactics around the world.

202
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and give a warm welcome...

203
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,880
...to His Excellency,
the Prime Minister of Japan...

204
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,120
...Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.

205
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,320
The president of the United States,
Thomas Benson.

206
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,520
Mr. President, this is Prime Minister
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.

207
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
President Benson,
where is your first lady?

208
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,720
My first lady? Hell I don't know. I've had lots of women.
Lost my flower to tender age of 15.

209
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
I can't keep track of all.

210
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,680
Let's get this over with.
Not feeling so well today.

211
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,120
My intestines were removed during
action in the North Atlantic.

212
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,600
Took a torpedo in the low abdomen.
And they replaced every foot of my bowels with hemp.

213
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
-Clogs easily.
-I hope you feel better.

214
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Well, my lips to yours.

215
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,520
(The junior senator
from Minnesota, Gray Edwards.)

216
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,080
President Benson,
Prime Minister Soto...

217
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
...ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,080
Tonight we put election politics
aside as I join you...

219
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,800
...in my duties as majority whip and chairman
of the Foreign Affairs Committee...

220
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,360
...in welcoming the
Japanese prime minister...

221
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,000
...and his lovely wife
to these United States.

222
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Our two great nations have begun...

223
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,560
...what we hope will be a long
and successful dialogue.

224
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,000
-(Not only economicaly...)
-I don't remember eating that.

225
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,280
I feel better now, thank you.
It's that raw fish odour.

226
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,480
It makes...

227
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh, God.

228
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
Look at that! Those my teeth?

229
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,880
(Only to continue
in the highest spirit...)

230
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
Yeah.

231
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,520
And so I would like
to propose a toast.

232
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,240
-Oh, thank you, Yoko.
-I'll take that, sir.

233
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,920
To world peace.

234
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,520
To a clean environment.

235
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,320
To harmony with our planet
and world prosperity.

236
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,920
Thank you.

237
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,720
Looking for a place
to sit, lieutenant?

238
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,760
No, I need to speak to the president.
Can you arrange that?

239
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,320
-You'd be amazed what I can do.
-It's my fault they got Walters.

240
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,680
I want to go in.

241
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
You showed up just in time.
We leave in the morning.

242
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,280
You should know I'm taking personal charge of this 
mission. Hope you dont't mind working under a woman?

243
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,760
(And now, the president of
the United States, Thomas Benson.)

244
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,000
Prime Minister Tojo,
Senator Edwards...

245
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,960
...my fellow Americans
and our millions of illegal aliens.

246
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,560
It seems like only yesterday
I was strafing so many of your homes.

247
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,160
Here I am today, begging you
not to make such good cars.

248
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
Excuse me. Just a second.
I need a glass of water.

249
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,120
Damn tongue's gone dry.
It's not mine, you know.

250
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,960
I lost mine in Laos.
Little commie lopped it right off.

251
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,920
[It's] probably a doorstop somewhere _____.
Got this one from a basset hound.

252
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,120
Husband get the car.

253
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
President Benson.

254
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,520
No, you're not.

255
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,080
I've seen him on the television.
He's older and about my height.

256
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Sir, this is Topper Harley.

257
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,310
Topper. Yes, of course.
Son I never had.

258
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,360
Well, no damn wonder
I didn't recognise you then.

259
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,720
Word of advice:
Don't go around calling yourself the president.

260
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,120
I wouldn't do that, I don't think you should 
neither. It doesn't hold water.

261
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,120
For that matter, neither do I. Let's
get away from these power cables.

262
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,000
-Sir, I'd like to join the next mission.
-God bless you boy.

263
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
We will keep this one's on the QT.

264
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
We callling it: “Secret Mission to go in and
get Walters and Our Boys Back.”

265
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And son, when you come back, I'm gonna throw you 
wonderful guys, a party that like you'd never seen.

266
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,200 
And there should be plenty to eat.

267
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,720
I doubt that more than half
of you will return.

268
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,720
Thank you.

269
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,000
Got a light, lieutenant?

270
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,000
I quit smoking.

271
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,360
Besides, I don't think
it's allowed here.

272
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,320
What are they gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?

273
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,600
-Now I know what to get you for Christmas.
-Why don't you make a Thighmaster? I've broken my last three.

274
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,800
Really?

275
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,120
Let's go to my apartment
and discuss our mission.

276
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
I'm putty in your hands.

277
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
In my hands, nothing turns to putty.

278
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
(In an emotional address
at the state capitol...)

279
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,520
(...Nebraska Governor, Paul Burmaster...)

280
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,320
(...today made a public apology
for his state being so flat.)

281
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,120
Where are you?

282
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,720
l don't know.

283
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,720
What's wrong?

284
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
My arm's asleep.

285
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,320
No, something else.

286
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,120
My leg too.

287
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,720
No, please, you can tell me.

288
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,600
Well....

289
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,120
Topper.

290
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,120
I have to wee-wee.

291
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,520
Look, I told myself last night
was just going to be last night.

292
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,320
I guess I just never counted on
finding a guy so deep, so sensitive.

293
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,000
I've fallen for you, Topper.

294
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,120
I've fallen for you big time.

295
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,320
There's someone else, isn't there?

296
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,720
No idea what you mean.

297
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,440
Women sense these things, Topper.

298
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,320
I said there's no one.

299
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm fine.

300
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,120
I know about Ramada, Topper.
I read your dossier.

301
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
She must be quite a woman.

302
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,520
And what if she was?

303
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,080
Was?

304
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,560
(Last call for Train 590 for Glendale,
San Francisco and Honolulu.)

305
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,920
Board! Board!

306
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,120
I told you. Warned you twice.

307
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
Harley.

308
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,720
-Topper Harley.
-Right here.

309
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,800
I cannot go with you
or ever see you again.

310
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,720
Just believe that I love you.

311
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,600
You must be brave, my darling.

312
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,320
This card is printed
on recycled paper.

313
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,120
Sergeant pick that up.
Someone could trip over it.

314
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,760
Which one of you
is Michelle Huddleston?

315
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,120
She is.

316
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm glad you're here. We just known
the hostages are being moved.

317
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm Commander Armin Harbinger.
I'm running the show.

318
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm sorry, commander.
Presidential orders.

319
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,760
_____ hardly, I'm in charge now.

320
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
-Any questions?
-No, ma'am.

321
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Harley, I've been there.

322
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,160
I've seen the enemy. If you're
not ready, you won't make it.

323
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,000
I've fired a couple of guns.

324
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,720
I'll assemble the men,
with your permission.

325
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,480
Gentlemen, Ms. Huddleston, CIA,
and Lieutenant Topper Harley.

326
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,280
We're working for them.

327
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,120
Williams, com sync pac ram set
MOS 92-H tact op spec patty-wack.

328
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,640
-Patty-wack?
-Give a dog a bone, sir.

329
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Of course.

330
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,240
Rabinowitz, demolition. I'm looking for
to blowing something up for you, Sir.

331
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm looking forward your explosions.

332
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,560
Gentlemen, Commander Harbinger just advised me 
we have 11 hours to free the prisoners.

333
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,680
After that, we may lose them forever.

334
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,480
This is the prison camp area.

335
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,480
It is heavily fortified, but they never
expect an attack from the jungle.

336
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,600
Your contact, code name Bench Press,
will lead you to the camp.

337
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,960
I'll be there to meet you at the 
rendezvous point.

338
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,120
Good luck.

339
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,520
Topper!

340
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,880
Topper, I know we haven't had
much time together but...

341
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,120
...when you go into battle,
I'd like you take something of mine with you.

342
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,920
Your lucky mole.

343
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,680
Topper, what are you reading?

344
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,160
Great Expectations.

345
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,320
-Is it any good?
-It's not all I hoped for.

346
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,800
Know what I'm gonna do if we make it?

347
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm gonna go back to Eagle River
and marry my gal, Edith Mae.

348
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,760
Gonna get us a nice little place
with a white picket fence.

349
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
You know the kind.

350
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
Two-car garage.

351
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,720
Maybe a fishing boat.

352
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,720
And in 15 years,
when they're all paid for...

353
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,920
...I'll set my charges
and blow the shit out of them.

354
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Got a girl, Topper?

355
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,720
Penny to Sky King, no parents in sight. 
Party is on.

356
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,400
Green, green, green...

357
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,720
Hook up.

358
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,040
Geronimo!

359
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
Geronimo!

360
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,120
Me!

361
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,720
Thanks, brothers.

362
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,720
Jeez!

363
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,720
Stop it!

364
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,280
-Ramada.
-Topper.

365
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,800
-What are you doing here?
-This is Bench Press, our contact.

366
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,960
-I didn't know.
-Do you know each other?

367
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,360
Yes. Yes, we do.

368
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,120
It's been a long time.

369
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,120
-Let's see, the last time we met...
-Was The Flurvian Sea.

370
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,840
-You remember?
-I remember every detail.

371
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,600
The sky was blue. You wore gray.
I was in chiffon.

372
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,520
Topper, there's so much to say.

373
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,680
You're as beautiful as the day you dumped me.

374
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,320
You've changed.

375
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,920
That beauty mark.

376
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,320
It was a... It's a gift.

377
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,680
It's all very touching,
but this is no time to reminisce.

378
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,800
We have to be at the rendezvous point
in seven hours or we miss our pickup.

379
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,520
It's your show, hero.

380
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,560
Let's move out.

381
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
Follow me.

382
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,520
We're late. I know a shortcut.

383
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,320
-The meat's smoking.
-Shut up.

384
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,280
-No, no. Let's take it off the grill.
-Leave me alone.

385
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,960
-Frank, you're drunk again.
-Whose fault is that?

386
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,720
This is the best way
to the prison compound.

387
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,560
They're used to seeing fishing boats,
so they won't be suspicious.

388
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,920
There are clothes in the wheelhouse.

389
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,160
Somebody once wrote, “Hell is
the impossibility of reason. “

390
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,160
That's what this place
feels like. Hell.

391
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,120
I hate it already,
and it's only been a few hours.

392
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,540
I'm so tired. We get up at 5:00a.m.

393
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:09,640
At first I thought they'd
handed me the wrong dossier.

394
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,120
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

395
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,120
Third generation West Point.
Top of his class.

396
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,920
Korea, Airborne...

397
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,720
...'bout a thousand decorations,
et cetera, et cetera.

398
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
I loved you in Wall Street!

399
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,400
Satellite reconnaissance indicates an enemy control boat has changed
course and is heading for our people.

400
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,720
Send the alert.

401
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,920
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky. 
Report my signal.

402
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,600
Report my signal. Over.

403
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,560
Hello, George Mike Walters.
Strength three. Over.

404
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Recon reports Indians
on the warpath in your area. Over.

405
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,880
Ain't no Indians around here. Over.

406
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
Do not take literally.
Repeat. Do not take literally.

407
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,480
The vultures are circling
the carcass. Repeat.

408
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,080
The vultures are circling the carcass. Over.

409
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,040
I see a couple of gulls, but I don't...

410
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,040
The pit bull is out of the cage.
The crips are raiding the store.

411
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,360
Hey, you yanking my crank?

412
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,760
They came by and see a woman, they will
know we are masquerading.

413
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,240
Only men are allowed
to do the fishing.

414
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,720
Topper.

415
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Why did you have to come here now?

416
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,400
Of all the missions
in all the jungles, in all the world...

417
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,600
-...you had come walking into this one.
-Oh, Topper. I tried to stay away.

418
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,360
I thought I was never going to see you 
again, that you were out of my life.

419
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,480
But it's a sequel.
I had to come.

420
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,800
Do you have any idea what
the critics will say?

421
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,000
-”Same warmed-over characters”
-Topper, stop it.

422
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,960
You're only using this whole
casting thing as an excuse...

423
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,520
...to hide what's really hurting you.

424
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,120
Hurt? Maybe. Once.

425
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,320
But I knew this day would come.

426
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,080
I knew one day you'd
come crawling back...

427
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,680
...begging for forgiveness.
Groveling, sniveling...

428
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,360
...pleading for another chance.

429
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,080
Sorry, sweetheart, but this all-day
sucker is down to the soggy ____ stick.

430
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,800
No, Topper, you don't understand.

431
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,160
I'm married. I was married
before you and I ever met.

432
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,080
I'm still married today.

433
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,880
-You're joking.
-I'm not.

434
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,800
-You've got to be.
-Look, if I was joking I would say:

435
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,800
”A horse walks into a bar. The
bartender says, 'Why the long face?' “

436
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,520
You are married.

437
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,920
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought he was dead.

438
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,240
He worked for the goverment,
training pilots for the CIA in Germany.

439
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,480
Highest security.

440
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,080
They told me he was killed
over Villenshtoben.

441
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,040
Then the day before we and I 
were to go away...

442
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,120
...I recieve the word he was alive,
in a hospital in Berlin.

443
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,720
I had to go to him.

444
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,040
They ordered me not to tell anyone.

445
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,120
-I know how you must feel.
-You do, huh?

446
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,120
You know how it feels
to have your heart shot out of season...

447
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,000
...and strapped to the hood of a car?

448
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,400
To be passed like the worlds
largest kidney stone?

449
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,680
Ramada...

450
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,040
...I don't think so.

451
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,720 
Patrol boat!

452
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,160
Remember, we're not American.
These boys aren't stupid.

453
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,040
Where's Harbinger?

454
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,520
Shut off your engine.

455
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,000
Shut off your engine.
We are coming aboard.

456
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,160
Kareem of Onion! Al Jarreau!

457
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,560
Go on! Get out of here!

458
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,620
Take that to the bank and cash it!

459
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,920
Swim for shore!

460
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,120
Save yourselves!

461
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,920
Swim for it! I'll catch up.

462
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,520
Go!

463
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,000
Omar Sharif!

464
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,480
Topper?

465
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,640
(And another news: President Benson is 
returning to Washington today...)

466
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,960
...to speak to the nation
in what experts are calling...

467
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,120
...the pivotal address
of his political career.

468
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,320
How is the speech coming, sir?

469
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,720
Oh, I'm practicing my A's.

470
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,880
-This is looking like an A to you?
-Yes, sir.

471
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,400
All right.

472
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,720
What's that, Bill?

473
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,040
We just received word from Michelle Huddleston.
Topper Harley is missing.

474
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,160
-His boat has been demolished.
-Oh, damn it!

475
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,640
Every time I give an order,
things gets screwed up!

476
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,000
Plan a reception, they bring
wrong hors d'oeuvres.

477
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,000
Appoint an ambassador, and they say:
No he leaves the country; and now this.

478
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,920
President, we need a plan.

479
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,920
This may be our last chance
to get the hostages out.

480
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,200
All right.

481
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,000
Here's where we are
and here is where they.

482
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,000
-Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
-Oh, no time for prayer, Bob.

483
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,760
-Here's the target area.
-That's Minnesota, sir.

484
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,320
Damn it, man,
that's the genius of my plan.

485
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,200
We don't have to travel around the world to fight.
We can do it right here on home. Give them some good fish.

486
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,960
-Sir, the enemy is over there.
-Then we'll fly them over here.

487
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,760
They can bring their relatives.
We'll teach them ice skate...

488
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,080
-Do I have to think of everything?
-But Mr. President, the hostages!

489
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,720
It is imperative that you act now!

490
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
Topper?

491
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,600
Topper! You made it!

492
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,800
That's right, Cindy,
it's 23 minutes past the hour.

493
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,720
And now here's the Buckinghams
with “Kind of a Drag.”

494
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,520
You're bleeding.

495
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
I'll be right.

496
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,520
Something else
bothers me a lot more.

497
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,320
Harbinger, where were you
when the patrol boat arrived?

498
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,800
Below, sweeping the boat for bombs.
What are you accusing me of?

499
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,920
Nothing, yet.
But I want you to know I smell a rat.

500
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,920
Don't push me lieutenant.
Before you bagged your first babe...

501
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,080
...I was shitting throats for this 
country making a damn good living at.

502
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,160
Hey, look. I'm not saying I don't trust you,
and I'm not saying I do. But I don't.

503
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,560
Save it for the enemy.
We got a job to do.

504
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,720
Oh, look. I'm cut too.

505
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,920
Oh.

506
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,960
They got me too. It's a real gusher.

507
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,320 
Get going.

508
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,920
There's a guard at the gate.

509
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,720
He's mine.

510
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,520
Wait here.

511
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,320
Topper.

512
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,200
-Topper.
-Uh, Jesus!

513
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,000
Before we go in, there are something
you should know.

514
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,480
-What now?
-Have you heard of Dexter Hayman?

515
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,120
The freedom fighter?

516
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,320
Yeah, he won the Nobel Prize
for inventing the artificial appendix.

517
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,120
Exactly.
Dexter is one of the captives.

518
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,760
-He's my husband.
-You've got to be joking.

519
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,920
If I was joking, I would say:

520
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,000
”A rabbi, a priest and a minister
walk into a bar...”

521
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,680
Okay, okay, he is your husband.

522
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,600
Topper, I was so young,
just a schoolgirl.

523
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,560
He was an older man,
so wise in the ways of the world.

524
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,120
He used to come around
the schoolyard, day after day.

525
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,760
I so admired his persistence.

526
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Even the restraining order of my parents
slapped on him wouldn't hold him back.

527
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,280
He opened my eyes to the arts:
music, clog-dancing, WrestleMania.

528
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,360
His work has meant so much to so many.

529
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,240
And I owe him everything, Topper.

530
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,440
Everything.

531
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,320
I'm happy for you, kid.

532
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,120
But if you think you can hurt
me again, you're wrong.

533
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,920
I left my heart in my other pants.

534
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,920
[Go].

535
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,920
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

536
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,400
The Iraqi coast.

537
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,040
Oh, those bluffs look treacherous.

538
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,920
Hadn't counted on that.

539
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,520
But if God is on our side, we will
rendezvous on Lincoln's wart by noon.

540
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,520
That's it, men.

541
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,720
We're going in!

542
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,160
My rescue mission was underway.

543
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,080
But two things kept running
through my mind:

544
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,200
Would we get to the men in time?

545
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,600
And why did I bring helium
instead of air?

546
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,320
I'll go to the rear.

547
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,520
Take the front door.

548
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,920
[The keys].

549
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,320
-[What]?
-[Enough]!

550
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,800
-Where are the prisoners?
-Over there.

551
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,520
-Let's go!
-I'll take the back gate.

552
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,560
Oh that's hell of a gun.

553
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,520
-Where's Dexter Hayman?
-Villa compound 405.

554
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,680
Okay. I'm here.

555
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,520
”Terrorist Mountain.”

556
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,120
”It's a Small War.”
”Pirates of the Persian Gulf.”

557
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,360
”Hostage Mover.”
Ah! “Dexter's Dungeon.”

558
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,760
Harbinger, what are you doing here?

559
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,600
I was right, wasn't I?
You sabotaged all the other missions.

560
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,160
-I find that totally unacceptable.
-You got me wrong.

561
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,800
All these years...

562
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,160
...fighting, and shooting and killing.

563
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,080
I just.... I can't go on.

564
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,720
Hey, hey, hey, rainy face!
Hey, proud warrior.

565
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,560
Let the sun come out,
you big bad G.I. Joe.

566
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,840
You know, kitten, we all have
permission to make mistakes.

567
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,120
It's called “learning.”

568
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,320
You give your Uncle Topper...

569
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,520
...a nice big blow.

570
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,560
I'm done.

571
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,920
That a boy.

572
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,400
Thank you Topper. I can kill again.

573
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,800
-You've given me a reason to live.
-Good.

574
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,800
Head for the gate. Plenty of bad guys
to shoot on the way.

575
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,200
Keeps going, and going, and going,
and going...

576
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,560
Nothing outlasts the...

577
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,720
Yes!

578
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,680
There's a copter pad half a mile in the compound.

579
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,160
-That's our ticket out. Let's go!
-We can't leave. Not without Dexter.

580
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,320
Topper! Watch out!

581
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,560
For a moment there,
I thought you were....

582
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,840
Gabriella Sabatini?

583
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,200
I get that all the time.
It must be the nose.

584
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,440
The irony is I haven't picked up
a racket in years.

585
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,160
You saved my life.

586
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,920
Topper, no matter what happens,
I want you to know that...

587
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,840
...I never stopped loving you.

588
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,240
Let's move out!

589
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,200
Anyone of you knows how to get to the copter pad.

590
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,080
If I'm not there in 15,
you know what to do.

591
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,120
-Well, we get the hell out of here.
-No! Wait another 15 minutes.

592
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,920
We could hear the gunfire
from the compound.

593
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,640
From out of nowhere,
a patrol boat appeared over here.

594
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,520
How would we get past the soldiers
on that boat?

595
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,320
Then, suddenly, it happened.

596
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,120
Take cover!

597
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,520
Guys.

598
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,520
Jeez!

599
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,680
That's it, good night.

600
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,720
War. It's fantastic!

601
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,760
Drop the gun!

602
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,600
Drop it!

603
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:37,040
You will die, Yankee bastard man.
How you say? Like a dog.

604
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,920
Now march!

605
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,880
March!

606
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,600
Now I kill you where you stand,
you imperialist Yankee little dork of a pig.

607
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,640
Slippery rascal!

608
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,920
Butcher of Baghdad. Hello?

609
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,480
Well, hello.

610
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,680
Who is it? Who is it?

611
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,800
-It's your wife, Hillary Rodham Hussein.
-Jesus Mary Joseph!. I'm so stupid!

612
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,840
I was supposed to pick her up at the laundry, man.

613
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,720
Tell her I'm at the gym.
No, no, no, I'm out of town.

614
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,600
On business. Bombing,
gassing, eletric execution.

615
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,360
-Tell her something. Make it up.
-I'm sorry. Just missed him.

616
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,240
I owe you one.

617
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,960
Ali MacGraw! My eyes.

618
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,320
You little ...!
I'm going to split you like a melon!

619
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,360
Now I will kill you
until you die from it.

620
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,640
In a pig's ear.

621
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,360
-Mr. President!
-Suffering succotash!

622
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,280
Looks like the upper hand is on
the other foot, Saddam.

623
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,880
Uh-oh!

624
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,400
Yes!

625
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,320
My skin's made of asbestos.

626
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,360
Tanning parlor accident at Dien Bien Phu.

627
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,160
Go on about your business, son.
I got a bone to settle with this guy.

628
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,040
Yes, sir. I'll get Dexter.

629
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,160
Let's make this a fair fight.

630
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,120
I've been waiting for you, O Big One.

631
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,960
We meet at last.
The circle is complete.

632
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,400
-Now I am the master!
-Only the master of evil, Saddam.

633
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,720
Your powers are...

634
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,000
Your powers are weak, old man.
You should not have come.

635
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,520
Well, all I have.
We'll settle this the old Navy way.

636
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,120
First guy to die, loses!

637
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,240
Water. Water! Water, please.

638
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,600
-It's locked. From the inside.
-No!

639
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,840
-Damn it!
-We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

640
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,600
-Get a hold of yourself, man!
-Blow it!

641
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,080
-It's not our property.
-Do it. Do it!

642
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,840
Oh, Mr. Geppetto!

643
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,160
Go ahead. Shoot.
You'll get nothing from me.

644
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,760
You are filth.
I spit in the face of filth.

645
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,160
-Dexter, come to get you out of here.
-You're American.

646
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,160
Yes, from America. Let's go.

647
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,120
My friend, I yearn for freedom
as much as anyone...

648
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,400
...but I run from no man.

649
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,680
You've got to come with me.

650
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,720
I can't walk. They...

651
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,800
They've tied my shoelaces together.

652
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,160
A knot.

653
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,960
Bastards.

654
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,920
I'm aborting the mission. Envelope
is closed. We're lifting off.

655
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,320
Here you go. It's $4.50.

656
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,160
I didn't think you'd make it.

657
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,200
Everybody onboard. We're getting out of here.

658
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,920
What about the others?
We just can't leave them.

659
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,320
Wait! I can't go any further.
I need to drink.

660
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,920
Okay. Right a bit.
Whoawhoawhoa, stop, stop there.

661
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,360
Down a bit, down a bit. There.
It's not very cold. Is this filtered?

662
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,680
Their artillery will be down
on us soon in seconds. We have to lift off.

663
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,840
No! If we leave now, we'll lose Topper and Dexter.

664
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,520
But that has been the idea all along,
hasn't it, Michelle?

665
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,640
You're looking beautiful as ever,
Ramada. How did you know?

666
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,000
I didn't. It all came together
when I saw you here.

667
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,600
I ?think about? your inscription
in my yearbook.

668
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,560
You wrote: “Remember all the fun
we had in speech class...

669
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,120
...and I'll fuck up your life
if it's the last thing I do.”

670
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,320
Then I realized where I had
last seen this.

671
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,120
What could I have done to make
you so vindictive?

672
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,240
Goodness sake. You gals know each other.

673
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,960
Oh, Ramada, how could you
have been so blind?

674
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,760
You were always too wrapped up in being
Miss Perfect College to notice me.

675
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,800
Why should you concern yourself with the feelings
of one insignificant roommate?

676
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,840
One fabulous day,
one incredible experience.

677
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,160
I had no idea it meant so much to you.

678
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,600
I remember that day
as if it were yesterday.

679
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,800
The exhilaration of experimenting...

680
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,800
...sharing something so new,
so dangerous...

681
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,680
-...so intimate.
-Go on.

682
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,360
And I'll never forget the look
on your face.

683
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,760
The way the sweat glistened
on your hard body.

684
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,880
Then you tied my ankles.

685
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,160
Tighter. Tighter.

686
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,480
But it just wasn't right.
It wasn't natural.

687
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,760
Bungee-jumping is just too
dangerous a sport.

688
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,600
Bungee-jumping? That's it?

689
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,720
Michelle, how could you do this? 
How could you hurt so many innocent people?

690
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,680
Oh, Ramada! It was always
so easy for you.

691
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,080
How could you ever understand?

692
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,200
I had Dexter imprisoned
because I wanted you to suffer...

693
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,880
-...as much as you made me suffer.
-You fool!

694
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,440
And then, when I discovered I couldn't win
Topper heart because...

695
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:34,920
...he still in love with you,
I tried to have you killed.

696
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,920
He... He still loves me.

697
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,600
You turned your back on America...

698
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,680
...because of your own ____ jealousy.
You're gonna pay for this.

699
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,600
Good doggy!

700
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,360
Aluminium siding. Ten-year guarantee.
Never have to be painted.

701
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,920
Do you have any idea where you're going?

702
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,000
Ha! You missed!

703
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,720
It'll take more than that
to stop me, you devils!

704
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,280
Don't jiggle me.

705
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,280
Advil! Midoh! Get over here!
To the helicopter.

706
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,120
They dicked with the wrong dictator.

707
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,120
This means war!

708
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,120
You better let me handle this, son.

709
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,200
Ugh! You're so sweaty.

710
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,080
-I knew you'd make it.
-[It's about time.]

711
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,160
-Michelle.
-She's our saboteur.

712
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,760
Topper, can you get me off ?the hook?
for old times' sake?

713
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:56,200
Sorry, precious. No can do. You sold
out the greatest country in the world.

714
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,520
And to think I wore your mole.
Get her out of here.

715
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,640
Dexter? (Mister Bean?? :D)

716
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,920
Ramada.

717
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,960
Oh, dear Dexter. Look what they've
done to your shoelaces.

718
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,600
Oh, my darling. You've no idea what
I've just been through.

719
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,280
But now we're together again.
We have so much to look forward to.

720
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,440
I want to do it all.
Donahue. Heraldo.

721
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,160
Sally Jessy. Oh, and who's
that black chick...?

722
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,520
Oprah.
-Yes! Yes. Her too.

723
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,320
Let's go! It's getting hot here.

724
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,280
Go ahead. I'm going back for the president.

725
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,920
Topper!

726
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,720
?I thought it over?. I'm staying here with you.

727
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,880
No you're not. Get on that helicopter with
Dexter, where you belong.

728
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,200
Why? I thought you loved me.

729
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,080
Ramada, I do love you.
I've tried to forget you...

730
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,280
...but no matter what I do, your face
is always on the tip of my tongue.

731
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,600
Then let me stay with you.

732
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,000
Ramada, I want to be with you.
I wanna hold you.

733
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,160
I wanna meet your parents and pet your dog.

734
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,560
My parents are dead, Topper. My dog ate them.

735
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,200
I'm sorry. We both know you
belong with Dexter.

736
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,200
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

737
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:25,560
I'm not good in being noble, but do you have
any idea what'd happen if you stay here with me?

738
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,960
Of course I do.

739
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,360
Sex. Wild, free, passionate,
unbridled sex.

740
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,960
I'd fondle you in ways
you can't imagine.

741
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,800
I would pleasure you at any time,
in any place, in any way...

742
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,160
...for as long as you could
possibly desire.

743
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,840
You better get going.
You'll miss your takeoff.

744
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,360
Goodbye, Topper. God bless you.

745
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,080
Wait a second, let me get a shot of you two.

746
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,560
It'll be great vision for the talk shows.
Let's just frame this up.

747
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,440
Closer together. Come on.
Don't be shy.

748
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,560
Put your arm around her.

749
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,760
I've almost got it.
This is a great shot.

750
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,920
My God, you're gonna love this!

751
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,640
You know, under other circumstances,
you'd make a great couple.

752
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,240
Oh, well. Say chee...

753
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,60
You're moving too much.
Quit spinning!

754
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,240
This'll make me rich and f...

755
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,400
-He really was a wiener!
-Don't get me started.

756
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,320
Hold it there! Hold it!

757
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,960
This buggy going to America?

758
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,720
Mr. President, I was afraid we may've lost you!

759
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,280
Lost? Huh? Not a chance.

760
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,440
I shove over you guys! I got ______ in the window seat.

761
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,480
-They're in my sights.
-Just a second! This is personal.

762
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,720
We're too heavy.
We need to lose some weight.

763
01:20:37,720 --> 01:22:00,720
