REPORTER: (ON RADIO) People
have to realize, we cannot
make everybody totally safe,

00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,940
even if we allocated
the entire federal
budget towards security.

3
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,610

is not an easier job...

I know. I'm sorry.

8
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,168
No, no, you can trust me.
I'm fine.

Excuse me, sir.
You got a light?

your attention, please?

Where you headed?

I'm headed to Amsterdam.

your attention, please?

22

OS is trying to keep up
with the hardware from 15
different manufacturers.

28
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,509
Right!

29
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,929
That's what I've
been saying. No
one listens to me!

30
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:46,475
Dude, you're
preaching to the choir!
It makes absolutely no sense.

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,771
Really?
I guess I'm
in your way.

New Yorkers,
man, I swear to God.
Give me two minutes.

Right this way, sir. Please.

Listen to me. Listen to me.
I cannot stay in
London for three days.

what you have to do."
Well, guess what? So do I.

Here.

41
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,031
Long flights are the worst.

42

No, thanks.

WOMAN: There's a mix-up
with my reservation.

46
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,855
I was supposed to
have a window seat
and they put me in an aisle.

47
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,774
Maybe you could move
some people around,

48
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,067
'cause I was guaranteed
the window seat.

49
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,472
I'm sorry about that,
Ms. Summers.

go on the runway?

00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,560
Come on, sweetheart.
Is this everything?

58
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,729
Yeah. My mom checked
my big bag for me.

59
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,564
Have you flown by
yourself before?

60
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,441
No. This is my first time.

61
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,235

have a lovely time.

62
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,448

Yes, just through there
and down to the left.

63
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,159
Nancy, this is Becca.
It's her first
time on an airplane.

64
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,578
Wonderful.
Who's waiting
for you in London?

65
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,787
My dad.

66
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,290
Well, we've a seat
by the window all
picked out for you.

67
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,136
Look, I know it may
seem scary, but
flying's really quite fun.

68
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,557
I believe this little
guy made a run for it.

69
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,976
What's his name?

70
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,062
Henry.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,773
Yeah, he looks like
a Henry. That's
a good name.

72
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,399
Well...
Becca.

73
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,736
Becca, I think
Henry's a little scared.

74
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,697
Maybe you can show
him how it's done.

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,910
Good girl.

76
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm sorry, am I in your way?

77
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,263
Again?

78
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,891
We are right up here.

ATTENDANT: (ON PA)
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,438
As a reminder,
all carry-on luggage
must fit in the overhead bin

81
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,316
or be safely stowed
under the seat
in front of you.

82
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,827
If you're having
trouble fitting your luggage,

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,529
we'll be happy to
check it for you.

84
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,533
Thank you for
choosing British Aqualantic.
Enjoy the flight.

85
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,452
JEN: Do you know,
is there somebody
sitting there?

86
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,287
Do you know who has that seat?
No, sorry.

87
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,081
WOMAN: Is somebody
sitting here?

88
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,127
Hey, I'm on the plane.
And guess what?
They effed up my reservation.

89
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,004
We land at 7:35.
Did they book a car?

90
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,089
Hang on. Hang on.

91
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,343
Excuse me.
Sir? I'm here in 3B.

92
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,803
I was wondering if
maybe you'd switch seats

93
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,248
with me so I
could have the window?

94
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,806
Do you care?

95
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,392
Do you speak English?

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,769
Okay. Thank you.

97
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,022
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir?

98
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,733
Hi. I'm right here,
I'm in 3B

99
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,486
and I was just wondering
if maybe you would
prefer the aisle,

100
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,655
or if you don't care,
if you would

101
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,157
switch with me
for the window seat?

102
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,411
A lot of people
just sleep anyway,
so I was wondering if...

103
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,042
Sure. Why not?

104
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,087
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

105
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,631
Sorry,
let me get out
of your way.

106
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,008
Let me help you.

Hello? Are you there?

112
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
Your phone.

113
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,195
What?
Hello?

114
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,362
Your phone.
Oh, shit.

Hello?
Hi. Hi, hi.

116
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,117
I'll call you
when we land, okay?
All right, bye.

117
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,535
Rough day, huh?

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,037
Yeah, you have no idea.

119
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,622
Hi, excuse me.

120
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,540
Could I get a gin and tonic,
when you get a chance?

121
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,168
Of course.
Make that two, please.

122
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,551
God.

123
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,055
Nancy, right? Gwen.
Yeah.

124
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,181
Thank God for you.

125
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,766
Girl doesn't show
up and leaves me

126
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,392
to handle two cabins.
You're a lifesaver.

127
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,917
If I pass out,
just promise to catch me
before I hit the floor.

128
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,521
Not if I do first.

129
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,399
Can I get you
gentlemen anything
before we taxi?

130
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,443
No, thanks, Nance, I'm fine.

131
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,826
What?

132
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,245
Nothing.

133
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,290
Ground, this is AQ-10,
we're ready to
disconnect ground power.

134
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,376
You naughty boy.

135
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,670
(CHUCKLES) Naughty.

136
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,014
Thank you.

137
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
Didn't you order gin and tonic?

138
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
Did I?

139
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,689
'Cause she brought you a water.

140
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,942
It's not my lucky day.

141
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,342
CAPTAIN: (ON PA) Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,638
welcome aboard British
Aqualantic Flight 10,
non-stop service to London.

143
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm your captain,
David McMillan,

144
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,517
flying with First
Officer Kyle Rice.

145
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,162
And we expect
a smooth ride this evening

146
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,147
with a flight time of
just over six hours.
Seatbelts, thank you.

147
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,607
We should have you in
the air momentarily.

148
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,495
This is a beautiful
picture they took of her.

149
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,822
ATTENDANT: Sir, could you
move your seat-back forward?
Thank you.

150
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,075
Flight attendants,
please be seated for takeoff.

151
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,080
What's that for?
Is that for luck?

152
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,291
Something like that.
My daughter gave it to me.

153
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,793
Better than a gin
and tonic, I bet.

154
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,961
It is.

155
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,641
I'm Jen.

156
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,518
Bill.

157
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,856
You fly much?
All the time, actually.

158
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,524
Yeah, I can tell.

159
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,113
It's just the takeoff.
Once we're in the air, I'll...

160
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,411
You'll have a seizure?

161
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,704
I'll be fine. I promise.

162
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,792
You actually fly all the time?

163
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,503
Some things you
never get used to.

164
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,513
How old's your daughter?

165
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,349
Now, she's, uh, 17.

166
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,767
What's her name?

167
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,102
Olivia.

168
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,436
That's nice.
Yeah.

169
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,772
I like that name,
it's a nice name.

170
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,566
So, why'd she
give you the ribbon?

171
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,739
Some kids have blankets,
stuffed animals.
Olivia had ribbons.

172
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,575
This was hers
when she was little.

173
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:35,254
She'd tie it to
a finger or toe
before going to bed.

174
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,756
And then in the morning,
she'd make me guess.

175
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,882
Where she put it?
Yeah.

176
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,676
That's cute.
That's really cute.

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,095
Yeah, and then she grew up.

178
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,597
I suppose I need it
more than she did.

179
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,768
Anyway.

180
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,981
So, what do you do for a living?

181
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,693
Well...

182
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,487
I fly a lot.

183
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,697
Oh, yeah?

184
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,075
Yeah, but I think that

185
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,411
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

186
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
Get some sleep, sure.
Yeah, it's gonna
be a long flight.

187
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sleep well.

188
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,932

Excuse me.

What kind of tea do you have?

202
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,815
I'll have chamomile. Thanks.

This your idea of a joke?
What're you talking about?

If you have a problem
with me, say it to my face.

Don't play games
on a flight in

You need to calm down, partner.

209
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,546
I was a cop for 25 years.
I knew men like you.

210
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,922
Men like me?

211
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,406
Men like me follow
goddamn protocol.

212

We're not even supposed
to be talking right now.

213
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,593
It's a secure network, Jack!

214
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,943
Bill, what the hell
are you talking about?

215
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,767
Don't deny you sent these.

216
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,898
Bill, I didn't send these.

217
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,192
See for yourself.

218
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,373

You and me.

222
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,264
I say no way.
It's bullshit.

223
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,600
Any threat to an aircraft
requires immediate landing.

224
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,270
Right, yeah, all right.
If there is a threat.

225
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,605
Come on, Bill.
You wanna be the agent

knows your personal problems?

Sends you a couple

Bill, I gotta ask you,
how many have you had today?

A threat's a threat!

231
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,489
Okay.

232
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,700
You really need to
think this through,
partner, all right?

233
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,118
Listen, how do you
kill somebody aboard

234

a crowded plane
and get away with it?

235
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,081
Pretty hard to pull that off,
don't you think?

236
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:55,003
Bill,
if there's not a situation,
you don't create one.

237
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,215
I'm going to see the captain.

238
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,508
You keep your eye
on the main cabin.

239
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,720
Bill? Don't panic
the cockpit. Bill?

240
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,103
I tell you, it's five hours in

241
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,065
and then, out of nowhere,
he suddenly sits
up and he says...

242
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,410
How do we
validate the threat?
We can't.

243
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,789
Captain?
TSA says a full cross check
on the passenger manifest

244
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,041
could take 25 to 30 minutes.

245
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,589
We can divert the flight,
if this is for real.

246
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,341
The nearest airport?

247
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,343
Well, it's 95
minutes back to Halifax,

248
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,513
two hours to Iceland,
three to London.

249
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,974
We're midway over the Atlantic.

250
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,149
You okay?

251
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,820
It's this juice fast I'm on.
Gives me the shakes.

252
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,658
It's your call, Bill.

253
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,744
Do we have a situation?

254
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,834
Can we review the footage?

255
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,336
It's recorded directly
to the black box.

256
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,922
But I can watch
all the camera feeds
live from the galley?

257
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,007
Yeah.

258
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,842
Get back on the line with TSA.

259
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,885
See if they can back trace
this account number.

260
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,097
In the meantime,
I'll need
the passenger manifest.

261
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,721
I'll see if I can find him.

262
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,437
But in 10 minutes,
I'd like you to switch off
the network system.

263
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,481
We don't want
him checking to see
if a transfer's been made.

264
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,109
Nancy, come with me.

265
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,665
Two cameras in business,
six in coach.

266
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,916
We're gonna need more eyes.

267
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,209
I'll get another attendant.

268
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,878
How well do you know the crew?

269
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,629
Not very well.

270
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,096
Excuse me.
Yeah?

271
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,182
Will you come with me, please?

272
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,311
Now?

273
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,647
You want me to come right now?

274
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,739
This is a bad idea.

275
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,365
She was sitting beside
me when this started.

276
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,118
The only two people
I trust on this
airplane are you and her.

277
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,537
Trust me with what?
What's going on?

278
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,500
I text, you circle any
passenger with a phone

279
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,710
or acting like
they have a phone.

280
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,712
I'm not sure I understand
what it is you
want me to do...

281
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,464
Please, just do as I ask.

gentlemen, looks like

283

Please return to your seats
and keep your
seatbelts fastened

285
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,595

move about the cabin.

This is Philip Marenick.

304
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,807
I'm with TSA.
I understand from the captain
you have a situation.

305
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,171
I need to speak
to my supervisor.

306
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,269
Listen, I'm calling
from the DHS here in D.C.

307
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,437
From here on out,
I am your supervisor.

308
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,522
Now, Agent Marks, I need you...

309
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,441
I'm going to run
seat numbers by you.
I need red flags and priors.

310
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,443
That's a very
serious request you put in.
20G.

311
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,695

I need you to take me

312
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,946
through the events
from the beginning.

313
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,906
And we're looking into
tracing the account
number you gave us.

314

20G again.

315
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,276
And as you know,
protocol dictates
in these situations...

316
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,829
we corroborate everything
with the second
officer on board.

318
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:04,998
It's not him.

319
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,500
It's not who?
Look, I'd rather not
jump to any conclusions.

320
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,461

I don't think you're in
a position to sort out

321

not at this point.

322

I need some sort of
acknowledgment from you.

327
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,390
Marks, you need to answer me.

328
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,773
Hang on.

329
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,160

330
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,786
Go back to your seat.

Hand it over!
What're you...

334
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,507

I need this money.

335
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,592
I can cut you in...

336
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,010
Give me
the goddamn phone, Jack.
Just listen to me.

337
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,553
Give me the phone...

Jack! You son-of-a-bitch.

339
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,523
Give it up, Marks.
Stop it!

340
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,858
Give it up.
Stop it.

341
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,614
Damn it, Jack!

342
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,451
Stop it. Stop it!

343
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,495
Stop fighting!

344
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,420
Jack!

345
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,855
Don't do this, Jack.

then why do you
have his phone?

be concerned about.

in two seconds flat,
but up here,

00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,022

500 miles an hour,
I can't track his phone.

There's nothing I can do.

Aren't you an air marshal?

please return
to your seat.

00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
Please return to your seat.

415
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,909

must be broken.

00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,033
What's wrong?

426
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,005

00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,848
Please, I can explain this.

431
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,599
Okay?

432
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,397
This is a setup.

433
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,066
The captain just
told me that the account

434
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,527
they want the money
wired to is in my name.

435
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,363
Do you think I would
extort $150 million

436
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,283
using an account in my own name?

437
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,119
He was transporting
cocaine, Nancy.

438
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,455
Whoever we're
looking for knew that.

439
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,292
He threatened Hammond,
made him paranoid.

440
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,628
I found out,
and Hammond
tried to kill me.

441
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,841
The person who's doing
this, he wants it
to look like this.

442
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,469
Like two federal agents
are the ones
doing this, not him.

443
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,141
Jack pulled a gun on me.
I had no choice.

444
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,312
Nancy?

445
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,648
I had no choice.

446
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,319
You know me.

447
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,823
You know
I could never do
something like this.

448
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,618
Look at me.

449
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,126
I need you to believe me.

450
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,672
I believe you.

451
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,179
In 13 minutes,
someone else will die,
unless I find him first.

452
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,183
I need you to help me.

gentlemen, may I have your
attention, please?

454
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,442
My name is Bill Marks.

455
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,278
I'm the federal air marshal
assigned to this flight.

456
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,572
I apologize for the disturbance.

457
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,908
The TSA has recently
instituted a policy

458
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,452
of random searches
aboard international flights.

459
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,456
Unfortunately,
this is one of three lucky
flights this month.

460
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,291
I'm gonna be coming
through the cabin.

461
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,168
If I call your
name and seat number,

462
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,128
please stand up and
move into the aisle.

of an illegal substance,
item or weapon,

464
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,705
it's best to just
step forward now.

465
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,430

to place both hands on

469
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,566
Contact TSA,
tell them we have
a possible hijacking.

470
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,904
Nancy, what's going on?
It's just a random search.

471
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,950
Thank you.

about the bomb in my bag?

Let's not use that
word on a plane, please.

to the main cabin,
you watch business class.

get my attention.

479

Stand up, please.

482
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,936
Is that how older men
pick up younger women?

483
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,355
Fondle first, talk later?

484
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,773
Phone.

485
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,609
Why don't you enter your number?

486
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,904
You're a little young for me.

It's nothing to worry about.
Happens all the time.

493
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,971
13B, Fahim Nasir.
Bullshit.

494
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,973
Stand.
Thank you, sir.

495
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,231
Feeling okay?

496
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,233
Flying is not my cup of tea.

497
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,485
Tell me about it.

498
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,361
You're a doctor.
How do you know?

499
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,489
Your bag.
Can you fetch
it up, please?

500
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,657
Sure. It's right
down here.

501
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,207
What kind of doctor?

502
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,583
Molecular neuroscience.

503
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
Sounds interesting.

504
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,338
Hey, look, man,
some of us need
to get some sleep.

505
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,423
Sir, sit down. Be quiet.

506
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,843
14C, Charles
Wheeler? Stand.

507
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,973
There was nothing in his bag?

508
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,811
What's the purpose of your trip?

509
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,355
I have a client in Brighton.
I'm a bankruptcy attorney.

510
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,273
Yeah? You any good?

511
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,693
Why?
Oh, you need one?
Sit down.

512
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,198
Sir, you need to keep
your hands on the seat
in front of you. Thank you.

Just relax.

00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,214
Okay, 22C.
Austin Reilly. Stand.

517
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,137
Hey, look.
Can we move this along?
Seriously, man.

518
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,053
I'm not gonna tell you again.

519
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,723
Mr. Reilly,
what do you
do for a living?

00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,202
The captain's dead.

695
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,412
Excuse me?

696
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,623
The cockpit was secured,
locked from the inside.

697
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,084
Let me guess,
were you inside, Bill?

698
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,545
The co-pilot said
the man just
collapsed beside him.

699
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,382
It could be
induced anaphylaxis,
I think it's called.

700
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,426
Induced...
What are you talking about?

701
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,636
Poisoning, I don't know how.

702
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,099
It was just he
and the co-pilot,
and the co-pilot, I trust.

703
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,184
For now.

704
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,478
"For now"? I don't
know about this, Bill.

705
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,563
Marenick, you need
to transfer the money.

706
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,689
Where is Agent Hammond?

707
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,774
I need to corroborate
everything you're telling us.

708
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,359
Hammond's dead.

709
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,569
What?

710
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,446
He had cocaine
in his carry-on.
Jesus Christ!

711
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,851
I confronted him,
he pulled a gun.

712
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,075
Are you serious?
Marenick. Transfer
the money.

713
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,327
Buy me time.
I'll find him.

714
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,578
Transfer the money.

715
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,122
$150 million into your account?

716
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,408
Is that something
you're seriously
asking me to do, Bill?

717
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,628
The moment we land,
arrest me, freeze the
funds. Just transfer it.

718
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,087
I can't do that, Bill.

719
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,652
The airline
believes paying the demand

720
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,553
will set a dangerous
and irreversible precedent.

721
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,718
Christ, there are 150
people on this plane.

722
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,720
Which makes me wonder
why you haven't
cut the network.

723
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,097
You have 150 people panicking,

724
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,601
contacting their families,
while we're trying to
handle the situation.

725
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,186
You attribute all
this to a passenger,

726
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,105
but you can give me no proof
he actually exists.

727
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,107
I won't cut the network.
I need to communicate
with this guy.

728
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,485
Then, Agent Marks,
I can't continue
talking to you.

729
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,569
What does that mean?

730
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,739
It means we will
not negotiate
with a terrorist.

731
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,245
Nancy.

732
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,255
Who else in the crew
has access to the cockpit?

733
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,501
Just me.

734
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,341
Would you like
to see my phone,
Agent Marks?

735
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,243
Is your
interview in
the morning?

736
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,786
Yeah.
If we ever
make it there.

737
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,371
Yeah, if we ever land, right?

738
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,789
Exactly. But
it shouldn't...

739
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,291
I'm sorry. I'll get up.

740
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,668
No. Please, don't worry
about it. Zack, this is Bill.

741
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,794
Bill, Zack.

742
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,046
We were just talking
and Zack was telling me

743
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,340
that he's
a programmer
for smart phones.

744
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,884
Is that right?

745
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,803
Yeah. I'm interviewing
at Paige in the morning

746
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,847
for a software
analytics position.

747
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,433
Which, technically,
isn't programming. But...

748
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,226
Look, I'm sorry for being
such an asshole earlier...

749
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,520
Yeah, but you were
a programmer, right?

750
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,440
I was telling him that
I keep losing my phone,

751
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:56,566
and because I
keep my ringer off...

752
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,818
It'd be nice if there
was a way to find it.

753
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,779
Yeah, but apparently,
it's pretty simple, right?

754
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,907
I didn't say it was simple...
GPS?

755
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,325
Carrier signal triangulation?

756
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,784
No.

757
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,954
Basically, you just
send an intrusion virus
attached to a picture text

758
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,373
that switches the phone
from silent to ring.

759
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,084
Most phones load
images automatically,
so if you...

760
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,670
What if there's no
cell phone coverage?

761
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,256
If it's two phones
on a smaller network?

762
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,592
It's the same protocol.
Even over Wi-Fi.

763
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,969
How fast could you do
something like that?

764
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,763
What, like right now?

765
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,847
Yes.

766
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,349
There are variables.

767
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,475
The phone and the network.

768
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,477
If the other phone is
even turned on or not.

769
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,146
It's on. But the target
number is anonymous.

770
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,899
You have to send
it from this phone.

771
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,946
Jesus.

772
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,074
Marshal,
I don't know
about this.

773
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,241
Can you do it?

774
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,036
This dude is talking
about killing people.
Can he see us right now?

775
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
I'm here.

776
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,499
I guess I can give it a shot.
But I can't guarantee...

777
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,833
How fast?

778
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,293
Thirty minutes?

779
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,087
Twenty?

780
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,131
We have less than eight minutes.

781
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:05,551
You can do it.
That's why they want
to hire you, right?

782
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,595
Eight minutes.

783
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,472
Okay.

784
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,433
Tell me when it's ready.

785
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,018
Thanks, ma'am.

786
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,153
Hey, hey.

787
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,406
What did you see up there?

788
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,700
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

789
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,327
What, are you like
a doctor or something?

790
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,125
What the hell?

791
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,378
BILL: Ladies and
gentlemen, if I can have
your attention.

792
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,672
The business
cabin is now closed.

793
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,760
I repeat, the business cabin
is now closed to everyone.

794
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,762
Flight attendants,
if you could do your best,

795
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,848
please, to
accommodate all passengers.

796
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,182
Thank you.

797
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,273
(ALL SHOUTING)

798
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,983
MAN: I have a family,
for Christ's sake!

799
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
We have a situation.

800
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,237
Hey, man, you gonna
tell us what the hell
is going on or not?

801
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,406
Is the captain all right or not?

802
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,994
The... The situation
is quite complicated.

803
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,245
Complicated? Come on!

804
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,580
But I can assure you...

805
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,789
This is bullshit!

806
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,999
Everything's in hand!

807
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,375
Everything is under control!

808
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,335
Everyone, calm down!

809
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,795
I want to see the captain.

810
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,630
I'm gonna head up there myself.

811
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,750
That's it.
Move aside, Marshal.

812
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,010
Wait, wait. Free travel.

813
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,387
Free flights!

814
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,764
Free travel.

815
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,183
The airline
company will guarantee

816
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,602
one year's
international free travel.

817
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,814
If you sit down, remain quiet,
and do what I say.

818
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,233
Free international travel.

819
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,943
Thank you.

820
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,695
Twelve months.

821
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Free.

822
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,198
Guaranteed.

823
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,700
One year.
Free travel. Thank you.

824
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,829
Kyle, it's Bill.

825
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,081
Why are we turning?

826
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,160
I've been instructed
not to communicate
with you, Marks.

827
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,253
Did they tell you
to cut the network?
Listen to me.

828
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,466
The men who issued
those instructions
are not on this plane.

829
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,762
This is your plane.
These are your passengers.
Rice!

830
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,846
Kyle!

831
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,849
We've been diverted
north. 55 minutes.

832
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,893
Did they tell you
to cut the network?

833
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,353
I have orders, Marks.

834
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,272
Give me five minutes.
Five minutes.

835
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,690
Land the plane
wherever you want,

836
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,234
but do not switch
that network off.

837
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,904
Do you hear me?
I have a plan.
I can find this guy.

838
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,405
Five minutes.

839
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,833
I hope we can trust this guy.

840
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,084
I trust him.

841
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:47,130
Yeah, well,
I'd rather not end up
an accessory to a hijacking.

842
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,340
Okay.
BILL: Zack.

843
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,634
It's done.
Here it is.

844
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,718
Good man.

845
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,758
You think the captain's
still in control of the plane?

846
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,307
The plane almost goes down,

847
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,852
there's a guy
waving his gun around,
tying people up.

848
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,728
I'd say he pretty
much took control.

849
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:07,024
So you think the thing
about free international
flights was bullshit, or...

850
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,821
At what point do
we do something?

851
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,824
Gentlemen,
would you please
return to your seats?

852
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,668
You don't know
what's going on
either, do you?

853
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,975
So, what's the air
marshal up to now?

854
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,062
Ladies and gentlemen,

855
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,398
I need every passenger
to raise their
hands above their heads

856
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,650
and remain silent for
the next 60 seconds.

857
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,862
This is not a request.

858
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,034
Up.

859
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,120
Flight attendants, too.

860
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,627
Up!

861
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,255

What the fuck...

864

Hands behind your goddamn head!

865
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,861
Remove the phone.
With one hand.

866
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,326
I've never seen
that phone before.

867
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,620
Miss, undo his seatbelt.

868
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,290
Stand up, now.

869
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,293
You searched me.
My phone was in my bag.

870
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,961
Into the aisle.

871
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,462
Whatever you think I've done...

872
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,299
Shut up.
Front of the plane. Move!

873
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,883
You're making a mistake.

874
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,510
Turn around.

875
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,554
Take it easy!

876
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,472
MAN: What's going on?

877
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,810
Listen to me, please!
That's not my phone!

878
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,146
Who are you?

879
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,814
Just a passenger!

880
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,442
Why did you open
the account in my name?

881
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,735
I don't know what
you're talking about!

882
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,362
Answer the question,
or I will break your arm.

883
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,031
You got the wrong guy!

884
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,747
We found him, Nancy.
We got him.

885
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,584
Why me? Why?

886
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,002
Why me?

887
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,296
Why?

888
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,384
Nancy, get the doctor. Now!

889
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,464
(WATCH ALARM RINGING)

890
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,299
Bill? Bill?

891
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,808
Okay, let's break this down.

892
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,727
First, he ties up that guy,
then he takes another guy and
brings him out back.

893
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,646
What, is he gonna
pick us off one by one?

894
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,108
That's the doctor
right there. Hey.

895
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,320
You want to let us all
know what's going on?

896
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,788
And the captain?
Dead.

897
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:36,168
The co-pilot is flying.
Behind locked doors.

898
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,684
Are you all right?
Me? Fine. I'm great.

899
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,727
You shouldn't be
seeing all this.

900
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,607
All right, Doc. So,
we got a dead passenger
and a dead pilot.

901
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,652
The plane took a hard
turn 15 minutes ago.

902
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,529
That doesn't
happen mid-flight.

903
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,948
The marshal closed
off business class,

904
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,325
moved all the passengers
to the back.

905
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,077
Does this scenario
ring any bells?

906
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,936
You think he's
gonna crash the plane?

907
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,231
Flight 10,
this is Royal Air Force 114,

908
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,525
call sign Jackrabbit.
How copy?

909
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:12,616
Excuse me.

910
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,243
I was told I could
stay here with my husband.

911
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,744
Of course.

912
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,414
You used the lavatory
about an hour ago.
Do you remember that?

913
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,457
I don't have Alzheimer's.

914
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,086
Do you know
if someone else went
in there after you?

915
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,132
Yes, she was standing there
blocking the aisle.

916
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,466
Who?

917
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,634
The redhead.

918
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,429
The woman you
were sitting next to.

919
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,151
What are you doing in here?

920
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,738
I'm drinking.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't.
That's just terrible.

921
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,364
I've been wondering.

922
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,452
Why the window seat?

923
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,495
What? Why the window seat?

924
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,831
Why did you sit next to me?

925
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,625
What?
I found a hole

926
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,878
in the first class toilet,
clear shot to the captain.

927
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,048
The guy who died
had one of these
imbedded in his skin.

928
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,592
Ever seen one before?

929
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,177
No.

930
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,430
The toilets were
locked 10 minutes
before the captain died.

931
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,682
Five minutes before that,
I saw a woman enter.

932
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,143
She's 70 years old.

933
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,103
She said you went in after her,

934
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,857
and she doesn't
have Alzheimer's,
if you're wondering.

935
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,070
Are you asking me
if I saw someone
else go in,

936
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,738
or if I killed the captain?

937
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,783
Did you see someone else?

938
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,036
No.

939
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,663
Then answer the question.

940
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,666
You're a dick.

941
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,544
You switched seats
to be next to me,
which made you trustworthy.

942
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,171
You engaged me in conversation.

943
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,255
To relax you
because you were scared...

944
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,465
Yet you evaded
personal questions.

945
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,385
You mean, like where
I work. Yeah, that's
a great personal question.

946
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,886
You inserted yourself
into the investigation.

947
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,137
Are you serious?

948
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,597
Tracking the phone,
that was your idea.

949
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,807
Are you kidding me?

950
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,351
I am the only
person on this plane
who has stood by you.

951
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,727
You've been lying to
me this entire time.

952
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,813
You've been lying to me
since the second you
boarded this plane.

953
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,482
Oh, God! Okay, fine, fine!

954
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,529
Seven years ago my heart failed,

955
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,198
and I was dead
for like 43 minutes.

956
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,033
Aortic arch aneurysm.

957
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,202
They tried to fix it,
but when I woke up,

958
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,870
they told me
it was something
they couldn't fix

959
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,666
and that one day
it would fail again
and I would just die.

960
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,837
And that's okay with me
because we're all
gonna die someday,

961
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,381
and none of us
know when it's
gonna be, right?

962
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,426
But when I fly, which is a lot,

963
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,928
I like to look out
the window instead of

964
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,638
at the back of
the seat in front of me

965
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,266
or a folding tray table,
because one day
might be today.

966
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,439
Why do you like the aisle?

967
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,107
Dick.

968
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,407
Wait a second.

969
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,536
Here.

970
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,665
Let me pour you a real drink.

971
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,175
Thanks.

972
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,844
I'm sorry.

973
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,724
I hate flying.

974
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,602
Really?

975
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,104
I always kind of
liked it, you know?

976
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,690
Six hours in the same spot,
nobody can get to you.

977
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,276
Nothing to do but just
be present, you know?

978
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,028
You have no control.

979
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,615
Control is an illusion.
There is no control.

980
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,700
Over anything.

981
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,495
WOMAN:
You need to listen to this.

982
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,543
REPORTER: Where
a federal bomb squad and
investigators are searching

983
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,254
a car that allegedly
belongs to Bill Marks.

984
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:58,383
Sources tell us that Marks
parked his car here
at the airport today

985
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,220
before boarding
British Aqualantic Flight 10,

986
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,806
the way he had boarded
so many flights before,

987
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,141
in the guise of
an everyday passenger,

988
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,559
but carrying a mandate

989
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,395
from the United
States Department
of Homeland Security.

990
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,648
His job, to protect the flight.

991
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,485
And he was also, as always,
carrying a concealed handgun.

992
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:20,239
Well, we know this is
the hijacker's phone.
Can it tell us anything?

993
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,032
It's password protected.
I can't get in.

994
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,243
Did you try guessing?

995
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,797
This is a transatlantic flight
from New York to London,

996
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,216
the airline now
confirming this is,

997
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,844
in fact,
a hijacking in progress.

998
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,308
What did you do?
I didn't do anything,
I swear to God.

999
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,811
I just was
messing around with it.
I didn't do anything.

1000
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,245
Open every bag in this cabin.

1001
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,874
And the horrific
twist is that the hijacker

1002
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,667
is now believed to
be the one person who

1003
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,553
was authorized to
carry a gun onto the plane.

1004
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,797
You're looking for a package.
You'll know if you find it.

1005
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,757
Every bag. Go! Now!
Okay.

1006
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,384
Marenick.

1007
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,927
Marks?
Order this plane
down to 8,000 feet.

1008
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,262
Marks, listen to me.

1009
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,847
I have reason to believe
there's a bomb on the plane.

1010
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,016
Agent Marks,
just listen to me.
We need to drop altitude now.

1011
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,060
A bomb at this height
would tear this plane apart.

1012
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,103
REPORTER: and questions
already swirling around

1013
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,147
Bill Marks and his state of mind

1014
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,607
as he boarded the flight...

1015
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,067
MARENICK: Bill, when you send
me a text and you say

1016
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,278
that you're out of options,
you and I both know
that's not the case.

1017
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,113
Who else received that message?

1018
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,865
Clearly, we got it here at TSA.

1019
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,869
We're getting
calls from the FBI,
the White House,

1020
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,410
and now the press is involved.

1021
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,872
You have our attention.
There's no need to take
this any further, Bill.

1022
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,500
No one else has to die.
I know it feels like no one
is listening, but I am.

1023
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,668
We'll work it out together.

1024
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,211
Marenick,
you're not getting this!

1025
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,839
Bill, listen to me.
Let's talk this through.

1026
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,633
You're talking to me
like I'm a terrorist.

1027
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:03,759
You know how this works.

1028
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,428
If you try to bring that
plane any lower into
civilian airspace,

1029
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,930
you will be shot down.

1030
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,514
You're a threat to ground, Bill.

1031
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,202
Just wait for your
money and sit tight.

1032
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,937
REPORTER: A stark picture
of a man in a dangerous
psychological state.

1033
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,357
MARENICK: Bill, stay with me.
I need you to
cooperate with us...

1034
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,192
What now?

1035
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,714
REPORTER: Officials say
he was originally
from Northern Ireland.

1036
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,613
He became
a decorated New York City

1037
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,615
police officer
with a young family.

1038
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,493
He became distraught
when his 8-year-old
daughter, Olivia,

1039
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,203
passed away from cancer.

1040
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,081
Over the next decade,
sources say he
became withdrawn,

1041
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,249
got divorced in 2003.

1042
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,835
Suspended and later
fired from the NYPD,

1043
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,004
it was then,
in the summer of 2003,

1044
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,508
that he transferred
to the Federal
Air Marshal Service.

1045
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,510
And there,
his colleagues and neighbors

1046
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,221
saying he's a quiet man
who kept mostly to himself.

1047
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,515
MALE REPORTER: This is
a costly program, as well.

1048
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,309
There's no question.
This is what happens
when you put an unstable,

1049
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,019
angry man in
a position of power.

1050
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:57,604
This guy wasn't
even born in the U.S.

1051
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,231
He could be IRA,
for all we know.

1052
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,315
Thank you.

1053
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,527
Since 9/11,
we've put 4,000 air
marshals in the sky.

1054
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,070
Where do these people come from?

1055
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,697
I've seen these guys myself.

1056
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,782
They walk right
past the security line

1057
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,909
and they're barely
qualified to carry a badge.

1058
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,911
Walked right past security.

1059
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,122
There's controversy
around the air marshal
program already.

1060
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,873
Is this the final blow?

1061
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,710
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

1062
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,514
We give them guns
and we put them on planes,

1063
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,632
and we're surprised
when we have incidences
of drug smuggling.

1064
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,004
Oh, God.

1065
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,644
Now!

1066
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,938
Go, go, go!

1067
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,068
Grab him!
Grab him! Get the gun!

1068
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:27,986
Help me, man!
Wait!

1069
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,613
Hey, stop it!

1070
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,740
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.

1071
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:32,908
Stay down!

1072
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,271
MAN 1: Take him down!
Kick his ass!
MAN 2: Somebody stop him.

1073
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,006
NANCY: Stop it!

1074
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,509
WOMAN: Oh, my God!

1075
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,345
Stop!

1076
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,640
Help me, man!

1077
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:57,974
NANCY: Let go of him!

1078
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,644
Stop!

1079
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,190
(SCREAMING)

1080
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,279
Get him to the ground!
Hold him steady!

1081
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,364
Get his legs!

1082
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,740
Hold him, God damn it!

1083
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,534
Grab his legs!
BILL: Listen to me!

1084
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,618
Listen to me!
Shut up!

1085
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,079
Listen to me, please!
Please, go into the bathroom!

1086
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,372
Pin him down!
In the bathroom!

1087
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,165
You're done, Marshal!
There's a dead body!

1088
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,290
Shut the hell up! Shut up!

1089
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,417
There's a dead
body and a briefcase!

1090
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,752
In the briefcase
you'll find a bomb!

1091
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,129
Bullshit, you're lying!

1092
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,588
There is a bomb on this plane.

1093
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,008
Believe me, please!

1094
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,262
Get off of him.

1095
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,014
I said get off of him!
Get off him!
(ALL GASPING)

1096
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,475
Do it now. Get back, back!

1097
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,270
Back away, all of you.

1098
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,155
You don't know
what you're
doing with that gun.

1099
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,566
MAN: Come on.
What is he doing?

1100
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,985
Bowen, give me the gun.

1101
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,820
Tom, please.
No, stay where you are.

1102
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:55,073
I'm NYPD, we got it covered!
Put it down!

1103
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,576
Is there a bomb on this plane?

1104
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,169
I want you to tell me
what the hell is going on.

1105
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,421
Relax.
Don't tell me to relax!

1106
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,383
A passenger on
board this flight has

1107
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,052
threatened to kill
someone every 20 minutes

1108
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,764
unless they're
paid $150 million.

1109
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,185
And now, three people are dead.

1110
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,938
The bomb will explode
in less than half an hour.

1111
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,942
Now, they want you to believe
that I'm responsible.

1112
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,529
Everything you've
heard about me is true.

1113
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,617
I've lost my family, my job.
I'm an alcoholic.

1114
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,622
My daughter was diagnosed
with acute leukemia
at the age of five,

1115
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:48,043
and I spent my days at work
instead of being at home,

1116
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:52,172
looking after her,
because I was afraid
of watching her die!

1117
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,094
I'm not a good father.
I'm not a good man.

1118
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,725
I'm not hijacking this plane.

1119
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,852
I'm trying to save it!

1120
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:11,524
And I will save it!
If you work with me.

1121
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,745
You're NYPD. So was I,

1122
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,248
and you look as if you were
a better officer than I was.

1123
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,999
Cut him loose. Nancy.

1124
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,554
We need to start moving
all the luggage
towards the back.

1125
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,879
And move the women and children,

1126
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,410
move them up to
the front of the plane.

1127
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,142
That's your plan?

1128
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,687
My job is to prepare
for the worst
possible outcome.

1129
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,522
Well, my job is to prevent it.

1130
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,358
Women and children,
no exceptions.
Men move up in coach.

1131
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:57,894
What the hell are you thinking?

1132
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,115
There's a plan of
action that exists

1133
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,535
called the Least Resistant
Bomb Location Protocol.

1134
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,620
You place the bomb
against the rear door

1135
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,580
and stack anything and
everything against it.

1136
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:12,043
Every bag,
blanket, every pillow.
Nullify it as best you can.

1137
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,838
At this height
a bomb would tear
this plane apart,

1138
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:19,301
but we descend
to 8,000 feet,
pressure equalizes,

1139
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,969
and then we have a chance.

1140
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,806
So you're just gonna
let the bomb go off?

1141
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,559
Of course not,
I'm gonna stop it.

1142
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,312
But if I can't,
I'd rather be prepared,
wouldn't you?

1143
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,399
The man who brought this
bomb on the plane
may try something.

1144
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,276
Can I trust you to stop him?

1145
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,784
You're damn straight you can.

1146
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:48,413
Hey, Reilly, sorry
about the nose.

1147
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,583
It was never my best feature.

1148
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,795
Can't you get them
to wire the money?
Just try something?

1149
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,213
This was never about the money.

1150
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,757
Then what's it about?

1151
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,761
I'm not sure.
They used an
account in my name.

1152
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,430
They want an air marshal
to take down a plane

1153
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,016
with 150 people on board,

1154
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,852
and they want
the whole world
to see it.

1155
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,189
I was never
supposed to find
that bomb.

1156
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:24,491
WOMAN: Look.

1157
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,244
That's not good.

1158
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,038
WOMAN: Do you know
what that means?

1159
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,878
Aqualantic Flight 10,
this is Royal Air Force 114,

1160
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:39,589
call sign Jackrabbit.
How copy?

1161
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,466
Copy, Jackrabbit.

1162
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,177
We will be your
escorts to the
designated landing zone.

1163
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:45,970
Do not deviate from
your current course

1164
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,889
or altitude
without authorization.

1165
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,141
Do you copy?
Copy.

1166
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,685
Kyle.

1167
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:55,397
Kyle.
Yes, Marks?

1168
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,481
We have a new situation.

1169
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,358
Yeah, no shit.

1170
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,735
I need you to drop
the plane to 8,000 feet.

1171
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,029
Get to the lowest
pressure deferential
you can.

1172
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:04,781
One PSI, 1.5 at most.

1173
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,325
Wait, Bill,
that's explosives protocol.

1174
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,413
Yes, we have 16 minutes,
give or take.

1175
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,498
You know we have company, right?

1176
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,084
Two typhoons are
flanking me right now.

1177
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,086
They're watching,
and you want me to...

1178
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,755
Kyle, we need to
drop altitude now.

1179
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,175
Look, I have orders, Marks.
Any suspicious
activity and they...

1180
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,593
Rice!

1181
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:29,097
There is a bomb on this
plane. We have to
descend to 8,000 feet.

1182
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,809
All right, give me 10 minutes.
If we drop now, I lose speed.

1183
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,645
Ten minutes at this
altitude, maybe I can get
us close enough,

1184
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,397
close enough to land in Iceland.

1185
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,982
Ten minutes. Thanks.

1186
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,974
It's an RDX explosive.
Very professional.
Maybe military.

1187
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,058
Is that blow?

1188
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,729
Are you positive it
can't be disarmed?

1189
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,231
This is
a calibrated
pressure trigger.

1190
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,984
The only way to disarm a bomb
is to remove the trigger.

1191
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:27,655
But remove the trigger,
the pressure releases,
the bomb goes off.

1192
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,860
Well, can't we
just dump it?
Same principle in reverse.

1193
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,701
The low pressure
outside the plane

1194
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,587
won't hold the trigger.
You try to dump it...

1195
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,621
The bomb goes off.

1196
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,831
Isn't there like
a wire you can cut?
No.

1197
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,396
So, if this guy
doesn't get his money,

1198
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,959
he's gonna kill
himself and everyone aboard?

1199
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,544
I can't believe this.
This is crazy.

1200
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,546
Why aren't we
looking for this guy?
We're out of time.

1201
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,256
That's a bullshit answer,
Marshal, you know it.

1202
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,466
Take it easy.

1203
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,093
There's 150 passengers
and crew.
It could be anyone.

1204
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,846
Let's find him!
Let's pay him,
let's do something.

1205
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:54,766
It's not about the money,
and even if I find him...

1206
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,436
I don't think
he ever intended to
get off this plane.

1207
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,939
My God, we're all gonna die.

1208
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:05,318
No!

1209
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:10,365
We gotta place the bomb
here. Stack all available
luggage over it.

1210
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,033
And direct
the explosion outward.

1211
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,328
At 8,000 feet,
the pressure will
equalize. Then we land.

1212
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,997
With a hole in the fuselage?
And this has worked before?

1213
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,917
It's never been tried before.

1214
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,835
That you know of.
You're not being
helpful, Doctor.

1215
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,003
We're so screwed.

1216
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,213
It could work!
We've got to try!

1217
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,341
Come on! Grab every able hand!
Let's get this done!

1218
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,054
Marshal, if they're
setting this thing off,
no matter what,

1219
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,848
what are they waiting for?

1220
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,310
AUSTIN: Just grab
what you can, go to the back.

1221
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,728
All right,
you guys form a chain,

1222
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,314
send those bags back
as fast as you can.

1223
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,945
ATTENDANT: Please
remove all luggage
from the overhead bins.

1224
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,498
Kyle, how close are we?
We need to descend, now!

1225
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,417
No, give me three minutes.

1226
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,211
Three minutes, okay.

1227
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:08,798
Look at your watch.
Three minutes from now,
not a second longer.

1228
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,759
No matter what happens,
drop down 8,000 feet.

1229
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,261
Okay.

1230
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,555
Take this.
MAN: Lighter luggage up front.

1231
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,725
Keep piling please.
Bring the heavier
luggage down.

1232
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:19,851
NANCY: Keep them going.

1233
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,374
Sir, keep that with you,
I just need...

1234
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,397
Your nose.

1235
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,232
Yeah, it's bleeding, thanks.

1236
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,234
You have a displaced fracture.

1237
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,195
Look, it's a broken nose,
it's normal,
I don't need you to fix it.

1238
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,823
Look, I'm going
to set your nose.

1239
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,742
Here, hold this.

1240
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:36,868
Just make it quick, all right?

1241
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,161
Apply some pressure.

1242
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:39,871
Okay.

1243
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,415
On three. One...

1244
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,417
(GRUNTING)

1245
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,843
GWEN: Sweetheart,
you've got to come out.

1246
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,304
It's all right,
I'll hold your hand.
But it's not safe.

1247
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,889
Gwen, what's going on?
Please.

1248
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,265
We need to hurry.

1249
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,977
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I need your help.
She won't come out.

1250
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,064
What's wrong?
Are you scared?

1251
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,941
I wanna see my daddy.

1252
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,569
I know you do,
sweetheart.
I know you do.

1253
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,907
You know, I was a daddy
once to a little
girl just like you,

1254
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,785
and when she was scared,
you know what she'd do?

1255
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,039
She had a magic ribbon,
very powerful.

1256
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,376
It'll protect you,
just like your daddy.

1257
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,004
You wanna see it?
I have it in my pocket.

1258
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,299
I carry it all the time.
Here it is. Here.

1259
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:36,427
You wrap it around
your hand, just like that.

1260
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,596
That's it, hold on to it now.

1261
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,225
Are you bribing me?

1262
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,145
Yes, I am.

1263
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,318
This is my friend, Jen.
She's gonna look after you.

1264
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:53,778
Jen, this is Becca.
Hey.

1265
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,447
Don't worry,
you'll see your father
soon. I promise.

1266
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,617
Can I have the window seat?

1267
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:04,622
You mean this old seat?
Mm-hm.

1268
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,547
KYLE: Ladies and
gentlemen, we're about to
begin our descent.

1269
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,134
I need you to
return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

1270
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,720
GWEN: Please stay calm.
Everyone, please get
back to your seats.

1271
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,805
(PHONE RINGING)

1272
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:21,889
Yeah?

1273
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,474
MARENICK: Marks,
we transferred the money,

1274
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,101
150 million US
into your account.

1275
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,228
It's too late for the money.
Whatever he's doing...

1276
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,689
You can stop now, Marks.
You have your money.

1277
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,894
The jets will escort you in.

1278
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,742
I have to bring this
plane down to 8,000 feet.

1279
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,069
You will not descend
into civilian airspace.

1280
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,698
You think he wants the money?
You think that will stop him?

1281
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,950
If you transferred
the money, prove it.

1282
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,704
You want proof?
Here's your proof,
$150 million was transferred

1283
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:51,085
to account
CH-1000-23000-A-10982.

1284
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:54,630
Confirmation code R48940.

1285
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,968
We'll escort you into
a military air field,

1286
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,596
you will not be arrested,
no questions will be asked.

1287
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,849
There is a bomb on this plane.
It isn't mine. It will go off!

1288
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:07,769
And we have to prepare...
You're in command
of a hijacked vessel

1289
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,437
and you will not
dive that plane
into civilian airspace.

1290
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,521
I will!

1291
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,273
Then, Marks, God damn it,
we will shoot you down!

1292
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,777
Someday, they'll fish
this plane's black box
out of the Atlantic Ocean,

1293
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,779
and the world will
know these people
could have been saved.

1294
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,383
The world already
knows what's going on

1295
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:20,865
in that plane, Bill.
You are hijacking it.

1296
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,366
That's what
you're telling them.
No, no, no, no, no.

1297
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,131
That's what your
hostages are telling them.

1298
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:27,330
That video is playing on
every major news
network on repeat, Bill.

1299
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,249
What video?
One of your
hostages uploaded a video.

1300
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,752
You're taking a man,
dragging him
around at gunpoint,

1301
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,754
stumbling over
terrified passengers.

1302
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,298
How do you expect
us to believe anything
that you're saying

1303
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,383
when you clearly
are abusing those hostages?

1304
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,093
We've seen everything
we need to know.

1305
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,887
But we're trying to negotiate...

1306
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,312
Your phone, now! The phone!

1307
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,231
Show me the video
that you uploaded!
Come on!

1308
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,655
I apologize for my son.

1309
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,618
Humor me. Look!

1310
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,538
Look.
I don't see him.

1311
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:09,664
Come on, look.

1312
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,626
Right there.
Where?

1313
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,461
Glasses.
Come on, move.

1314
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,214
God damn it!

1315
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:20,925
You. Look...

1316
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,434
God damn it!

1317
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,743
Stay where you are.

1318
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,829
Bill, don't test me!

1319
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:56,294
Bill.

1320
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,546
Reilly, drop!

1321
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,174
Reilly, get down!

1322
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,135
You gave me an unloaded weapon?

1323
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,887
Overhead bin, 4B!

1324
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,764
Everybody, down! Stay down!

1325
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,604
Hey, get out of there, move!
What?

1326
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,480
Hey, man!

1327
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,322
You looking for this?

1328
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:26,949
Give me that.

1329
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,577
What are you doing?

1330
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,091
Get back!
Okay, okay.

1331
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,857
Jackrabbit,
I have shots fired outside
this cockpit, need to descend.

1332
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,973
That's a negative, Flight 10,
do not deviate from your
current course or altitude.

1333
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,853
Turn around.

1334
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:57,716
I need all of you
to put your hands

1335
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,065
on the seat-back
in front of you.

1336
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,733
Do it now!

1337
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,152
Move.
Don't test me.

1338
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,862
Step back!

1339
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,781
Put your hands up!

1340
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:07,990
Sit!

1341
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,659
Sit, sit!

1342
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:14,205
He was supposed to be
in the seat next to mine.

1343
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,123
Yeah. He was close enough.

1344
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:21,379
Listen,
whatever I've done to you,
whatever it is, I'm sorry.

1345
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,172
Stay down!

1346
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:25,591
Bill, I'm not mad at you.

1347
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,551
You're my hero.

1348
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,596
People everywhere
are gonna remember
the name Bill Marks.

1349
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,682
An alcoholic,
self-destructive,

1350
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,809
suicidal man with
a gun and a federal badge

1351
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:35,935
who changed everything.

1352
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,853
What do you think doing
this is gonna change?

1353
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,106
Two minutes outside
the window. Suit up.

1354
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,910
Every one of these
people boarded this plane

1355
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,776
believing their
country would protect them.

1356
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,236
That you would protect them.

1357
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,157
Everyone!

1358
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,575
We're gonna be okay!

1359
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,619
There's an air marshal on board.

1360
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,498
Do you have any
idea how easy this was?

1361
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,167
You're right, I failed.
You've made your point.

1362
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,712
No, Bill, you failed miserably!

1363
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:07,341
Three thousand
people died that day,
including my father!

1364
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,761
So I joined up
'cause I wanted to go
fight the cowards that did it.

1365
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,265
But I just ended
up fighting in a war
that I still don't understand

1366
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,018
and came home to a country
where nothing had changed.

1367
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:18,894
Until now.

1368
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,106
Security is this
country's biggest lie.

1369
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:26,944
In our homes, in our cities,
in our planes, no one's safe,

1370
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,781
and one day
somebody worse than me
is gonna expose that lie,

1371
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,616
and the last thing
our children will see

1372
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,577
is our failure as
it destroys them.

1373
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,248
You, Bill, you are that lie!

1374
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,098
You should just have
handed out pamphlets.

1375
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:42,710
It would have been a lot easier.

1376
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,716
You can't change
the world with words, Bill,

1377
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,926
unless you write those
words in the evening
news with blood.

1378
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,053
We gotta go.

1379
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,598
You're military.
These are the people
you fought to protect.

1380
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:58,934
I swore to protect my country,
and that's what I'm doing.

1381
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,728
You believe that?
I do.

1382
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,522
I also believe we'll
be $150 million richer.

1383
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,067
You'll never get that money.
It's in an account in my name.

1384
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,902
It's in a trust in your name.

1385
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,072
I die, the money moves.

1386
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,909
To 100 accounts,
27 countries, each of
those into 100 other accounts.

1387
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,078
When do you think
you're gonna jump?

1388
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:19,246
35,000 feet? You'll be
dead in four seconds.

1389
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,707
We'll jump when the pilot
follows explosive protocol

1390
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,001
and drops us down to 8,000 feet.

1391
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,670
Anything you think of,
we've thought of
a thousand times.

1392
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,590
They've been instructed
to shoot us down
if we try to descend.

1393
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,092
That's bullshit!

1394
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,135
They're not gonna
kill all these people.

1395
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:37,139
This is a hijacked flight.
We're a classified
threat to ground.

1396
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:41,685
If you don't disarm that bomb,
everyone on board
will die, including you.

1397
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,354
Did you think of that?

1398
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,107
Look, I'm prepared to die.
We're not gonna die.

1399
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,859
Say again, Jackrabbit.
I need to descend.

1400
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,111
That's a negative, Flight 10.

1401
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,197
I'm gonna stick with the plan.
We descend, we jump.

1402
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,740
The plane goes down,
we have enough money.

1403
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,117
We can do whatever we want.

1404
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,453
Think about it, Tommy.
We can disappear
and never come back.

1405
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,749
You hear me?
Never be found, ever.
Mission accomplished, right?

1406
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,374
But right now
we need to get
the hell off this plane.

1407
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:10,047
Zack, you and I both know
we were never
getting off this plane.

1408
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,761
Zack, whatever your name is,
you don't have to die.

1409
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,556
If you won't save these
people, save yourself.

1410
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,558
Disarm the bomb.

1411
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,936
Come on, do it.

1412
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,414
He was a martyr,
like you and me, Bill.

1413
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,834
Real heroes don't
need to be remembered
or recognized.

1414
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,878
Real heroes do
whatever's necessary.

1415
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,713
I guess I wouldn't understand.

1416
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,549
Fuck it!
I guess you wouldn't.

1417
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:18,449
No!

1418
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,585
20,000! Come on, you wanker!

1419
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,529
8,000 feet! Come on, come on!

1420
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,200
Bill!

1421
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,092
8,000!

1422
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,574
JACKRABBIT: AQ 10,
climb back up to 25,000 feet!
There's a bomb on board!

1423
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,179
I need to get this
plane on the ground.

1424
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,792
Nancy, move, move!
Everybody down, heads down!

1425
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,295
Hey, Bill!

1426
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,879
I'm getting off this plane!

1427
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,716
Am I in your way, asshole?

1428
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,822
Get down!

1429
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,074
Do it quick! Heads down!

1430
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:31,999
Get down!

1431
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,595
Come on, Kyle!
You can do this!
You can do this, come on.

1432
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,811
JACKRABBIT: severe
damage to your fuselage.

1433
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,313
Are you able to
maintain control?

1434
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,237
Shit!

1435
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,744
KYLE: Fuel dump in progress.

1436
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,246
Copy that, Flight 10.
Come on, damn it!

1437
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,541
A little longer, come on!

1438
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,393
Oh, God!

1439
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,440
Get the belt! Get the belt!

1440
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:44,154
Hang on!
Bill, help me!

1441
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,156
Becca, I have you!

1442
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:48,826
Hang onto me! Hang onto me!

1443
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:08,554
You okay? Are you okay?

1444
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,685
Door is disarmed.
Release your seatbelts!

1445
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,772
Take her. Everybody.
Come on with me.

1446
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,233
Undo your seatbelt!
Move to the front, quickly.

1447
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,694
Leave everything.
Come this way,
up to the front.

1448
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,280
One at a time, please.

1449
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,198
Leave everything.

1450
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,451
(SIRENS WAILING)

1451
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:32,786
Leave everything.

1452
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:33,912
Up to the front.

1453
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:35,998
Leave everything.

1454
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,330
All passengers and
crew accounted for.

1455
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,624
And you, are you all right?

1456
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,709
That was a hell of a landing.

1457
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,301
REPORTER: Less than
one hour ago, British
Aqualantic Flight 10

1458
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:32,930
made an emergency landing
after a bomb exploded mid-air.

1459
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:37,684
This following
an attempted hijacking,
yet in an unbelievable twist,

1460
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:40,771
the suspected hijacker,
U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks,

1461
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,564
turned out to be the hero.

1462
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:45,984
It was Marks
who confronted and
killed the hijackers,

1463
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,070
saving the lives...

1464
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,822
Yeah?
It's Marenick.

1465
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,951
It's my turn to break
protocol, Agent Marks.

1466
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,440
I'm calling from
my personal line

1467
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,871
and I'll deny this
conversation ever took place.

1468
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:02,668
Listen, Bill,
what you did on that plane,
what you were up against,

1469
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,671
I want you to know
I was wrong about you.

1470
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,341
And you'll have my full support.

1471
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,344
Appreciate that.

1472
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:14,805
And, Bill,

1473
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,974
we're gonna need
that money back.

1474
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,269
What money?

1475
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,564
Take care, Agent Marks.

1476
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:39,746
AUSTIN: Marshal!

1477
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,626
Reilly, you son of a gun.

1478
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:46,420
Next time,
give me a loaded weapon.

1479
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,171
Next time, don't get shot.

1480
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,840
Deal.

1481
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,749
I'm gonna give you
back your ribbon.

1482
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:02,311
I don't need it anymore.

1483
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:05,856
That-a-girl.

1484
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,358
It's your dad.

1485
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:12,946
Daddy.

1486
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,794
Hey, I was looking for you!
Hey.

1487
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,423
Do you know where we are?
Iceland.

1488
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:34,009
Ah! Well,
never been to Iceland.

1489
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,804
I mean, I've seen it,
few times from
plane windows, but...

1490
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:39,097
Thank you.

1491
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,224
For what?

1492
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:44,394
You stood by me,
even after all
that happened.

1493
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,521
Why?

1494
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,898
You're a good man.

1495
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,901
I bet your daughter
would have been proud of you.

1496
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,528
Thanks, ma'am.

1497
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,495
So...

1498
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:02,579
Mm-hm.

1499
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:04,748
Where you headed?

1500
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,795
Depends.
