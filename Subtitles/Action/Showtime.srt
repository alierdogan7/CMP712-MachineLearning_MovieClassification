00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:33,393
-Look, l did an episode of Cops once.
-You did an episode of Cops?

166
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:36,473
You forget the camera is even there.

167
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:41,544
-This is real work. l'm not an actor.
-No one is saying you can't work.

168
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:47,109
But you screwed up. And now
you've got to play ball. End of story.

169
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:52,986
You'll be reporting
to the show's producer, Chase Renzi.

170
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:55,993
Chase Renzi? ls that a real name?

171
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:00,064
l won't take orders from some
coked-out Hollywood dickhead.

172
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,306
That's good,
because she doesn't have a dick.

173
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:11,628
Check her out for yourself.
She's outside, waiting for you.

174
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:18,550
Well. Better looking than l thought.

175
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:25,713
We gotta bring in color, some light.
Do you think these windows move?

176
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,592
Detective Preston, hi.

177
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:31,753
l can see you're busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

178
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,667
He's not very friendly.

179
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,953
-Here you go, cover boy.
-Thanks.

180
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:56,034
Detective Preston, Chase Renzi.
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

181
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:59,705
-How you doing?
-Good. l see you've already ordered.

182
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:07,743
fries and a Coke

183
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,906
-Diet?
-Regular.

184
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:15,427
So, Detective Preston. . . .
Can l call you Mitch?

185
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:25,106
-I don't tick

186
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:28,787
-Sure you do. Everybody ticks.
-Not me.

187
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,351
Tell me about yourself.
You have a girlfriend, a wife?

188
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:35,864
-Ex-wife.
-Ex-wife.

189
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,191
Was it a painful divorce?

190
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:42,993
l only ask because l was divorced,
and l know it can be difficult.

191
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:44,833
l mean, did you drink?

192
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:49,426
Lady, l'm here because my captain
made me. l had no choice.

193
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:53,144
out questiens or your snow.

194
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:57,474
Not only do l understand
your resistance, l appreciate it.

195
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:12,508
. . .we could do something
very special here.

196
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,915
l don't know
what you're talking about.

197
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,545
-l'm talking about reality, Mitch.
-There you go.

198
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,833
Letting the world find out
who you really are.

199
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:27,427
You're looking for loose cannon,
cop-on-the-edge Serpico bullshit.

200
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:30,428
l'm telling you,
you're wasting your time.

201
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,066
See that anger, Mitch?

202
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:39,872
The audience will connect
with that in a major way.

203
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:41,907
l'm out of here.

204
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,510
Want that in a doggy bag?

205
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:54,504
No.
Thanks, though. lt was delicious.

206
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:02,310
-How did it go? ls he intense?
-l need cherry Tums, quick.

207
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:06,832
-ls he psyched about the show?
-lt may be harder than l thought.

208
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:09,910
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch!

209
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:28,188
Wait! Wait!

210
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:47,104
Bad idea. l only got two things
bigger than my mouth.

211
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,709
One of them is pointed at your head.

212
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:11,430
-You damn right.

213
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:16,544
lf your boys want to know who put the
smack down on you, my badge is 38723.

214
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:46,071
-l got the situation in hand.
-Top Cop, how you doing?

215
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,754
This is my collar.

216
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:53,508
-He could've had a gun.
-Nobody got no gun.

217
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,549
Trey, l think you broke a rib.
Tell him to get the cuffs off.

218
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:00,395
l told you l can't do handcuffs.

219
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:08,588
Never seen him before.
Just another criminal.

220
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:12,834
Bullshit. We took a stage combat class
together last fall.

221
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,263
Nice try, pal.

222
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:17,911
He's just trying to weasel
his way out of the crime.

223
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,505
-That's what he's doing.
-He looks like a real menace.

224
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,068
Who wants to explain?

225
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:27,427
Trey said he'd give me $50 if l
snatched the lady's purse and ran.

226
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,553
He'd pull up in his police car,
jump out. . .

227
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:33,792
. . .chase me up a fence,
beat me down, kick me--

228
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:35,826
All right, all right. Okay.

229
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,673
l set the whole thing up.
lt was a big setup.

230
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:44,712
l set it up to make it look
like l was. . . .

231
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:48,390
-l was auditioning to get this part.
-What part?

232
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:53,032
lt won't be this moron.

233
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:55,914
l should report you
for impersonating a cop.

234
00:29:57,515 --> 00:30:01,508
Why you take everything so seriously?

235
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,553
You should be protecting,
not staging crimes.

236
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:14,389
You got the part already.
l'm just trying to spruce it up.

237
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:18,668
-That's what you normally do at work.
-Better watch your mouth.

238
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:22,265
What are you gonna do,
wrap me up in caution tape?

239
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:26,791
No, l ain't gonna wrap you up
in caution tape.

240
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:36,944
Work on your Starsky and Hutch
routine on your own time.

241
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:43,109
-He's a disgrace.
-You'd work with him?

242
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,027
Never in a million years.

243
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:54,750
-Amazing.
-Really?

244
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,633
Thank you. All right.

245
00:30:57,955 --> 00:31:01,504
The guy's a joke.
There's no way l'll work with him.

246
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:04,787
l don't want to hear it.
Shit, come on.

247
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:08,144
Thanks.

248
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:13,306
You're doing this. That's an order.

249
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,263
Trapped in the jaws, he struggled.

250
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:22,383
You'll never see no brothers
messing with no sharks.

251
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:23,544
Never.

252
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,544
Hello?

253
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:35,792
l saw you on TV,
shooting up the neighborhood.

254
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,024
Oh, yeah?

255
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,705
l got cell phones, call waiting,
e-mail, voice mail. . .

256
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:50,713
. . .and l haven't heard una chingada
from you.

257
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,553
lt ain't like that, dog.

258
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:56,344
l'm laying low till everything
dies down. lt got crazy.

259
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:04,546
And you let me down.

260
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,390
And now you put
my entire shipment at risk.

261
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:11,548
You used that gun
without my permission.

262
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:18,546
We don't want that getting
into the wrong hands, do we now?

263
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:26,068
No, l was just borrowing it.
Just testing it out, you know?

264
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:32,385
-And how did it work?
-Real good. l got it right here.

265
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,548
So we cool, right?

266
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:44,264
-Yeah. We cool.
-l'm sorry about--

267
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:48,906
Don't worry. We cool, Lazy Boy. Okay?

268
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:50,747
-We're cool.
-All right.

269
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:54,504
You two have a nice night. Okay?

270
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,148
All right.

271
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:06,745
What the hell was that all about?

272
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:12,224
What the hell?

273
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:20,110
-What's that?
-Stop playing this shit, man.

274
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:22,904
Get down!

275
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:11,223
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

276
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,466
Cut, cut, cut, cut. Cut.

277
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,234
Let's do it again.

278
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,070
Freeze! L.A.P.D.

279
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:26,388
That how he's doing it?

280
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:30,628
l'm laying my shit out.
Freeze! L.A.P.D. That shit is right.

281
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,824
Ready?

282
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,589
Patrolling your area at Friday. . . .

283
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:37,304
Friday night at 8. Eight.

284
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,745
Patrolling every Friday at 8.

285
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:42,270
Yeah, good, and be happy.

286
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:44,466
Why should l? l'm patrolling.

287
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:47,872
You're happy because
you're patrolling.

288
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:49,508
Keeping it safe, Mitch.

289
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,070
Patrolling every Friday at night.

290
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:54,306
Every Friday night at 8.

291
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:07,032
-Get out.
-Wait a minute, hold it, cut, cut.

292
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:10,784
Mitch, you can't just
toss a cameraman aside.

293
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:18,463
The doors fly open.

294
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:22,025
They fly open. You burst in.
You scan the room.

295
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:26,547
You do the turn, toss yourself around.
And now! You're set and--

296
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:29,633
But don't turn your head
too far from camera.

297
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:34,431
That little lady is your lover. Don't
respect her, she won't respect you.

298
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,672
-Always know where she is.
-She's in my way.

299
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:44,311
Which is the most underrated show
in history.

300
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:48,064
-T-Thank

301
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,631
-l'm playing a detective.
-Okay.

302
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:59,709
Let's go do some hood-jumping.

303
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,264
What's that?

304
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:05,309
-What do you think? We jump over hoods.
-Something you'd know.

305
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:06,984
Freeze!

306
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:17,904
-Okay, Mitch. Come here.
-l'm not going on the hood of a car.

307
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:20,071
-What do you mean?
-Forget it.

308
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:24,387
l entertained viewers everywhere
in the '80s, jumping on car hoods.

309
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:27,905
One of a TV cop's greatest weapons.
l'll show you.

310
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:33,825
You gotta stop them, see? Halt!
And you throw your body. Halt!

311
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:38,343
You okay, T.J.?

312
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,344
Moving on.

313
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,708
Deep in thought.

314
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,550
Now the eyebrows arch,
ever so slightly.

315
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:55,345
And Hooker solves another case.

316
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:59,434
Okay? All right, Trey, you try it.
Go ahead. Ready?

317
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,309
-Get loose now. Loosen up. Ready?
-Yeah.

318
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:05,106
Trey, who stole the money?

319
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:10,430
Good. You nailed it, first take.
Give me five. That was good!

320
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:14,150
Okay, Mitch.
Come on, show me some magic.

321
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:16,784
Mitch, who stole the money?

322
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:24,227
Look at the anger in his eyes.
Look at that.

323
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:28,434
See, that slight squint says,
''Hey, l'm Mitch. l'm the man.

324
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:31,824
Don't mess with me. ''

325
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,670
Okay. Let's taste some drugs.

326
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,305
Hooker's got a bag
of white powder in his hand.

327
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:41,273
Spears it open with a pocketknife.

328
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:44,470
Takes his little pinkie. . .

329
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:46,586
. . .in the powder.

330
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,949
And he touches it,
gently, on his tongue.

331
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,074
Watch the eyebrows.

332
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,631
Hooker knows it's cocaine.

333
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:58,754
What if it's cyanide?

334
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:07,192
Hello? Hold on. There's a reason
real cops don't taste drugs, Bill.

335
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:14,470
-Okay, l'm on my way.
-lt's tricky.

336
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:18,913
-Where are you going?
-l gotta wash this shit out of my hair.

337
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:22,551
We have some action?
We have some action, finally.

338
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:43,387
ln the wheel, the glove compartment
and a crook-cam in the back.

339
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,149
-Pretend they're not there.
-Pretend.

340
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:50,945
-See? You're catching on already.
-We'll be right behind you in the van.

341
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,504
You'll be right behind me?

342
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,703
What are you doing?

343
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,710
Unbelievable.

344
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,313
What's the mean face for?

345
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,591
Listen. Don't speak, listen.

346
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:22,308
First of all, you gotta know
that l got your back covered. . .

347
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:25,109
. . .and l gotta know
you got mine covered.

348
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,390
No doubt.

349
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:31,549
When we're on the job you're
the only person l can depend on.

350
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:35,904
You got that?

351
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:38,953
That's important.
There's no other way.

352
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,504
And it's gotta start right now.

353
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:48,068
You know, ever since l was 8,
l wanted to be a cop.

354
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:55,270
He was the first in the family
on the force. Big muscles.

355
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,504
Uncle Reggie.

356
00:39:57,155 --> 00:40:00,352
He used to let me ride
in the squad car with him.

357
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:05,830
. . .l knew l was gonna be a cop.

358
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:07,508
Uncle Reggie.

359
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:09,748
Yeah.

360
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,027
My uncle--

361
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:17,388
Uncle Reggie passed away
two years ago.

362
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:20,274
He got caught in the line
of some fire.

363
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:25,103
Didn't slow me down.
l remember how he set me on my way.

364
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:29,228
He's looking down on me
from a big precinct in the sky.

365
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:34,634
He's thinking, ''You've done all right,
Trey. You've done right by me. ''

366
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:47,195
That ''l'm your partner. ''
That was a speech.

367
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:50,905
You burned up 90 seconds of air.
That was a speech.

368
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,074
When we get to the crime scene,
stay out of my way.

369
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,908
This isn't studio shit.
This is real.

370
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:07,233
-Get your camera out of here.
-Hey, watch it.

371
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:09,869
Julio has to shoot. That's the show.

372
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,553
That's right. Whatever you need,
l'm there.

373
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:20,709
lf l get shot, stabbed, it's cool.
Whatever. l'm getting good footage.

374
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:24,311
Just remember three words:
Go to Trey.

375
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:25,544
-l'm Trey.
-Julio.

376
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:28,792
-You worked on Springer?
-Springer, Girls Gone Wild.

377
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:31,873
Get that camera out of here.
Who's in the bag?

378
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,269
We don't know yet.

379
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:36,467
Whoever shot him didn't care
for open caskets.

380
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:38,546
Thinking what l'm thinking?

381
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,991
. . .cleaning the streets up
on they own terms, partner.

382
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:51,267
This is payback for a drug deal
gone sour.

383
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:54,064
Whoever this guy worked for
got pissed.

384
00:41:58,035 --> 00:42:00,868
Good thinking, partner.
Good thinking.

385
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:06,073
l think l can identify
one of the victims.

386
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:12,110
Those are 1 2-gauge, armor-piercing
uranium shells.

387
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,788
-Charlie.
-Hey, Mitchell.

388
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:17,504
l found explosive and incendiary
rounds scattered around.

389
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:25,592
lt appears to be hand-held, automatic,
with interchangeable magazines.

390
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:28,389
Technically, this gun doesn't exist.

391
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,828
Speak English.

392
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:39,511
Any idea who made it?

393
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:44,872
It's out of Eastern Europe.

394
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,631
-Thanks, Charlie. Keep your eyes open.
-You bet.

395
00:42:53,675 --> 00:42:55,791
-What are you doing?
-Take it easy.

396
00:42:55,995 --> 00:43:00,705
-You're not supposed to touch.
-l didn't. l turned it over.

397
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,594
-Let me know when you touch--
-l don't have to--

398
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:07,191
-What's going on?
-He's contaminating my crime scene.

399
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:10,068
l'm doing a sweep of the area.

400
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:14,712
You never know where a crucial
bit of evidence may be hiding.

401
00:43:17,355 --> 00:43:21,667
Did anybody think to pull some prints
off this water bottle?

402
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:24,191
Can l get an evidence bag?

403
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,313
That's an honest mistake.

404
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:36,509
evidence so I thought it was...

405
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,866
Hey, T.J., go solve the case
somewhere else.

406
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:42,106
Don't give me orders,
l'm your partner!

407
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,545
No, l partner with real cops.

408
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,992
-Get me a copy of that report.
-All right, Mitch.

409
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:51,465
Well, l am your partner,
so you better accept that.

410
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,034
l am your partner!

411
00:43:55,675 --> 00:44:00,624
He won't open up. You know how hard
it is to work with somebody like that?

412
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:05,710
l know. Mitch has been a lot
more resistant than l'd hoped for.

413
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:09,271
l think that you and Mitch
need some bonding time.

414
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:11,353
You're right. We do.

415
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:16,470
We need some QT time together.
Two guys hanging out, have some beers.

416
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:19,547
l'll call to see
if he wants to hang out.

417
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:23,432
Let's not call him.
Let's just go over.

418
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:26,030
-Just show up?
-Surprise him.

419
00:44:28,595 --> 00:44:30,108
What are you doing?

420
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,950
How hard is it to say,
''Hi, Trey, nice to see you''?

421
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:36,305
Hi, Trey. What are you doing here?

422
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:39,473
We got off on the wrong foot.
l got some food.

423
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:42,508
We can eat the food and bond a bit.

424
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:44,952
-Bond?
-Yeah.

425
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,231
How'd you get my address?

426
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:50,464
-Hi, Mitch.
-Oh, shit.

427
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:55,706
-Do I have to?

428
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:02,268
l gotta see where my star cop lives.

429
00:45:02,435 --> 00:45:04,027
Come on, Mitch.

430
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:08,273
-Oh, my God.
-Mitch. . . !

431
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:16,514
Got a little smell to it.
Not a stinky smell, an odd one.

432
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,909
What is that smell?

433
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:20,543
ls this here your actual living area?

434
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:30,067
What's the problem?

435
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:40,467
Like a trailer on the beach or
a loft downtown. That kind of thing.

436
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:44,025
Your research shows that, huh?
Where does he live?

437
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:47,348
l rent a guesthouse from a producer.

438
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:50,268
-Kind of gives off a Magnum vibe.
-Totally.

439
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:54,309
lt's unique. You know what, Mitch?
We can make this work.

440
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,910
Did a crackhead make this cup?

441
00:45:57,915 --> 00:46:01,828
-No. It's just.

442
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:07,264
The point is to let the audience
in on all aspects of your life.

443
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:19,434
Mitch, l think you need some time
away from the job.

444
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:22,434
l just found the crackhead's shop.

445
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:24,547
Hey, don't go in there.

446
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,593
This is what you smell
all over the place.

447
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:30,872
Wow, a pottery studio!

448
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:34,425
You're full of surprises.
How long you been doing this?

449
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:38,634
-Six years, give or take.
-You really got a knack for it.

450
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,593
This room's off-limits.
lt's not for show.

451
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:43,990
Okay, Mitch.

452
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:50,069
Bond with yourself, l got work to do.

453
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,304
Check this out.

454
00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:59,273
Must be some Hollywood dickhead.

455
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:53,783
-Not bad, huh?
-A cop never slides across the hood.

456
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:58,944
-Why? lt's not police procedure?
-Your holster scratches the paint.

457
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:10,190
They can buff that shit out.

458
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:13,393
-l'm trying for detective.
-You take the exam?

459
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:16,467
-Twice.
-And you think you won't fail again?

460
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:18,751
Now l'm working with Mitch Preston.

461
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:23,585
Give me some tips, and l'll tip you
on how to look better on camera.

462
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:28,391
-Tips like what?
-You wear plaids, like fishermen.

463
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:32,514
That's ugly shit. Wear solids.
You look slimmer on camera.

464
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:35,793
-l'll keep that in mind.
-Got any tips for me?

465
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:39,391
Yeah, stay out of my way
and l won't shoot you.

466
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:43,352
What the hell's going on?

467
00:49:43,555 --> 00:49:48,185
Welcome to America's window
on your world.

468
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:50,144
What is this?

469
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:54,149
-We made your workspace camera-ready.
-My workspace?

470
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:58,587
l think it captures the reality
of an inner-city precinct.

471
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:10,063
-Look at your desk. lt's so beautiful.
-ls this my desk?

472
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:14,507
Mitch. We didn't change it.

473
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:18,071
But this is a confessional. All right?

474
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:20,271
Talk about anything you want.

475
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:27,632
. . .your sex lives. l mean,
only if you want to. Direct to camera.

476
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:31,794
-No, thanks.
-You could put a pottery wheel there.

477
00:50:32,035 --> 00:50:35,266
Look, Mitch, this is an integral
part of the show.

478
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:43,273
We've provided a chair.
All you have to do is sit and share.

479
00:50:43,435 --> 00:50:46,393
-Share?
-Learn how to turn on your heart light.

480
00:50:46,595 --> 00:50:48,187
-Exactly.
-Chase!

481
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,863
Brad loves the promo footage.

482
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:58,190
You need a catch phrase? l got it.

483
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:03,508
-When l'm about to make a bust--
-When did you ever make a bust?

484
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:09,349
to get in the moment...

485
00:51:09,515 --> 00:51:15,112
. . .l take three deep breaths and say to
myself, ''Okay, Trey, it's showtime! ''

486
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:17,545
-You say that?
-That's stupid.

487
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:19,751
-What's stupid about it?
-Know what?

488
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:21,985
Don't say it, please.

489
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:25,704
No, l have to say it, Mitch.
''Showtime. '' lt's amazing.

490
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:34,026
Say it again for the camera.

491
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:38,786
My God, you're a natural!

492
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:41,304
lt's showtime!

493
00:51:55,595 --> 00:52:00,828
This is Harley Barley taking calls
from fans of the new series Showtime.

494
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,823
Let's go to Pete from Idaho.
You're on the air.

495
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:11,864
I mean, I got a lot of anger
inside me too.

496
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:19,064
Thank you, Pete.
You sure you're not calling from Waco?

497
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:22,033
Let's go to line three.
Mandy, you're on.

498
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:27,832
I'm your biggest fan. Trey is so fine.

499
00:52:28,035 --> 00:52:29,946
-I could ride that.
-What?

500
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:31,747
Thank you, Mandy.

501
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:45,825
Marry me, Trey!

502
00:52:47,955 --> 00:52:50,230
I'm gonna be honest, you know.

503
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:59,150
... to think about what it might be
like to have a different partner.

504
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:08,908
Charismatic, with a little flair
and shit.

505
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,709
You kicking it with him,
have some fun.

506
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:18,147
Me and a Wesley Snipes type.
I know you won 't get Wesley.

507
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:21,153
I see Wesley Snipes types
all the time.

508
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:24,313
Me and a Wesley Snipes type?

509
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:26,471
Can you imagine?

510
00:53:27,555 --> 00:53:28,783
Wesley Snipes type?

511
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:43,309
Basically, I'm saying the whole show
is slowed down just a half a beat...

512
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:47,992
-I'm too old for this shit.
-...so Mitch can keep up.

513
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:51,471
Because I'm working out.
I do free-weights.

514
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:53,114
Go ahead. Make my day.

515
00:53:53,395 --> 00:53:56,068
I'm taking care of mine. Mitch is not.

516
00:53:58,075 --> 00:54:01,545
That's it. I'm taking care of mine
and Mitch is not.

517
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:04,872
Trey, look at this. lt's all for you.

518
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,793
Five minutes up yet?

519
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:50,354
It's showtime!

520
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:15,515
What are you looking at that for,
Magnum?

521
00:55:18,312 --> 00:55:22,464
-How come we're not talking to him?
-Because he's sitting in county.

522
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,301
Forget it. l put him there.

523
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:34,469
He won't talk to me. l already tried.

524
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,747
He'll talk to me.

525
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:39,506
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

526
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,351
l won't go in like a bulldog like you.

527
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:45,982
-l'll talk. l'll be in character.
-ln character!

528
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:49,704
That's great.
You mean, like undercover?

529
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:55,111
A little finesse, catch him off guard,
have him think l'm someone else.

530
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:00,826
l don't know.

531
00:56:04,192 --> 00:56:09,107
ReRun! How you doing, my man? l'm Trey
Sellars from the Justice Channel.

532
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:13,191
-Have a seat, please. You being strong?
-Yeah.

533
00:56:13,392 --> 00:56:18,102
-Thanks for coming. You okay?
-I ain 't heard of no Justice Channel.

534
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:22,749
That's because we got started
while you was rotting away in here.

535
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:27,583
The Justice Channel is devoted to
shining the light on victims like you.

536
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:31,984
-He's got talent, Mitch, come on.
-We're wasting our time.

537
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:34,702
ls that a new shirt?

538
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:37,432
lt looks good. l like you in solids.

539
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:45,912
Not me, brother, the TV show.
l'm hosting a show called Framed.

540
00:56:46,232 --> 00:56:49,622
Let me tell you about the show.
We spotlight you.

541
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:53,745
Put a light on your situation.
Let the people see you.

542
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,264
campatgn started and get you out.

543
00:56:58,472 --> 00:57:01,430
l got three people out.
You can be number four.

544
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:05,471
-Like Mandela.
-Similar. You ain't as noble.

545
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:08,783
You ain't no Nelson. You're ReRun.

546
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:13,901
Mandela's shit stink too.

547
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:16,188
Trey, l'll talk you through this.

548
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,070
-Not so loud.
-Say what?

549
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:23,670
You don't have to talk too loud.

550
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:30,111
That's the wrong thing you can do.
Let me explain something.

551
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:33,582
Research has shown people
don't want to hear lawyers.

552
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:36,869
They want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

553
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,830
l got Johnnie Cochran.
No offense, bro.

554
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:43,308
I'm now trying to get.

555
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:46,384
l'm trying to get people
to connect with you.

556
00:57:52,872 --> 00:57:56,660
Ain't no cops here.
Just me and you. Brother to brother.

557
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:02,265
Take it slow. Nice and easy.
He's still on the fence.

558
00:58:03,072 --> 00:58:07,190
All right! You and Lazy Boy
got this gun from somebody!

559
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:10,708
You work for the same person!
Who you working for?

560
00:58:10,872 --> 00:58:14,103
What the hell?
What kind of reporter are you?

561
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:17,264
-l don't tiptoe around the truth!
-Back off.

562
00:58:17,472 --> 00:58:21,829
And l will not back off
until l find out the truth!

563
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:28,511
You say ''ass'' on TV?

564
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:31,670
This is cable.
l can say whatever l want to.

565
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,902
Did they tell you plea-bargain?

566
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:38,187
That's what was said, isn't it?

567
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:40,947
Yeah.

568
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,302
See if you can get a name.

569
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:45,905
It's time, ReRun.

570
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:54,786
Whose time are you doing?

571
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,785
While you're in here
he's smelling freedom.

572
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:04,145
-Ass.
-Ass and feet, and tension and stress.

573
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:08,669
Hey, brother, that ain't for you.
Look in that camera right now.

574
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:15,666
here instead of you.

575
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,869
Look in the camera and say it.
I'm with you.

576
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:21,263
l'm right here with you.

577
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,543
All the people out there in TV land. . .

578
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:32,226
-Your baby be home soon, Mama.
-Yes.

579
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:33,586
The culprit...

580
00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:35,344
You'll see Mama soon.

581
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:39,750
... that put me on the streets
to do his dirty work...

582
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:42,346
. . .that's shitting on my freedom. . .

583
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:46,102
. . .is none other. . .

584
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:48,747
This is an emotional moment.

585
00:59:58,152 --> 01:00:00,029
... than Vargas!

586
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,871
Caesar Vargas!

587
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:04,547
He said it!

588
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:07,868
Hope you're watching, bitch.

589
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:10,626
-Shit.
-You did the right thing, brother.

590
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,145
Find out where he is.

591
01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:16,027
-You going down, baby.
-You made a connection.

592
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:20,185
When the people see this,
they'll get rallied up. l can tell.

593
01:00:20,392 --> 01:00:23,623
Now, where would a guy
like Vargas kick it?

594
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:27,590
-You trying to get a brother killed--
-Not at all.

595
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:31,023
l do this for the viewers.
We don't point fingers.

596
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:36,061
We'll say, ''lf you don't want to run
into Vargas don't go to this place. ''

597
01:00:36,272 --> 01:00:42,268
Hanging out with him, you wind up
in this place. That's how you got here.

598
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:49,263
Think about the babies, the children.
Save the babies, brother.

599
01:00:50,072 --> 01:00:51,664
People...

600
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:56,184
...and children in TV land and all
the little kids around the world...

601
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,229
. . .don't be like me.

602
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:01,589
And if you want to stay
out of harm's way. . .

603
01:01:04,512 --> 01:01:08,027
. . .don't go to Club Cuba Loca
on Figueroa.

604
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:12,981
He's just lucky.

605
01:01:13,192 --> 01:01:17,026
Brother, you did the right thing.
Don't you feel good?

606
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:20,385
-We connected.
-A weight off my shoulders.

607
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:23,350
You going down, bitch.
l got backup now.

608
01:01:23,872 --> 01:01:25,669
Hey, that's a wrap.

609
01:01:26,312 --> 01:01:28,462
Yeah! Come on, Mitch.

610
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:35,906
l was born in a corn field,
Grandma was a stripper--

611
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:39,866
Save all that for when you do
The Oprah Winfrey Show.

612
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,222
Yo, we going to the club tonight.

613
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:15,828
ls the mike on?
Can you turn the mike up?

614
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:25,266
Sorry to bother everybody.
ls Mr. Vargas here?

615
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:30,309
Anybody know where Mr. Vargas is?
Mr. Vargas?

616
01:02:30,472 --> 01:02:32,781
There he is.
See how easy that was?

617
01:02:32,952 --> 01:02:35,227
Don't get up, we'll come to you.

618
01:02:35,592 --> 01:02:37,310
Sorry. Go on back. . .

619
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:45,104
Sorry, l always wanted to do that.
Be right with you, Mr. Vargas.

620
01:02:50,072 --> 01:02:51,551
lnteresting approach.

621
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:54,829
Just doing my part.
He's over this way.

622
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:09,028
-Yeah, I tokd you.

623
01:03:18,072 --> 01:03:19,824
-Mr. Vargas?
-Yes.

624
01:03:20,032 --> 01:03:24,662
I'd like to ask you some questions.

625
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:37,705
-Who's he?
-One of your employees. You know that.

626
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:41,747
I don't know this guy.

627
01:03:47,512 --> 01:03:49,423
What's his name?

628
01:03:56,312 --> 01:04:00,783
. . .probably big enough to go through
those bulletproof vests you wear.

629
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:03,707
Am l right?

630
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:10,547
And you are. . .?

631
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:14,990
You can't miss me. l'm across
the street on the billboard.

632
01:04:16,672 --> 01:04:18,264
You are the TV cops.

633
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:20,783
Right.

634
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:22,784
What's your line again?

635
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,391
''lt's showtime! ''

636
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:27,341
lt's showtime!

637
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,270
l told you it was good.

638
01:04:30,472 --> 01:04:32,906
See how funny this is
once we arrest you.

639
01:04:34,712 --> 01:04:37,749
What'll you do?
Try me in The People's Court?

640
01:04:37,912 --> 01:04:41,666
We're gonna be watching
your punk ass 24-7, slick.

641
01:04:43,872 --> 01:04:46,227
Are you going to arrest me?

642
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:51,583
Or I have to call the real cops.

643
01:04:51,752 --> 01:04:54,710
-Hey, we are the real cops.
-Sure you are.

644
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:58,501
I think you're a joke.

645
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:08,191
Not this time, but next time
l'll drag you out of here in cuffs.

646
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:11,389
You see, l told you.

647
01:05:11,592 --> 01:05:13,787
They are a joke.

648
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:15,181
Right?

649
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:28,069
-lt's a joke. lt's a Showtime joke.
-Showtime.

650
01:05:37,352 --> 01:05:38,910
That's great TV!

651
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:52,864
We can take this car and meet girls
who wouldn't normally look at us.

652
01:05:57,832 --> 01:06:02,383
-Why don't you stop the car?
-All right, l'll leave you alone.

653
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:13,145
-What's this, your picture and resume?
-Those are my 8-by-1 0s.

654
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:14,751
l just want to look.

655
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:19,826
l've never. . .

656
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:21,943
. . .never met a. . .

657
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,586
. . .mime. ls that it? Mime?

658
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,629
Yeah, l'm a mime. l mime.

659
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:30,707
l'm curious about these movies:
Beach Party Bonzo?

660
01:06:36,072 --> 01:06:39,348
Planet Gorthon, 3 1 A.D. ?

661
01:06:40,112 --> 01:06:43,991
Kind of light porn,
but l don't even want to go into it.

662
01:06:44,472 --> 01:06:47,509
You try out for the Village People?

663
01:06:57,712 --> 01:07:01,261
-lf l tell you, will you drop it?
-Please tell me.

664
01:07:01,432 --> 01:07:06,381
My marriage counselor. My ex and l were
on the rocks. He said get a hobby.

665
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:08,469
-And that's it?
-That's it.

666
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:17,785
-Can l ask you something?
-Yeah.

667
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:20,466
Why'd you become a cop, anyway?

668
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:25,343
You mean you were a better mime?

669
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:30,825
Would you like to see my skills?

670
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:32,989
l got the car. Don't worry.

671
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:40,748
You can mime words too. Watch.

672
01:07:40,952 --> 01:07:43,512
-Fuck you.
-Okay.

673
01:07:43,912 --> 01:07:45,982
l'm impressed.

674
01:07:46,912 --> 01:07:49,142
There's a glass wall here.

675
01:07:56,792 --> 01:07:58,066
Thanks for the ride.

676
01:08:15,432 --> 01:08:16,785
Surprise!

677
01:08:16,952 --> 01:08:18,305
What did you do?

678
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:20,781
-You don't like it?
-No, l don't.

679
01:08:21,872 --> 01:08:24,830
Tell Don Johnson
we found his apartment.

680
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:28,866
l don't know what you were thinking.
l want it back. Now!

681
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:31,188
Okay, Mitch. Just relax, okay?

682
01:08:31,392 --> 01:08:35,180
We didn't touch the pottery.
We're giving you sex appeal.

683
01:08:40,592 --> 01:08:41,741
Just stop.

684
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:45,262
without my permission.

685
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:48,629
You don't have the right.
Get this dog out.

686
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:50,865
Powder's yours.

687
01:08:57,072 --> 01:08:58,630
He looks like an addict.

688
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,545
Want me to be sympathetic?
Put my stuff back.

689
01:09:06,712 --> 01:09:09,829
l'll be sympathetic.
Until then, l won't be.

690
01:09:10,832 --> 01:09:13,904
How can you say no to that face,
Mitch?

691
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:18,230
l can say no very easily.
No, Powder. Get out.

692
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,950
Don't be like that.

693
01:09:20,152 --> 01:09:21,426
lt's just a dog, man.

694
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:24,146
Come here, Powder.
You're a good boy.

695
01:09:26,432 --> 01:09:27,547
Shit!

696
01:09:27,752 --> 01:09:30,391
Maybe Mitch is right.
Get rid of the dog.

697
01:09:33,272 --> 01:09:34,910
Watch your ass, Powder.

698
01:09:56,312 --> 01:09:57,904
Okay. Move it.

699
01:10:06,992 --> 01:10:09,426
Dispatch, this is Armor 323--

700
01:11:05,272 --> 01:11:08,070
This is Showtime One.
We're on it.

701
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:23,020
Okay.

702
01:11:23,232 --> 01:11:26,110
Annie, get the dish up.
Julio, go!

703
01:11:35,192 --> 01:11:37,023
That's definitely our gun.

704
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:39,461
Watch it!

705
01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:19,507
Hey! Hey!

706
01:12:22,552 --> 01:12:25,191
-Let's go!
-Move it!

707
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,464
Damn! We lost picture!

708
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:49,271
Slow down!

709
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:26,866
There he is!

710
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:28,226
l got him!

711
01:14:48,392 --> 01:14:50,462
-You getting this?
-Yeah!

712
01:14:54,432 --> 01:14:55,831
Jump!

713
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,266
Jump! Jump!

714
01:14:58,072 --> 01:15:00,267
You gotta jump! Now!

715
01:15:00,472 --> 01:15:01,985
-Come on, Mitch!
-Do it!

716
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,860
Now that was some good hood-jumping!

717
01:15:23,272 --> 01:15:24,944
You all right?

718
01:15:25,152 --> 01:15:26,551
You okay?

719
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:28,987
l think two drops of pee came out.

720
01:15:34,192 --> 01:15:37,821
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

721
01:15:50,152 --> 01:15:52,302
And we're screwed.

722
01:15:53,112 --> 01:15:56,070
See you back on the tape, Top Cop.

723
01:15:59,672 --> 01:16:03,028
Being a police officer is not
what you see on TV!

724
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:08,985
Your showboating
put this city at risk.

725
01:16:09,192 --> 01:16:11,422
l expect that of Trey, not you.

726
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:13,748
lt just escalated.

727
01:16:13,912 --> 01:16:18,542
Chief is pulling the plug on the show.

728
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,351
-What?
-PR is having a heart attack.

729
01:16:33,272 --> 01:16:37,663
You blew it. l'm relieving you of
duty, pending an investigation.

730
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:42,822
What, do you want me to turn in
my gun and my badge? Ben, come on.

731
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:46,661
l just want you to go home
till this shitstorm settles.

732
01:16:52,632 --> 01:16:55,146
Do your pottery projects.

733
01:17:02,072 --> 01:17:03,346
What?

734
01:17:04,472 --> 01:17:06,622
He's touching the pecker-cam.

735
01:17:08,032 --> 01:17:09,909
There's a lens in those eyes.

736
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,061
My woodpecker?

737
01:17:11,272 --> 01:17:13,627
-Don't break it.
-I said no cameras.

738
01:17:21,472 --> 01:17:22,621
He broke it.

739
01:17:25,632 --> 01:17:27,350
l'll get you another one.

740
01:17:27,552 --> 01:17:30,942
Talk to him. He's got issues.
He hates cameras.

741
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:51,865
-We're here to take the dog.
-The dog stays.

742
01:17:52,192 --> 01:17:54,342
-We have orders.
-He's an officer.

743
01:17:54,512 --> 01:17:57,310
Touch him and l'll shoot you.

744
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:03,831
Go, go, go.

745
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,951
Good boy, Powder. Good boy.

746
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:18,061
on my head. Check it.

747
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:20,621
You're Nick Load, and l'm John Lock.

748
01:18:20,832 --> 01:18:23,027
-Nick who?
-Nick Load.

749
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:27,510
You're Nick Load. l'm John Lock.
Together, we're Lock and Load.

750
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:40,069
. . .before he hit big with ER.
So you see?

751
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:44,628
l don't wanna be the guy
putting up the caution tape.

752
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:47,027
l was feeling this detective thing.

753
01:18:47,192 --> 01:18:50,867
Listen, you have heat
on your acting career right now.

754
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:55,184
lf you don't strike while the iron
is hot, it'll pass you by.

755
01:18:56,152 --> 01:19:00,907
Whatever. l'm gonna go see
this last episode of Showtime.

756
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:11,341
You had your food. None for you.

757
01:19:12,632 --> 01:19:16,307
You're off the show, Sellars.
You're busted to patrol.

758
01:19:16,472 --> 01:19:19,544
-What happens to Mitch?
-He's relieved of duty.

759
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:23,711
Mitch is my partner.
He's the only person I can depend on.

760
01:19:23,912 --> 01:19:26,904
Not my family, not my friends.
Just him.

761
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:30,707
That's beautiful, Sellars.
What do you want me to do?

762
01:19:30,872 --> 01:19:35,821
-If he's relieved, I should be.
-If you want it, you're relieved too.

763
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:37,306
Okay.

764
01:19:38,432 --> 01:19:41,071
-I'm relieved, then.
-Okay.

765
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:45,991
All right.

766
01:19:58,272 --> 01:20:02,026
-Who is this?
-lt's me, Mitch.

767
01:20:08,952 --> 01:20:12,388
-New day, new way.
-Me too. l'm eating a TV dinner.

768
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:17,746
-So what's up?
-l just, you know. . . .

769
01:20:17,912 --> 01:20:20,301
l wanted to tell you that. . .

770
01:20:21,112 --> 01:20:25,105
. . .what you did was a pretty
standup thing and. . .

771
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:31,587
Whatever questions, l'll be around.

772
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:35,580
-l'd make a great detective?
-You'd make an okay detective.

773
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:40,980
No. Quick question.

774
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:49,542
-You gotta be kidding.
-Relax. l'm just joking, man.

775
01:20:49,752 --> 01:20:51,629
No, something on the show.

776
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:54,392
-So you are watching the show.
-Yeah.

777
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:58,870
-Me too. What did you see?
-Charlie Hertz, works for ballistics.

778
01:20:59,072 --> 01:21:03,668
-That guy outside Lazy Boy's.
-Yeah, but l gotta see it again.

779
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:07,023
Don't worry, l'm recording it.
l record them all.

780
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:10,668
-Why am l not surprised?
-Let me rewind this thing.

781
01:21:14,832 --> 01:21:16,823
-lt is Charlie Hertz.
-lt is?

782
01:21:17,032 --> 01:21:20,229
-lt's definitely him.
-What's he doing with Vargas?

783
01:21:44,072 --> 01:21:45,710
Where are the lights?

784
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:53,351
We definitely found our gunmaker.

785
01:21:54,192 --> 01:21:56,342
This is definitely his workshop.

786
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,784
Look at all this shit.

787
01:21:59,472 --> 01:22:03,260
What happened to the days
when people just grew pot?

788
01:22:07,032 --> 01:22:09,182
King Rental Trucks,
may I help you?

789
01:22:12,072 --> 01:22:15,189
You mean the Mitch Preston?
The one on Showtime?

790
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:17,547
-That's me.
-Oh, my God!

791
01:22:17,952 --> 01:22:22,423
Calm down, we just need some
information about a truck.

792
01:22:27,032 --> 01:22:29,671
Mr. Hertz picked one up this morning.

793
01:22:29,872 --> 01:22:33,945
-Was there a tracking device on it?
-Yes, Mitch, there was.

794
01:22:34,872 --> 01:22:37,227
Is Trey with you?
Can I speak to him?

795
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:38,865
Sure, here.

796
01:22:39,032 --> 01:22:41,421
-Trey? This Trey?
-Yeah.

797
01:22:41,632 --> 01:22:43,827
I love you, baby!
Say, ''Showtime. ''

798
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,267
lt's showtime!
This bitch is crazy.

799
01:22:46,472 --> 01:22:50,511
Okay, all right. Bye-bye.
See how popular l am?

800
01:22:53,712 --> 01:22:54,861
All right, thanks.

801
01:22:55,032 --> 01:22:57,751
We got a hit on the truck
at the Bonaventure.

802
01:22:57,952 --> 01:22:59,863
-What's going on?
-Gun show.

803
01:23:16,752 --> 01:23:18,708
Nice guns.

804
01:23:18,872 --> 01:23:20,624
Come on back.

805
01:23:21,512 --> 01:23:22,786
lt's okay.

806
01:23:47,432 --> 01:23:49,821
-Thanks for the call.
-Find that footage?

807
01:23:52,472 --> 01:23:53,905
You went out on a limb.

808
01:24:05,752 --> 01:24:07,185
Excuse me.

809
01:24:07,832 --> 01:24:09,106
Hello, gun lovers.

810
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:13,908
My name is Chase Renzi
from the hit series Showtime.

811
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:21,192
l'm here because we need your help.

812
01:24:21,392 --> 01:24:24,543
We believe these two men
are in the building.

813
01:24:24,752 --> 01:24:28,267
They are armed
and extremely dangerous.

814
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:30,105
What the hell?

815
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:32,351
There they are!

816
01:24:39,632 --> 01:24:40,781
Vargas!

817
01:24:56,752 --> 01:24:57,741
Don't move.

818
01:25:04,152 --> 01:25:06,382
Oh, shit!

819
01:25:11,392 --> 01:25:12,541
Mitch!

820
01:25:22,832 --> 01:25:23,947
Guys, wait up!

821
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:32,629
Why don't l go up and
make a nice list of demands?

822
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:34,385
l can help you here.

823
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:57,263
-Get in!
-Just take it easy, all right? Easy!

824
01:26:04,232 --> 01:26:06,143
Vargas? There's no way out.

825
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:13,943
All right. But first, slide your
weapons in here.

826
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:18,864
Slide your weapons in here.

827
01:26:19,032 --> 01:26:21,102
-What?
-What'd you say?

828
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:25,305
Slide in your weapons.

829
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:31,271
Hold on. l gotta change the tape.

830
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:37,750
-You thinking what l'm thinking?
-Yeah, l am.

831
01:26:40,352 --> 01:26:43,230
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

832
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:44,467
Mitch, no.

833
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:49,263
Don't do that. Man!

834
01:26:50,432 --> 01:26:51,751
l've got demands.

835
01:26:55,832 --> 01:27:00,303
We have a cameraman out here so
you can tell the world what you want.

836
01:27:01,472 --> 01:27:04,782
Okay. Throw in your weapons.

837
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:06,908
Here they come.

838
01:27:17,392 --> 01:27:18,381
Ready?

839
01:27:24,152 --> 01:27:25,744
-Stay there.
-Easy.

840
01:27:28,632 --> 01:27:31,271
-Where's the cameraman?
-He's afraid.

841
01:27:31,472 --> 01:27:35,181
so he'll do the shooting.

842
01:27:35,352 --> 01:27:36,467
l'll do it.

843
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:39,146
You ever been on TV before?

844
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:43,068
lt's very simple.
Look at the red light.

845
01:27:43,272 --> 01:27:46,070
Tell the people what's on your mind.

846
01:27:47,192 --> 01:27:49,103
You got him all lined up?

847
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,467
Yeah. Let's shoot.

848
01:28:36,472 --> 01:28:38,030
Mitch?

849
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:58,786
-Trey! Where are you?
-Over here!

850
01:29:02,632 --> 01:29:05,100
-What are you doing?
-Hold on!

851
01:29:10,472 --> 01:29:11,746
Oh, God!

852
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:28,504
Now it's your turn to smile
for the cameras.

853
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:36,665
-Get that camera out of here!
-Keep that camera where it is!

854
01:29:53,032 --> 01:29:56,149
Annie, you deal with it, girl.

855
01:29:57,032 --> 01:30:00,263
What's going on
with your new recruits?

856
01:30:03,672 --> 01:30:07,221
-They're not bonding.
-They don't have our chemistry.

857
01:30:07,432 --> 01:30:11,983
Which is why you ought
to guest star in the next episode.

858
01:30:12,152 --> 01:30:14,382
-Not in a million years.
-That's a yes.

859
01:30:14,592 --> 01:30:17,345
l know, and believe me,
l'm working on him.

860
01:30:19,752 --> 01:30:21,265

For passing the detective exam.

That is nice of you to do that.

863
01:30:37,352 --> 01:30:39,707
Mitch, that's nice.

864
01:30:40,912 --> 01:30:42,550
What is that?

865
01:30:42,832 --> 01:30:47,826
-What is it? lt's a loose change dish.
-Of course it's a loose change dish.

866
01:30:47,992 --> 01:30:51,826
l haven't seen this level of
craftsmanship since kindergarten.

867
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:58,224
-Detectives, your suspect's waiting.
-Be right with you.

868
01:30:58,392 --> 01:31:01,589

lt has a nice ring to it.

He doesn't have any balls.

876
01:31:27,392 --> 01:31:28,950
Well, he has balls.

877
01:31:32,472 --> 01:31:34,269
