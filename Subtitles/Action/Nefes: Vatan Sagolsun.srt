1
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:21,200
Karabal, do you read me?
Please come in. This is Falcon!

2
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:25,720
Karabal, please come in,
this is Falcon 1-8.

3
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:30,919
Karabal, do you read me?
This is Falcon 1-8.

4
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,199
This is Falcon 1-8.

5
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,518
Whip 2 listening.

6
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:43,839
Is that your group coming down
from southwest of the station

7
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:48,758
That's correct. We're almost there.
Still no contact.

8
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:52,524
Karabal, Karabal. This is falcon 1-8.

9
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:01,121
Falcon 1-8, this is Tuna.
Did you establish contact with Karabal?

10
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:06,439
We can't establish contact
with the station.

11
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,437
Guys, it is at 11 o'clock.

12
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:15,803
Did you see Karabal hill?

13
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,843
Falcon 1-6 roger.

14
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,004
Falcon 1-4 roger.

15
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,921
Falcon 1-8,
what is the condition of Karabal?

16
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,519
Do you see anything?

17
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:31,155
There's smoke rising from the building,
people lying around

18
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,525
Is someone approaching the station?

19
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:40,645
Tuna, Tuna5. I'm 50m away Commander

20
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:44,678
Tuna 5, report the the situation.
Be careful. Enemy could still be around

21
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:48,120
Secure the area
Commander?

22
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,878
Speak, lieutenant.

23
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,675
Commander, here...

24
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,758
Lieutenant what happened to Karabal?

25
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,443
1993 Southeast

26
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:03,600
Have you ever been in love, Commander?

27
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:09,161
Yes, I was. Ibrahim.
- Did she laught at you?

28
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:15,597
Karabal Military Base.

29
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:33,520
Ibo, just grab his weapon.

30
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,480
Yes, Sir. Sergeant.

31
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:42,120
Are you asleep?

32
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:44,403
Get up, wake up, Go to bed!

33
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:45,801
Lbo Give me the weapon.

34
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,276
This is not your home.

35
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,244
Leave him with the blanket.

36
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,603
Get up.

37
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:57,039
Kaya1, Kaya1.

38
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:00,399
Kaya copies.
We reached the station Commander.

39
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,838
The second lieutenant is asleep.
Shall I wake him?

40
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,436
No. I'm on my way.

41
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:28,845
Sit down, boy! Sit down!

42
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,120
Good morning.

43
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,442
I am captain of infantry commando,
Mete Horozoglu

44
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:44,159
Turgay Atalay from Kars.
To your command.

45
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,844
Gendarme second lieutenant,
Vedat Dinckaya.

46
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:51,683
Communication Sergeant
Kamil Ates, captain.

47
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:59,320
We were expecting you
tomorrow Commander.

48
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:02,324
We came early, didn't we?

49
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:05,639
Why is that so, Turgay?

50
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,317
Because of you! To support you!

51
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:16,120
We've been informed yesterday
by radio dispatch.

52
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,285
Okan. - Yes, Sir. Commander.

53
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,921
Bring me Dogukan, Doruk
and Cemil right now.

54
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Our condolences

55
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:29,280
You must be hungry.
Shall have something to prepared?

56
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,724
We came to your outpost.

57
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:41,598
Your soldiers were asleep.
We killed them.

58
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,320
Then we entered the station, your room.

59
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,686
You were asleep as well.

60
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:00,359
We killed you too.

61
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:07,202
Do you know the Subasi Plateau?
We came that way.

62
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,997
At the entrance of the plateau
Lieutenant Baris called me...

63
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:14,319
...to come up front.

64
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,720
Because he discovered footprints.

65
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,799
We need to take go through anyway,
I said.

66
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,319
I called Orhan. Told him this.

67
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:33,679
From far away, the sound of Dragunov
sounds like a whistle

68
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:39,600
If you hear it, you're still alive.

69
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:45,880
One of us, Emre from Sivas,
he was at the front.

70
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,320
He couldn't hear it.

71
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,440
It went right in there.

72
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:14,157
I was paralyzed.

73
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:18,800
Turgay pulled me away.

74
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:22,085
Then I came to myself.
Take cover, I just yelled.

75
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,959
Orhan is experienced.
He spoted where the sound comes from

76
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:35,282
He lifted his gun...

77
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,680
A bullet hit his left shoulder.

78
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:49,605
He staggered. Wanted to lift his gun...

79
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,002
Bam!

80
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,247
Orhan!

81
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,116
I screamed Orhan!
To make him get back to us.

82
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,281
He doesn't hear me.

83
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:12,441
He walked to the center of the plateau,
to the snow.

84
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:20,440
I yelled to the Paramedic
a couple of times...

85
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,835
...but he could not raise his head up.

86
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,163
His first combat.

87
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,478
He tried a couple of times
but couldn't.

88
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,685
Which one of us could anyway?

89
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:39,805
Then the third bullet hit him.
Orhan just collapsed.

90
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,724
Roll call in 30 minutes.

91
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:12,440
On the front right part of the skull...

92
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,764
...there is a bullet hole, size 1 cm.

93
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:20,080
Another one, 5cm in diameter...

94
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,484
...on the back left side of the skull.

95
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,004
At ease, Sedat. At ease.

96
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:44,275
Did you have the chance
to meet the others? - Yes, commander

97
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,961
Establish a connection to the brigade.

98
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,998
What's your name?
- Akan, Sergeant.

99
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,446
And you?
- Utku Duman, Sergeant.

100
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,922
You?
- Cüneyt, Sergeant.

101
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:56,477
How many of you are there on this station?
- 12 men, including all ranks.

102
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,916
Commander we've reached Mt. Karabal.

103
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,998
Copied Kaya. Any problems?

104
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:02,680
No, no problem Commander.

105
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,200
Copied, captain.

106
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,365
The boys already expected us.

107
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,281
You know I trust you a lot.
You are responsible for this.

108
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:13,400
Thank you, Commander. Understood. Over.

109
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,643
Don't worry.
We will take care of Orhan's family.

110
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,840
Don't leave the station except patrols.

111
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,403
May God be on your side.

112
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,923
At ease. Name?

113
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:45,280
Communication Sergeant Kamil Ates,
at your command.

114
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,205
Kamil Ates, you are dead.

115
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,001
Are you married?
- Yes, commander.

116
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:52,124
She's living in the barracks?
- Yes, commander.

117
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:53,680
Give her a call, she needs
to look for another flat.

118
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,804
She won't be able to stay
there anymore. Why?

119
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,318
You are dead!

120
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,716
Are your parents still alive?
- Yes, commander.

121
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,886
Good. We'll send your coffin
to them. You?

122
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,515
Akan Atakan, from Hatay.
At your command Commander.

123
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,524
You are dead! You?

124
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,122
You? - Ömer Çetin Duman from
Bandirma. At your command.

125
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,641
You are dead, Ömer Çetin!

126
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,442
You? - Utku Duman from
Giresun. At your command.

127
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:20,040
To whom you gave your last will document?
- To my father

128
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:25,083
Good, then we'll also
send him your coffin.

129
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:29,241
You? - Melih Korucu, Istanbul.
At your command.

130
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,358
You are dead!

131
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,038
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, commander.

132
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,276
Not anymore.

133
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,035
She'll marry another guy.

134
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,678
Cause you are dead now, boy.

135
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:51,360
Your mother cries her heart out,

136
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,201
the neighbours try to calm her.

137
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,956
They are rubbing her wrists
with cologne.

138
00:11:57,127 --> 00:12:00,324
My son, she's crying...

139
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:04,164
...my one and only!

140
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:12,999
Your father is crying as well,
silently inside, in one corner.

141
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,560
On his lips only one sentence remains:

142
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,236
...long live the Motherland!

143
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,838
Long live our Nation!

144
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:28,920
If I had another son I'd send
him too, cries your mother.

145
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:33,120
Long live Motherland, she says.

146
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:38,240
They ambush the station.

147
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,160
They kill all of you.

148
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:45,680
We'll send your families your corpses.

149
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:50,120
They wash your bullet holes.

150
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:55,080
Wash off the blood.

151
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:59,520
Then they cover your coffin
with the flag.

152
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,441
That's the way they do it, right Turgay?

153
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,484
Like you command, captain.

154
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,325
That's the way.

155
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:09,640
That's the way the man who
meant the most to me died.

156
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:14,443
He died not because he fell
asleep but because he wanted.

157
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,157
They put him in a helicopter
and sent him to his family.

158
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,437
That's what they are
going to do with you guys.

159
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:25,881
You? - Ekin Bulut, Ankara.
At your command,

160
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,640
Who will carry your picture
on your burial?

161
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,004
Do have a sibling?
- Yes, commander.

162
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:34,318
Good, he will carry it then. How old?

163
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,676
30. Commander.

164
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,844
Then your 30 year old brother
will carry your picture...

165
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:42,118
Your 30 year old brother
will carry your coffin...

166
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,716
Does your father smoke?
- No, commander.

167
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:48,641
He'll start because of you.
He will have cancer.

168
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,964
You'll even make it into the TV news.

169
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,839
2 minutes, bullshit! 45 seconds.

170
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:02,722
You'll be heroes for 45 seconds!

171
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,439
A fancy lady will say in a sad tone:

172
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:12,720
Ekin Bulut died a martyr
during station ambush.

173
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,965
45 seconds!

174
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:21,519
After that celebrity news.

175
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,441
Did you fight bravely?

176
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,120
Did you die like that?

177
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:30,724
No, you died because
this guy fell asleep!

178
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,765
Why do your parents cry?

179
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:38,443
Because this man fell asleep.

180
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:43,236
Don't be mad at him.

181
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:46,962
Be mad at yourself. You are a unit.

182
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:50,200
You can't act as individuals.

183
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:54,046
You act for your comrades.

184
00:14:54,127 --> 00:15:00,726
You don't sleep for him to sleep.
You die, so he does not!

185
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,324
You won't just die asleep.
If you sleep, you die.

186
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,320
You all die! If you sleep, you die.

187
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:12,599
If you sleep, you die. You too.
You guys all die.

188
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:16,999
You die, if you fall asleep, Sergeant.

189
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,556
If you fall asleep everybody dies!

190
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:32,124
Look. We are strong, brave and ready!

191
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,760
Ready for what?
- To die in our sleep.

192
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:41,161
You won't sleep! Won't eat!

193
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:44,161
Won't rest!

194
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:48,076
I won't send your corpses,
your coffins...

195
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,601
...to your families!

196
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,957
I forbid you to die.

197
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:57,401
Understood, soldier?
- Yes, Sir!

198
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:03,045
I forgive your friend
to preserve order in the unit.

199
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:10,437
I forgive him, so you can stand guard
side by side until morning.

200
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:19,039
But if I ever catch you
with your pants down...

201
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,802
I'll shoot you by my own hand. I swear.

202
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:27,006
A training accident. That's what
the report is going to say.

203
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:33,475
Understood, soldier?
- Yes Sir, captain!

204
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,284
What is the status of this flag?

205
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,517
The wind here is too strong.

206
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,799
Keeps tearing them apart.

207
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,516
We brought a new one. Change it.

208
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,996
Yes Sir, captain!

209
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,637
How are the boys?

210
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:46,880
Good. They will get over the shock.

211
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:57,000
Every single one of these boys
is different.

212
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:06,046
Their hands, faces, their loves
and fears.

213
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,283
You don't notice them.

214
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:15,840
They don't even know why you can't.

215
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:25,079
They come here, because of you.
To become your heroes.

216
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:30,042
They run and don't know why.

217
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:36,204
We make 'em run so it wil be
easier for them to walk.

218
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:43,321
All their longings are here, their
sadness. Even their home is here

219
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,081
This is their homeland.

220
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:54,680
One goal makes 'em forget everything.

221
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,642
They celebrate like they fight.

222
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:05,396
They dance but in a reserved way.
They are men.

223
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,198
They laugh.

224
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,762
What's going on here?
- A hand grenade exploded.

225
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,721
I just came from watch, captain.

226
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,199
I tried to adjust the pin to the grenade.
It slid out of my hand

227
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,559
I threw it in the toilet.

228
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:40,724
Why the hell is the hand grenade
in the toilet and the pin in your hand

229
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:46,399
They make mistakes, but never lie.
- Have you ever been in love?

230
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,917
A long time ago.
- You're not in love right now?

231
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:53,444
They fall in love.
- While I am on watch at night

232
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,675
...you light my nights like moonlight
- lf you write poems, you'll fall in love

233
00:19:57,767 --> 00:20:00,281
When you emboss my dreams,
I can't sleep in these mountains

234
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:06,005
They express their feelings
through poems.

235
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,277
You need to be able to express
your feelings.

236
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,403
One a Kurd, the other a painter
and the third a poet.

237
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm a Kurd too!
- Me too.

238
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,481
And you are the guys to watch my back?

239
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,075
They come from the most
different places.

240
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:20,085
Tunceli, Eskisehir. Adana, Istanbul.

241
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:25,522
They don't understand each
other. Here they learn.

242
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,526
Enjoy your meal, comrades!
- Thank you.

243
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:32,123
His code name is Doctor. Real name Riza.

244
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:37,961
An unknown enemy is coming their way.
You know, the doctor was a student in med school

245
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:42,160
That's all. Departure at 6 am.
Get some rest.

246
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:47,795
They leave to face their enemy.
- Tomorrow we leave on duty

247
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:52,685
Snow is falling silently. - Where are we
heading to, commander? - You'll see, when we get there

248
00:20:53,247 --> 00:21:00,756
What will happen to the commando?
Tonight we're in combat

249
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:05,962
Shoot, platoon, shoot!
Shoot, platoon, shoot!

250
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:09,886
They get graded after the degree
of injury of the patient:

251
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:11,883
1. wounded lightly.

252
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:14,441
2. Patient in need of
medical hospital care.

253
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:18,680
3. Patient in need of operation.
- It's urgent.

254
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:22,524
Right. 4. Patient is fatally wounded.

255
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,803
They are curious about their fate.

256
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:29,239
Will we treat a wounded terrorist?
- Of course.

257
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:35,560
I want to join the mountain mission.
At home nobody cares about me

258
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:39,916
What am I supposed to tell them
when I get back home?

259
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm a good-for-nothing. That's
what my dad keeps telling.

260
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,805
Do me this favor, captain. Let me join.

261
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:56,362
You need to be brave
to join the mission!

262
00:21:56,647 --> 00:22:02,438
This mountain will make a man out of me, commander.
- Take him with you

263
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:11,038
God is almighty.

264
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:28,723
Troop, wake up. Get up!
He's still sleeping! Get up!

265
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:40,363
Pull the pin,
throw the grenade!

266
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,645
They leave their warm beds and
start their march to the mountains

267
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:57,001
Snow on my head. Snow on my head.

268
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:02,203
Winds are wild. Winds are wild.

269
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:07,801
Lowlands become too narrow.
Lowlands become too narrow

270
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,963
My country. My country...

271
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:18,083
...are the mountains, the mountains.

272
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:23,721
...are the mountains, the mountains.

273
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:59,440
Fate is looking for its hero
and finds him...

274
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,195
Orhan!

275
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:13,277
I wrote a report, Mr. District Attorney.

276
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,558
Here are the details.

277
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:18,919
Let's type it.

278
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,597
Below the shoulder, left and right side,

279
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:30,877
there's a bullet hole, circ.3 cm.

280
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,762
Attention, Mr. District Attorney.
The ground is slippery.

281
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:18,120
These boys keep walking,
no matter what.

282
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:21,877
These boys carry their hearts
in their hands.

283
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:26,400
Their distance to you grows
as the distance to the peak diminishes

284
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:30,675
Now they can't understand you anymore
and you can't understand them

285
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:06,600
Who's up there? - They are
cleaning the roof,

286
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:14,160
Did you see Orhans new car?
- No.

287
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:21,161
He was crazy about it.
- I know.

288
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:27,437
He could not enjoy it

289
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,125
Life sucks.

290
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:37,438
Come in. You're wife's on the line.
She's waiting.

291
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:43,798
Hello?

292
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:50,277
I hear you. How are you?
- I'm fine, fine. How are you?

293
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:53,002
Do you know when you'll be coming back?

294
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,795
Even if I knew I couldn't tell you.

295
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:59,364
I know. I just wanted to know,
whether you know a date or not -No

296
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,403
Please take good care of
yourself. - Of course, darling.

297
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:07,603
Commander, Tell your wife, waiting is useless.
She won't see you again

298
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:11,119
Zeynep, hang up there is
interference -I don't understand.

299
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:14,957
The line is no good, hang up.
I 'll call later. Hang up.

300
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:17,599
Speak, while you still can, Kaya.

301
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:19,683
Do you listen asshole?

302
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,520
What's up?

303
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,201
Doesn't Commander Tuna allow
you to leave the station?

304
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,279
Don't be such afraid.

305
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,523
Why could not you become a man?

306
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,997
Instead of living like a wild hog
in the mountains

307
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,245
you should have graduated
university and went back to

308
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:38,800
Your cheap propaganda slogans
won't work, captain.

309
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:40,760
Am I not right?

310
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:45,917
Instead of going to your university,
I rather hang out in my mountains

311
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:48,641
Why so angry, Doctor? We're just
having a nice chat.

312
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,800
No worries, captain.

313
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,040
At the end you'll die like an animal.

314
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,405
Wolves and vultures will feast
on your corpse.

315
00:28:56,847 --> 00:29:01,159
Screw you, captain.
- Screw you too, pig.

316
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:08,206
The guys who didn't sign their last
will... - Here Cemil,

317
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,487
and Dogukan, Polat too.

318
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,798
Ibrahim, Resul and you.

319
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,602
Muharrem. - I did sign it,
Sergeant. - What? - I signed it

320
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,642
Write! In the case of my death...

321
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,925
God Forbid.

322
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:27,045
...I pass on my individual rights...

323
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,797
What means individual?
- The rights you own,

324
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:32,880
currently being a soldier.

325
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:37,760
Which means?
- To make it short:

326
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:42,242
If we die a martyr, the government will pay reparation.
- How much?

327
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:47,080
I guess a lot.
- Dogukan whose name will you write?

328
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:53,922
I've got no one to insert here.
- Whose name did you write?

329
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:56,158
My mom. I have a mom but
my father takes everything.

330
00:29:56,207 --> 00:30:00,200
Then I'll write my mother's name
in my last will.

331
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:06,725
Whatever, then write your father's
name down. At least there's a name there

332
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:11,438
If anybody wants to donate his
organs, write it down also.

333
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,156
Organ donation?
- Yes donation lbo

334
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:16,557
How's that supposed to work?
Is that an order?

335
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:20,323
No, I won't donate nothing.
That just won't work.

336
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:24,395
Why not?
- Won't my heart die when I die?

337
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:29,397
No it won't. They cut it out,
put it into a box...

338
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,485
...and take it to the hospital.
And you do something good.

339
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:36,043
It's an easy thing to say, but you
incur the sin of these boys

340
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,205
Do you think that's a good thing
to do? - I don't incur the sin of anyone

341
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,923
Suppose they die, shall they
enter the afterlife...

342
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,916
...without arms and legs,
even without a heart?

343
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:46,163
He's right. If we die tomorrow...

344
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:50,521
...we enter the afterlife
without our donated organs.

345
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,962
That's the word of God,
that's how its written down.

346
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,205
God Forbid, if we step on a landmine...

347
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:59,963
...and our arm or leg is shattered,
what then?

348
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:02,482
Then you're a martyr and
you'll go straight to heaven.

349
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:07,038
Your place will be directly
below the prophets.

350
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:11,037
There no one will ask you
about your missing organs.

351
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:15,959
But you just said it. I'm becoming
a martyr if I die here? - Right

352
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:20,361
- So if I'm a martyr anyway
and therefore not accountable in heaven

353
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:24,760
then I'll donate my heart!
- That's right.

354
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:28,523
I'll donate, pal. - That's the spirit.
- Right on, donate!

355
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:32,243
When was the warning shot fired?
- 3 months ago, commander

356
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:34,523
What intervals?

357
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,521
I'm here since 8 months and
there was only one.

358
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:42,436
One in 8 months? - Yes, commander.
- That's fishy Baris

359
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,560
You and Sedat look through
the old files...

360
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:53,116
...and check them for death
zones and shot directions.

361
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:57,600
Calculate the distance and inform
the brigade.

362
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:00,516
In case of an assault we can ask
for an artillery backup.

363
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:04,361
Yes, Sir. Commander.
- Vedat, where are the files?

364
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:07,236
At the information centre.

365
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:10,604
Good, let's check them.
- Yes, Sir. Captain.

366
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:14,840
Why didn't you connect the dugouts?
- The soil is too rocky

367
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,803
We weren't able to build
connecting dugouts.

368
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:22,960
Do you send out patrols to secure the area?
- No, commander

369
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:28,361
Weather's too rough. And we
don't have enough men.

370
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:32,998
We'll send out a patrol when the
snow melts. - Yes, Sir.

371
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,438
Then we'll see what's going on
out there.

372
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:39,325
Considering this weather,
pigs won't come out either.

373
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:03,325
They're totally shredded.
How are we supposed to sew them?

374
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:07,116
No idea, just sew. It's an order.

375
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:10,961
Yours is even worse.
- Yes.

376
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:44,039
Lock it. Pick up ammo.
Hurry. Hurry. Muzzle into the can

377
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:49,885
Load it, chamber a round,
release the safety, pull the trigger

378
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,722
Put in the magazine, lock it.

379
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:09,159
Muzzle into the can, chamber a
round, pull out the magazine

380
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,602
Release the safety, pull the trigger,
put in the magazine,

381
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,920
Don't point it at me.

382
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,517
Pick up your magazine.

383
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,403
Come in.

384
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:38,760
Time for you medication. - Thank you.

385
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:36,157
What are you staring at?
There's nothing to see here. Get lost.

386
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,323
Put it on the speaker.
- As you wish, commander.

387
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,165
Sergeant... Turn it off!

388
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:55,200
Give me my gun!
Turn of the generator!

389
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:58,399
Hurry, hurry... at 2! To the 14!

390
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:01,440
Only shoot when you see the enemy!

391
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:07,160
In my right pocket!
What's in your right pocket?

392
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:11,440
Take the lucky charm.

393
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:15,883
He is dead. Turn off the light.

394
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:20,243
What is in your right pocket?

395
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:24,920
We're right under the relay! Right!

396
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:30,920
I can't see anything.
Take the lucky charm.

397
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:20,960
Did you dream?

398
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,397
Everythings fine, it's nothing.

399
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:31,283
Sergeant. - Sleep on.
He's as pale as a ghost.

400
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:36,480
Must've been a nightmare.
Go back to bed.

401
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,516
The snow is melting.

402
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,603
Spring is here!

403
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,485
Indeed.

404
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:43,326
I will send you a parcel.
Will you get it?

405
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,400
Apricots and stuff you like.

406
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:50,760
Thank you, but not now.
I'll let you know when the time is right, ok?

407
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:56,166
If you need a courier, I'm your man!
- Zeynep, hang up please.

408
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,680
I wonder, how long your wife will
continue to live in the barracks after you die

409
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:04,681
Do you hear, Mete? - Zeynep,
would you please hang up?

410
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,680
Actually I aimed at you.

411
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:11,157
I hit the boy accidently.
What was his name again?

412
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:14,284
No worries, I'll whisper his name
in your ear next time we see each other

413
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:18,966
After the last attack the
organization will get more aggressive

414
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:21,721
At least this is what it looks like.

415
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:27,283
Every single one of you needs to
act with caution.

416
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:32,120
Follow the orders accurately.

417
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:36,645
Be ready for combat at all hours.
This place will become our grave...

418
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:39,242
...or theirs.

419
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:42,365
Don't you ever forget that.

420
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:53,601
Look under every rock.

421
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,684
Clear.
- Clear.

422
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,997
They took this path. We secured
this area.

423
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:08,317
Southeast. Southwest.

424
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,606
Get down.

425
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:13,759
Their hideout must be
right around here Baris.

426
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,799
That's why he's not attacking.

427
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:22,763
We must disturb him. Hurt him.

428
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,318
Let's search every mountain, boys. Okan!

429
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:30,921
Yes, Sir.
- Send two men over there.

430
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,641
They also cleared
the other side of the path.

431
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:38,562
This area?
- Search completed in this area.

432
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:42,879
He trusts himself a lot.
That's his weak spot.

433
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,395
We must make him angry.

434
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:48,756
Let's make him angry then.

435
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:52,683
Go look for a nice
observation spot. - Yes, Sir.

436
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:57,800
We need to find an ambush point.
The 2 of us and two messengers

437
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,397
Your medication Commander

438
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:02,842
4 men are enough.

439
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:07,918
This guy is here.

440
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:12,441
You were right, captain.

441
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,796
Have you found an appropriate spot?

442
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,683
Yes, Sir.

443
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,446
He won't attack us until
the end of our assignment.

444
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:29,197
We need to lure him out of his cover.
If we can't find him, he must find us

445
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,758
What are we going to tell the
brigade Commander?

446
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,037
They don't want us to leave the station.

447
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:36,322
We say nothing.

448
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:39,240
If something goes wrong?

449
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,919
It won't.

450
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:43,558
Let me go alone.

451
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:45,838
No, I'll join you.

452
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,599
As you wish, captain.

453
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,641
I'll revenge Orhan.

454
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,679
In this place sin is larger than
man, right?

455
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,964
It is written that man...

456
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:07,283
...shall not slay man.

457
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,684
Are there men without sin, lbo?

458
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,763
That's what's written.

459
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:14,003
Do you want to read my poem?
- Yes

460
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:16,083
Why don't you write one yourself?

461
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:19,319
If I could, I wouldn't ask for yours.

462
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,763
Hello, do you hear me?

463
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:24,526
Follow my words:
I look at stones and rocks.

464
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:26,598
I look at stones and rocks.

465
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,956
Look sad, while staring at the stone.

466
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,038
Look at the stone.
- Look...

467
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:35,800
I look at stones and rocks.
There they lie.

468
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:41,241
What is their purpose? Alone is
the stone, for a long long time

469
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:43,915
Can he leave? He cannot.

470
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,963
Can you?
- No.

471
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:50,120
I ask myself, if somebody waits for them or not.
- Less tragic, slightly melancholic

472
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:54,880
Don't cry, just melancholic

473
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,561
Then I think of you.
Your eyes open, they shine.

474
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:00,521
I think of you. I think of you.

475
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:05,486
Don't overdo it. Laugh slightly.

476
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,199
I'm glad that the longing will
end someday.

477
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:12,086
We'll be united happily.

478
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:13,921
What's up?

479
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,043
What? Why are you laughing?

480
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,397
OK?

481
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:23,476
That's it, darling.
- Masallah!

482
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,842
Damnit, lbo!

483
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:28,487
Did you do it how I told you?

484
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,764
I did and even swayed with my
head. Just ask Sedat!

485
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:35,407
Did you put feeling in your words?
- Yes, there was feeling

486
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:41,880
Strange. Then you didn't perform it properly.
What's her job?

487
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:45,960
She's as student at a technical
college. - Technical college?

488
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,924
Yes.
- Then it won't work with her.

489
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:49,243
Why?

490
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:53,320
She's the materialistic type,
not the romatic. She needs a different poem.

491
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:56,605
Really?
- Go. I'll write another one.

492
00:45:58,287 --> 00:46:00,642
Those girls aren't romantic.

493
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:03,964
May I ask you a question, Sir?
- Of course, Kadircan.

494
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:08,878
Rumors are spread... of a doctor
who'll attack the station.

495
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:10,924
Who is this guy?

496
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,317
You know, the terrorist
who's intercepting the radio

497
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:16,200
Why is he called Doctor? Is he a doctor?

498
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:19,324
He dropped out of medical college
after 3 years.

499
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:22,240
Then he disappeared in the
mountains. Nickname stayed.

500
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:24,596
Why did he drop out?
Afraid of dead bodies?

501
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,883
Is this guy nuts? He should work
in a hospital and earn lots of money.

502
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,077
What's he looking for
in the mountains?

503
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,476
Commander says,
they'll definitely attack.

504
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:35,563
Then they will.

505
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:38,207
I am your angel of death.

506
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:43,080
Are you out of your mind?
- Put that rifle away.

507
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:46,804
Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

508
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:49,158
Good god...

509
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:51,642
I thought I heard something...

510
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:54,560
My grandpa made those.

511
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:59,557
Said, they'll protect you.

512
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:07,040
These men are doing a great
and sacred job.

513
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:14,480
As I said before...

514
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:18,520
...we were able to weaken
the terrorists severly.

515
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:22,842
We will increase these efforts...

516
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:26,920
...and as I promised our
distinguished people...

517
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:31,000
terrorism will no longer be
an important topic...

518
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:34,478
...by the end of summer.

519
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:36,962
Even the flag cannot endure
our wind, right?

520
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:41,276
You also fought for this flag.
How could you forget?

521
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:45,440
You forgot! The blood of my
people is also in that flag.

522
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:49,720
It is the blood of all of us
which colors this flag red.

523
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:54,000
But you added the crescent moon
and the star.

524
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:57,244
Just a star would've been better!

525
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:59,922
So you don't like the crescent moon?

526
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:04,040
Go away while you still can.
If not, Zeynep will be very sad

527
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:07,404
No one will be sad if you die?

528
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:10,325
I'll blow your head up, just as I did
with the other two boys

529
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:14,400
You're gonna pay for this.

530
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:17,200
You will die, captain.

531
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:21,760
You dont use the
radio transceiver anymore?

532
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:25,601
No.
- Did you have a fight?

533
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:28,355
We broke up.

534
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:31,883
She's sick of waiting.

535
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:36,000
True. Its hard to wait for
your death news anytime.

536
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,320
Then she just shouldn't wait for it.

537
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:43,840
It is a good thing,
if someone waits for you.

538
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:02,798
Open the window.

539
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:05,966
What's wrong. Tell me!

540
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:10,763
Nothing. Don't mind.
- Why are you doing this? Tell me.

541
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:15,040
I don't know. I need to think of Emre...

542
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:18,796
...Sergeant Orhan, my mother, Hülya.

543
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,919
I invented some new techniques.
Want to learn?

544
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:25,683
A man is stuck in an elevator.

545
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:56,076
How? Just look.

546
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:20,883
One.

547
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:24,557
Two.

548
00:50:36,607 --> 00:50:40,600
Blue. Beret. Does not fall down.

549
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:48,316
Now with just one finger.

550
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:52,918
One, two. That's more easy.

551
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:57,239
Do you know the shop owners son?

552
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:01,081
Mahir?

553
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:05,396
Recently he sent his mom over
to my parents house.

554
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,361
They want me to marry their son.
- What the hell?

555
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,280
My mom just told me.

556
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:14,564
I'll smack this guy.
That really makes me mad.

557
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:16,837
They proposed to her and stuff...

558
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:20,078
It made my heart race.

559
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:23,244
I guess I'm more in love than I thought.

560
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:26,559
But she said no,
so what else do you want?

561
00:51:26,607 --> 00:51:29,804
That's right. But what if we die?

562
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,161
Hello? Mom?

563
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:32,560
My son...

564
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:36,840
Nothing, not much to do here.
How are you?

565
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,079
I miss you so much. So nice to
hear your voice, my boy.

566
00:51:40,207 --> 00:51:42,323
How are the boys?

567
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:44,517
Good. In perfect shape.

568
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:46,598
We don't know anything
about your situation.

569
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,804
Me and your father are kinda nervous.

570
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,242
We do get bits of information...

571
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:56,520
They aren't related to us,
we are at a different place.

572
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,763
We're in Turkey.

573
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:01,765
You'll wrap the newborn in
Besiktas banner for me, will you?

574
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:04,720
Mom, I'm talking to you.
- To me?

575
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:06,405
Yes, of course to you.

576
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:09,843
We're the champions this season.
Don't you get it. Fener is the best.

577
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:13,125
Hello, mom. Im fine and you?

578
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,358
Mom? I am allright, how are you?

579
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:23,045
Do you hear me? Is your phone broken?

580
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:27,286
Lts getting warmer,
orange blossoms smell lovely.

581
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:33,686
Do you hear the call to prayer?
I pray for you and your friends.

582
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:38,560
I can't stand this much longer.

583
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:42,680
I see you sometimes standing before me.

584
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:44,957
If I blink, you're gone.

585
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:49,240
I guess I am demented.

586
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:54,006
I miss you so much.
- I miss you too.

587
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:58,440
I couldn't wash the t-shirt
you wore last time.

588
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:00,563
Sometimes I smell it.
- Oh, mom.

589
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,842
It smells like my boy.

590
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:06,920
I'll send you greetings with music!

591
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:11,440
If we die while asleep.
Will we still become martyrs?

592
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,356
If you're confident and
not afraid of death...

593
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:17,836
...you'll become martyrs while sleeping.

594
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,999
Is that guy still beating you up?
- It will soon be over, mom

595
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:24,324
No need to worry about us.
- Just 64 days...

596
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:27,161
You serve your country.
You need to endure this.

597
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,358
Why? Are you at war?

598
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:34,123
Don't you ever watch TV?
- Your father sold the TV.

599
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:36,243
What did he do?

600
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:39,478
Oh, I really miss you.
- I do miss you too.

601
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:41,444
I really miss your cooking a lot.

602
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:44,963
Since you left I never
prepared meat balls...

603
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,284
...nor stuffed wine leaves.

604
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:52,036
Because you like those so much.

605
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:54,955
Mom, do you cry?

606
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:57,680
No, I'm not crying.

607
00:53:57,847 --> 00:53:59,485
Don't cry.

608
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:03,483
Your voice protects me.

609
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:07,960
Your voice soothes me.

610
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:10,601
Do you still have that gold
I bought you?

611
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,400
Have you ever thought about me
being in need of you?

612
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:17,800
I too want to be with you.
They won't let me. Do you think, I'm stupid?

613
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:21,840
It was everything I had. I wanted
to start a business with that.

614
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:26,280
You will certainly become mad there!

615
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:31,440
Don't call him dad, he is not my dad!

616
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:35,600
And you will call again in 10 days,
I know.

617
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:39,836
This isn't a hotel. I'm not in the
position to call you more often

618
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:41,044
Hello?

619
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:41,799
Hello.

620
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:45,559
Aunt Hanife. It's me, Soner.
- Hello.

621
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:47,922
Is Esma at home?

622
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:49,725
No, she's not.

623
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,763
But I can hear her.

624
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:54,845
Please don't call anymore.

625
00:54:54,887 --> 00:54:58,880
Her father scolds me and her too.
- OK, auntie.

626
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:06,640
Are in love with somebody too?

627
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:09,637
Yes.

628
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:14,964
Keep me updated, will you?
We'll be sitting near the phone all the time

629
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:19,116
Is she in love with you?

630
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:21,162
Yes.

631
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:24,160
I love you.
- I love you too.

632
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:28,360
You know I love you very much,
don't you?

633
00:55:29,487 --> 00:55:31,637
Yes, I know.

634
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:33,997
It's me. Ahu.

635
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,760
You were luckier than me.

636
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:52,958
Will your love die, if we don't see
each other?

637
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:56,119
Love is not the only thing
that plays a part here.

638
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:58,238
You're self-centerd.

639
00:55:58,327 --> 00:56:02,320
Am I self-centered because
I need to fight for everything?

640
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:05,843
What are you fighting for anyway?

641
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:08,362
What's this snotty remark
supposed to mean?

642
00:56:08,487 --> 00:56:10,603
You are there so that I can sleep
at peace right?

643
00:56:10,727 --> 00:56:14,197
You 're in the army.

644
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:17,276
Yes I am.
- Of course!

645
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:22,400
So I need to be thankful for every
quiet night. I get it.

646
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:26,402
Do you want to end it?
- That would make it easy for you, right?

647
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,879
No, it wouldn't.
But you sound like that.

648
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:34,000
It feels like the right thing to do,
indeed. It is over.

649
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:50,480
Not even a picture of you did I get,
now you hang out with other guys

650
00:56:56,887 --> 00:57:02,837
Not even a picture of you did I get,
now you hang out with other guys

651
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:15,800
One day I will knock on your door
with roses.

652
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:24,760
..."get lost" is what I'm going to say.
Live on your street.

653
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:41,481
You tramp, what fun we had with you.

654
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,402
You look tired, Vedat.
- No, commander. I'm fine.

655
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:47,518
Didn't you sleep?

656
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:50,638
No.

657
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:55,602
Where does she live?

658
00:57:56,847 --> 00:58:01,159
I beg your pardon? Who?
- Your girlfriend, boy.

659
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:06,363
In Istanbul.

660
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:11,836
Are you in love with her?

661
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:13,525
I think so, yes.

662
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:18,760
You know that love is too small
for big cities.

663
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,565
I know.

664
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,757
She'll cheat on you.

665
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,798
Are you prepared for that?

666
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:40,840
I can't change it.

667
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:45,040
Are you ready for the fight?
- I am.

668
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:48,405
Serkan, you?

669
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:51,680
I am ready.

670
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:54,357
You didn't make that impression
on me during the first combat

671
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:57,126
I am now, captain.
- Ready for what?

672
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,960
Ready for what you taught us, captain.

673
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:05,487
What did I teach you?

674
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:10,080
Would you treat the man
who shot Orhan...

675
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,158
...if we captured him wounded?

676
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,727
Yes, I would.

677
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:22,836
Equal treatment for everyone,
right? - Yes, commander.

678
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:27,446
Even this we taught you, right?
- Yes, commander.

679
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:32,400
That was a mistake.

680
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,439
I beg your pardon?
- Nothing

681
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:44,600
And if that man killed your
brother? What would you do?

682
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,842
I would still treat him.

683
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,396
And what would you have
told your mother?

684
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:55,599
A man killed my brother.

685
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:59,083
We captured him but I saved
his life. Why?

686
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:03,440
Because I swore an oath to
uncle Hippocrates, right?

687
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:06,800
These mountains have different oaths.

688
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:19,560
Hakan you are a banker, right?
- Yes, commander.

689
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:23,800
Those guys earn 5 times
the salary we get.

690
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:26,919
Ain't it true?

691
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:33,317
Depends on the bonus.
We have commissions too.

692
01:00:33,687 --> 01:00:37,680
What would I need to show you
to get credit?

693
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:43,000
I'm not in the credit department,
but securities I guess.

694
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,560
My securities are these mountains here.

695
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:52,683
You would need papers to prove this.

696
01:00:58,407 --> 01:01:00,967
I don't have papers...

697
01:01:01,087 --> 01:01:04,318
...so these mountains
mean nothing to the bank.

698
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:09,917
When you're discharged
you forget the mountains.

699
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:14,200
Go to the woman you love.
Rest your head on her shoulder

700
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:18,397
And start talking...

701
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:23,000
Oh, you're going to say,
when I was there I shot men.

702
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:27,280
I was shot, I couldn't breathe,
you'll say and cry.

703
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:32,840
Everywhere was blood you'll say.

704
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:40,360
Shed two little tears
on their shoulders, right?

705
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:44,005
And the women will cry.

706
01:01:44,127 --> 01:01:48,120
My hero, my national hero.

707
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:55,157
That's how she'll call you.
Just awesome, right?

708
01:01:56,207 --> 01:02:00,200
You'll hug each other,
so soft and nothing else matters.

709
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,358
Turgay?
- Yes captain.

710
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:06,520
Tell the boy, who is drawing,
to paint not only rocks and stones

711
01:02:06,607 --> 01:02:09,679
Tell him to paint flowers,
beetles and butterflies!

712
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,803
Yes, Sir. Commander.

713
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,197
Maybe then we can get
credit someday, right?

714
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:16,844
Kaya, Kaya 1.

715
01:02:17,287 --> 01:02:20,324
Kaya 1 here.

716
01:02:20,607 --> 01:02:23,246
We prepared the stake-out.

717
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:27,400
Kaya1, did you ever apply
for credit at a bank?

718
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:34,045
No, Kaya

719
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:37,239
Well, don't. Because they want to
see a entry in the land register

720
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:38,476
Understood.

721
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,243
Go now. C'mon.
- Yes, Sir.

722
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,557
Turgay. - Yes, Sir?
- Bring me tea.

723
01:03:32,847 --> 01:03:34,644
Kaya 1, Kaya.

724
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:38,764
Kaya, Kaya 1.

725
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:42,759
Just come back home.
- Yes, Sir.

726
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:53,840
He said you shouldn't draw stones,
but beetles, flowers and butterflies

727
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:57,920
You will not get credit if you don't.

728
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:07,398
Here, take the sheets.

729
01:04:07,727 --> 01:04:09,080
Allright.

730
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:14,600
Take a big pot, add some tea...

731
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:17,646
...and boil them thoroughly.

732
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:22,083
Just wait. In a minute you will
forget that you are here.

733
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,646
How?

734
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,446
Just close your eyes and concentrate.

735
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:28,995
We concentrate on women, right?

736
01:04:29,487 --> 01:04:34,242
No, later. First we concentrate on
the day of discharge.

737
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:40,120
Or leave.

738
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:42,957
Yes, two men.

739
01:04:44,007 --> 01:04:45,156
Flowers.

740
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:48,524
Southwest, they are running.

741
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:53,239
Beetles.

742
01:04:55,967 --> 01:04:57,958
We will leave this place.

743
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,078
150m

744
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:07,883
Think of your families.
Birds chirping. Wind.

745
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:15,437
I see them. They are no scouts.
Let's wait.

746
01:05:16,047 --> 01:05:20,040
And other things. You see them,
don't you?

747
01:05:20,407 --> 01:05:22,079
A woman.

748
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,361
Yes.

749
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,120
100m

750
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:29,203
Think of Hülya.

751
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:30,766
80m

752
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:33,196
Think of your warm beds.

753
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:35,442
You aim at the man.
- The sound of water.

754
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:38,485
I take the women.

755
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:40,438
Listen.

756
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:42,239
70m

757
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:44,482
Forget that you are even here.
- Stay calm.

758
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:47,525
You are not here.
- 60m

759
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:49,877
A slight breeze.
- Very nice.

760
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,601
Quiet.

761
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,685
50m

762
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:03,482
You fire when I fire.

763
01:06:12,487 --> 01:06:16,480
The girl fell behind the tree. Go, run!

764
01:06:16,647 --> 01:06:18,877
Yes, Sir.

765
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,278
The boy went down. The girl I don't see.

766
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:38,200
He is dead.

767
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:41,003
Does she have a hand grenade
with her? - No.

768
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:44,403
Maybe under her body.
Have a look. Let's leave.

769
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,440
Turgay.
- Yes, Sir.

770
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:57,400
Take his ammo. Turgay.
- Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir.

771
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:21,084
Kaya 1, Karabal.
- Karabal here.

772
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:23,006
During combat...

773
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:26,282
Wait. Don't report.

774
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:30,160
Commander?
- Take that.

775
01:07:30,327 --> 01:07:33,125
Will you return?
- Give me the walkie-talkie.

776
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:37,560
Everythings fine. We return.
- Understood.

777
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,439
Take it.

778
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:50,440
Turgay, bundle up our stuff.
- Yes, Sir.

779
01:07:52,727 --> 01:07:55,878
What are we going to do with them?

780
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:01,600
They'll come and get the man.
We'll take the girl to the base

781
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,443
Serkan. How's her condition?

782
01:08:18,487 --> 01:08:20,079
Badly injured.

783
01:08:20,287 --> 01:08:23,324
I know. I shot her.
Can you stop the bleeding?

784
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,682
We"ll need the helicopter.

785
01:08:25,887 --> 01:08:29,880
Which university did you attend?
- Hacettepe.

786
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,003
They have the best medical
department, right?

787
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:33,242
I guess so...

788
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:36,882
So you've been a bad student or
what? Do your job.

789
01:08:37,407 --> 01:08:39,716
Turn on the TV.

790
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:42,998
We need the helicopter, commander
- There won't be one.

791
01:08:43,127 --> 01:08:45,641
We're not the US Army...

792
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:47,996
...which sends a helicopter
for every single wounded soldier

793
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:52,962
I need to talk to her. There are
things I want to hear from her

794
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:57,240
I am trying to save you.
Bring me a sheet.

795
01:08:57,487 --> 01:09:01,480
I'm 21, born in Ankara and
go to college.

796
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:04,121
What's that?

797
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:07,640
How was the day of the contest
for you? Were you excited?

798
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:10,566
Just tell us a little about it.

799
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:12,605
Swab.
- Swab. Swab.

800
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:17,360
Let me have it.

801
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:37,320
Here, grab this. Tighter!

802
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:41,800
I can't watch this.
- Then don't, damn it!

803
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:47,600
There were so many other
beautiful girls.

804
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:51,800
And how does it feel to be the
most beautiful girl of Turkey

805
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,639
I am very proud.

806
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:56,566
And I want to represent my
country in the best possible way.

807
01:09:56,687 --> 01:09:59,076
How did you get that stunning
body and great looks?

808
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:02,005
I exercise alot. I am an athlete.

809
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:05,278
I'm on a healthy diet.

810
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:08,086
Every morning an apricot,
a glass of water.

811
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:11,279
That's how I start my day.

812
01:10:11,487 --> 01:10:13,478
Is there a part of your body
you don't like?

813
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:16,201
I don't like my neck.

814
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:18,835
What changed in your life
after the contest?

815
01:10:19,247 --> 01:10:22,000
It still feels like a dream.

816
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:25,597
Nothing much.
Only more people know me now.

817
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:30,316
Commander I can't concentrate.
Can we turn off the TV?

818
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:33,200
Could you stop the bleeding?
- To some extent.

819
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:43,600
Thank you and again, congratulations.

820
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:59,005
Are you in pain? What a pity.

821
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:07,920
You were there
when Orhan and Emre got killed?

822
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:16,960
Orhan had a wife and two kids
and a new car.

823
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:23,762
Did you watch them die?

824
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:32,280
Did I squeeze to tight?
I'll loosen then. Good.

825
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:39,200
Is there anyone who'll miss you,
when you die?

826
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:42,723
Who'll be sad when you die?

827
01:11:42,887 --> 01:11:45,720
Commander You'll kill her.

828
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,042
Not me.

829
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:55,400
Will the Doctor be sad? Do you know him?

830
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:57,525
Commander.

831
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:00,155
He fucks you, doesn't he?

832
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:04,606
You are going to kill her.
- I'll make this Doctor to show up here.

833
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:09,638
Commander you will kill her.
- Be quiet! What?

834
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:14,000
The Doctor wants to talk to you.

835
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:18,920
Tell him the captain is taking care
of his girlfriend. He's busy right now.

836
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:21,244
Yes, Sir.

837
01:12:22,447 --> 01:12:25,803
So you know each other.

838
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:30,640
Where is the doctor?

839
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:34,920
You're going to kill her!

840
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:37,523
Where is the doctor?

841
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,525
Commander...

842
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:43,680
Commander! Commander!
You'll kill her! Commander!

843
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:46,356
The Doctor is here.

844
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:57,200
Commander! Commander!

845
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:02,320
Enough!

846
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:08,360
Orhan had a wife and two kids
and a new car.

847
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:16,680
Call the helicopter to take her away.

848
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:22,000
Everybody out! Llker, Soner, out!

849
01:13:22,047 --> 01:13:25,642
Yes, Sir.

850
01:13:43,447 --> 01:13:44,766
Turgay.

851
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:46,195
Yes, Sir.

852
01:13:46,407 --> 01:13:49,717
You go with the helicopter,
take a few days leave.

853
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:53,800
No, we arrived here together and
we're leaving together.

854
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,365
The helicopter is here.

855
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:10,921
The boys shall help you carry her.

856
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:12,520
Yes, Sir.

857
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:16,362
Bring the blanket also.

858
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:18,842
Yes, Sir.

859
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,996
Let her down, slowly.

860
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:42,927
Let me have it.

861
01:14:45,207 --> 01:14:46,845
Sit down.

862
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:23,480
Citizens heatedly protested
against the terror of the PKK.

863
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:26,597
It takes 57 second.

864
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,606
What takes 57 seconds?

865
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:36,885
Commander said we would get
45 seconds. But it took 57.

866
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,566
General Güres is ordered to
lead the examination...

867
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:44,119
...in Diyarbakir in the southeast
of the country.

868
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:54,436
Don't shed tears, you beauty.

869
01:16:55,047 --> 01:16:59,643
Don't hurt yourself, beauty.

870
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:05,676
What does this mean in turkish?

871
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:10,240
Don't shed tears,
don't hurt youself, beauty.

872
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:12,961
What shall I do, I love you.

873
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,477
I can't cope with my feelings.

874
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:19,600
Do you have a girlfriend?

875
01:17:19,967 --> 01:17:21,605
Yes, in the village.

876
01:17:21,727 --> 01:17:23,558
What's her name?
- Xece.

877
01:17:23,967 --> 01:17:25,241
What?!
- Xece.

878
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:27,403
What's that supposed to mean?
- Hatice in Kurdish.

879
01:17:27,527 --> 01:17:32,999
My heart. My only one, my flower.

880
01:17:33,887 --> 01:17:35,878
Beloved.

881
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:39,719
I am too far away to say I'm sorry.

882
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:50,000
I wished my breath to be in your face.

883
01:17:52,327 --> 01:17:56,320
I'd love to warm your back
with my breath.

884
01:17:59,687 --> 01:18:03,236
If only I could whisper the
sweetest love songs in your ear

885
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,364
Muzzle into the can!

886
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:11,719
I couldn't, my love.
I was ashamed of these words.

887
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:19,959
My hands caressed your hands,
my lips caressed your neck...

888
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,441
Be careful.

889
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:26,244
My eyes, your heart...

890
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:30,679
...where the sun hides.

891
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:37,324
I always thought the clouds would disappear,
if I would only stare bravely enough at them.

892
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:44,367
I can't change this. Too late.

893
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:50,721
Don't be angry.
A cloud concealed my view.

894
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:54,325
I couldn't help it...

895
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,357
I became that cloud.

896
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:06,437
I made it rain in your innermost.

897
01:19:09,727 --> 01:19:10,796
Forgive me.

898
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:18,720
I didn't have enough breath
to chase the clouds away.

899
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:22,286
I seem to hear your voice...

900
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:27,400
In my most unprotected moment
I will take your curse.

901
01:19:29,567 --> 01:19:31,558
I will ask for forgiveness.

902
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:43,760
My breath was supposed to
give life to yours. I couldn't.

903
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:49,280
I was out of breath.

904
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,117
Come.

905
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,721
Your medication.

906
01:19:56,487 --> 01:20:00,480
I don't need them anymore.
Throw them away.

907
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:05,040
I wished so hard that this breath would be
enough to swallow the love in your chest

908
01:20:05,407 --> 01:20:08,080
It wasn't supposed to be that way.

909
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:12,560
I wasn't able to tell you the
fairy tales of my childhood.

910
01:20:14,087 --> 01:20:18,080
I would have loved to carry you
away with my fairy tales!

911
01:20:20,207 --> 01:20:24,200
Once upon a time... was all I said.

912
01:20:25,127 --> 01:20:28,278
Hello? Hello?

913
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:09,439
Kaya, I will avenge the death of my comrade.
- Then come

914
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:12,399
I'll revenge the woman.
- I'll have revenge too.

915
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:14,597
I will raise a statue for her there.

916
01:21:14,647 --> 01:21:17,002
Come here, act like a man.
- I'll come soon.

917
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:19,362
I won't leave this place without
having seen you first. You coward.

918
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,682
Would a coward fight for 10 years?

919
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:24,241
You live like a boar in the mountains.

920
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:26,887
You killed thousands of youth!
You murderers!

921
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:29,242
We fight against the leeches
that dwell among your own people

922
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:31,847
Did you manage to defeat them
in all these years?

923
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,481
You are one who kills his own people.

924
01:21:34,527 --> 01:21:37,280
Don't speak out the name of
my people, who you supress.

925
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:39,597
You were suppressed? What is it,
that this state didn't give?

926
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:43,885
My freedom! You banned my
people from their own land.

927
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:47,920
You don't gain freedom through murder.
- You outlawed my language

928
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:50,117
You went to university in this country!

929
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,237
Be patient. I will free you of
all your worries.

930
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:54,318
You are a murderer.
- In fact you are the murderer.

931
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:58,400
What about the teachers, children,
engineers, workers you've killed.

932
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:01,678
This land is tough, this war has rules.

933
01:22:01,727 --> 01:22:04,195
You have a rule for killing children?

934
01:22:04,247 --> 01:22:06,602
How many villages did you burn down?

935
01:22:06,647 --> 01:22:09,366
The blood of the innocent
villagers is on your hands!

936
01:22:09,447 --> 01:22:13,122
You never understood us. It is your fault
that poverty became the fate of my people

937
01:22:13,207 --> 01:22:15,562
Has every poor man become a
terrorist, like you?

938
01:22:15,607 --> 01:22:17,996
This is our land.
- Doctor, this land belongs to us all.

939
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:19,685
These mountains are mine. Off you go!

940
01:22:19,807 --> 01:22:21,957
This place shall become your grave.
- Off you go.

941
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:24,646
Not without seeing you first.
- Go to your wife.

942
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:26,518
I'll stay here, Doctor.
- Go.

943
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:29,081
I'm going to kill you.
- You will die here.

944
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:32,717
So long live Motherland!

945
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:41,003
I want you to give that to Zeynep.

946
01:22:41,047 --> 01:22:42,924
Commander.

947
01:22:43,447 --> 01:22:45,802
This is not an order.
I ask you to do it.

948
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:57,443
I don't think I'll survive the combat.

949
01:22:57,847 --> 01:23:01,203
I feel it since Orhan died.

950
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:09,683
I can't accept his death.

951
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:17,160
But you've been in so many combats!

952
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:27,600
I never told Zeynep
how much she means to me.

953
01:23:28,687 --> 01:23:31,076
I was ashamed.

954
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:36,962
We are soldiers. Unromantic.
Nothing for me.

955
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:43,720
I wasn't able to say I LOVE YOU.

956
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:49,761
I love you...

957
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:56,400
How hard to say are these 8 letters?

958
01:23:56,847 --> 01:24:00,317
Good god... 8 letters.

959
01:24:08,887 --> 01:24:12,197
Everything's black, Baris.

960
01:24:15,287 --> 01:24:18,165
I don't find answers to
my questions anymore.

961
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:22,599
I remain here without answers.

962
01:24:24,047 --> 01:24:28,040
Without Zeynep, without Orhan.

963
01:24:30,727 --> 01:24:35,676
Nothing makes sense and
I don't find words for it.

964
01:24:41,487 --> 01:24:45,480
How can I explain that I have as much love
for Ankara, as I have for the mountains here

965
01:24:50,247 --> 01:24:52,966
Anyway...

966
01:24:58,047 --> 01:25:02,325
Don't you wonder what's the
medication for I take?

967
01:25:04,407 --> 01:25:08,161
We can't have children.

968
01:25:09,447 --> 01:25:12,325
I'm bleeding on the inside.

969
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:18,999
Give this to her.

970
01:25:25,527 --> 01:25:30,282
Tell her, I smell her scent
whenever I see flowers.

971
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:34,043
And... I want her to forgive me.

972
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:39,760
Could you deliver additional ammunition?

973
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:47,800
Good, I'll keep you updated.

974
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:30,680
Sir, yes Sir. Commander.

975
01:26:41,287 --> 01:26:45,280
All nights in this place are short...

976
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,795
...except one.

977
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:55,162
You pray to make it end.

978
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:59,880
You don't have a chance to think
about why you're here.

979
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:09,000
You just want to survive the night,
still breathing.

980
01:27:14,927 --> 01:27:18,920
If I stop breathing, you do too.

981
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:25,279
Do you deserve your breath?

982
01:27:26,807 --> 01:27:30,800
I don't know. Commander, I...
- Keep silent!

983
01:27:34,927 --> 01:27:39,762
You guys sent me here.
The Turkish soldier is the bravest

984
01:27:42,287 --> 01:27:44,482
Martyrs never die, no one will
ever divide this country.

985
01:27:50,447 --> 01:27:54,156
My uncle shouted this.

986
01:27:54,607 --> 01:27:56,325
My aunt did.

987
01:27:57,527 --> 01:28:01,406
Neighbours. You.

988
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:06,645
And I came.

989
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:14,764
This is war. Either you are a
murderer or a victim.

990
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:18,284
In between there's only dishonour.

991
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:23,080
Do you think, I don't know that
we can't win this war like that?

992
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:28,324
Do you think I'm stupid?

993
01:28:31,767 --> 01:28:34,759
I know that.

994
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:40,362
What you don't know is that
if I fail here,

995
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:47,556
you lose in Istanbul and Ankara
as well. Do you get that?

996
01:28:56,207 --> 01:29:00,200
You don't.
Nobody is ever right at war

997
01:29:01,327 --> 01:29:05,036
You don't ask yourself
in the longest night...

998
01:29:05,447 --> 01:29:10,123
...who is right or wrong, murderer
or victim.

999
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:20,278
There is only your breath.
You breath in or out.

1000
01:29:20,807 --> 01:29:24,800
That simple. You get that?

1001
01:29:34,887 --> 01:29:38,880
If you would've only liked me a little.

1002
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:48,880
Sleep now.

1003
01:30:04,047 --> 01:30:07,881
Don't worry. Every war has
got an end. Even this one.

1004
01:30:09,967 --> 01:30:13,960
At the end you'll judge me.

1005
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:19,200
That doesn't matter.

1006
01:30:19,567 --> 01:30:22,320
There is no other place for me
to turn to.

1007
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:48,236
Damn kiosk owner!

1008
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:53,403
Is the captain asleep?

1009
01:30:57,287 --> 01:31:01,280
Sergeant, I need to call Göksen.

1010
01:31:01,647 --> 01:31:04,878
Who is Göksen?
- My bride-to-be.

1011
01:31:05,767 --> 01:31:09,760
This is not funny. Good night.
- I have to call her!

1012
01:31:09,847 --> 01:31:13,237
I beg you!

1013
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:17,400
I need to ask you for something.
One of the boys...

1014
01:31:17,447 --> 01:31:21,440
...needs to do a long-distance
call. Family affairs.

1015
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:26,801
This is the number.

1016
01:31:36,047 --> 01:31:37,958
What's happening?

1017
01:31:38,647 --> 01:31:42,640
Get lost. It is ringing.

1018
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:48,639
It is ringing.

1019
01:31:48,687 --> 01:31:49,802
Hello? Hello?

1020
01:32:16,727 --> 01:32:17,318
Get down!

1021
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:18,806
Get down!
- Commander!

1022
01:32:19,047 --> 01:32:19,797
Sedat?

1023
01:32:19,887 --> 01:32:21,081
Are you OK?

1024
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:22,925
Lbo?

1025
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:24,964
My arm is off.

1026
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:35,361
Go get the MG

1027
01:32:35,607 --> 01:32:36,596
Kamil!

1028
01:32:37,287 --> 01:32:40,279
I can't see anything!

1029
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:42,716
Turn of the generator!

1030
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:44,280
Yes, Sir. Commander.

1031
01:32:55,847 --> 01:32:56,563
Kamil.

1032
01:33:10,247 --> 01:33:11,600
Commander!

1033
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:14,963
Turn off the light.

1034
01:33:15,287 --> 01:33:16,197
Onur.

1035
01:33:16,367 --> 01:33:17,243
Turgay.

1036
01:33:17,447 --> 01:33:19,836
Look at his foot.

1037
01:33:20,047 --> 01:33:22,686
Push it on his leg. He is dead.
Off to the radio room.

1038
01:33:22,807 --> 01:33:24,001
Muharrem.

1039
01:33:24,407 --> 01:33:25,317
Turgay.

1040
01:33:28,207 --> 01:33:29,686
Fire!

1041
01:33:30,127 --> 01:33:32,402
Turgay.

1042
01:33:32,727 --> 01:33:35,560
Fire!

1043
01:33:55,607 --> 01:33:59,600
Come here, Soner.

1044
01:34:00,127 --> 01:34:04,120
Soner, grab the bag, look at me.
What's your name?

1045
01:34:04,407 --> 01:34:05,123
Lbo! - What's your name?

1046
01:34:11,127 --> 01:34:15,120
Doctor, I've got a letter
in my right pocket.

1047
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:17,920
Don't shot until you see the enemy.

1048
01:34:18,087 --> 01:34:20,806
Right pocket.

1049
01:34:23,607 --> 01:34:24,960
Look at me.

1050
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:27,083
I can't see anything.

1051
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,921
OK, let's go together.

1052
01:34:31,087 --> 01:34:35,080
Hand this letter to my mom, OK?

1053
01:34:35,487 --> 01:34:36,078
Down!

1054
01:34:36,767 --> 01:34:39,156
Göktay, answer me!

1055
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,596
Bro, my arm has been ripped off.

1056
01:34:44,927 --> 01:34:47,760
Give me the letter.

1057
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:51,800
Right side...

1058
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,523
Look. On the other side.

1059
01:34:56,527 --> 01:34:58,597
Go away.

1060
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:04,440
Doctor, commander.

1061
01:35:06,727 --> 01:35:10,322
My arm has been ripped off, commander.

1062
01:35:14,607 --> 01:35:18,600
Want to lick my head? It wouldn't help.

1063
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:22,442
In my right pocket, Resul.

1064
01:35:22,687 --> 01:35:23,597
Grenade.

1065
01:35:23,887 --> 01:35:25,525
Resul, Resul.

1066
01:35:26,767 --> 01:35:29,156
One of us?

1067
01:35:29,607 --> 01:35:33,600
Don't be afraid. Give me a gun.

1068
01:35:33,927 --> 01:35:37,522
They are on the right side.

1069
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:39,599
I dont see them.

1070
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:50,486
Shoot. They shoot.

1071
01:35:50,567 --> 01:35:53,400
In my right pocket.

1072
01:35:57,367 --> 01:36:01,360
What's in there, Sergeant.
What in Gods name is where?

1073
01:36:01,607 --> 01:36:05,600
His girl knows nothing about
poetry. I wrote a poem.

1074
01:36:09,887 --> 01:36:13,880
We must shoot.
- Grab his arm.

1075
01:36:14,207 --> 01:36:18,200
While you sneak into my mind at night...

1076
01:36:18,687 --> 01:36:22,680
...I keep watch here.

1077
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:31,400
I can't find sleep, must think of you.

1078
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:38,080
Want to get up to get to you,
but I can't.

1079
01:36:43,927 --> 01:36:46,202
I... shoot.

1080
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:50,360
Hakan, shoot! Shoot!

1081
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:54,480
Just shoot! Just shoot!

1082
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:02,520
Have you ever been in love, captain?

1083
01:37:02,687 --> 01:37:05,485
I've been, lbrahim. And you?

1084
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:07,324
Screw you.

1085
01:37:07,687 --> 01:37:08,597
Cüneyt.

1086
01:37:08,767 --> 01:37:11,520
I once was.
Have you ever written a poem?

1087
01:37:11,647 --> 01:37:14,036
Yes, I did.
- Screw you.

1088
01:37:18,247 --> 01:37:22,240
Do you have feelings? Do you? Huh?

1089
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:23,840
Cüneyt!

1090
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:29,242
Did she laugh at you?

1091
01:37:31,487 --> 01:37:34,047
Welcome, Doctor.

1092
01:37:34,447 --> 01:37:37,166
Thank you, commander.

1093
01:37:42,127 --> 01:37:46,120
I can't find the vein. Go on.

1094
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:52,286
I must read poetry.

1095
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:56,118
Go, Dogukan.

1096
01:37:56,727 --> 01:37:58,843
Fire?

1097
01:37:59,247 --> 01:38:03,240
Shoot them. Hakan. Give me your rifle.

1098
01:38:04,127 --> 01:38:08,120
Do you hear me? Go to the 14!

1099
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:10,880
I can't see anything!
- I am looking!

1100
01:38:12,287 --> 01:38:14,960
Is nobody here?

1101
01:38:15,087 --> 01:38:19,080
Why don't you shoot? They will kill us!

1102
01:38:21,007 --> 01:38:23,237
Are you OK, Sergeant?

1103
01:38:25,327 --> 01:38:26,362
Paramedic!

1104
01:38:27,447 --> 01:38:30,564
They come.

1105
01:38:31,727 --> 01:38:32,921
Go.
- God help us.

1106
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:34,281
Ibrahim.

1107
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:40,320
Paramedic! Come here fast!

1108
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:54,799
In my right pocket...

1109
01:38:56,287 --> 01:39:00,280
Look ahead. Sergeant, where are
you going? Down!

1110
01:39:01,207 --> 01:39:05,200
In my right pocket.

1111
01:39:06,087 --> 01:39:10,080
Turn of the light! Sergeant! Sergeant!

1112
01:39:10,967 --> 01:39:14,960
We're an easy target because of you!

1113
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:19,400
Look ahead, Dogukan! Look ahead!

1114
01:39:19,847 --> 01:39:23,840
You have some ammo left?

1115
01:39:24,327 --> 01:39:28,320
Do you see the spot over there?
Are the boys out there?

1116
01:39:28,767 --> 01:39:30,644
Mami

1117
01:39:47,407 --> 01:39:50,399
Why did MG 3 stop?

1118
01:39:53,007 --> 01:39:55,123
Mami

1119
01:39:56,007 --> 01:39:58,123
Just shoot!

1120
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:04,320
Dogukan, there are too many of 'em.

1121
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:05,358
Mami

1122
01:40:05,727 --> 01:40:08,195
Stupid, why don't you shoot?

1123
01:40:08,647 --> 01:40:11,480
Take the lucky charm.

1124
01:40:11,967 --> 01:40:14,561
Take it, for god's sake. Take it.

1125
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:18,003
Shoot!

1126
01:40:19,367 --> 01:40:20,641
Mom

1127
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:24,842
Dogukan, take the lucky charm.

1128
01:40:24,967 --> 01:40:26,605
Turn off the light!

1129
01:40:26,647 --> 01:40:28,683
Commander, please.

1130
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:30,919
Turn it off, Ekin!

1131
01:40:31,007 --> 01:40:32,599
My grandpa prayed...

1132
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:34,923
I brought you the radio unit.

1133
01:40:35,007 --> 01:40:37,043
Shoot only when you see them.

1134
01:40:37,087 --> 01:40:39,157
I'm out of ammo.

1135
01:40:39,247 --> 01:40:41,044
I beg you, take it.
Take the clip.

1136
01:40:41,207 --> 01:40:43,562
The man comes.
- I brought you the radio unit.

1137
01:40:43,727 --> 01:40:45,524
The man comes.

1138
01:40:46,847 --> 01:40:49,407
Pull him down.

1139
01:40:57,407 --> 01:40:59,796
Dogukan.

1140
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:16,920
How are you, captain?
- Give me my weapon, boy.

1141
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:24,280
Wake up, please!
- Look after Ekin!

1142
01:41:28,527 --> 01:41:32,520
Paramedic!

1143
01:41:35,247 --> 01:41:39,240
Calm down.

1144
01:41:48,527 --> 01:41:50,836
Are you OK, commander?

1145
01:41:50,887 --> 01:41:54,880
Just a graze. Now you are a war veteran.

1146
01:41:55,047 --> 01:41:59,040
Behind him. Back!
- Hold tight. He's dead.

1147
01:41:59,087 --> 01:42:01,647
Answer!
- He is dead!

1148
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:03,439
Turn of the light! Sergeant!

1149
01:42:05,567 --> 01:42:09,560
Ömer is shot. Don't move

1150
01:42:09,807 --> 01:42:13,720
We are under the relay. Ömer was shot.
He is bleeding

1151
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:15,758
You have to come here
immediately. Paramedics...

1152
01:42:15,887 --> 01:42:17,843
Ömer is shot. Don't move

1153
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:21,563
Where are you?
- Right under the relay. Come

1154
01:42:21,807 --> 01:42:25,322
On my way. Stay where you are.

1155
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:35,838
Lights off!
- Aim at the right side.

1156
01:42:35,967 --> 01:42:37,798
Prepare the signal rocket.

1157
01:42:37,847 --> 01:42:40,122
I'll make you get the girl.

1158
01:42:42,887 --> 01:42:45,879
You'll become a war hero,
just wait and see.

1159
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:51,164
War veteran Ömer Çetin.
She'll immediately fall in love with me.

1160
01:42:52,407 --> 01:42:54,204
Over there!

1161
01:42:56,207 --> 01:43:00,200
Now, everybody will know
I'm in the special forces.

1162
01:43:00,287 --> 01:43:02,755
They are coming! Hurry!

1163
01:43:05,567 --> 01:43:07,558
The paramedic comes.

1164
01:43:08,327 --> 01:43:11,205
Where is he hit?
- Belly.

1165
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:17,115
Give me the bandage.

1166
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:19,203
On the ground!

1167
01:44:33,687 --> 01:44:37,680
Father, I'm coming.
- Forgive me, mother.

1168
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:34,240
I am tearing down your castles
Kaya. Piece by piece.

1169
01:45:35,047 --> 01:45:39,040
I can still see the roof, doctor.

1170
01:45:39,127 --> 01:45:42,324
Is your RPG out of ammo.

1171
01:45:43,567 --> 01:45:47,560
Situation report, Heval Ciya.

1172
01:45:48,567 --> 01:45:50,797
Up, up!

1173
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:55,002
We're here to help you.

1174
01:45:58,247 --> 01:46:02,240
Surrender Turkish soldiers.
We won't do you any harm.

1175
01:46:02,447 --> 01:46:06,201
Surrender your captain.

1176
01:46:06,287 --> 01:46:10,280
It's not worth it... fighting for
this man, soldiers.

1177
01:46:10,327 --> 01:46:12,966
We dont have anything against you.

1178
01:46:13,127 --> 01:46:17,120
Save your breath, Doctor.
These boys will never surrender.

1179
01:46:25,727 --> 01:46:28,719
Go to Turgay.
- Turgay is dead.

1180
01:46:28,767 --> 01:46:32,760
Turgay is dead.
- No, he's not!

1181
01:46:32,847 --> 01:46:36,283
Turgay! Turn off the lights.
- Then I won't see.

1182
01:46:36,407 --> 01:46:38,204
Turn it off!
- Then I won't see.

1183
01:46:38,447 --> 01:46:40,722
Serkan.

1184
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:43,316
Commander, don't.

1185
01:46:43,607 --> 01:46:47,600
I'll kill you. Turn it off!
- I need to bandage you.

1186
01:46:48,287 --> 01:46:50,676
Shhh. The light.
- I need to bandage you.

1187
01:46:50,807 --> 01:46:53,275
Bring me a sheet or a blanket.

1188
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:57,360
Don't let your soldiers die
like flies. Surrender.

1189
01:46:59,047 --> 01:47:03,040
Come Doctor, I'm waiting for you.

1190
01:48:14,647 --> 01:48:18,276
Are you seriously injured?
- I don't know.

1191
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:21,086
Are you okay, Ömer?
- Yes, commander.

1192
01:48:21,207 --> 01:48:25,086
Will we die? - We'll have lots of
times to go for walks.

1193
01:48:25,287 --> 01:48:28,723
Yes, Sir. Commander.

1194
01:48:32,767 --> 01:48:36,476
Do you have your rifle?
- Yes, commander.

1195
01:48:39,887 --> 01:48:42,162
Surrender.

1196
01:48:42,407 --> 01:48:46,400
I broke the slender neck
you were so fond of kissing.

1197
01:48:46,527 --> 01:48:50,520
You hear that?

1198
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:56,237
What was her name, Doctor?

1199
01:48:57,007 --> 01:49:01,000
How did you call her?

1200
01:49:01,487 --> 01:49:05,480
My wild wind?
My daisy? How?

1201
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:43,400
Doctor?
Doctor, do you hear me?

1202
01:49:50,567 --> 01:49:54,560
Come. I am here.

1203
01:50:19,487 --> 01:50:22,206
Her name was Gulan.

1204
01:50:24,927 --> 01:50:26,997
A beautiful name.

1205
01:51:35,807 --> 01:51:39,800
I abhor the pain you feel,
when you hear them ringing the bell

1206
01:51:41,407 --> 01:51:44,479
I won't smell your soul anymore.

1207
01:51:44,847 --> 01:51:48,840
Like a cloud I'll darken your inner sun.

1208
01:51:52,567 --> 01:51:54,762
Forgive me.

1209
01:51:55,247 --> 01:51:58,239
Words never had so much weight, my love.

1210
01:52:02,487 --> 01:52:05,206
When I said "my life for my country"...

1211
01:52:06,127 --> 01:52:09,483
...my heart screamed
"you are my home!".

1212
01:52:13,687 --> 01:52:17,680
I became your grave
while trying to be your soil.

1213
01:52:19,527 --> 01:52:23,520
A trickle instead of your river.

1214
01:52:26,007 --> 01:52:30,000
Instead of being your sun
I became your shadow.

1215
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:39,085
Forgive me, my love...

1216
01:52:45,927 --> 01:52:48,919
Why didn't I listen to your soul?

1217
01:52:49,887 --> 01:52:53,596
Listened with my eyes,
see with my heart?

1218
01:52:55,047 --> 01:52:59,040
Why did I hide my heart
when you reached out for it.

1219
01:53:02,207 --> 01:53:06,200
If only my tears could rest
on my cheek without shame.

1220
01:53:09,647 --> 01:53:13,640
My love, I take you with me.

1221
01:53:18,287 --> 01:53:22,280
How cruel, to be the cloud
in your heart.

1222
01:53:25,567 --> 01:53:29,560
To devour the light of the
morning forever.

1223
01:53:33,487 --> 01:53:37,480
Winds! Help me!

1224
01:53:43,007 --> 01:53:47,842
I hope that one sunny day
a stronger love finds its path...

1225
01:53:49,287 --> 01:53:52,438
...and I fly away.

1226
01:53:55,927 --> 01:53:59,920
Then I will scream a thousand times

1227
01:54:00,207 --> 01:54:02,516
I love you.

1228
01:57:36,687 --> 01:57:40,680
I'm unemployed. Why do you hit me?

1229
01:57:41,127 --> 01:57:44,563
This love should not end like this.

1230
01:57:45,407 --> 01:57:49,161
Please don't leave me, oh!

1231
01:57:49,727 --> 01:57:52,878
This love should not end like this.

1232
01:57:54,007 --> 01:57:57,477
Don't leave me alone,

1233
01:57:58,327 --> 01:58:01,160
don't surrender me to death,

1234
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:04,359
don't surrender me to cruelty.

1235
01:58:04,447 --> 01:58:07,359
Take me with you, wherever you go,

1236
01:58:07,487 --> 01:58:10,365
don't surrender me to death,

1237
01:58:10,447 --> 01:58:13,439
don't surrender me to cruelty.

1238
01:58:13,607 --> 01:58:17,361
Take me with you, wherever you go,

1239
01:58:18,607 --> 01:58:22,202
I can't breath without you,

1240
01:58:22,487 --> 01:58:25,797
I can't stand it here without you,

1241
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:29,920
Oh, I can't be alone!

1242
01:58:31,607 --> 01:58:34,758
I miss your scent,

1243
01:58:34,967 --> 01:58:38,403
waited for you forever,

1244
01:58:38,847 --> 01:58:42,601
Take me with you, wherever you go,

1245
01:58:43,007 --> 01:58:46,602
I can't breath without you,

1246
01:58:46,647 --> 01:58:49,957
I can't stand it here without you,

1247
01:58:50,047 --> 01:58:54,040
Oh, I can't be alone!

1248
01:58:55,247 --> 01:58:58,398
I miss your scent,

1249
01:58:58,487 --> 01:59:01,957
waited for you forever,

1250
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:05,921
Take me with you, wherever you go,

1251
01:59:06,127 --> 01:59:09,722
I can't breath without you,

1252
01:59:09,767 --> 01:59:12,645
I can't stand it here without you,

1253
01:59:12,767 --> 01:59:16,760
Oh, I can't be alone!

1254
01:59:18,927 --> 01:59:22,044
I miss your scent,

1255
01:59:22,127 --> 01:59:24,960
Oh, I can't be alone!

1256
01:59:25,007 --> 01:59:28,636
Take me with you, wherever you go.

1257
01:59:29,047 --> 01:59:32,005
Well done.
- Thank you, guys.

1258
01:59:39,447 --> 01:59:41,403
Troop!
- Thank you!

1259
01:59:41,487 --> 01:59:42,886
Troop!
- Thank you!

1260
01:59:43,167 --> 01:59:45,123
Troop!
- Thank you!

1261
01:59:50,927 --> 01:59:54,397
Step by step, march ahead!

1262
01:59:57,567 --> 01:59:59,558
Snow on my head.

1263
02:00:03,727 --> 02:00:06,799
Winds are wild.

1264
02:00:08,007 --> 02:00:11,477
Lowlands become too narrow.

1265
02:00:12,127 --> 02:00:15,278
My country...

1266
02:00:19,047 --> 02:00:21,322
...are the mountains, the mountains.

1267
02:00:29,647 --> 02:00:33,083
Towns seem like traps to me.

1268
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:38,597
People's chit-chat not allowed.

1269
02:00:40,647 --> 02:00:44,401
Stay away from me.

1270
02:00:45,927 --> 02:00:48,157
My country...

1271
02:00:51,167 --> 02:00:53,840
...are the mountains, the mountains.

1272
02:00:56,727 --> 02:00:59,116
...are the mountains, the mountains.
