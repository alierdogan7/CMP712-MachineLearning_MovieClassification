00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,009
<i>Yankee Nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?</i>

2
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,412
0-2-0.
Flight level 1-5.

3
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,950
Above release point
Echo Bravo One.

4
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,450
<i>Move in and check it out.</i>

5
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,384
Roger. Moving in.

6
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,893
Food riot in progress.

7
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,364
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

8
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,332
No weapons evident.

9
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,800
<i>Proceed with Plan Alpha.</i>

10
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,928
<i>Eliminate anything moving.</i>

11
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,904
I said the crowd is unarmed.

12
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,533
There are lots of women and children.
All they want is food!

13
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,009
<i>As you were, Richards.!</i>

14
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,775
<i>Proceed with Plan Alpha.
All rioters must be eliminated.</i>

15
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,208
The hell with you!
I will not fire on helpless people.

16
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,217
Abort mission.
We return back to base.

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,654
<i>- Lieutenant Sanders, do you copy?
- Affirmative.</i>

18
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,557
<i>Take command, detain Richards
and proceed as ordered.</i>

19
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,526
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

20
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,563
Shit! Get him!

21
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,600
Goddamn it!

22
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,401
We're pitching over!

23
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,640
I got it.
I got control.

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,376
He said detain him.
Don't drop him.

25
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,685
Richards, you're gonna fry for this.

26
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,491
And I'll see you in hell.

27
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,806
Come on. Keep digging.

28
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,244
What's the holdup?

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,648
This one's had it.

30
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,344
Watch the detonator.

31
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,357
Get that garbage out of here.

32
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,618
Move!

33
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,055
<i>Hey, Charlie. Did you see
The Running Man last night?</i>

34
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,215
I never miss it.

35
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,124
I even won 500 bucks.

36
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,627
You lucky bastard.

37
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,162
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

38
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,760
Okay, hang on.
Lenny, this is the eighth perimeter.

39
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,738
Fresh meat just got here.
Shut down the deadline.

40
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,400
<i>Affirmative.
Shutting down now. Stand clear.</i>

41
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,143

- Okay, assholes. Move it.
- Let's go. Let's go.

45
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,856
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

46
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,280
East perimeter here. New prisoners
are all in compound. We're clear.

47
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,247
Affirmative.
Activating deadline.

48
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,511
What are you looking at?
Get out of here.

49

<i>Prisoner restraint collars armed.</i>

52
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,691
Give you a lift?

53
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,872
- Get it open!
- I got it!

54
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,169
- Repeat the codes.
- I did!

55
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,145
653.
Shit! It's not working!

56
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,614
- You're hell of an actor, Laughlin.
- Who was acting?

57
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,313
You're still alive, aren't you?

58
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,420
- Repeat that code.
- Okay!

59
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,193
Weiss, what's the holdup?
Come on!

60
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,098
The linking computer
is denying the code.

61
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,802
The walls are blocking the signal.
It's not happening.

62
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,637
We try it outside. Move!

63
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,714
Let's go! Come on!

64
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,417
Get out of the way!

65
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,424
Open the gates!

66
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,991
Do it.

67
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,797
Shut off the deadline,
or we all lose our heads.

68
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,849
The system's blocked.
Must be an encryption lockout. Damn!

73
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,663

Seven days a week.

108
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,996
- Don't listen to it.
- I worry about the kids.

109
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,528
The network shuts down the schools.

110
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,034
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training.

111
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,637
Brainwashed by the TV.

112
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,333
We can jam the network once we find
the uplink to the satellite.

113
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,308
- Then we'll broadcast the truth.
- The truth?

114
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,639
Hasn't been popular lately.

115
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,375
Can't find the code or the uplink.

116
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,314
I don't know where the network
hid something that big.

117
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,885
But they managed.

118
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,649
Stevie, would you mind?

119
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,923
Good-bye, my lovely.

120
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,634
You're one of the cops
who locked up all my friends.

121
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,406
Burned my songs.

122
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,640
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

123
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,048
- We don't want his death on our hands.
- He's a cop.

124
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,246
- He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
- Come on, Mic.

125
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,687
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

126
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,723
We don't know that.

127
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,723
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

128
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,524
- We also know he's not one of us.
- Perhaps now he's seen too much.

129
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,732
I've seen too much? All I've seen
is a bunch of low foreheads...

130
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,237
who think they can change the world
with dreams and talk.

131
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,363
It's too late for that.

132
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,273
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

133
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,074
Nothing worth losing
your head over, though, huh?

134
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,445
You got it.

135
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,256
Hey, get out of here!

136
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,380
Well, there's your ride.
It's all set.

137
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,511
Nothing like first class.

138
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,749
Come in.
Senorita, do you want to come in?

139
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,222
Yeah. Hey, you too!

140
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,051
I guess this is it.

141
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,789
Now you, Weiss, stay out
of the national database, okay?

142
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:23,095
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the Constitution to the street punks.

143
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,365
- See you at the 10-year reunion.
- You can still join us.

144
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,997
No, thank you. My brother's
gonna get me out of the city.

145
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,939
I'm not into politics.
I'm into survival.

146
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,011
Nowadays, it's the same thing.

147
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,614
Save it for the written test.
Good luck.

148
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,580
Yeah, for all of us.

149
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,899
We need you, Damon!

150
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,503
Brenda, do you have this week's ratings,
or do I have to guess?

151
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,135
They're the same as last week,
and those were the same last month.

152
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,943
I guess we've just peaked.
But it's not like we've dropped.

153
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,948
"Not like we..."
You're beautiful, sweetheart.

154
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,350
- Sorry, Mr. Killian!
- That's all right. What's your name?

155
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,481
- Dan.
- Dan, you're doing good work.

156
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,386
- Don't worry. Okay?
- Thank you. Thank you.

157
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,858
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping the floor tomorrow...

158
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,694
you'll be mopping it
for the rest of the week.

159
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,233

Your new jackets are fantastic.

00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,803

Hey, how are my people today?

163
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,774
- Fine, sir. Thank you.
- You're looking good.

165
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,782
Damon, thank God! TheJustice
Department's calling every 10 minutes.

166
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,253
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

167
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,256
Got my coffee?

168
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,020
- I want to know what we got, all right?
- All right. Let's see.

169

170

Kitchen, toast and coffee.

00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:00,077
<i>Are you ready for pain?
Are you ready for suffering?</i>

173
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,846
<i>If the answer is yes...</i>

174
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,253
<i>then you're ready for
Captain Freedom's workout.</i>

175
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,384
<i>Yes, it's America's own
Captain Freedom.</i>

176
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:14,159
<i>Ten-time national champion. The greatest
stalker to ever play the game.</i>

177
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,769
<i>All right now, all you runners.
Ready, get set, go.!</i>

178
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,202
<i>We interrupt Captain Freedom's workout
to bring you this urgent news bulletin.</i>

179
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,331
<i>The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search...</i>

180
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,742
<i>for Benjamin A. Richards,
known as the Butcher of Bakersfield.</i>

181
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,680
<i>Richards, a former police officer,
was the helicopter pilot...</i>

182
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,978
<i>who went berserk 18 months ago,
firing without warning...</i>

183
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,681
<i>on a crowd of innocent civilians.</i>

184
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,950
<i>If you see this man,
do not approach him.</i>

185
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,961
<i>Contact your local block warden.
He is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

186
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,490
Don't make a sound. Understand?
Who are you? A friend of my brother's?

187
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,737
- What are you talking about?
- This is his apartment.

188
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,111
I moved in last month. They told me
the last tenant was taken away for...

189
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,773
- Yes?
- For reeducation.

190
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,108
Help!

191
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,216
<i>Asesino in my house! El Butcher
of Bakersfield's in my bathroom!</i>

192
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,384
<i>That's the ticket.
No pain, no gain.</i>

193
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,022
Let go of me! Let me go!

194
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,827
Now, listen to me.
I'll only say this once.

195
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,528
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

196
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,800
- Yeah, sure.
- Now be quiet and stay still...

197
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,432
and I'm out in five minutes.

198
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,715
<i>Hi, this is Amber.
I'm not home right now.</i>

199
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,479
<i>I'm out having a wonderful time with
glamorous people in a fabulous place.</i>

200
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,250
<i>So, when you hear the tone, control
yourjealousy and leave your message.</i>

201
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,654
<i>- "Baby Face"March.
- Are you kidding me? Next!</i>

202
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,528
How's this one? Case 114.
Schoolteacher.

203
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,829
Killed his wife and mother-in-law at a
faculty dinner party with a steak knife.

204
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,371
Yeah. See, I like that quality.

205
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,601
He's the sort that the neighbors say,
"Such a quiet man.

206
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,770
Never too busy to say hello."
But look at him.

207
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,180
He weighs 120 pounds.
He wouldn't last 30 seconds.

208
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,978
Who else?

209
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,452
What about those bank robbers?
The ones that made that suicide pact.

210
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,889
- Did they commit suicide?
- Obviously not, Damon.

211
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,085
Then they're unreliable.

212
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,062
I got a friend at a talent agency.
Maybe they've got an axe murderer.

213
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,699
Hello, gorgeous.

214
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,132
- Somebody with stamina.
- Tony!

215
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,339
Pipe that feed in here now.

216
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,844
Take a look at this.
This is yesterday's prison break.

217
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,877
Look.

218
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,413
Look at that mother move.

219
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,179
- Is he beautiful? Who is he?
- Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards.

220
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,651
The cop from the massacre?

221
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,816
Sensational! Perfect contestant.
I want him.

222
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,121
- Can't have him.
- Why not?

223
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,493
You know our contract.
We never get military prisoners.

224
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,466
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

225
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,764
Yeah? Well, they'll get him for me.

226
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,502
Cadres can't have it both ways.

227
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,267
They want ratings? I can get
10 points for his biceps alone.

228
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,467
Hello, this is Killian.

229
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,775
Get me theJustice Department,
entertainment division.

230
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,781
No, hold that. Operator?

231
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,080
Get me the president's agent.

232
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,952
What is this?

233
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,921
That's my synthesizer setup.

234
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,684
I'm a musician.

235
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,120
Well, I'm really a singer.

236
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,359
I write music for the network.
Have you heard their theme song...

237
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,834
"We Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife"?
I wrote that.

238
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,166
You must be very proud of yourself.

239
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,873
It's really nothing.

240
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,602
Look at this.

241
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,077
They're all on the censored list.

242
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,274
And look what we have here.

243
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,909
This looks like black-market clothing.

244
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:59,285
- And you wrote the network jingle.
- Come on. Everybody does it.

245
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,625
Money.

246
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,622
That's what I need.
Money.

247
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:09,631
Money's not going to do you any good.
You don't have a travel pass.

248
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,693
You do.

249
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,168
Now I do.

250
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,007
Let's see.

251
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,079
Now, where should we go?

252
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,346
Maybe someplace warm.
I need to work on my tan anyway.

253
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,252
You get so pale in prison.

254
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,415
There you are.

255
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,393
Good.
Now, I'm going to untie you.

256
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,860
And then you're gonna get dressed.

257
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,296
And then you're gonna come with me.

258
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,801
Oh, yeah?
Well, why should I?

259
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,068
Because I'm going to say please.

260
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,673
Well, why didn't you say so?

261
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,116
<i>All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville
and Mandelaburg are on schedule.</i>

262
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,986
<i>Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.</i>

263
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,025
<i>All Mideast flights are canceled
until further notice.</i>

264
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,531
You'll never pull this off.

265
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,932
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

266
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,862
Face it, you're screwed.

267
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,529
So why don't you forget about all this
and turn yourself in?

268
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,073
You know...

269
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,370
you have a very negative attitude.

270
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,777
Now remember, I can break your neck
like a chicken's.

271
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,378
Travel pass.

272
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,452
What a beautiful day today.

273
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,456
I can practically taste
those pina coladas.

274
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,253
- Right, sweetheart?
- Miss?

275
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,594
You didn't put it
in your purse again, did you?

276
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:51,396
Last vacation she put my credit cards
in there, and we couldn't find them.

277
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,439
- Here. Could you hold this, please?
- You want to move it up there?

278
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,430
We got a plane to catch.

279
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,504
Go on! Go on!

280
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,872
You can't live with them...

281
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,675
- and you can't live without them.
- This is ridiculous!

282
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,352
I'm warning you, I get sick...

283
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,658
air sick, car sick.

284
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,354
I'm gonna throw up all over you.

285
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,357
Go ahead. It won't show
on this shirt.

286
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,846
Help!
He's Ben Richards!

287
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,473
He's trying to kidnap me!
Help!

288
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,716
<i>Positive ID.
Benjamin A. Richards.</i>

289
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,985
<i>Priority-one fugitive.
All units, terminal seven.</i>

290
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,602
All right. We're on him.
Close in!

291
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,411
Go! Go! Move!

292
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,017
You move and you're dead!

293
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,244
Hi, cutie pie.

294
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,882
You know, one of us
is in deep trouble.

295
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,810
You know who I am?

296
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,614
I've seen you before.

297
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,780
You're the asshole on TV.

298
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,985
That's funny. I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

299
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,894
I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.

300
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,229
Ben, I think we might be able
to help each other out.

301
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,237
I've got the brains,
and you've got talent.

302
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,703
You've got more.
You've got talent...

303
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,277
you've got charisma,
and you've got balls.

304
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,938
That's why I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

305
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,379
And that's why...

306
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,419
I'd like you to volunteer to appear...

307
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,250
<i>on tomorrow's broadcast
of The Running Man.</i>

308
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,654
Fuck you.

309
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,589
You're a brilliant conversationalist.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

310
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,031
Take a look.

311
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,971
Isn't that your old
schoolteacher buddy there? Huh?

312
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,202
There's your other buddy
who helped you in the prison infirmary.

313
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:48,774
Weiss. Laughlin.
What are you gonna do with them?

314
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,372
Well, that's really
up to you, Ben.

315
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:57,147
<i>You see, I created The Running Man,
but I don't make the rules.</i>

316
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,483
I got a contract
with the government.

317
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,651
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show. You've seen it.

318
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,826
You know at least
you've got a chance.

319
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,229
But your buddies, Ben...

320
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,231
get the B list.

321
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,764
<i>So if you don't do
The Running Man tomorrow...</i>

322
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,774
Weiss and Laughlin...

323
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,843
are gonna go on...

324
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,672
in your place.

325
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,871
What do you say?

326
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,758
We'll see how far this clown runs
when we're done with him.

327
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,358
Starting barium IV.

328
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,697
That's a go.

329
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,171
Reading all systems down the line.

330
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,605
Your bird is singing
loud and clear.

331
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,634
All systems check out.

332
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,508
Mandibular restraint.

333
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,985
Interphalangic injection.

334
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,325
Deltoid I M injection.

335
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,523
- Procedure completed.
- Takes care of him.

336
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,507
Sons of bitches!

337
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,702
He's wrapped.
Knock him out till show time.

338
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,613
<i>These guys never stop competing.</i>

339
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,946
<i>I get thirstyjust watching them,
and in my line of work...</i>

340
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,880
<i>I can't afford that filled-up feeling.</i>

341
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:12,087
<i>That's why I drink Cadre Cola.</i>

342
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,555
<i>It hits the spot.</i>

343
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,588
<i>The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards...</i>

344
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,791
<i>was filmed yesterday
by runway security cameras.</i>

345
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,132
<i>Richards's hostage, Amber Mendez,
was unharmed.</i>

346
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,104
<i>Some airport personnel
were not so lucky...</i>

347
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:33,574
<i>like the ticket agent and security guard
Richards shot at point-blank range...</i>

348
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,304
<i>when he arrived at the airport.</i>

349
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,745
<i>- But that's not true.
- They were taken to Cadre Hospital...</i>

350
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,182
<i>where they remain
in guarded condition.</i>

351
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,413
<i>And now, back to
Climbing for Dollars.</i>

352
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,035
Mr. Richards.

353
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,403
I'm your court-appointed
theatrical agent.

354
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,581
It's time.

355
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,467
And digital effects number one.

356
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,662
Roll process mod.

357
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,198
<i>Okay, you guys.
Hey, here we are.</i>

358
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,813
Hey, over here! Here!

359
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,846
Big crowd tonight.

360
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,080
Better there than in the streets.

361
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,244
Who's your number one stalker?

362
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,150
Hey, Buzzsaw!
Slice those runners for me!

363
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,422
He touched me! You guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

364
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,770
Don't touch the hair!

365
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,861
Go!

366
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,834
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

367
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,969
- Yes.
- Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

368
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,414
You're lucky to be alive.
I mean, that guy, he's killed, what...

369
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,543
60, 80, 100 people?

370
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,250
- Not according to him, he hasn't.
- That's what they all say.

371
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,052
"Whereas the victim contests this...

372
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,663
and whereas network and victim
have in past been combatants...

373
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,389
ad hoc de facto...

374
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,466
the parties herein
have agreed to disagree.

375
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,126
This is mutually consented
to be de jure...

376
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,762
and therefore parties have certain
obligations to each other.

377
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,342
Respective rights and obligations..."

378
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,206
Boy.

379
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,904
Lucky he didn't kill you too...

380
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,449
or rape you and kill you...

381
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,449
or kill you, then rape you.

382
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,747
"Conflicts between your estate..."

383
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,948
I mean, a guy like that...

384
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,583
what would stop him?

385
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,024
Yeah.

386
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,653
What would?

387
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,392
Look, Amy, I have to
pass on that drink.

388
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,900
I just remembered
I have some paperwork to do.

389
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,028
<i>- I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?
- The producer ofThe Running Man...</i>

390
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,506
<i>and everyone's favorite showman...</i>

391
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,838
<i>Damon Killian.!</i>

392
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,517
Yeah! Thank you!
You're beautiful!

393
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,486
I love you. Yes!

394
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,090
You're beautiful!

395
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,749
Thank you!

396
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,290
Shh!

397
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,160
It's...

398
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,028
show time!

399
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,102
Yeah!

400
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,771
All right! Now, tell me.

401
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,174
What's the number one
television show...

402
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,747
in the whole wide world?

403
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,907
<i>The Running Man.!</i>

404
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,317
And who loves you,
and who do you love?

405
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,752
Damon!

406
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,117
One more time!

407
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,418
Damon!

408
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,617
Yes!

409
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,290
Phil, my announcer.

410
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,162
<i>I heard the warm-up today,
and I got to tell you...</i>

411
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,634
<i>honestly, Phil, I don't think
I've ever heard you funnier.</i>

412
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,832
<i>I'm just kidding, guys.
You're great at yourjob.</i>

413
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,933
<i>Too bad it isn't music.</i>

414
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,446
"Ad infinitum for cassettes...

415
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,208

and all other methods
of recordings known or unknown."

417
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,959
Sign here.

418
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,232
Here, here.
Use my back, victim.

419
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,242
Don't forget to send me a copy.

420
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,043
The love of my life,
my number one fan...

421
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,289
Mrs. McArdle!

422
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,416
- How you doin'?
- Just fine.

423
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:58,388
I want a big kiss, now,
but remember, no tongues.

424
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,923
- Bless you.
- Sit down, little darling.

425
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,900
We have one hell
of a show for you tonight.

426
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,233
Phil, please, if you will...

427
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:15,210
introduce tonight's
guest runner...

428
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,075
and watch that screen.

429
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,911
<i>Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.</i>

430
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,677
<i>He's Ben Richards...</i>

431
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,618
<i>the brutal slayer of 60 men,
women and children...</i>

432
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,020
<i>in the Bakersfield Massacre.</i>

433
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,889
<i>Food riot in progress.</i>

434
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,723
<i>Approximately 1,500 civilians.</i>

435
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,795
<i>Moving in.</i>

436
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,058
<i>Yankee Nine-niner,
the crowd is unarmed.</i>

437
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,034
<i>Repeat, unarmed.
Abort attack.</i>

438
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,865
<i>- Acknowledge, Yankee Nine-niner.
- The hell with you.</i>

439
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,099
<i>Lt. Sanders, take command.
Detain Richards and return to base.</i>

440
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,508
<i>Acknowledge, Yankee Nine-niner.
Acknowledge.! Return to base.!</i>

441
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,878
<i>Those are innocent, unarmed people
down there.! Cease fire.! Cease fire.!</i>

442
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,675
Well, we all know
the aftermath...

443
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,244
grieving parents...

444
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,780
orphaned children...

445
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,283
and a nation shocked to its very core.

446
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,114
Here he is...

447
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:34,156
ready to pay the price
for our home audience...

448
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,350
in person...

449
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,759
the Butcher of Bakersfield!

450
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,809
Now, Ben Richards
could have gone to prison...

451
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,214
<i>but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man.</i>

452
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,183
<i>- Risking everything for a chance...
- Excuse me.</i>

453
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,949
<i>At our fabulous prizes, like a trial
byjury, suspended sentence...</i>

454
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,183
<i>maybe even a full pardon...</i>

455
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:46,662
<i>like our previous winners
Whitman, Price and Haddad.!</i>

456
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,392
<i>You remember them.
Whitman, Price and Haddad.!</i>

457
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,036
<i>There they are.!
And at this very moment...</i>

458
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,798
<i>they're basking under the Maui sun...</i>

459
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,168
<i>their debt to society...</i>

460
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,267
<i>paid in full.</i>

461
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,747
<i>Speaking of prizes, you don't have to be
a menace to society to be a winner...</i>

462
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,045
<i>'cause you folks in the audience
will get a chance too.</i>

463
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,451
<i>Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.</i>

464
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,649
<i>Damon, how about a year's supply
of Orthopure Procreation Pills...</i>

465
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,923
<i>adult and kiddie sizes, and the latest
edition ofThe Running Man home game.</i>

466
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,160
<i>Ben, I know you're dying to
get into that game zone...</i>

467
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,930
and show us the same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

468
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,767
Well, first, I've got
a little surprise for you.

469
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,210
We all know
you're a big, tough guy, Ben...

470
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,077
but that doesn't mean
you're a loner.

471
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,017
And it takes a big man to admit
that he needs his friends.

472
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,748
We didn't want to break up
a winning team...

473
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,257
so here they are,
ready to go for broke...

474
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,384
right by your side.

475
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,795
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ben's buddies...

476
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:01,030
Harold Weiss and William Laughlin.

477
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,436
Son of a bitch!

478
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,108
<i>You know how this works.</i>

479
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,114
<i>The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks...</i>

480
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,844
<i>left over from the big quake of'97.</i>

481
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,251
<i>I don't think any of us
will ever forget that.</i>

482
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,259
Once inside the zone,
the runners have three hours.

483
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,987
They've got to go
through all four game quads.

484
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,233
Three hours or less,
and they're gonna need every second.

485
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:33,226
- 'Cause you know who's on their tail?
- The stalkers!

486
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,166
- Who?
- The stalkers!

487
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,040
And you know what happens then!

488
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,277
Anything goes!

489
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,141
- What?
- Anything goes!

490
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,341
Right!
Without further ado...

491
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,978
it's time to start running!

492
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,026
On your marks, get set...

493
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,733
Killian.

494
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,929
I'll be back.

495
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,804
Only in a rerun.

496
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:14,876
Go!

497
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,141
- Go!
- You son of a bitch!

498
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,514
Go!

499
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,020
Yes!

500
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,170
All systems go.

501
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,713
Vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.

502
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,020
"Edited for television."

503
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,586
"Raw footage."

504
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,087
<i>Edith Wiggins, come on down.!</i>

505
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,106
Whoa, whoa, Edith.

506
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,770
You look like you might have done
a little stalking yourself.

507
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,751
All right. Now, we need you
to give me the name...

508
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:38,211
of the stalker that we send out to hunt
down those three desperate criminals.

509
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,024
Give me 10 seconds, please.

510
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,087
Come on, come on.
Place your bets.

511
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,328
Dynamo, 3 to 1.

512
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,896
<i>Time's up.</i>

513
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,265
No more bets.

514
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,533
Back off! Come on!

515
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,233
<i>I don't know.
They're all so good.</i>

516
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,843
Quickly!

517
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,139
My husband and my little boy
have their favorites.

518
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:08,276
- But I like my men big and cuddly.
- Yeah? Who is it?

519
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,852
Subzero!

520
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,285
All right! Okay!

521
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:17,554
We're looking for Subzero!

522
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,458
Yeah!

523
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,068
<i>And now, our first stalker
of the evening...</i>

524
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,642
<i>a Cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills.</i>

525
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:36,238
<i>Let's welcome the incredible iceman,
who slices his enemies limb from limb...</i>

526
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,605
<i>into quivering, bloody sushi...</i>

527
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,276
<i>Professor Subzero.!</i>

528
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,492
Damon, here in the locker room...

529
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,934
there's a lot of excitement here,
a lot of adrenaline.

530
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,633
The stalkers know there's 400 square
blocks of game zone out there...

531
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:42,507
<i>and anything can happen
in the next three hours.</i>

532
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,946
<i>- I remember once when I was...
- Sorry, Cap. Just been informed...</i>

533
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,212
the runners have entered the first quad.

534
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,480
Let's go there now, live!

535
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,461
- Faster!
- Get going.

536
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,900
Come on. Bring your money.
Give it to me!

537
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,737
First blood. You pay your money,
you make your choice.

538
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,139
Hey. How about you?

539
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,053
It's cold.

540
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,229
What is this?

541
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,714
I guess they want us to stay.

542
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,455
Subzero does it again!

543
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,621
A triple hit!

544
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,323
Let's get out of here!

545
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,026
Weiss, come on! Go!

546
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:48,667
Oh, look at this.
An ICS home video. Yeah!

547
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,538
<i>And The Running Man...</i>

548
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,470
home version right here for you.

549
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,670
Get me out of here, you guys!

550
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,573
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

551
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,455
Come on, big boy!

552
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,392
Get me out of here, you guys!

553
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,169
Will, look out!

554
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,706
Kill that son of a bitch!

555
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,921
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

556
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,838
<i>Hey, Killian.!</i>

557
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,069
Here is Subzero.

558
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,112
Now plain zero.

559
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:53,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is... just horrible.

560
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,258
Words can't express
what we're all feeling...

561
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,596
at this very moment.

562
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,499
A great champion has fallen.

563
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:09,510
We'll be back
right after these important messages.

564
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,875
Pull!

565
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,607
- You all right?
- Yeah. Boy.

566
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,611
What the hell is that?

567
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,184
- It's gas.
- Let's get out of here.

568
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,919
Sure glad we took care of Subzero.

569
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,292
Yeah, he was a real
pain in the neck.

570
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:31,094
Huh?
I know a stalker died.

571
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,460
Well, it had to happen
sooner or later.

572
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,964
Yeah, well, it is
a contact sport, right?

573
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,839
Yes, but you guys atJustice,
you cannot have it both ways.

574
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,280
You want ratings, you want people
in front of the TV sets...

575
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,975
instead of picket lines.

576
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,350
<i>Well, you ain't gonna get that
with reruns of Gilligan's Island.</i>

577
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,787
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

578
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,196
Yeah, the one with the boat.

579
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,129
Buzzsaw! Buzzsaw! Buzzsaw!

580
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,833
Fireball! Fireball!

581
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,765
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

582
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,500
Leon.

583
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,077
I don't know.
I think maybe Dynamo...

584
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,681
but Buzzsaw was
last year's champion.

585
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:22,683
- I can't decide.
- Then don't decide, Leon.

586
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,947
Hard decisions
call for hard solutions.

587
00:50:26,182 --> 00:50:30,178
And here are two hard asses
ready to step in and take charge.
