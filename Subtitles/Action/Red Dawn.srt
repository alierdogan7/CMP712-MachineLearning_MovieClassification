00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,353
What?

706
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,388
Laurie Stewart.

707
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,958
Who?

708
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,096
Camping? Memorial Day weekend?

I have no idea what you're talking about...

710
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,862
We had that huge barbecue
and I ended up getting food poisoning,

711
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,301
so I was in and out of my tent
all night puking,

712
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,396
and that's when I saw the two of you
ducking into the lake together.

713
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,302
- Oh, that Laurie Stewart.
- Oh, yeah, that one.

You know, she was a good kisser.

717
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,152
- She smelled like Aqua Net.
- What?

718

719
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,856
Shit, that's right.

720
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,650
She had that terrible haircut.

721
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,425
The one that I immediately copied
and wore all through middle school,

722
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,622
which you never noticed, by the way.

723
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,095

They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads

794
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,004
and landed ground troops
where they needed strategic pressure.

But if we had it,

830
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,346
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out

831

01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,145
Smith, you're on.

883
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,821
C'mon, ladies, show us your guns.

884
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,637
Shit!

885
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:06,881
Come on!

886
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,626
We gotta get out of here!

887
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,929
Run!

888
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,844
He was just here.

889
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,320
Keep them away from the box.

890
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,006
Shit!

891
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,348
Not gonna happen.

892
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,017
Grenade!

893
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,225
Tanner!

894
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,248
- Get that thing out of here. I'll cover.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

895
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,295
God damn it, Matty.
Get that thing out of here. Go!

896
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,774
Matt Eckert!

897
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:38,614
(BEEPING)

898
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,330
You fucked with the wrong family.

899
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,902
Get this out of here, Robert.

900
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,774
Where's the box?

901
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:10,008
It's safe.

902
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,518
All right, let's get out of here.

903
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,423
It's pretty deep.

904
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,559
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt. It's okay.

905
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,137
Hey.

906
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,015
Hey.

907
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:57,992
I'm okay.

908
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:06,896
I'll be right there.

909
01:19:09,772 --> 01:19:11,399
Collateral.

910
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:20,575
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

911
01:19:20,716 --> 01:19:22,411
Yeah. Sure.

912
01:19:26,422 --> 01:19:28,356
What's up?

913
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:30,491
Nothing. I...

914
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,890
I was just thinking, you know, and...

915
01:19:36,799 --> 01:19:38,926
I'm not very good at this, man.

916
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:40,700
Good at what?

917
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,575
Giving you props when you get it right.

918
01:19:49,545 --> 01:19:51,775
And letting you know that

919
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:54,579
I'm proud of you.

920
01:19:58,521 --> 01:19:59,886
(SNICKERS)

921
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:05,083
Yeah.

922
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,624
Yes, Jed. That's not one of your strengths.

923
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:11,221
- No.
- No, it's not.

924
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:23,508
So, how about that beer now?

925
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:30,575
Wow.

926
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:33,555
My first one.

927
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:39,818
Where's yours?

928
01:20:40,763 --> 01:20:42,458
She stole it from me.

929
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,667
Go get it.

930
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:00,883
(GUNSHOT)

931
01:21:04,587 --> 01:21:07,078
Matt! Watch the back!

932
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:20,600
Tanner! Cover me!

933
01:21:24,807 --> 01:21:26,172
Robert, get Erica out of here.

934
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:28,971
- I'm not leaving without you!
- God damn it, do what I say, Robert!

935
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:31,238
When you hit the deck, watch your ass.

936
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:34,941
I'll catch up. Go!

937
01:21:39,956 --> 01:21:40,923
(SOBBING)

938
01:21:42,725 --> 01:21:44,989
TONI: Help me! Jed!

939
01:21:45,695 --> 01:21:47,856
- Come on, Toni.
- We can't leave him!

940
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,327
Come on!

941
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:51,829
God damn it, Toni.
We need you back in the fight.

942
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:55,370
Come on! I know. I know.
Tanner! Can we get out your way?

943
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:56,460
Make it quick.

944
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,164
Go, go, go, go!

945
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:02,042
Move your asses!

946
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,317
(PULLS GRENADE PIN)

947
01:22:11,887 --> 01:22:13,218
Let's go!

948
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:23,295
Smith!

949
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,815
How did they know?

950
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:25,959
How did they know where we were, bro?

951
01:23:26,162 --> 01:23:27,720
- They must have followed us.
- No.

952
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:29,754
No way they could track us.

953
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:40,068
Daryl, lift up your jacket.

954
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:43,304
Let me see this. Let me see it.

955
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:47,310
Oh, shit.

956
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:49,478
What is it?

957
01:23:49,952 --> 01:23:51,146
It's not a knife wound.

958
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:54,117
They tagged him with something.

959
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:55,915
Like what they do with animals.

960
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:57,719
What?

961
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,359
They're tracking him?

962
01:24:00,196 --> 01:24:01,629
Daryl.

963
01:24:02,064 --> 01:24:03,122
You...

964
01:24:03,232 --> 01:24:04,631
- No.
- You led them right to us.

965
01:24:04,834 --> 01:24:07,894
- I didn't know!
- You led them right to us!

966
01:24:08,237 --> 01:24:09,795
Let go!

967
01:24:10,706 --> 01:24:12,196
You killed Jed!

968
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:16,838
Matty, he killed Jed.

969
01:24:26,455 --> 01:24:29,185
You can cut it out of him, right, Robert?
Cut it out of him.

970
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,952
There's no way. With what?

971
01:24:31,193 --> 01:24:32,558
Matt, we got to move.

972
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:34,569
Let's just get back in the car.

973
01:24:34,663 --> 01:24:36,528
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.

974
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:39,632
They'll find us.

975
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:41,732
What else are we supposed to do?

976
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:52,203
Robert.

977
01:24:52,414 --> 01:24:54,405
Get me some gear.

978
01:24:54,717 --> 01:24:55,775
What?

979
01:24:56,085 --> 01:24:57,643
They could be here any minute.

980
01:25:03,559 --> 01:25:04,992
Daryl.

981
01:25:17,473 --> 01:25:19,031
Can I borrow your SAW?

982
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:17,425
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

983
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:19,931
We got plenty of room.

984
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:23,705
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.

985
01:26:24,607 --> 01:26:26,302
We've all lost something, Matt.

986
01:26:28,777 --> 01:26:30,176
You've done enough.

987
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,374
You've done more than enough.

988
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:37,510
I appreciate that.

989
01:26:44,093 --> 01:26:45,924
The fact is

990
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:49,962
we're not doing too bad

991
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:52,326
for a bunch of kids.

992
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:55,128
We're going to fight.

993
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:58,773
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.

994
01:26:58,974 --> 01:27:01,943
And we're used to it.

995
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,545
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

996
01:27:05,748 --> 01:27:09,149
Because we're not going to sell it to you.

997
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:12,047
It's too ugly for that.

998
01:27:12,788 --> 01:27:14,722
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

999
01:27:14,924 --> 01:27:17,757
when you're fighting for your family,

1000
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:20,462
it all hurts a little less

1001
01:27:21,997 --> 01:27:23,726
and makes a little more sense.

1002
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:30,295
<i>Because for them, this is just a place.</i>

1003
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,132
<i>But for us, this is our home.</i>
