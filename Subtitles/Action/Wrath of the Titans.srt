...he will allow we few gods who remain
to keep our immortality.

You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.

You forget our father once tried to kill us.

Na, I remember everything.

213
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,367
And what exactly does our father want from us
in return for our precious immortality?

214

...for the death of four Chimera. We have...

272
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,837
offended the gods. We need to pray.

As soldiers always have.

is your enemy now?

and then I can get home.

What is this far?
- It's to cut the cars for my trireme.

282
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,489
I need 110 cars...

- This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.

00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,053
...she lacks you up like a pet rabbit?

294
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,988
He wanted my hand in marriage.

295
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,095
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

296
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,356
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

297
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,933
Actually, you gut the eyes of your father.

307
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,062

Goad. Could you do me a favour?

312
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,632
Anything.
- Go to hell.

That's exactly where I'm going.

00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,973
I just need information.

315
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,482
Your father told me...

316
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,881
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.

317
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,226

318
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,794
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

319
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,167

321
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:48,974

Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

326
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,856
Let me see. What else have I dreamt of
as I lay here in my cell?

327
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,396
Don't push it.

328
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,602
I'm going to need a boat, your fastest boat.

329
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,034
The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.

330
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,701
Where?

331
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,637
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I'll show you.

332

Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

335
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:34,152
Because the first time I ware it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

336
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,992
Send ward to every regiment...

337
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,226
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.

Regroup at the garrison!
You can't leave...

342
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,147
...Greece without a queen.

343
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,450
Are you giving me orders now?

344
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,400
Unchain him.

345
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,368
Show me where the Fallen One is.

346
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,376
Who is the Fallen One?

347
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,745
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.

348
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,615
And who's Hephaestus?

349
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,424
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

350
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,728
Hades' pitchfork...

351
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,294
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

352
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,424
Put those together...

353
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,898
...they farm the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...

354
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,536
to defeat Kronos.

355
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,763
But Hephaestus lives on the island of Kail.
Ha-ha-ha.

356
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,408
Which no one has ever found.

357
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,576
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor'?

358
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,740
It dues...

359
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,211
...exist. I can take you.

360
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,609
Unchain me and give me the trident.

361
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,153
If you unchain him, he'll jump off
this boat, you'll never see him again.

362
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,518
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

363
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,748

If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

551
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,243
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

552
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,753
There can't be much time
before his life farce...

553
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,049
...is completely sapped.

554
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,055
But how do we get to him?

555
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,589
We can't.

556
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,625
Normally you'd be right, young man.

557
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,562
But when I designed this marvel...

558
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,466
...I included a secret passage, a shortcut...

559
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,699
...if you will.

560
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,003
- You designed Tartarus?
Oh, aye.

561
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,069
And built it.

562
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,740
Aphrodite, I could...

563
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,214
not only get you inside...

564
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,752
...I could give you a guided tour.

565
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,425
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

566
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,825
...to be completely impregnable...

567
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,932
...I built it from the outside in.

568
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,933
So I had to leave a passage
for me self to get cut...

569
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,971
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

570
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,338
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

571
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,309
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

572
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,504

573

576
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,287
I'm afraid, brother.

577
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,657
Is that what you want me to say?
I'm a god and I'm afraid.

578
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,798
Well, you should be.

at least their souls go to another place.

581
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,507

Came here.

922
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:08,319
I've got a story to tell. Came and meet...

923
01:28:08,482 --> 01:28:10,155
your Uncle Navigator.

924
01:28:20,126 --> 01:28:21,605
I'm Agenor.

925
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:23,271
Helius.

926
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:26,707
I've read that you are
a great disappointment.

927
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:29,113
That's right, I am great.

928
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:31,306
This is my nurse, Tiger.

929
01:28:45,385 --> 01:28:47,661
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.

930
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:49,994
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

931
01:28:50,156 --> 01:28:53,296
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...

932
01:29:12,412 --> 01:29:13,652
Dad...

933
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:17,222
...I'm actually lacking forward
to going home.

934
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:22,228
I've decided being a baring fisherman
isn't that bad.

935
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:25,195
You know we can't go back home.

936
01:29:42,142 --> 01:29:43,382
Take it.

937
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:49,918
You're Helius.

938
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:53,929
You're sun of Perseus...

939
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:56,356
...the grandson of Zeus.

940
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:00,732
Take it.

941
01:30:11,705 --> 01:30:13,048
It's heavy.

942
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,617
Yeah, it is.

943
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:19,915
Is it too much?

944
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:28,728
Na.
