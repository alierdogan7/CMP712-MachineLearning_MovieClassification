"Wow, there's a nice... There's...

here to see Eric Sacks.

Thank you.

APRIL: I've been working on a story.

708
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,048
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

709
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,009
that are fighting back against the Foot.

710
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,651
I think you and my father
may have created them.

711
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,680
Uh, I'm not sure I...

712
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,683
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

713
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,569
about Project Renaissance?

714
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,801
Hmm.

715
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Well, um, it was a dream.

716
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,964
A dream that died with your father.

717
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,326
What if it isn't dead?

718
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,323
That's impossible.

719
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,562
We lost all our research in the fire,

720
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,564
all our specimens, everything.

721
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,287

trying to replicate the results.

722

- This can't be real.
- it is real.

724

about Project Renaissance?

726
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,521
- Yes.
- Come with me.

727
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,770
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

728
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,842
My father went to Vietnam.

729
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,364
Didn't come back.

730
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,926
I was an outsider in a foreign land.

731
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,481
A freak.

732
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,120
I was a powerless and helpless boy.

733
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,966
Until a local <i>sensei</i>
took me under his wing.

734
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,730
And he saved me.

735
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,246
Taught me lessons that I later
shared with your father.

736
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,931
Ninth-century Japan.

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,082
An evil warlord ruled the land.

738
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,210
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

739
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,124
Death and disease
and suffering ran rampant.

740
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,884
Not unlike the Foot Clan

741
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,769
and what they'd like to do to our city.

742
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,963
Then one day, a hero arose.

743
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,289
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

744
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,050
to the warlord's poison.

745
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,804
The cure-all

746
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,123
for his evil.

747
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,130
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

748
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,368
We developed a mutagen

749
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,523
capable of stimulating self-repair

750
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,568
on a cellular level.

751
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,048
What were you going to do with it?

752
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,642
Imagine New York City,

753
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,244
being victim to a chemical attack.

754
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,405
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

755
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,926
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

756
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
Those test subjects, those turtles...

757
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,131
Running in their blood
is the last of this precious mutagen.

758
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,726
And up until a few moments ago,

759
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,369
I thought we failed.

760
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,847
I thought they died in the fire. How...

761
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
How could they have lived?

762
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,326
Because I saved them.

763
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,170
Of course you did.

764
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,921
