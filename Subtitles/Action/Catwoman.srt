1
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,613
It all started on the day that I died.

2
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:32,524
If there had been an obituary...

3
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,891
...it would've described
the unremarkable life...

4
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,402
... of an unremarkable woman...

5
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,563
... survived by no one.

6
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,405
But there was no obituary...

7
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,729
... because the day that I died...

8
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:48,892
... was also the day I started to live.

9
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,010
But that comes later.

10
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:03,613
This was my life.

11
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:06,605
Days blended together,
consistently ordinary...

12
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,003
... thanks to a job that was the practical
version of my passion.

13
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,283
-I'm sorry.
-Watch where you' re going!

14
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,968
I was supposed to be an artist by now.

15
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,241
Instead...

16
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:19,930
...I was designing ads for beauty cream.

17
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,013
-You are so addicted to that stuff, Sally.
-Happily.

18
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,846
-Beau-line is magic in a bottle.
-I don't know how you get it.

19
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:32,766
-It's not even in production yet.
-We have our ways.

20
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,371
-Hey.
-No!

21
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,925
Headaches again.
My brain's all tight and cranky.

22
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:46,813
In one week, precisely, we will Iaunch
the most exciting...

23
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:49,771
...and revolutionary product
to hit the beauty industry since...

24
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:52,412
...soap.

25
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:54,926
Beau-line.

26
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:59,530
Now, Beau-line doesn't
just hide the effects of aging...

27
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,526
...it actually reverses them.

28
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,610
However, with change...

29
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:06,124
...must come sacrifice.

30
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,251
My husband...

31
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:12,613
...and I have decided that
it's time for me to step aside...

32
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,205
...as the face of Hedare.

33
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,371
It has been a magnificent 15 years.

34
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:22,213
But we have decided to choose
a new face to represent Beau-Iine.

35
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,612
Exactly.

36
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,126
Drina.

37
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,290
The future of Hedare Beauty.

38
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,402
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I look forward...

39
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:37,086
...to seeing you at the gala, where you
can toast to Drina and our success.

40
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,444
Careful, George.
She's not old enough to drink.

41
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,447
You've got more talent than anybody
in the building, which I hate you for.

42
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:54,013
Sal, this is my first lead campaign.
It's gotta be perfect. You know that.

43
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,402
What is wrong with you?!

44
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,441
Good luck.

45
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:01,966
Yeah.

46
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,973
You simply couldn't resist it, could you?

47
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,325
You had to make
a scene out of it, Laurel.

48
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:09,613
What's the matter, George?

49
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,444
Did I steal your moment?

50
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,171
Come in!

51
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:30,971
Hi, Mr. Hedare.

52
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,449
Did you still want to see me, or...?

53
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:37,566
-Sit.
-Right. Okay.

54
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:43,651
I'm not pleased.

55
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:49,444
This isn't even close to what I wanted.

56
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:52,008
I can't imagine what on earth
you were thinking.

57
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,362
I am so sorry--

58
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,803
I mean, look at this red. It's all wrong.
I wanted it darker.

59
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:01,723
-I specifically heard you say--
-I know what I said.

60
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,813
-Okay. Maybe I misunderstood you.
-Clearly.

61
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,690
Mr. Hedare, I know I can fix it.

62
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:09,329
If you give me a chance,
I know I can fix it.

63
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,922
I do not reward incompetence.

64
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:17,212
I have no idea why I expected your art
to show better taste than your wardrobe.

65
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,325
Oh, and do try and get
a manicure, will you?

66
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,563
Oh, for God's sake, George.

67
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,213
Let her fix it.

68
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,965
She's good and you know it.

69
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,013
Whatever.

70
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,571
By tomorrow night.

71
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,687
Midnight.

72
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,965
Right. Thank you.

73
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,371
Excuse me. Hi!

74
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:28,365
Do you think you could just
maybe turn the music down...

75
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,364
...just a little bit?

76
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,491
No? Okay.

77
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,203
Kitty! Kitty.

78
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,605
How'd you get up there?
Come down here.

79
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,810
What, are you stuck?

80
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,928
You're gonna make me come out there.

81
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,893
Hey! Easy! Hold on a minute!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

82
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,133
Whatever you're thinking or feeling...

83
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,133
...it's not worth it. You understand?
I'm a cop. Maybe I can help.

84
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,566
Okay. I'm fine.

85
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,525
-It's just that--
-Listen to me.

86
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,406
We'll get through this together.
What's your name?

87
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,933
Patience Phillips.

88
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,924
But this cat....

89
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,609
Sure, sure, Patience,
and it's a real beauty.

90
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,206
-Very cute.
-The cat's not up here any more.

91
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,730
Okay. And I'm sure that
makes you very sad.

92
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,203
-What's your apartment number?
-Twenty-three!

93
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:39,727
Hold on!

94
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,122
Hurry.

95
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,532
I got you.

96
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,801
-You okay?
-Thanks.

97
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,844
You sure you're okay?

98
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,685
That was the cat.

99
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,933
You weren't kidding.

100
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,447
You actually climbed out there
to rescue your cat?

101
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,333
Yeah. I mean, no.
It's not my cat.  It's a cat.

102
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,164
To rescue somebody else's cat?

103
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,610
Well, that's something else.

104
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:21,810
Oh, my gosh, I'm late for my job!

105
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,491
-I'm on a deadline today.
-Yeah? Well, good luck with that.

106
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,682
Thanks.

107
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,166
Thank you!

108
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,492
After all, no one can defeat Father Time.

109
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:15,729
Though you did put up
a hell of a fight, didn't you?

110
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:19,886
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

111
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,572
Yes, it does.

112
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:24,131
I have a busy day today.

113
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:27,604
Drinks, then dinner.
Don't wait up, will you, darling?

114
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,973
I stopped waiting
a long time ago, George.

115
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,646
Oh, and that lunch tomorrow?

116
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,885
-Cancel that too, will you?
-Problems?

117
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:38,773
I doubt it...

118
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:42,732
...but Slavicky won't stop calling.
You know scientists.

119
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:47,649
They're worse than models. You have to
coddle them all the time like little children.

120
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:51,129
I'll have Wesley reschedule. Bye.

121
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,524
Hey! Man sandwich, 12 o'clock.

122
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,252
Oh, my God.

123
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,765
Hello, Miss Phillips.

124
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,406
Hi.

125
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:32,173
This is the officer I was telling you
about from earlier.

126
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,652
Detective Lone.

127
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:38,131
-Tom Lone.
-God, that is such a good name.

128
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:39,973
Tom Lone.

129
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:43,329
Rhymes with cone, phone, bone.

130
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,923
Not that rhyming's all that important.

131
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,682
I'll just be in my cubicle.

132
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,647
Alone.

133
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:59,409
-Hi.
-Hi.

134
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,728
How'd you get...?

135
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,173
You dropped something.

136
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,846
You can really cover a lot of ground
when you're in a hurry.

137
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,526
Thanks.

138
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,367
Is this yours?

139
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:15,086
Yeah.

140
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:16,573
-It's nice.
-Thanks.

141
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:19,326
Yeah, it kind of reminds me
of early Chagall.

142
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:20,892
Elegant, but whimsical.

143
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,173
Very much in the...

144
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:26,051
-...tradition of the old Dutch Masters.
-I'm impressed.

145
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:30,610
Don't be. I noticed all the art in your
apartment, so I Googled it at the office.

146
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,726
-No, but really, I like it.
-Thanks.

147
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:39,010
Listen, I wanted to apologize about this
morning for thinking you were a jumper.

148
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:41,773
I was hoping to make it up
by taking you to coffee.

149
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:45,766
I know this great Italian place
around the corner, Grecchio's on 6th.

150
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:49,443
Or, listen, maybe tomorrow's better.
Say, 1:00?

151
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,567
Yes.

152
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,770
-Okay.
-Yeah?

153
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,491
Okay. So tomorrow then, 1:00.

154
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:00,803
-You make sure she gets there.
-Yes, officer.

155
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:03,168
-Counting on you.
-I screw it up...

156
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,329
...you can throw away the key.

157
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,131
See you tomorrow.

158
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,886
Okay, bye.

159
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,722
Patience.

160
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:17,606
-That is a man in serious like with you.
-You think?

161
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:20,173
-Hello.
-We got a lot of work to do.

162
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,050
First, you gotta shave those legs.

163
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,573
Second, you have to wear that leather outfit
we got you for your birthday.

164
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,849
-Remember?
-First, it's only coffee.

165
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:34,725
And second, I will never, ever,
ever wear that leather outfit.

166
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,486
Good night!

167
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,203
Hi, this is Patience
in the art department.

168
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:03,048
Yeah, I'm expecting a messenger
to come and pick up--

169
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:06,250
But it's gotta be there by midnight.

170
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:10,450
Well, I....
I know it's not your fault, but....

171
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,452
Okay.

172
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,411
I'll take it myself.

173
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:48,972
Hello? Is anybody in there?

174
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,123
Oh, come on, Slavicky.

175
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,205
When did you grow a conscience?

176
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,643
I don't care that the FDA never saw
the headaches...

177
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,321
...and the nausea
and the fainting spells.

178
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,651
Those are symptoms I can live with.

179
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,206
Hello?

180
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:23,453
And with what we stand to make
from consumers demanding their fix...

181
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,444
...I can live with it being addictive.

182
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:28,686
But these side effects
from the long-term studies....

183
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:32,687
That won't happen if they keep using it.
And we'll make sure they do...

184
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,408
...because that's where
the money comes from.

185
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,205
I'm not sure any more.

186
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:42,403
Hello? Hello?

187
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,725
I thought I could live with it...

188
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:00,406
...but I can't live with turning
people into monsters.

189
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:02,402
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:06,128
You've gotta let me pull the plug.
We can't let this go on the shelves.

191
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:08,968
Who's there?

192
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,608
-Armando, come in.
-I'm on my way.

193
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,283
You can come out now.
It's okay.

194
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,762
We'd just like to ask you
a few questions.

195
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,368
Sorry.

196
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,886
But I think maybe I'm in the wrong--

197
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,290
-What are you doing?
-Don't ever do that again.

198
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,127
Where is she?

199
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,083
She ran down to waste treatment,
jumped in a pipe.

200
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,648
We don't know who she is,
but we know what she heard.

201
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,686
We can 't risk it.
Get rid of her.

202
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,811
Seal the door.

203
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,602
Patience Phillips,
I've never been so proud of you.

204
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,252
You're probably sipping
your decaf soy whatever right now...

205
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,173
... fantasizing about licking
the foam off his lips.

206
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:36,013
Wait, that's what I'm doing.
Anway, how'd the presentation go?

207
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:39,210
Did you get me free samples of it?
Listen, call me.

208
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,612
What...?

209
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,773
Hi, I'll take a decaf latte.

210
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,523
Hey, Patience, it's Tom Lone.
I'm here at Grecchio's waiting...

211
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,849
...and you 're not here.

212
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:01,646
Anyway, I gotta get back to work, so....

213
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,246
Bye.

214
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:21,403
Okay, kitty.
It's time for you to go home.

215
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:23,848
Now....

216
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:47,165
-Are you Ophelia Powers?
-Y es.

217
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:50,285
-I got your cat off a ledge and ever since--
-Why, Midnight.

218
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:53,251
You've never brought a stranger
home before.

219
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:55,485
PIease, come in.

220
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,683
No, I can't come in.
I've got to go to-- I'm late.

221
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:22,565
-Midnight.
-I'm sorry?

222
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:23,967
Her name.

223
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:29,328
She's an Egyptian Mau,
the rarest of breeds. Temple cats.

224
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:32,202
It's said that Maus have
special powers.

225
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:35,009
Like popping out of nowhere? I know.

226
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:37,011
Among other things.

227
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:42,612
Your cat....

228
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,092
Socrates!

229
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:46,687
No caffeine.

230
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,211
It makes him irritable.

231
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,012
You look a little out of sorts yourself,
my dear.

232
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:55,292
The cats, perhaps.

233
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:58,693
They seem to be taking quite
an unusual shine to you.

234
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,969
This has been a really bad day
for me already.

235
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:05,922
-I can't even remember most of yesterday.
-Perhaps I can help you.

236
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:07,721
Right.

237
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:11,205
This really isn't your problem.
I don't even know why I'm here.

238
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:14,893
-It's all right. Tell me, please.
-Really. I'm late for work.

239
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,932
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't even....
-You should come back any time. I'm always here.

240
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,521
Catnip.

241
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:38,887
No--

242
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:48,405
I'm fine. I am fine.

243
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,569
What the hell is wrong with you, Phillips?!

244
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,652
You never delivered the design!

245
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,813
You don't even know where they are.

246
00:28:56,813 --> 00:29:01,409
You do not know where they are because,
and I quote you, you "cannot remember"!

247
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:05,083
Your incompetence is staggering!

248
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,966
Are you even listening to me?

249
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:22,892
I'm sorry!

250
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,732
"Sorry"?

251
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,210
Sorry's not nearly enough.

252
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,041
Okay.

253
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,124
Then let me try the remix.

254
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:39,413
I'm sorry for every second I wasted...

255
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:44,282
...working for an untalented,
unethical egomaniac like you.

256
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:48,723
Clean out your cubicle. You are fired.

257
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,731
Wait! Mr. Hedare!

258
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,844
I didn't mean it.

259
00:29:58,613 --> 00:29:59,682
Did I?

260
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:02,651
My hero.

261
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:12,447
Where did that come from?

262
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,168
I don't know.
It's like I can't describe it.

263
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:29,808
I was saying it, but I wasn't saying it.
Do you understand?

264
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:32,805
Whoever said it has the thanks
of a grateful art department.

265
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,805
You don't understand, Sal.
I wanted to cause him pain.

266
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,526
I'm sorry.

267
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,405
-What was that?
-Allergies?

268
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:46,010
Maybe?

269
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,813
You just got fired, remember?

270
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,724
But it's so pretty.

271
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:04,013
Sal? Sal?

272
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,605
Sally?

273
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,610
Sally! Sally?

274
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:11,841
Hey.

275
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:16,013
Ever noticed when they keep you for
observation no one really observes you?

276
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:18,971
-Did they tell you what was wrong?
-Oh, they have no idea.

277
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,013
They did run a million fun tests, though.

278
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,004
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.

279
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,324
I can see you're feeling better.

280
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,813
Reminds me, what's up with the
"hot yet modest, but who cares...

281
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:32,008
...because he's so hot" detective?

282
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,213
It's not gonna work out, Sal.

283
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:37,283
Patience, you never think
it's gonna work.

284
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:42,403
Because it doesn't. Anyway, I've got a good
reason for saying it this time. Trust me.

285
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:45,325
Look, this time I refuse
to let you sabotage a good thing.

286
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:47,324
If it's broke, fix it.

287
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:51,726
All right? Now, I love you,
and he is gonna love you. Now, go.

288
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,049
Go give him some brown sugar.

289
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,813
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.

290
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:58,087
Tell me I look vulnerable.

291
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:03,206
Being good is something you keep
in your heart because you choose to put it there.

292
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:06,729
I'm not saying it's easy.
I'm not saying some people don't choose to be bad.

293
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:09,973
But I want something different for you.
I want something better.

294
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,282
-You understand?
-Yeah.

295
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:15,006
-Can I see your gun?
-No.

296
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:17,443
-You know what makes somebody--
-Will you shoot it?

297
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,252
No.

298
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,645
I want you to be the good guys.
Got it?

299
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:32,412
-Yeah.
-Let's go shoot some hoops.

300
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:43,573
I called the police station
and they said you might be here.

301
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:49,292
You never got your coffee.

302
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:56,410
Well, you're a brave man to be facing
a mob like this. No backup?

303
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:58,889
I'm used to working alone,
most of the time.

304
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:01,368
-Is that by choice, or--
-Yeah, theirs.

305
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:03,373
No, I've had partners before.

306
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:05,284
Turns out I take my job too seriously.

307
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,287
You know my friend Sally?
That's what she says about me.

308
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:11,173
She says that I'm fun-deficient.

309
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,243
-I don't believe that.
-That's what she says.

310
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:14,773
One-on-one?

311
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:17,367
-Who? Me and her?
-Yeah, come on.

312
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,486
You wanna do this?

313
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:23,651
One-on-one
One-on-one

314
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,373
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

315
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:43,965
Come on.

316
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,284
Can we have our ball back?

317
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:48,851
You don't seem so fun-deficient to me.

318
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:05,688
Mr. Hedare wanted me to inform you
he'll be at the factory the rest of the afternoon.

319
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,568
If by "factory"
you mean the Four Seasons...

320
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,888
...teaching Drina
to unlock the minibar...

321
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,607
-...consider me informed.
-Well, he just said he'll be working with--

322
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:19,041
Wesley, George hasn't said anything
meaningful to me since he said "I do."

323
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:54,563
-Hello?
-You'd think with the advances...

324
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:57,373
...in medicine, this place
would have a wet bar.

325
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:01,413
-Seems like you're feeling better.
-Some new medication I can't pronounce.

326
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:04,883
-So, what's up?
-Nothing. Just fixing a little snack.

327
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:08,050
What I'd like to know is
did you fix it with the cute cop?

328
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,005
I think I did.

329
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,890
Details! And make it good, honey.

330
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:19,405
I'm sitting here in a paper dress,
for God's sakes.

331
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:22,485
All we did was talk.
And play a little one-on-one.

332
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,413
-You know how to play basketball?
-Apparently I do.

333
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:29,201
-I even went Shaquille on his butt.
-Patience, have I taught you nothing?

334
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:32,081
You never beat a guy at sports.
It messes them up.

335
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:35,013
They end up in a men's group,
banging on a drum.

336
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:37,288
It's not like I meant to.
It just happened.

337
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:43,045
I'm telling you, Sal.
Something really,
really weird is happening to me.

338
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:46,849
-I practically jumped him.
-Hello, that's called lust, sweetheart.

339
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:49,891
-Animal attraction.
-You think?

340
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,726
What if it gets worse?

341
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:58,767
-I mean, what if the next time--
-Next time? He asked you out again?

342
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:02,528
-I love this guy.
-So do I. But it's me I' m worried about.

343
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,813
-I felt like I couldn't be myself.
-Well, feel free to be me next time.

344
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:10,283
-Sally--
-I'm teasing. Just be yourself.

345
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,731
Myself.

346
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,846
Okay.

347
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,565
-I'll try.
-Oh, I gotta go.

348
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,650
Future father of my children's coming.
Sweet dreams, honey.

349
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:25,044
Excuse me.
I think I might have a fever.

350
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:40,611
Hey!

351
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:43,128
-Shut that off!
-Get a Iife!

352
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,733
Yeah, get a life, you loser!

353
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:02,254
Sorry, babe.
This ain't the slumber party.

354
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:04,927
However...

355
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,048
...in your case,
I think I can make an exception.

356
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:08,578
I'm flattered.

357
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,330
But do you think this one time...

358
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:14,493
...you could turn the music down
just a little...

359
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,216
...bit.

360
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:30,690
Tell you what.
Why don't I do it myself?

361
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:35,414
Hey! Hey! Listen, you freak--

362
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:42,693
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Is the music still too loud?

363
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,009
Hey!

364
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:58,176
You hear that? It's called silence.

365
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,734
That's all I ever wanted.
Now, keep it down.

366
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:05,254
Thanks for the party. I had fun.

367
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,534
-Time to accessorize.
-My bike!

368
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:09,610
Amateurs.

369
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:21,138
You boys thought you could come in here
and steal all these beautiful things?

370
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:24,255
What a perfect idea.

371
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:51,687
Meow.

372
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:05,288
That was one of a kind.

373
00:44:05,538 --> 00:44:08,575
-From Egypt.
-That's a hell of a profile.

374
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:11,811
Thieves said she jumps around
like a cat.

375
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:16,575
What should we call her?
"Cat Chick"? No, no. "Cat Broad. "

376
00:44:16,938 --> 00:44:18,417
What do you got?

377
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:38,694
Cupcakes.

378
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:38,731
Midnight.

379
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:55,370
I knew you'd come back
when you were ready.

380
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,807
The goddess Bast.

381
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:21,616
The Maus are sacred to Bast.
They're her messengers.

382
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:25,691
-You wrote this?
-I was a professor for 20 years...

383
00:46:25,898 --> 00:46:27,889
...until I was denied tenure.

384
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:30,289
Male academia.

385
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:34,898
Bast is a rarity.

386
00:46:34,898 --> 00:46:37,731
A goddess of the moon,
and of the sun.

387
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:42,528
She represents the duality in all women.
Docile, yet aggressive.

388
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:45,258
Nurturing, yet ferocious.

389
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:49,688
But what does all of this
have to do with me? I mean--

390
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:52,207
What happened the other night?

391
00:46:52,898 --> 00:46:56,493
-I don't remember.
-Do you want me to tell you?

392
00:46:57,098 --> 00:46:58,292
Yes.

393
00:46:58,298 --> 00:46:59,890
You died.

394
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:03,217
What?

395
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:05,973
I didn't die. Look at me, I'm right here.

396
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:07,895
You died.

397
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,251
-But you were reborn.
-Oh, you're crazy.

398
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:15,776
-You are a crazy cat lady.
-Midnight knew your fate.

399
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:19,728
That's why she tested you.

400
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,812
To see if you were worthy
of a gift she could give you.

401
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:28,096
A gift that could change your life...

402
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:30,368
...and give you a new one.

403
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:41,726
You're not alone, child. He's saved
others before you. Look.

404
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:50,174
Catwomen are not contained
by the rules of society.

405
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:54,053
You follow your own desires.

406
00:47:54,698 --> 00:47:57,451
This is both a blessing and a curse.

407
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:01,008
You will often be alone
and misunderstood.

408
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:05,416
But you will experience a freedom
other women will never know.

409
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:10,128
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...

410
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:13,298
...every sound, incredibly heightened.

411
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:19,009
Fierce independence, total confidence,
inhuman reflexes.

412
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:23,769
-So I'm not Patience any more?
-You are Patience.

413
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:26,532
And you are Catwoman.

414
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:38,251
Accept it, child.

415
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,171
You've spent a lifetime caged.

416
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:45,855
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

417
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:48,698
...you can be free.

418
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:51,087
And freedom is power.

419
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:13,532
You saved my life, Midnight.

420
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:15,656
But somebody killed me...

421
00:49:16,938 --> 00:49:20,294
...and I've got to find out who,
and why.

422
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,329
You dealt with Slavicky?

423
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:53,410
It's done.

424
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:27,730
Oh, my God. We danced all night.

425
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:46,657
-Been here all night.
-Absolutely.

426
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,656
Keep the change.

427
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:56,177
-What can I do for you?
-White Russian.

428
00:51:56,538 --> 00:52:00,690
No ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.

429
00:52:06,138 --> 00:52:08,208
Cream. Straight up.

430
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,329
Looking for something?

431
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:11,208
The other night you killed somebody.
She was a nice girl. Why?

432
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,654
Cat got your tongue?

433
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:21,211
I don't know. They told me to flush
the pipes so I flushed the pipes.

434
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,288
-Why?
-I don't know why.

435
00:54:25,618 --> 00:54:28,007
Beau-line. There's something
wrong with Beau-line.

436
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,418
She heard something
she wasn't supposed to hear. I don't know.

437
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:33,376
And Hedare is covering it up.

438
00:55:10,618 --> 00:55:13,655
I can't live with turning people
into monsters.

439
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:37,010
Hey, hey, hey.

440
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:39,330
Wow!

441
00:55:39,538 --> 00:55:41,449
You look amazing.

442
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:43,971
-Do you like it?
-Love it.

443
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:45,538
-Like the hair?
-Love the hair.

444
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:47,415
-Did good?
-You did real good.

445
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:49,138
This guy is good for you.

446
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:53,370
Aren't you glad I pushed you into it?
Props to Sally. Let me hear my props.

447
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:55,212
-Props to Sally.
-Yeah.

448
00:55:55,738 --> 00:55:59,014
Clothes, and a treat.

449
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:03,208
So are you gonna be okay, or what?

450
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:07,372
I do feel better. That's maybe laying off
the Cosmos for a couple days.

451
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,251
Check this out.

452
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:12,291
Some chick in a cat suit
murdered Slavicky last night.

453
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:16,138
The actions of this lunatic will not
keep Beau-line off the shelves.

454
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:19,130
We will launch next week as planned...

455
00:56:19,738 --> 00:56:24,334
...because we owe it to the women
of this country.

456
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:28,008
-Because--
-Please. That guy is so full of himself.

457
00:56:28,738 --> 00:56:30,888
-I'm almost out.
-Let's see.

458
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,935
How long have you
been having headaches?

459
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:34,735
-About a month.
-Do me a favor.

460
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:36,171
-Stop using this.
-Why?

461
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:40,130
Because it's making you sick. Trust me.

462
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:48,135
Thank you, lieutenant.
You're gonna roll with him.

463
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:51,891
For Tom, from forensics.

464
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:55,810
Oh, and Slavicky homicide.
Maybe you'll want to look at that.

465
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,568
Hey, Bob, let me ask you a question.

466
00:56:58,738 --> 00:57:02,174
Would your wife crawl out on the ledge
of a building to rescue an astray cat?

467
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:04,488
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

468
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,738
Well, there are similarities.

469
00:57:19,738 --> 00:57:23,697
-Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
-Were they written by the same person?

470
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,247
Well, it's not an exact science.

471
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:31,138
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the letters? Indicative of loneliness.

472
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:35,017
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

473
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:37,727
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.

474
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:40,127
Very self-confident, almost angry.

475
00:57:40,138 --> 00:57:43,335
And the O, well, this person
doesn't like to play by the rules.

476
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:45,615
-So they're different people.
-Very.

477
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:48,538
If you put these two women
in the same room...

478
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:50,608
...you're gonna have one hell of a party.

479
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:55,414
-You got a big weekend planned, Tom?
-I do now.

480
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,614
Aren't you supposed to let me win?

481
00:58:10,978 --> 00:58:12,127
Not that kind of girl.

482
00:58:12,178 --> 00:58:14,897
-What kind of girl is that?
-A loser.

483
00:58:15,778 --> 00:58:17,578
Hey, can I ask you a question?

484
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,091
You work for Hedare, right?

485
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:22,450
Somebody was murdered at his factory
the other night.

486
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:25,378
I'm sorry.

487
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:28,654
Can you think of anybody who might
have a grudge against the company?

488
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:32,857
Lots of people. George Hedare isn't
the nicest guy in the world, you know.

489
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,975
He fired me.

490
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:41,007
What? Am I a suspect now, detective?

491
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:46,531
No.

492
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:07,694
Looks like we'll be
up here for a while.

493
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:11,496
You in a hurry?

494
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:32,731
Mom!

495
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:44,973
-Hey!
-Don't move!

496
00:59:45,178 --> 00:59:47,533
Hold on tight. I gotta stop this thing.

497
00:59:53,578 --> 00:59:55,489
-Mom!
-Frankie.

498
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:01,136
Mom! Mom!

499
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:03,448
Help, Mom!

500
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:06,127
Mom!

501
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:14,015
Help, Mom! Help! Help!

502
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:46,378
You are one tough little guy.
You know that?

503
01:00:46,378 --> 01:00:48,687
-Take it easy, partner.
-Bye.

504
01:00:52,978 --> 01:00:54,696
It's over.

505
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:58,134
Well, I'm not sure how you did it,
but I'm impressed.

506
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:01,609
Well, I saw how you did. And so am I.

507
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:03,411
-You know what?
-What?

508
01:01:03,778 --> 01:01:07,373
We should celebrate. Why don't you
let me take you to dinner tonight?

509
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:10,927
I would love to, but I can't.
Not tonight. I've got...

510
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:15,207
...some business
that I have to take care of.

511
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:13,658
You picked the wrong house.

512
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:18,329
You're the cat that killed Slavicky.

513
01:02:18,898 --> 01:02:21,298
You don't believe everything
you see on TV, do you?

514
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:23,892
-What do you want?
-Your husband. Is he home?

515
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:26,448
I'm here. Why on earth
would he be home?

516
01:02:26,698 --> 01:02:28,211
Oh, too bad.

517
01:02:33,898 --> 01:02:37,413
If your husband ever comes home,
tell him I know all about Beau-line.

518
01:02:38,098 --> 01:02:41,408
It's disease in a jar.
I wouldn't caulk a sink with it.

519
01:02:41,698 --> 01:02:45,898
-Come on. I've been using it for years.
-It's your funeral.

520
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:50,016
Because whoever killed Slavicky did it
to keep Beau-line's toxic little secret.

521
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:53,408
Are you suggesting that my husband
is a murderer?

522
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:55,654
I'm suggesting that
you tell me where he is.

523
01:02:56,098 --> 01:02:58,612
-So I'll ask him myself.
-I suppose I should be shocked.

524
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:02,295
Protest his innocence. But the truth is...

525
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:05,050
...that man's capable of anything.

526
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,370
You wanna find him?

527
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:10,811
There he is.

528
01:03:15,898 --> 01:03:18,287
-Thanks.
-I'd like to help.

529
01:03:18,898 --> 01:03:20,098
How can I reach you?

530
01:03:20,098 --> 01:03:21,531
I'm not exactly listed.

531
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,456
Take my phone.

532
01:03:57,938 --> 01:04:01,010
Call the cops.
You're not going to believe this.

533
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,574
I think this is a total waste of time.

534
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:06,247
-Don't.
-What?

535
01:04:06,938 --> 01:04:08,417
Think. Ever.

536
01:04:09,338 --> 01:04:11,977
Consider it a condition
of our relationship.

537
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:23,727
I love this part.

538
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:28,732
-Who the hell--?
-Like my nails?

539
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:32,010
Just got them done.

540
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:35,212
My bad.

541
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:38,929
Get your paws off me this instant!

542
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:41,693
I know about Beau-line,
and your cover-up.

543
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:43,327
What?

544
01:04:44,138 --> 01:04:46,811
So did my girl, Patience.
That's why you killed her.

545
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:50,738
-What? I didn't kill her--
-Too bad your last words will be a lie.

546
01:04:50,738 --> 01:04:52,330
Freeze!

547
01:05:15,938 --> 01:05:17,132
Hey!

548
01:05:17,738 --> 01:05:20,491
Hold it right there.
Don't you move.

549
01:05:20,738 --> 01:05:22,888
Now, come down from there
nice and easy.

550
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:25,936
Cats come when they feel like it.

551
01:05:26,738 --> 01:05:28,330
Not when they're told.

552
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:31,769
I won't tell you again. You turn around.
Hands on your head.

553
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:52,737
You're under arrest.

554
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:09,457
Gotcha!

555
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:14,738
-You think this is some kind of a game?
-Now we're playing.

556
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:18,253
-You're playing. I'm at work.
-Seems like you love your job.

557
01:06:21,938 --> 01:06:25,169
-Don't I get din-din first?
-I'll feed you in your cell.

558
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:45,168
Careful. That cable hits us,
we're both fried.

559
01:06:45,338 --> 01:06:47,568
I knew I felt a spark between us.

560
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:56,138
-Not on the first date.
-Don't flatter yourself. I'm taken.

561
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,412
Does she know about us?

562
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,212
There's no "us."

563
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:02,656
Too bad.

564
01:07:06,338 --> 01:07:07,771
It's over.

565
01:07:20,138 --> 01:07:21,457
There she is.

566
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,937
Okay, boys.

567
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:27,011
Show of hands.
Who can see in the dark?

568
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:30,127
I can.

569
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:42,250
But this is a disaster!
It's a total bloody disaster.

570
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:48,296
How does she know all this?
Who is she, anyway? And how come--?

571
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,092
It's all right.

572
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:52,211
Don't be scared.

573
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:59,008
Great. You haven't got a clue, do you?
We are in absolute ruin here...

574
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:02,647
...and your brilliant piece of advice
to me is: "Don't be scared"?

575
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:06,657
No. My advice to you, George...

576
01:08:07,498 --> 01:08:08,698
...quit the self-tanning.

577
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:11,098
Stop eating Viagra like they're vitamins.

578
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:15,808
Resist the urge to date children born the
same day they invented the cell phone.

579
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:20,127
For once, George,
in your miserable life...

580
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:22,526
...be a man!

581
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:33,898
Terrific.

582
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:36,287
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

583
01:08:36,898 --> 01:08:39,412
Okay, Sal. What do you think?

584
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:45,776
I don't know. You going to a church
or a Playboy mansion?

585
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:47,456
Well, that was helpful.

586
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,414
I'm such a freak.

587
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:54,134
PIease, I'm a freak Thursday
through Sunday, big deal.

588
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,766
Okay, but what if he doesn't like...

589
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,210
-...the real me?
-He can't pick and choose, Patience.

590
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:03,893
If he wants this to work,
he's gonna have to like all of you.

591
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:17,215
-Senora Hedare. Perdon.
-Go.

592
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,326
Pretty.

593
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,056
-Thanks.
-Oh, you too.

594
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:32,448
But I was talking about the fish.

595
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:35,616
Detective work is like dating.

596
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:39,452
It's all about the pursuit.
But when you catch them--

597
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:46,450
You like your sushi, huh?

598
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:50,331
That's good.

599
01:09:54,898 --> 01:09:57,651
So tell me about this one...

600
01:09:58,498 --> 01:09:59,931
...that got away.

601
01:10:00,298 --> 01:10:01,526
Catwoman.

602
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:06,569
-You heard of her?
-Oh, yeah. Hot, black leather, whip.

603
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:08,570
She kissed me.

604
01:10:09,298 --> 01:10:11,493
-Really?
-Yeah.

605
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:14,690
-What do you think about that?
-Depends.

606
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:18,290
-You like bad girls?
-Only if they like me back.

607
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:24,176
No, listen, bad isn't something
that does it for me.

608
01:10:24,298 --> 01:10:27,813
Okay, bad, good.
Gotta be something in between, right?

609
01:10:28,498 --> 01:10:31,251
Maybe it's a little more complicated.

610
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:34,410
-Why don't we talk about you?
-Okay.

611
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:38,568
-What's it like to be an artist?
-Well, I'm not really an artist.

612
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:41,531
I mean, yeah, I did go to art school...

613
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:45,486
...but then I got a regular job
at an advertising agency...

614
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:51,936
...and now I don't really know
what I am any more.

615
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:56,490
Well, I know what you are.

616
01:10:57,898 --> 01:10:59,570
You're different.

617
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,811
You're special.

618
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:06,298
-And I like that about you.
-Thanks.

619
01:11:06,298 --> 01:11:07,777
No, it's true.

620
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,854
And I want to know more about you.

621
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:15,087
You know...

622
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,093
...I guess there's a few things
I need to explain.

623
01:11:18,218 --> 01:11:20,812
Like what, your new look? Huh?

624
01:11:21,218 --> 01:11:25,006
-Your dunk shot?
-No, that's not what I was thinking.

625
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,692
Hey.

626
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,770
You can tell me anything.

627
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:39,815
I'm....

628
01:11:48,818 --> 01:11:50,410
I hate the rain!

629
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,456
What were you saying?

630
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:06,815
Nothing important.

631
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:38,771
Tom?

632
01:13:47,018 --> 01:13:48,417
It's me.

633
01:13:49,418 --> 01:13:51,409
You were right about Beau-line's secrets.

634
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:56,016
I can 't believe it, but you were right.
Beau-line is toxic.

635
01:13:56,018 --> 01:14:00,216
I have proof. We can stop him,
but we have to stop him together.

636
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:04,097
George will be launching Beau-line
at a press conference tomorrow.

637
01:14:04,418 --> 01:14:06,978
Beau-line will be on the shelves
on Monday.

638
01:14:54,938 --> 01:14:56,132
So, what'd you find?

639
01:14:56,138 --> 01:15:00,495
Enough evidence to put someone away
for a long, long time.

640
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,530
I was everything they wanted me to be.

641
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:07,857
I was never more beautiful.

642
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:10,015
Never more powerful.

643
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:14,133
And then I turned 40
and they threw me away.

644
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,493
It's all there behind the desk.

645
01:15:33,338 --> 01:15:34,657
How'd I do?

646
01:15:35,138 --> 01:15:39,256
The clawed-flesh thing
was a little tricky...

647
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:41,249
...but I think I pulled it off.

648
01:15:45,938 --> 01:15:49,248
-You killed him?
-No one is gonna stop Beau-line...

649
01:15:49,538 --> 01:15:51,335
...from hitting the shelves.

650
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,851
Not Slavicky.

651
01:15:53,738 --> 01:15:57,333
Not George. And certainly not you.

652
01:15:58,538 --> 01:16:01,336
I'm sorry. I'm forgetting my manners.

653
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:03,338
Can I offer you something?

654
01:16:03,338 --> 01:16:05,215
Can of tuna? Saucer of milk?

655
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:11,935
Smoking gun? Which, sweetheart, you
just emptied into my husband's chest.

656
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:17,329
Oh, George!

657
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:21,970
Help, somebody help!
It's Catwoman! She killed George.

658
01:16:23,138 --> 01:16:24,810
Oh, my God!

659
01:17:35,338 --> 01:17:36,771
Patience.

660
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:45,851
I'm sorry.

661
01:17:52,138 --> 01:17:55,733
I guess you could take this right
out of my hands if you wanted.

662
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:01,971
If I wanted.

663
01:18:10,738 --> 01:18:14,333
I'm telling you.
Slavicky had evidence that Beau-line was toxic.

664
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:16,610
That's why Laurel killed him.

665
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:20,174
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.

666
01:18:20,338 --> 01:18:23,853
Ballistics show the same weapon killed both men: the gun that was in your hand.

667
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:27,010
-Catwoman's hand.
-What's the difference?

668
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:31,855
-Guess it doesn't matter.
-Don't you understand?

669
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:36,172
All of the evidence, every single piece,
it points to you.

670
01:18:36,538 --> 01:18:38,927
There's nothing that shows me
anything else.

671
01:18:40,138 --> 01:18:41,491
There's me.

672
01:18:42,538 --> 01:18:44,290
You can believe me.

673
01:18:50,938 --> 01:18:53,498
Do you remember the first time
you saw me?

674
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:55,687
Yeah.

675
01:18:56,338 --> 01:18:57,976
What did you see?

676
01:18:58,138 --> 01:18:59,412
A girl...

677
01:18:59,938 --> 01:19:01,417
...rescuing a cat.

678
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,091
No, you didn't.

679
01:19:04,138 --> 01:19:08,370
You saw a crazy person out on a ledge
trying to jump.

680
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:14,495
And all the evidence pointed to that,
didn't it?

681
01:19:14,938 --> 01:19:17,498
I really need you to believe me.

682
01:19:22,138 --> 01:19:23,651
How can I?

683
01:19:25,138 --> 01:19:26,969
I don't know who you are.

684
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:34,536
I'm the same girl
you were with last night.

685
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,176
Take her back.

686
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:08,210
You be a nice kitty, now.

687
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:33,490
Look at it this way, Lone.

688
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:37,335
You may have lost your woman,
but at least you got your man.

689
01:20:39,538 --> 01:20:40,766
Did I?

690
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,487
Yeah.

691
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:49,850
Hello, Midnight.

692
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:11,293
You've spent a lifetime caged.

693
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:15,616
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

694
01:21:16,298 --> 01:21:17,777
... you can be free.

695
01:21:18,098 --> 01:21:19,816
And freedom is power.

696
01:21:22,898 --> 01:21:25,128
It's not just about me any more, Midnight.

697
01:21:35,498 --> 01:21:36,897
You know...

698
01:21:37,298 --> 01:21:40,131
... Lassie would have brought me a key.

699
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:42,570
Cross your paws.

700
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:13,290
-We're gonna shift-change in half an hour.
-All right.

701
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:19,051
-Dave's gonna take over then?
-Yeah, as far as I know.

702
01:22:19,298 --> 01:22:21,129
Yeah, right through here, pal.

703
01:22:22,298 --> 01:22:24,528
You'll get to talk to a lawyer.

704
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:45,647
Are you okay?

705
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:48,496
A girl like me lands on her feet.

706
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,809
Wait! Wait!

707
01:23:01,578 --> 01:23:03,773
My husband dreamed of a world...

708
01:23:03,978 --> 01:23:07,288
...where every woman could be
as beautiful as she wanted to be.

709
01:23:08,178 --> 01:23:13,578
He dedicated his life pursuing that dream.
As Hedare's new chief executive...

710
01:23:13,578 --> 01:23:16,650
...I intend to make that dream a reality...

711
01:23:17,178 --> 01:23:21,888
...by proceeding with tomorrow's launch of Beau-line.

712
01:23:28,578 --> 01:23:29,897
Thank you!

713
01:23:33,978 --> 01:23:38,017
Thank you so much. I have been dying
to get some of this stuff.

714
01:23:38,178 --> 01:23:42,330
My husband would have wanted you to have it.
He wanted that for everyone.

715
01:23:44,178 --> 01:23:47,409
-Detective Lone. What a surprise.
-Yeah?

716
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:53,057
Everyone, this is the man that brought
my husband's killer to justice.

717
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:57,930
Can I talk to you for a minute, in private?

718
01:23:57,978 --> 01:24:00,208
Come upstairs to my office.

719
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,178
-Number five, ready to go.
-Yeah, yeah.

720
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,294
Yeah, go ahead. Right there.

721
01:24:22,578 --> 01:24:25,012
Get a move on.
Gotta meet that midnight delivery.

722
01:25:01,618 --> 01:25:04,618
I saw her standing over him.
There were claw marks all over his body.

723
01:25:04,618 --> 01:25:07,371
-But not on Slavicky's.
-Because she didn't have the time.

724
01:25:07,618 --> 01:25:09,574
She also didn't have a motive.

725
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:13,812
-I don't know.
-What if I told you I know the truth?

726
01:25:14,218 --> 01:25:16,937
That I know who killed your husband,
I know about Beau-line.

727
01:25:17,218 --> 01:25:20,574
Why, detective, you make it sound
like I'm a suspect.

728
01:25:21,418 --> 01:25:23,932
What if I told you I had evidence?

729
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:29,818
If you have evidence,
then how come I'm not in cuffs?

730
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:33,936
Well, you're a smart woman,
Mrs. Hedare. Beautiful. Rich.

731
01:25:34,618 --> 01:25:36,688
I thought maybe we could
work something out.

732
01:25:37,018 --> 01:25:42,046
So this evidence.... You'll make it
disappear? Pin it on the other girl?

733
01:25:42,418 --> 01:25:44,648
If that's what you want me to do.

734
01:25:45,418 --> 01:25:46,618
And you?

735
01:25:46,618 --> 01:25:49,530
-What do you want?
-You just gave me what I want.

736
01:25:49,618 --> 01:25:51,495
You just told me it was you.

737
01:25:52,618 --> 01:25:55,291
Now, why would you believe it was me?

738
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,376
Because I finally trusted a friend.

739
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:01,132
Yeah, well, your friend
just got you killed.

740
01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:05,776
Don't be stupid, Laurel.
You don't want to kill a cop.

741
01:26:06,418 --> 01:26:08,374
I'm a woman, Lone.

742
01:26:09,418 --> 01:26:12,808
I'm used to doing all kinds
of things I don't wanna do.

743
01:26:13,018 --> 01:26:15,088
Give my regards to my husband.

744
01:26:21,418 --> 01:26:22,976
How sweet.

745
01:26:23,218 --> 01:26:25,686
Thanks. Now I can kill you both.

746
01:26:44,818 --> 01:26:46,809
Hold on, I gotta stop.

747
01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:49,612
How is it?

748
01:26:49,618 --> 01:26:51,495
Well, there goes my jump shot.

749
01:26:52,018 --> 01:26:53,167
Listen.

750
01:26:53,218 --> 01:26:55,288
I want you to know I'm sorry.

751
01:26:55,618 --> 01:26:57,813
I should have trusted you all along.

752
01:26:58,018 --> 01:27:00,612
You're confusing me
with somebody else.

753
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:03,256
Come on, Patience.

754
01:27:08,818 --> 01:27:10,092
I'll take this side.

755
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:08,686
I can't believe I ever trusted you.

756
01:28:09,218 --> 01:28:12,369
-You're a fake.
-And what are you? A hero?

757
01:28:14,618 --> 01:28:15,971
A thief?

758
01:28:17,618 --> 01:28:19,017
A freak?

759
01:28:23,618 --> 01:28:27,008
If you don't have an identity,
why keep it a secret?

760
01:28:27,818 --> 01:28:30,252
Because you killed me.

761
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,896
It was me you flushed down the pipes.

762
01:28:41,018 --> 01:28:42,736
I'm Patience Phillips.

763
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,610
That's who's under there?

764
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,974
-I can't be hurt.
-Beau-line.

765
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:22,649
You stop using it
and your face disintegrates.

766
01:29:26,618 --> 01:29:30,691
And if you keep using it,
skin like living marble.

767
01:29:36,818 --> 01:29:38,888
And you can't feel a thing.

768
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:13,208
You're just a scared little girl
playing dress-up.

769
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:19,848
Nobody. Nothing.

770
01:30:26,018 --> 01:30:28,054
Where do you think you're going?

771
01:30:30,818 --> 01:30:33,013
You're gonna look like a cop-killer.

772
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:37,530
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn't save yourself.

773
01:30:51,818 --> 01:30:53,171
Game over.

774
01:30:54,218 --> 01:30:55,571
Guess what.

775
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,654
It's overtime.

776
01:31:41,618 --> 01:31:43,051
Give me your hand!

777
01:31:45,818 --> 01:31:47,046
Help me!

778
01:32:15,818 --> 01:32:20,016
I might not be a hero,
but I'm certainly not a killer.

779
01:32:23,618 --> 01:32:24,937
You know...

780
01:32:25,418 --> 01:32:27,170
...once Laurel's boys start talking...

781
01:32:27,818 --> 01:32:30,491
...we'll be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

782
01:32:32,018 --> 01:32:35,374
And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

783
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:39,176
...it'll be awfully tough to prove
that she was Catwoman.

784
01:32:41,618 --> 01:32:43,131
Exactly.

785
01:33:11,538 --> 01:33:13,654
Delicious, thank you.

786
01:33:14,538 --> 01:33:16,768
You know, the strawberry was good too.

787
01:33:27,138 --> 01:33:29,652
The day I died
was the day I started to live.

788
01:33:31,938 --> 01:33:35,538
In my old life, I longed for someone
to see what was special in me.

789
01:33:35,538 --> 01:33:40,009
You did, and for that
you 'll always be in my heart.

790
01:33:40,338 --> 01:33:43,296
But what I really needed
was for me to see it.

791
01:33:43,938 --> 01:33:45,496
And now I do.

792
01:33:45,738 --> 01:33:47,251
You 're a good man, Tom.

793
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:51,738
But you live in a world that has no place
for someone like me.

794
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:55,208
You see, sometimes I'm good.
Oh, I'm very good.

795
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:59,047
But sometimes I'm bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.

796
01:33:59,538 --> 01:34:01,017
Freedom is power.

797
01:34:01,338 --> 01:34:06,696
To live a life untamed and unafraid
is the gift that I've been given...

798
01:34:06,738 --> 01:34:09,889
...and so my journey begins.

799
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,578
