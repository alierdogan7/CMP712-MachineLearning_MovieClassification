00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:28,199
(Swoff)
A story.

2
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:31,934
A man fires a rifle
for many years...

3
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,380
and he goes to war.

4
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:38,384
And afterward,
he turns the rifle in
at the armory...

5
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,345
and he believes
he's finished with the rifle.

6
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,558
But no matter what else
he might do with his hands...

7
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,756
Iove a woman, build a house...

8
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,031
change his son's diaper...

9
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,598
his hands remember the rifle.

10
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,762
(Fitch)
You are no longer black,
or brown, or yellow or red!

11
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,509
You are now green!

12
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,206
You are light green
or dark green!

13
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,349
Do you understand?

14
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,948
(all)
Sir, yes, sir!

15
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:12,607
Swofford!

16
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,710
Sir, yes, sir!

17
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,649
You the maggot whose father
served in Vietnam?

18
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:17,747
Sir, yes, sir!

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,793
Outstanding!
Did he have the balls
to die there?

20
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,919
Sir, no, sir!

21
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,793
Too fucking bad!
He ever talk about it?

22
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,557
Sir, only once, sir!
Good! Then he wasn't lying!

23
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,566
Are you eyeballing me
with those baby blues?

24
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,698
Are you?
Sir, no, sir!

25
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,903
Are you in love
with me, Swofford?
Sir, no, sir!

26
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,311
You don't think I look good
in my uniform, Swofford?

27
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:44,509
Sir, the drill sergeant
looks fabulous
in his uniform, sir!

28
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,417
So you're gay, then,
and you love me, huh?

29
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,182
Sir, I'm not gay, sir!

30
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:52,282
Do you have
a girlfriend, Swofford?
Sir, yes, sir!

31
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,658
Guess again, motherfucker!
Jody's banging her right now!

32
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,594
Get on your face
and give me 25...

33
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,791
for every time
she gets fucked this month.

34
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,333
Down on your face!

35
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,937
(Swoff)
It was shortly after meeting
Drill Instructor Fitch...

36
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,600
that I realized that joining
the Marine Corps...

37
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,700
might have been
a bad decision.

38
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,938
What in the fuck
is this?

39
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,545
Sir,
it's a recruit's drawing
of a footlocker, sir!

40
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,709
Jesus, Joseph
and doggie-style Mary!

41
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,844
That is a pile
of dog shit.

42
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,151
Sir, the recruit's
never been good
at drawing, sir!

43
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,657
Why the fuck
are you my scribe, then?

44
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,057
Isn't my scribe
supposed to know
how to draw?

45
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,322
Sir, the recruit
doesn't know!

46
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,557
The recruit thought
the scribe was supposed
to write, sir!

47
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,223
Of course the recruit
doesn't know!

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,599
The recruit doesn't know
because I haven't told him!

49
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,795
[Groaning]
All right,
cum-for-brains...

50
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:43,206
show me exactly
where your Skivvies
and running shoes go.

51
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,538
Sir, the recruit
can't think...

52
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,806
while the drill instructor
is hitting him
on his head, sir!

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,781
You can't think
while I'm giving you
a few love taps?

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,546
How the fuck
are you going to
fire your rifle...

55
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:55,383
when grenades are going off
in your face?

56
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,352
What the fuck
are you even doing here?

57
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,485
Sir, I got lost
on the way to college, sir!

So, now my hands
were dick skinners.

60
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,472
A flashlight was a moonbeam.
A pen was an ink stick.

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,410
My mouth was a cum receptacle.

62
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,006
A bed was a rack.
A wall was a bulkhead.

63
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,280
A shirt was a blouse.

64
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,480
A tie was still a tie,
and a belt a belt.

65
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,880
But many other things
would never be the same.

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,797
Swofford. What kind of
fucking name is that?

69
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,636
It's English.

70
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:23,665
My great-grandfather
came over here
in the 19th century.

71
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:25,703
Whatever.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,978
I'm putting you
in Golf Company.

73
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,012
It's full of retards
and fuck ups.

74
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,687
Maybe you can elevate
the sons of bitches a little.

75
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,090
Or maybe not.

The Marine's head,
by implication, therefore...

82
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,281
also a jar.

83
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:05,349
An empty vessel.

Yeah, I was assigned

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:23,658
Yeah.

90
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:32,775
What's going on, boss?
Nothing much, man.

00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,677
Welcome to Second Platoon.
Thanks, man.

Still got
that stomach flu, Swofford?

I can't seem to shake it.

109
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,768
That's all right.
Not everyone's cut out
for the Marines.

But for me, there was nowhere
else. That was the truth.

After all,
I was made in a war.

I can't show you.

to pull that little branding
trick on you.

Your file says that you ain't
too fucking dumb, either.

So you better get un-sick
most motherfucking
ricky-tick...

that you could be

your ass there.

Is that an order,

146
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,217
It's a fucking opportunity.

147

It's the best fucking job
in the Marine Corps.

Could I have my...

You know what?
I got a better idea.

You play any instruments?

154

I played the trumpet
in third grade,

155
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,334
Played the trumpet
in third grade? Good.

156
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,537
You still play?

I don't give out
too many special treats...

176
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:44,123
but this morning,
we have a very special treat.

177
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,791
Private Swofford here
is going to play Reveille
for us.

178
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,630
Okay, Swofford,

You don't have a what?
I don't have a bugle.

181
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,693
Oh, no. No, no.
Damn, damn.

182
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,633
You better play
with your mouth.

183
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:04,534

184
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,805

Sounds good to me.

189
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,499

190
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,868
You know You Are
The Sunshine Of My Life?

191
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,634

some kind of Kenny G
or some shit?

198

No, Staff Sergeant.
Good.

do you have what it takes...

200

In order to
engage your target...

221
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,985

must not see you.

Still kind of cute,

No, sir.

229
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,397
This suit will hide you.
You will become a tree.
A rock.

230
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:16,033
You are mud, sand, and dust.

231
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,736
Still funny?
No, sir.

232
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,243
In order to fire accurately...

233
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,179
you must be able to judge
distance and wind direction.

234
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:24,181
How far are those trees?

235
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,410

500 yards.
No.

237
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,712
300. How did you
figure that?
Three football fields.

238
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,188
Three football fields,
that's right.

239
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,157
You take what you know
and then you multiply.

240
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,454
Please don't use
your dicks.

241
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,392
They're too small,
and I can't count that high.

I don't wanna hear,
"400,000 inches."

You use what you have.

Use a flag,
use a plume of smoke,
a little bit of dust.

and hold that bitch up.

These are formulas
that you can use...

247

but in the end,
you have to trust your gut.

00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,202
Details, gentlemen.

249
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:54,246
Details is gonna be
the difference between
you killing your target...

250
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,780
and your target killing you.

251
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:59,284
We've all been taught that,
"Thou shalt not kill."

252
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,175
But hear this:

253

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,140
Shoot that motherfucker!

347
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,613
Die!

348
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,155
[All cheering]

349
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,155
Run, Charlie!

350
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:50,024
[All sighing]
(announcer)
Now hear this. Now hear this.

351
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,195
All personnel from 2-7...

352
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,672
are to report immediately
to your company area.

353
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,311
Get some, Marines. Get some!

354
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,446
[All cheering]

355
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,246
[Marines chattering]

356
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,586
(Kruger)
Me, I had a choice...

357
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,891
either join the Marines
or go to jail.

358
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,722
And you know
what the shit of it is?

359
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,733
Yeah, if you'd
gone to jail...
Don't spoil
the joke, asshole.

360
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,599
If I'd have went to jail,
I'd be getting out today.

361
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,267
Would you like some nuts?
No, thanks.

362
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,866
Yes, are they warm nuts?

363
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,775
No, I believe
they're room temperature.

364
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:38,650
Well, maybe later
you can come
and warm up my nuts.

365
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:41,113
You know,
I don't really like
the little ones.

366
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,380
[Chuckling]

367
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,983
Okay, is that all?
Yeah.

368
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,249
(stewardess)
Would you like some nuts?

369
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,752
You poor bastard.

370
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:51,489
I bet your recruiter
promised you a whole
wide world of pussy, huh?

371
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,656
You fucking A.

372
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:55,564
Cocksucker knew the price
of every whore
from Olangapo to Stockholm.

373
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:58,228
And here we are,
headed to the desert.
No pussy in 1,000 miles.

374
00:20:58,304 --> 00:20:59,931
Fucked by
the green wienie again.

375
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,503
What would you be doing
if you were a civilian?

376
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,238
Staying up late,
jacking off...

377
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:08,746
playing Metroid, trying to get
to that ninth level?

378
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,645
You know what happens
when you get there?

379
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,950
Nothing.
You just start
all over again.

380
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:19,455
How long you think
we'll be there? Two weeks?

381
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,160
Less, man.
We'll be back so fast...

382
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,785
we'll still be
shitting out those nuts.

383
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,560
Good luck, now.
Goodbye, now.

384
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:29,632
Good luck, now.
Goodbye, now.

385
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,826
Want to keep me company
for two weeks?

386
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:32,962
Goodbye, now.

387
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,268
You don't know
what you're missing.
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,436
Damn!

389
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,107
[Helicopter whirring]

390
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,281
[Inaudible]

391
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,822
[Marines chattering]

392
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,786
Attention on deck!

393
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,689
Take your seats.

394
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:40,929
Good afternoon, Marines.
(all)
Good afternoon, sir!

395
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,169
Jesus, did you just land
in a war zone
or a funeral parlor?

396
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,939
Good afternoon, Marines!
Good afternoon, sir!

397
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,274
I just felt my dick move.

398
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:50,642
[All laughing]

399
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:52,775
For those of you
who don't know me...

400
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:56,082
I'm
Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski,
your battalion commander.

401
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,152
We are now a part of
Operation Desert Shield.

402
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:01,559
Now, just north of us...

403
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:05,222
Saddam Hussein's got
one million Iraqi soldiers.

404
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,989
And some of those boys
have been fighting...

405
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,501
since you were nine
or ten years old.

406
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:11,900
They are tough.

407
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,733
They will stop at nothing.

408
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,771
They've used nerve gas
against the Iranians
and the Kurds.

409
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,111
Now, here's a picture.

410
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,215
I know
what you're thinking.

411
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,882
You're thinking,
"Let's kick ass
and take names...

412
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,687
"and end this shit
the day before yesterday."

413
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,852
(all)
Yeah!

414
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:39,227
But the bureaucrats
have a lot of jawboning to do.

415
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,330
So for now, these Iraqis
who have raped and pillaged...

416
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:46,667
poor little Kuwait
are not yet in our gun sights.

417
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,269
Our current mission
is to protect
the oil fields...

418
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,605
of our good friends
in the Kingdom of Saud...

419
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,045
until further notice.

420
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,913
And gentlemen,
I'm talking a lot of oil.

421
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,054
A lot of oil.

422
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:06,948
So you will hydrate,
you will train...

423
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:10,784
you will adjust
to this desert,
and you'll hydrate some more.

424
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,596
And you will be ready.

425
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:17,292
You will maintain
a constant state
of suspicious alertness...

426
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,266
and one day soon...

427
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,705
Saddam Hussein is gonna regret
pulling this sorry shit.

428
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:23,764
(all)
Ooh-rah!

429
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,168
(Fowler)
We're gonna kick
some Iraqi ass!

430
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,234
[Laughing]

431
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:28,811
What did you say?

432
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,105
We're gonna kick
some Iraqi ass, sir!

433
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:32,445
Oh, hell, son.

434
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:34,952
What, you gonna win
the Medal of Honor
all by yourself?

435
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,920
What's the rest
of my battalion gonna do?

436
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:38,650
(all)
Kick some Iraqi ass!

437
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:40,817
You know,
I think it's time
for me to retire.

438
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,157
I can't hear a fucking thing!

439
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:44,989
Kick some Iraqi ass!

440
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:47,793
Oh, boys,
I just got a hard-on!

441
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,427
[All laughing]

442
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,547
(Fowler)
Man, this defensive
position shit sucks, huh?

443
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,285
We need to get out
of this shit hole soon.

444
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,724
I need to shoot something!

445
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:18,024
You're gonna get
all you want soon enough.

446
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,723
First to fucking fight!

447
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,592
Yeah. For what?

448
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:26,638
I've been around
these old white fuckers
all my life.

449
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,832
They got their fat hands
in Arab oil.

450
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,068
The motherfuckers drink it
like it's beer.

451
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,077
That's why we're here,
to protect their profits.

452
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,613
You're full of shit.
He's full of shit.

453
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:38,650
Who do you think gave Saddam
all his fucking weapons?

454
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,208
We did!

455
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:43,220
Fuck politics, all right?
We're here.

456
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:45,283
All the rest is bullshit.

457
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:46,483
(Fowler)
Yeah.

458
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,572
[Mumbling]

459
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,545
Everyone else
is unpacking, man.

460
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,824
I'm taking a break.

461
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,354
(Fowler)
What you got?

462
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:24,819
Photos.

463
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,388
She's hot. Yours?
Yes, man.

464
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,693
You better shoot yourself
in the foot...

465
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,463
and get a ticket home...

466
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,697
because Jodies are
gonna be all over her!

467
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,036
[All exclaiming]
Look at her!
Ain't she an animal!

468
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,541
They won't
leave her alone!

469
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,668
That's nice
for a white chick, man.
Thank you, man.

470
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:40,803
Nice? Come on.

471
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:43,245
I'd drink a gallon
of her pee just to see
where it came from.

472
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:44,509
All right, all right,
all right.

473
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,914
This is hardcore right here.

474
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,475
This is close to porn.
Let me see that one.
Let me see.

475
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:50,077
She's got
a baby fist down here.

476
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,152
Dream on, brothers, dream on.

477
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:55,455
I'm storing that
for later, man.
I'm storing it for later.

478
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,187
Hey, y'all horny fucks
wanna see a beautiful woman?

479
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,890
Yeah!
Let's see it.
Let's see it.

480
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,694
Give it up!
Check this out.

481
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,598
Yeah, boy!
Give it up, give it up.

482
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:04,761
No, no, no.

483
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:07,134
Oh, no! Please
don't love me!

484
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,833
Now, tell them
how many tortillas she had
before that picture.

485
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,466
[All laughing]

486
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,040
Hey, she's pregnant, man.

487
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,610
That's why
she's so beautiful, man.

488
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,515
This is what it's all about
right here, man.

489
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,314
[All booing]
Hey, fuck you guys!

490
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,445
Married guys.

491
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,958
I'm telling you, married guys
lose brain cells
by the billions.

492
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,617
If the Corps wanted you
to have a wife...

493
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:29,922
they would have
issued you one.

494
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,327
Yeah, they would have
issued you one.

495
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,092
Yeah!

496
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,765
No family photos, Swofford?

497
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:41,364
Hey, can I see
your pictures?
Yeah, sure, man.

498
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,566
Thanks.

499
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,298
Fergus, right?

500
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:46,633
Yeah.

501
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,007
She have her own clothes?

502
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:56,216
Well, ain't this cozy as fuck?
You guys get settled in?

503
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,687
(all)
Yes, Staff Sergeant!

504
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:00,884
Well,
if you're not too busy...
Gas! Gas! Gas!

505
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,450
Right now!
I'm talking about gas!
Let's go! Let's move it!

506
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,120
Come on, guys,
what the fuck are you doing?

507
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:06,664
Let's go! Get it on!

508
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,097
Right now your dicks
are falling off!

509
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,293
Your skin is bubble wrap!
Let's go! Move it!

510
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:12,496
You sorry motherfuckers,
I told you, "Don't get lazy."

511
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,165
Didn't I tell you
not to get lazy? Let's go!

512
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,504
Let's go.
What are you doing?

513
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,044
That's your fucking
sleeping bag, you moron!
Let's go!

514
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,579
It's been 30 seconds.

515

00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,753
(woman reporter)
So in case
of a chemical attack...

689
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:03,225
what provisions
do your men have for that?

690
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,790
This is what we call
the NBC suits.

691
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,560
That's nuclear-biological
- chemical protective suits.

692
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,125
We also have a mask.
This is the M17 A1 mask...

693
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,761
which is fitted
with a drinking tube...

694
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:15,999
so these guys
can drink from
their canteens...

695
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,336
without taking off
their masks.

696
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,705
Oh, really?
Want to try it?

697
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:21,768
No, thanks, but can I hold it?
Yeah, sure.

698
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,642
It's heavy.
Yeah, it is.

699
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,979
But you know, we need these
in order to protect us.

700
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,711
They fight with all this
in all this heat?

701
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,083
Yes, they do.
They fight with it and...

702
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:33,419
As a matter of fact,
let me give you
a small demonstration of that.

703
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,084
Kruger, get rid of the ball.

704
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,018
Get rid of the ball.

705
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,365
Kruger! Get rid
of the fucking ball.

706
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:42,763
(Sykes)
Ball.
Fuck.

707
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,233
Give me the ball.

708
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,100
All right, listen up, guys,
today is your lucky day.

709
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:52,199
These reporters want to see
how your NBC suits work.

710
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,543
All right, so we're gonna
continue this little
football game...

711
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,080
in full chemical gear.

712
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,172
[Laughing]

713
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:00,945
That's right.
Come on, let's go.
It's 112 degrees.

714
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,147
Then I guess
you won't be needing
your parkas, will you?

715
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:05,382
Let's play!

716
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:06,980
[Breathing heavily]

717

[All shouting]

718
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:13,193
I'm gonna hurt you, Swoff.
I'm gonna hurt you so bad.

719
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,492
Do you like pain?

720
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,657
(Marine #1)
Hut!

721
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,530
(Kruger)
Swoff!
(Swoff)
Where's the fucking ball?

722
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,332
Swofford, what is that?

723
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:25,376
Swofford, I guess
you call that
using your head, huh?

724
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:26,907
Using his head.

725
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,241
(Marine #2)
Hut.

726
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:36,711

00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:40,312

Fuck you! Fuck you, bitch!

732
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,385
Who got me? Who got me?
No, no, I want him.

733
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:17,053
You want
the Mexican leprechaun?
Well, let's take him.

734
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,062
Yeah, I'll take
the fucking midget.

735
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,065
I'm the midget?
Let's go,
you squishy-faced retard.

736
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,661
Don't you ever call me
a squishy-face.

737
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,864
Squishy-face.
Let's go, baby, squishy-face!

738
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:30,305

741
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:40,116
All right, that's it!
That's halftime!

742
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,209
Put the masks back on.
Bring the water.

743
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,254
We're gonna further
this demonstration.

744
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,949
Men, these M17 A1
drinking tubes...

745
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:50,118
are designed to work
perfectly with your canteen
and your mask.

746
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:51,286
Take the narrow part
of the tube...

747
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:52,829
with your fingers
extended and joined...

748
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,956
and place it into
the appropriate receptacle...

749
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,557
on the canteen lid.
The lid on my canteen's
fucked.

750
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,933
Watch your mouth.
I got another one
for you right there.

751
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:01,995
(Troy)
My hydration tube is busted,
Staff Sergeant.

752
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:04,871
We're gonna die
of dehydration.
We're not gonna die.
Just cool it.

753
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:07,206
Staff Sergeant,
my drinking tube fell off...

754
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:09,371
at the gas chamber
at Pendleton.
It's been four months...

755
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,938
I understand that,
and I want everybody
to understand this!

756
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:15,144
Fucking piece of shit!
And I want you to play
fucking ball!

Come on, bring the camera.

768
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:53,585
You're gonna put
your clothes on
and quit acting like monkeys.

Let's go check out
the artillery and everything.

00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,692
Field what?
He said "field fun."

774
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,636
That's one of the exercises
that we run here in the field.

775
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:18,208
The armory.

776
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:22,075
Why don't we have
a look at that?

Come back soon, now, you hear?

780
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,310
I don't hear you laughing now.

782
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,348
I can't hear you.

783
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,853
That's better. Sounds jovial.

On top of the world, huh?
Yes, Staff Sergeant!

787
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:22,608
Well, I have
more important things to do...

788
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,240
like play with my balls.

789
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,545
But guess what,
you guys are scheduled...

790
00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:29,882
for a little two-day vacation
back in the rear...

791
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:31,546
so I suggest
you get your shit together.

792
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:36,024

by taking all that down.

straight weeks.

That's the third
fucking time, man.
What's that?

807
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,152
I just want it to say
"no preference."

808

Is that so fucking hard?

809
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:16,528
What difference does it make?
God knows you're
"no preference."

810

(Kruger)
At least they got
the blood type right.

811
00:44:18,536 --> 00:44:22,563

rather get? The wrong prayer
or the wrong blood?

One lonely pink letter
from Sacramento.

what she's up to?

Kristina has a new friend,
man.
She got a new friend?

He's the night manager
at her hotel, and she says
he's a good listener.

Man! This is getting worse.
He's fucked, man.

with a military fetish.

Yeah, and she's getting off
when she tells the Jody...

Twenty-six in a row.

What would you say
if I told you
I was gonna kill you...

1048
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:55,589
for fucking me over like that?

1049
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:57,064
I already told you,
it was an accident.

1050
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:58,225

1051
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:00,803

to kill a man.

What are you doing?

1060
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:25,124
I'm in the firing position
known as the sitting position.

1061
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:27,527
After the prone position,
it is the platform
most likely...

1062
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,531
to enable a Marine
to effectively
kill his target.

generally an enemy...

1064

or friendly.

or friendly fucking...

Come on, Swoff,
it was your watch.

1068
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:41,000
It was Christmas Eve,
and I was just sitting there
thinking about home.

1069
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:42,442
That's it.
What do you think, Cortez?

1070
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:44,878
You think I'll accidentally
kill your homeboy
from boot camp?

1071

Accidents happen.

a bunch of bullshit.

1201
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:44,691
"The mother of all battles
is upon us.

1202
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,694
"The sacrifices
the Iraqi people will make...

1203
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:49,356
"are equal to the importance
of the victory.

01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:53,095
"Kuwait is the branch
that must be returned
to the tree.

"The blood of the infidels
will flow like a river.

"Jihad is the way
of all Arab people."

1207
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,768
We are now
Operation Desert Storm.

1208
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:04,108
And we're the fucking
righteous hammer of God.

1209
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,411
And that hammer
is coming down.
It's real now.

1210
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:09,608
We're going to the border.

1211
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:11,346
(marines)
Ooh-rah!

1212
01:10:34,043 --> 01:10:35,601
Let's go! Let's move it!

1213
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,839
Let's punch in this clock.
We got work to do.

1214
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:39,677
Let's go. Let's move.

1215
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:41,774
Come on! Let's go!

1216
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:43,543
Move.

1217
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,482
Listen up.

1218
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:47,716
When we cross this berm
tomorrow...

1219
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:51,385
we expect as many as
30,000 casualties
the first day.

1220
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:55,322
There will be gas.
It will be fucking nasty.

1221
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:59,061
These atropine-oxime
injectors go along
with your PB pill packs.

1222
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:02,366
In the event that
you're attacked by
nerve agents such as soman...

1223
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:04,998
these agents will produce
casualties immediately...

1224
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:08,373
if you do not deploy
these countermeasures
fucking ricky-tick.

1225
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:11,504
Why in the fuck,
if we've already taken
a set of PB pills...

1226
01:11:11,581 --> 01:11:13,515
and just now been issued
the fucking injector?

1227
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,710
Shut the fuck up.
I'm sick of your shit.

1228
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:17,275
All right, all right, man.
Calm down.

1229
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:19,480
Look, they don't want
chemically dead fighters
on CNN.

1230
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:20,749
Just sign it, Kruger.

1231
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:22,950
What the fuck is this?
It's a waiver.

1232
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:24,492
It says these pills
aren't proven.

1233
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,926
It says you won't sue
if you get fucked up.

1234
01:11:26,996 --> 01:11:29,191
Okay, yeah, sure, fine.

1235
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:31,597
I'll take the fucking pills,
and a year later...

1236
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,500
my asshole will
turn inside out and
start fucking talking to me.

1237
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:37,232
It's all a bitch.
These pills
ain't worth a shit.

1238
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:39,536
Kruger,
you country motherfuck!

1239
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:43,109
In 1987, Saddam Insane
used chemical weapons...

1240
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:46,307
against the Kurds,
and he killed thousands
like fucking that.

1241
01:11:46,382 --> 01:11:49,249
The ones that lived,
their kids came out
fucked up.

1242
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:51,684
Eight toes to one foot,
no anal opening...

1243
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,051
retarded, blind.

1244
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:54,487
Such fucked up
little motherfuckers...

1245
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:56,024
they should have
just killed them all anyway.

1246
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:58,060
You want that,
don't take the pills.

1247
01:11:58,127 --> 01:12:00,755
You don't want that,
sign the fucking waivers...

1248
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,923
and take the fucking pills!

1249
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,763
All of you,
get your pills in your hand.

1250
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:09,805
Get them out.
Get them so I can see them.

1251
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,537
[Distant explosions sounding]

1252
01:12:13,275 --> 01:12:15,175
Now take the pill
and put it on your tongue.

1253
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:20,541
Swallow the pill.

1254
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:22,410
Now let me see your tongues.

1255
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:29,715
Now, doesn't that
feel better?
Don't we all feel better?

1256
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,783
Yes, Staff Sergeant!
Good.

1257
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:34,489
Now, dig your sleeping holes.

1258
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,527
Dig your holes
with the hands God gave you.

1259
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:48,266
[Jet engines roaring]

1260
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:51,838
Fucking zoomies.

1261
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:54,614
They're gonna win the war
all by themselves?

1262
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,180
They'll be sleeping
in their own beds
tonight, too.

1263
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:59,813
So what, man?
We're scout fucking snipers.

1264
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:02,722
When the shit hits the fan,
we lead the fucking way.
Ooh-rah!

1265
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:03,781
(marines)
Ooh-rah.

1266
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:07,192
Sure, look around.
You hear those planes.

1267
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:09,695
This war is gonna move
too fast for us.

1268
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,824
All right,
we can shoot 1,000 yards.

1269
01:13:12,134 --> 01:13:14,694
To go that far in Vietnam,
that would take a week.

1270
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,169
In World War I, a year.

1271
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:19,002
Here, it's gonna take
about 10 fucking seconds.

1272
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,770
By the time we have
our rifles dialed...

1273
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,243
the war is going to be
a mile down the road.

1274
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:25,441
Wake up!

1275
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:28,843
Jesus!

1276
01:13:32,855 --> 01:13:34,482
What the fuck is going on?

1277
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:36,218
Get out of my sleeping hole.

1278
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:39,227
We're about to go
in the shit, and you're
fucking with their heads.

1279
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:41,092
Get out of my sleeping hole.

1280
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:42,721
(Sykes)
Lucky day! Listen up!

1281
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:45,232
We've got our orders.
We leave tomorrow, 0900.

1282
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:47,030
Swofford, you got to sign
your waiver again.

1283
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:48,502
I can't read
your fucking handwriting.

1284
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,334
Yes, Staff Sergeant.

1285
01:14:02,718 --> 01:14:03,844
Done.

1286
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:06,979
I don't give a fuck,
Swofford, I could read it
the first time.

1287
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:09,251
Your boy, Troy
got turned down
for re-enlistment.

1288
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,456
What? You're fucking with me.

1289
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:14,996
Hey, watch your mouth.
I don't need
your fucking attitude.

1290
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:17,692
But that's all he...
That's all he wants,
is to be in the Suck.

1291
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:20,600
I know that,
but the Suck doesn't want him.

1292
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:23,637
He had a criminal record.
He lied about it.

1293
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,406
And he lied about it
on his application.

1294
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:29,638
So when we get back home,
he's out. He's out.

1295
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,875
The reason I'm telling you
is so you can keep him
from fucking up.

1296
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:35,143
You think
you can manage that?

1297
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:38,015
Can you manage that?

1298
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:48,192
[Helicopter whirring]

1299
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:17,191
What?
So you weren't
even gonna tell me?

1300
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:20,186
What?

1301
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,331
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up
and mind your own business?

1302
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:47,187
What the fuck is this, man?

1303
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,121
(Cortez)
Bet it smells good, man.

1304
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:51,887
She sent it back, man.

1305
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:53,861
Sent it back
like you send back a ring.

1306
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,055
(Cortez)
What did she write?

1307
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,859
"I'll always love you,
Kristina."

1308
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:59,059
What's the fucking problem,
then?

1309
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:00,999
Nothing stays the same,
Swoff.

1310
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:03,766
Not our girlfriends,
not our families,
not anyone.

1311
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:05,739
Time doesn't stop
back in the real world...

1312
01:16:05,808 --> 01:16:08,436
'cause we're about to
go in the shit.
We're Marines.

1313
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:12,276
Nobody gives a rat's ass.
No, we're jarheads.

1314
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,843
Yeah, what the fuck
do you know?

1315
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:17,681
I know you're
a fucking jarhead,
and that's all I need to know.

1316
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:19,084
Jar-fucking-head.

1317
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:21,418
Hey, jarhead,
what's the Marine Corps
birthday?

1318
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:24,050
Marine Corps birthday?
November 10th, 1775.

1319
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,957
Older than the USA.
Fucking A.

1320
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:28,588
Birthplace?
Tun Tavern, Philadelphia.

1321
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,131
That's the city
of brotherly love.

1322

Bloodiest battle

Killed 37 Chinese by hand
during the Boxer Rebellion
of 1900.

1326

The greatest weapon on earth?
The Marine and his rifle!

1327
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:43,206
You wanna win
your fucking war?

1328
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:44,746
You tell it to the Marines!

You earned it, man.

We turned
the inside of our tent...

1338

into a circus.

1339

'Cause inside of our circus,
we cannot be injured.

Inside of our circus,
we cannot be touched.

1341
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,807
But we are insane...

1342
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,109

What the fuck, man?

1357
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,470
I pissed myself.

1358

Got to find the fucking FO.
What?

1359
01:18:57,312 --> 01:18:59,337
The forward observers,
they got us dialed in.

We gotta find the fuck...
Get down!

Fuck!
Swofford, you get
on the binos.

1362

You get your binos
and you find him.

1363

Troy, get on that radio.
Radio's dead.

Go to the com truck!
Look up!
And get some batteries!

You did it.

1715
01:49:53,367 --> 01:49:54,994
You did it clean.

1716
01:49:55,736 --> 01:49:57,397
You made us proud.

1717
01:49:59,706 --> 01:50:01,037
Semper Fi.

1718
01:50:02,943 --> 01:50:04,604
Semper fucking Fi.

1719

1720

You mind if I sit down
in your bus?

1725
01:50:32,105 --> 01:50:34,335
(Swoff)
Every war is different.

1726
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:36,537

01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:02,032
Give me one shot...

01:51:18,018 --> 01:51:19,315
Hey, where you going?

1731
01:51:37,671 --> 01:51:38,763

(Swoff)
A story.

1738
01:52:50,877 --> 01:52:53,402
A man fires a rifle
for many years...

1739
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,743
and he goes to war.

1740
01:52:57,117 --> 01:52:59,347
And afterwards
he comes home...

1741
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,351
and he sees that
whatever else he might do
with his life...

1742
01:53:04,658 --> 01:53:06,250
build a house...

1743
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:09,085
Iove a woman...

1744
01:53:10,363 --> 01:53:12,388
change his son's diaper...

1745
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:16,135
he will always remain...

1746
01:53:17,437 --> 01:53:18,768
a jarhead.

1747
01:53:22,309 --> 01:53:24,209
And all the jarheads...

1748
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:27,979
killing and dying...

1749
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:32,177
they will always...

1750
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,680
be me.

1751
01:53:40,827 --> 01:53:42,351
We are still...

1752
01:53:43,363 --> 01:53:44,853
in the desert.
