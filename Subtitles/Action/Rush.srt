1
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,250
(English commentator 1) ...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,810
(commentator speaking French)

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,848
(English commentator 1) With the
weather conditions so uncertain,

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,166
the drivers prepare for...

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,720
(commentator speaking German)

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,802
(English commentator 2)
...the track is still dangerously wet,

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,251
but following a drivers' meeting,

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,403
-a decision has finally been taken.
-(announcer) Three minutes to go.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,162
Everybody off the grid now.
-(thunder rumbling)

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,322
(commentator speaking German)

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,045
(overlapping chatter)

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,245
(Niki) Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,403
and each year two of us die.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,527
What kind of person
does a job like this?

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,682
Not normal men, for sure.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,004
Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,081
People who are desperate to make a mark

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,441
and are prepared to die trying.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,885
My name is Niki Lauda,

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,369
and racing people
know me for two things.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,206
The first is my rivalry with him.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,245
(speaking Italian)

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,284
(announcer) Photographers,
please clear the grid.

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,768
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,485
No, he's going on wets.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,723
(Niki) I don't know
why it became such a big thing.

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,128
We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,566
To me this is perfectly normal,

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,802
but other people saw it differently,

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,804
that whatever it was between us
went deeper.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,243
(speaking Italian)

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,731
(engine revving)

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,082
The other thing I'm remembered for

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,926
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,525
when I was chasing him

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,682
like an asshole.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,489
(engines revving)

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,930
(tyres screeching)

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,802
(overlapping chatter)

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,645
Trauma trolley, please.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,121
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,645
Hunt. James Hunt.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,803
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,811
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,849
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,007
I have.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,323
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,244
What did you disagree about?

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,890
It's none of your business.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,002
"(Q Foans)
-Sorry_

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,365
His wife.

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,926
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,083
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,765
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,601
Only what she asked me to do.

56
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,365
Which was...

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,526
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,007
-(groaning)
- Oh! Sorry.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,920
(James) I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,601
It's not because
they respect what we do,

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,490
driving round and round in circles.

62
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,131
Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,442
It's our closeness to death.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,966
You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,044
The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,043
They feel that in you.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,441
My name is James Hunt.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,562
My father is a stockbroker,

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,207
my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,725
And I...

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,890
Well, I do this.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,925
It's a wonderful way to live.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,128
It's the only way to drive.

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,481
As if each day is your last.

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,561
(tyres screeching)

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,491
(Gemma laughing)

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,240
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,163
Oh, you still haven't.

79
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,766
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,841
It's a lower division,

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,446
where idiots like me mess about

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,525
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,602
- You look disappointed.
- No.

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,289
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,930
That's not true.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,602
- Don't worry. I will be one day.
-(9i99le$)

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,284
Morning, everyone.

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,924
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,444
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

90
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,601
How do you do?

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,764
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,804
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,805
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,330
How do you do?

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,650
Fine, thanks.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,569
(Hesketh laughs) Well done, Superstar.

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,166
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,009
Lotus 59.

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,851
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

100
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,804
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,369
(James vomiting)

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,408
(Hesketh) Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,562
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

104
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,850
(announcer) All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,002
(echoing distorted voices)

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,769
(announcer) ...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,730
All right, Superstar?

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,524
Never better, patron.

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,040
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,931
(Hesketh) Quick toke of this.

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,730
(announcer) At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

112
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,848
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,531
and Dave Walker completing Row 1.

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,090
-with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.
- Who's that?

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,965
(Doc) He's new.

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,284
- Some German.
- Austrian.

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,443
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

119
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,887
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,564
You'll need these.

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,811
-(Bubbles) Okay, start her up.
-(engine revving)

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
(Hesketh) Ah! What music!

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,890
They could never have imagined it,

124
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,247
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,570
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,607
Nursie, men love women,

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,484
but even more than that,

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,882
men love cars.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,163
-(spectator) Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,571
Go, James!

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,246
(camera clicking)

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,401
Hunt's still in the lead,

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,642
but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,251
(engine roaring)

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,284
(race commentator) Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.

136
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,924
They're leaving the pack far behind.

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,924
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,042
(race commentator)
Lauda takes a look down the inside...

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,610
(tyres screeching)

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,444
...and he's sold him a dummy!

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,962
Lauda is through! He's in the lead!

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,201
Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.

143
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,964
(engines roaring)

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,530
Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,608
Lauda's not leaving any gap.

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,725
The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,723
Oh! There's contact!

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,848
(tyres screeching)

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,411
(spectators gasp)

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,723
The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,687
- The back marker's gone through.
-(grunts angrily)

152
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,644
-(grunts)
- You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,529
-call him "Hunt the Shunt".
-(engine revving)

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,170
(engine roars)

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,001
Asshole!

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,844
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

157
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,083
(race commentator)
Lauda is clearly furious.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,607
There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,569
It's gonna be victory for Hunt.

160
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,002
It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,168
-(all cheering)
-(laughing)

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,611
(commentator) So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season

163
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,920
here at Crystal Palace,

164
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,771
after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,569
Lauda was unable to restart

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,411
after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out

167
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,681
in the last lap of the race.

168
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,690
(Hesketh) Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

169
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,885
Hey, asshole.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,122
That was my line. I had that corner.

171
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,443
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,881
- I think that corner had you.
-(all laughing)

173
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,486
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

174
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,404
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,408
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,489
(clucking)

177
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,403
Fuck you. What's your name?

178
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,409
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,410
(James in German accent)
Jawohl. Remember ze name.

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,250
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

181
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,406
-(feedback on PA)
-. . .cunt.

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,005
Who was that?

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,242
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

185
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,446
(Gemma giggling)

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,005
(Niki) In my home town, Vienna,

187
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,762
my family is famous
for one thing - business.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,607
My grandfather was a businessman,

189
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,525
my father, too.

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,449
So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,

191
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,329
they had a few things to say.

192
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,170
(both speaking German)

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,805
Gut.

194
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,371
(Lauda's grandfather yelling in German)

195
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,482
(Niki) So if my family
wasn't going to help me,

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,326
I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,370
I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car

198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,528
and an owner who had run out of money

199
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,802
and was willing to accept my terms.

200
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,884
(presenter) And so,
ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,764
I'm delighted to say

202
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,367
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

203
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,561
is James Hunt.

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,205
(all cheering)

205
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,925
Superb news!

206
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,842
-(man) Well done, James.
- Superstar!

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,445
Fantastic!

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,207
- Well done. Congratulations.
-(laughing) Thank you so much.

209
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,441
Yes!

210
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,851
Erm...

211
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,690
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

212
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,888
-(audience laughing)
-...or a stockbroker or something.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,684
They gave me the first-class education,

214
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,842
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

215
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,684
-and I ended up with you lot.
-(audience laughing)

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,250
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,362
(all laughing)

218
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,086
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,565
- Yes!
- Very true.

220
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,123
I fall out with people left and right.

221
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,809
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

222
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,882
-are budgerigars.
-(all laughing)

223
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,205
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,767
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

225
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,963
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

226
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,485
I'm going to give it to my father

227
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,324
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,721
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

229
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,404
(audience applauding)

230
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,321
(J1 Mama Weer All Crazee Now by Slade)

231
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,923
(Hesketh) Well done, Superstar.

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,566
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

233
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,250
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,688
You are. (laughs) I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

235
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,161
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,527
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

237
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,604
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,847
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

239
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,365
He's never won a bloody thing.

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,363
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,090
with two million Austrian schillings.

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,605
Jesus.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,284
(engines roaring)

244
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,761
(speaking French)

245
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,169
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

246
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,490
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,765
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

248
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,724
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay! (clears throat)

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,485
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

250
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,562
Clay Regazzoni.

251
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,689
- How are you?
- Good.

252
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,444
- Pleasure.
-(Stanley) And these are your mechanics.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,449
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

254
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,284
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

255
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,805
Sure.

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,251
Hello.

257
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,726
(mechanic) There she is. P160.

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,126
- Same as Regazzonfs?
-Identical in every detail.

259
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,570
How much does she weigh?

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,326
-600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

261
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,126
- Why so heavy?
-It's a V12 engine.

262
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,329
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

263
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,323
Okay.

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,687
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,161
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

266
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,651
It needs to be 500,

267
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,404
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

268
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,720
(mechanic) We already tried.

269
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,961
(Niki) Tried what?
(mechanic) Everything.

270
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,650
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

271
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,008
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

272
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,561
(blowtorch crackling)

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,485
Now the engine block.

274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,291
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

275
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,683
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

276
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,524
front and rear wing.

277
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,042
Okay, thank you. Good night.

278
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,130
(engine roaring)

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,445
What was Regazzoni's time?

280
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,731
1253.

281
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,924
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,049
-(laughs) Well, that's impossible.
-(mechanic 2) No chance.

283
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,011
(sighs)

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,367
(mechanic)
We've been working on it all night.

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,488
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

286
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,403
(Regazzoni) I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

287
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,403
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

288
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,925
(sighs)

289
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,205
Gloves, please.

290
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,725
'Fanculo.

291
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,648
(indistinct)

292
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,170
(car engine roaring)

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
(ticking)

294
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,086
(clicks)

295
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,687
(whirring)

296
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,969
-(Nikl) I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

297
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,042
What did you do to the car?

298
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,647
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

299
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,325
Go on.

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,084
A guaranteed place in the team,

301
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,807
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

302
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,804
(93505) Are you crazy?

303
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,447
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

304
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,962
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

305
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,883
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

306
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,691
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

307
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,282
Was he quicker in my car?

308
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,002
He was, wasn't he?

309
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,961
Did he go two seconds faster?

310
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,045
2.3.

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,888
So, have a think,

312
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,761
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

313
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,171
Hey, Niki.

314
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,450
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

315
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,561
What?

316
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,282
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

317
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,890
It's none of your business.

318
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,726
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

319
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,721
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

320
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,251
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

321
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,641
who has a reputation for two things.

322
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,405
For being a little crazy on the track,

323
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,724
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

324
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,287
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

325
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,330
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

326
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,084
(laughing)

327
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,722
But if that doesn't bother you...

328
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,610
What's his name, the driver?

329
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,365
Hunt. James Hunt.

330
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,927
You see, you share information
and I share information.

331
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,487
That's what teammates are for.

332
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,361
(sighs)

333
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,210
(James) Where the hell are we going?

334
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,567
<i>(Hesketh) I promise
it'll be worth it. (laughs)</i>

335
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,085
Just keep them closed.

336
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,965
Wait for it.

337
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,609
- Wait for it.
-(laughs)

338
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,406
There. What do you say?

339
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,090
(James) She's Formula 1.

340
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,204
Yes, she is, Superstar.

341
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,450
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

342
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,931
And since the economics of F1

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,561
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

344
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,041
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

345
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,209
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

346
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,602
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

347
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,565
(all laughing)

348
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,242
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

349
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,443
(James) Who?
(Hesketh) Lauda.

350
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,285
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

351
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,930
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

352
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,562
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

353
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,645
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

354
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,248
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

355
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,650
And racing overalls which read,

356
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,366
-"Sex. Breakfast of champions."
-(reads along)

357
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,771
(all laughing)

358
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,929
So, when do we start?

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,087
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

360
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,971
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

361
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,928
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,764
(Stirling Moss) When the season started,
people wondered

363
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,890
whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts

364
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,643
were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.

365
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,802
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

366
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,441
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

367
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,285
But they have made quite an impact.

368
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,523
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

369
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,207
(announcer 1) All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.

370
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,362
- A severe crash at the Esses.
-(siren wailing)

371
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,489
(announcer 2) Red flag.
There is a car off the track.

372
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,244
(Moss) And reports are reaching me

373
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,527
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

374
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,406
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

375
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,687
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

376
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,404
going on behind me towards the track,

377
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,881
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

378
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,371
We will, of course,
have more information for you

379
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,487
as and when we get it,

380
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,605
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

381
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,364
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

382
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,885
(commentator on TV)
Drivers of top stature

383
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,689
we've lost just in the past four seasons

384
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,607
have included Piers Courage,
Jochen Rindt,

385
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,968
Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson

386
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,247
and today, at Watkins Glen,

387
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,641
Formula 1 has claimed another driver.

388
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,527
(announcer) The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.

389
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,291
Their places on the grid
will be left empty.

390
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,806
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

391
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,565
Why?

392
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,326
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

393
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,851
It's his fault.

394
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,809
- Is that right?
-It's obvious.

395
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,929
Look at the tyre marks.

396
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,563
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

397
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,051
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

398
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,330
Fine. How is it at the back?

399
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,322
Not planning on being there for long.

400
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,611
(announcer)
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.

401
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,245
Ten minutes.

402
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,651
(in German)

403
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,005
Arsehole.

404
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,688
(James) Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.

405
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,761
Turn in hard,

406
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,491
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

407
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,369
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

408
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,041
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

409
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,448
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

410
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,490
up through third, fourth, fifth...

411
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,562
(Suzy) ls Alexander round?

412
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,686
(James) Er, yes, he was.

413
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,364
He went back to the house
to take a call.

414
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,204
He'll be back shortly.

415
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,442
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

416
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,131
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

417
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,009
And "toy".

418
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,290
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

419
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,365
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

420
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,091
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

421
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,209
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

422
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,204
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

423
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,443
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

424
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,523
You're James, aren't you?

425
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,250
Yes.

426
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,929
You fit the description.

427
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,731
Is that right?

428
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,928
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

429
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,169
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

430
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,330
(James) What was the description?

431
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,925
(Suzy) Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

432
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,207
Negative only in terms of character.

433
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,643
I've been told to avoid you.

434
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,451
BY Whom?

435
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,724
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

436
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,087
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

437
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,527
I was. I'm not any more.

438
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,127
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

439
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,770
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

440
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,205
But according to the team,

441
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,726
(in German accent) "The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

442
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,285
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

443
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,330
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

444
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,085
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,043
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

446
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

447
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,886
ﬂaughs)

448
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,365
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

449
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,525
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,329
And what about your soul, your heart?

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,562
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

452
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,166
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

453
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,481
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

454
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,971
They think it would be good for me.

455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,442
Hmm. What do you think?

456
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,122
- It sounds fucking awful.
-(laughing)

457
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,607
But since they're right
about most things,

458
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,531
-they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

459
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,001
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,681
ﬂaughs)

461
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,528
-(church bells tolling)
-(applause)

462
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,845
(all cheering)

463
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,609
(cameras clicking)

464
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,925
(photographer) Suzy.

465
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,051
(man) Bravo!

466
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Hey, hey, hey!

467
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,803
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

468
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,571
Didn't want to ruin your day.

469
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,561
It's. .. It's the Kraut.

470
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,410
What about him?

471
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,123
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

472
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,921
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

473
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,690
Did he buy his way in there, too?

474
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,364
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

475
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,408
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

476
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,484
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

477
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,687
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

478
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,088
- It's a Ferrari!
-It's a shitbox.

479
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,928
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

480
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,049
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

481
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,805
Uh!

482
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,882
(cameras clicking)

483
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,849
(speaking Italian)

484
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,683
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

485
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,242
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

486
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,731
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

487
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,170
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

488
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,204
(Regazzoni) But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

489
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,362
It's passion, love.

490
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,205
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

491
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,327
Not me.

492
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,085
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

493
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,884
I would.

494
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,567
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

495
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,961
Not yet, but I will.

496
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,529
If you can, I can.

497
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,243
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

498
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,521
ﬂaughs)

499
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,568
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

500
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,165
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

501
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,083
and better at setting up the car.

502
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,924
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,161
Screw you.

504
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,289
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

505
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,249
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

506
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,129
that could rub off on you.

507
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,851
Forget it. Make your own friends.

508
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,605
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

509
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,723
(Clay speaking Italian)

510
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,484
(overlapping chatter)

511
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,090
(sighs)

512
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,604
(Italian pop music playing)

513
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,850
(door closes)

514
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,565
Are you leaving?

515
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,091
Yes.

516
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,210
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

517
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,765
anywhere with a train station?

518
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,643
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

519
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,327
Get in.

520
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,680
(J1 Sad Sweet Dreamer
by Sweet Sensation on radio)

521
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,127
J1 Been another blue day
without you, girl

522
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,767
J1 Been another sad summer song

523
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,525
J1 I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long

524
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,361
(turns off)

525
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,561
What are you doing?

526
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,485
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

527
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,247
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

528
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,044
My What?

529
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,521
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

530
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,045
which means there's air in the system.

531
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,931
- Anything else?
- No.

532
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,685
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

533
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,411
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

534
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,209
which explains
why you're weaving so much.

535
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,760
Hmm. How can you tell?

536
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,088
- My ass.
- Sorry?

537
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,129
God gave me an okay mind,

538
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,931
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

539
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,481
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

540
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,291
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

541
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,011
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

542
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,642
This car is as good as new. Relax.

543
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,643

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,485

545
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,244
(Niki) No. As long as I'm back

546
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,651

Ja.

- Marlene.
- Niki.

Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?

- Yes.

(both speaking Italian)

560
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,251
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

561
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,526
It's my honour, Niki, please.

562
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,841
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

563
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,681
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

564
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,843
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

565
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,882
(both speaking Italian)

566
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,808
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

567
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,041
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

568
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,565
Who are you? Should I know you?

569
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,130
(man 1) What, you don't know?

570
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,645
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

571
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,210
- Him?
-(man 1) Yes.

572
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,527
- Impossible.
-(man 1) Why?

573
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,168
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

574
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,645
their shirts are open to here.

575
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,404
- Thank you.
- Yes.

576
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,882
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

577
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,571
(Niki) There's no need to drive fast.

578
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,922
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

579
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,245
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

580
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,845
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

581
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,684
why would I drive fast?

582
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,522
Because I'm asking you to.

583
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,001

584
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,371

This is an incredible battle

between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari

595
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,086
and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.

596

...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,250
(commentator on TV)
Lauda attacking Hunt.

598
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,089
Lauda gets through on the inside.

599
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,725
Goes wide at the exit.

600
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,410
Hunt is past again.

601
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,523
Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.

602
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,605
They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.

603
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,730
So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.

604
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,127
Hunt is now ahead once more.

605
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,242
But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.

606
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,760
And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...

607
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,083
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

608
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,611
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

609
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,125
We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.

610
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,201
They come down the hill.

612
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,570
And Hunt's got a problem!

613
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,086
Hunt pulls across to the left.

614
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,964
Lauda goes ahead on his own.

615
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
A sad end to a wonderful battle.

is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.

The title going to Niki Lauda,

619
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,925
who wins the race,

620
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,480
who wins the World Championship.

(both speaking German)

629
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,880
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

630
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,890
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

631
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,890
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

632
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,889
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

633
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,406
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

634
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,410
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

635
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,723
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

636
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,887
Right. Why's that?

637
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,891
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

638
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,724
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

639
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,723
- You're just a charger and a party guy.
-(laughs)

640
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,080
That's why everybody likes you.

641
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,682
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

643
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,725
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

644

All that affection, all those smiles

645
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,049
-is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

646
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,526
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

647
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,251
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

648
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,930
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

649
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,765
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

650
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,281
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

651
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,449
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

652
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,291
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

653
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,529
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

654
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,443
Arseholes?

655
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,966
You should go home more often, too.

656
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,282
I heard you got married.

657
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,884
Yes, I did.

658
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,046
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

659
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,242
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

660
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,608
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

661
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,880
No?

662
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,130
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

663
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,125
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

664

665
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,166
Thank you, Niki. I mightjust have two.

666
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,010
(James) Right, Bubbles,

667
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,169
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

668
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,691
Your word is my command.

669
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,282
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

670
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,683
What the hell's going on?

671
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,446
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

672
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,530
(door opening)

673
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,520
Do you know what the date is today?

674
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,046
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

675
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,724
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

676
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,203
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

677
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,285
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

678
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,283
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

679
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,965
Yes?

680
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,130
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

681
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,081
Well, so? (stammers)
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

682
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,447
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

683
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,330
(sighs)

684
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,606
Right.

685
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,527
Except we are, or were.

686
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,766
I've made something of a miscalculation.

687
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,202
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

688
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,763
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

689
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,009
What are you saying?

690
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

691
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,767
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

692
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,961
Probably have to sell this place.

693
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,562
Oh, Christ.

694
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,804
(James sighs)

695
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,930
(J1 Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff)

696
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,689
(coughs)

697
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,966
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

698
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,925
I mean, (stammers) what about Lotus?

699
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,485
You don't wanna know. (sighs)

700
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,451
- Actually, I do.
- Okay. Uh...

701
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,802
They felt your reputation preceded you.

702
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,804
And what does that mean?

703
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,370
(telephone rings)

704
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,489
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

705
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,481
(sighs) Peter Hunt.

706
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,410
Fuck.

707
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,685
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

708
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,528
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

709
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,131
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

710
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,329
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

711
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,690
ﬂaughs)

712
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,362
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

713
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,485
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

714
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,966
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

715
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,124
I can't watch this.

716
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,201
What were you hoping for anyway?

717
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,967
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

718
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,963
No danger of that.

719
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,327
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

720
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,165
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

721
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,891
-looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

722
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,082
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

723
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,650
I just hoped I'd married someone

724
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,803
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

725
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,684
At least there's something
behind the facade.

726
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,927
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

727
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,401
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

728
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,244
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

729
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,725
(door closes)

730
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,009
(telephone ringing)

731
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,445
(clears throat)

732
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,405
- Hello?
-(Peter) Hi, James.

733
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,762
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

734
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,362
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

735
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,966
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

736
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,722
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

737
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,201
Say anything, just get me in that room.

738
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,884
(Mayer) I'll come straight to the point.

739
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,407
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

740
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,721
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

741
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,121
(Caldwell) Coper-fucking-sucar.
(Mayer) And we need a replacement.

742
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,650
ASA-fucking-P.

743
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,486
(sighs) Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

744
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,005
- Jacky lckx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

745
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,331
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

746
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,847
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

747
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,928
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

748
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,685
(Hogan) The sponsors like him.

749
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,322
(laughs) What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

750
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,084
- We wanna be successful.
-(James) Yes, so do I.

751
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,524
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

752
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,125
(Mayer)
I heard about this thing with Niki.

753
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,366
Everyone has.

754
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,007
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

755
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,368
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

756
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,682
Which is why I'm here, begging.

757
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,605
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

758
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,523
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

759
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,529
say the right things.

760
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,161
I can beat this guy, trust me.

761
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,889
Just give me the drive.

762
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,489
(Bubbles) Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.

763
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,284
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

764
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,887
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

765
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,889
there is no better driver in the world.

766
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,442
He's the real thing, Teddy.

767
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,040
- He's what we all came into this for.
- Mmm.

768
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,162
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

769
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,363
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

770
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,402
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

771
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,524
You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.

772
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,247
You just might with James.

773
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,971
(announcer speaking Portuguese)

774
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,171
(Latin music playing)

775
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,767
(Moss) Welcome to Séo Paulo, Brazil,
and the lnterlagos circuit

776
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,521
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

777
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,923
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

778
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,082
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

779
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,931
by just two hundredths of a second.

780
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,524
(sighs) New car.

781
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,010
- Inoficed.
- Pole position.

782
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,371
I noticed that, too.

783
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,886
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

784
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,527
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

785
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,410
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

786
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,368
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

787
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,250
which should give him the best chance
of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.

788
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,884
If ever there was a doubt about

789
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,248
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

790
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,921
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

791
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,725
(engines revving)

792
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,125
(commentator) Here in South Africa,

793
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,162
James Hunt is determined to make amends

794
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,284
after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.

795
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,762
But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.

796
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,490
James Hunt comes home second

797
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,006
to confirm his championship
challenge at last

798
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,809
and score his first points

799
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,410
of the season.

800
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,846
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

801
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,962
Next time I'll have you.

802
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,331
We'll see in Spain.

803
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,684
(engine roaring)

804
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,640
(commentator) James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season

805
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,206
here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.

806
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,527
It was only a matter of time.

807
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,690
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

808
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,724
(speaking Italian)

809
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,721
-it's too wide.
- Disqualified.

810
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,487
- What?
- You're disqualified.

811
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,244
(Caldwell) How can we be disqualified?

812
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,169
-1.5 centimetres.
-It's the same car.

813
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,402
(Ferrari crew member) Giustissimo.

814
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,486
(indistinct)

815
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,721
You fucking...

816
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,684
(commentator) ...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.

817
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,643
(whirring)

818
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,563
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

819
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,728
(Caldwell) New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

820
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,570
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

821
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,081
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

822
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,367
(man) With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

823
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,526
(James) Fuck.

824
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,728
(Caldwell) What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

825
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,205
(all arguing)

826
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,764
(engine roaring)

827
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,880
(commentator) And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,

828
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,526
his championship year is not going well.

829
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,126
And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!

830
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,368
His engine is smoking.

831
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,442
(speaking French)

832
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,131
(commentator) Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

833
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,685
And James Hunt is out!

834
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,240
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

835
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,442
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

836
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,729
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

837
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,411
(all screaming)

838
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,051
Shit!

839
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,767
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

840
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,484
It's fucking undriveable!

841
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,449
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

842
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,482
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

843
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,608
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

844
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,768
- They're killing us out there.
-(Caldwell) Go and get your dick wet.

845
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,609
- You're a wanker.
-(James) Fuck you.

846
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,449
(Caldwell) You're a fucking wanker.
(James) I will, arsehole.

847
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,641
(all laughing)

848
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,324
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

849
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,481
It's good for everyone

850
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,489
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

851
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,331
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

852
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,887
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

853
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,968
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

854
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,411
that's what's going wrong.

855
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,007
<i>(commentator) So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

856
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,844
in this year's Formula 1 season,

857
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,603
Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,

858
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,729
and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.

859
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,287
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

860
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,923
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

861
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,610
and his team of Italian cheats

862
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,160
-who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

863
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,362
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

864
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,689
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

865
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,041
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

866
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,527
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

867
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,809
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

868
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,850
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

869
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,721
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

870
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,049
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

871
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,201
Thank you. Thank you.

872
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,205
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

873
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,210
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

874
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,969
I don't mind it.

875
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,889
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

876
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,681
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

877
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,404
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, komm.

878
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,045
(Niki speaking German)

879
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,525
No wonder she left him.

880
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,844
(car door closes)

881
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,890
Anyone seen Suzy?

882
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,006
She's supposed to be here today.

883
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,243
We, er...didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

884
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,770
Tell me what?

885
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,565
Jesus.

886
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,805
Is that from him?

887
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,811
Yeah.

888
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,485
(snorts)

889
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,482
So when did all this start?

890
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,007
That weekend I went skiing.

891
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,087
Why have you come here, James?

892
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,085
I've come to get you back.

893
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,169
You don't want me back.

894
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,930
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

895
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,321
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

896
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,400
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

897
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,164
settle you down, help with the racing.

898
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,931
No, I didn't.

899
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,282
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

900
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,120
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

901
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,321
it might even have worked.

902
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,929
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

903
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,843
No, you're not terrible.

904
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,003
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

905
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,004
God help anyone who wants more.

906
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,361
ﬂaughs)

907
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,883
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

908
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,806
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

909
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,531
What's important is how it feels to me,

910
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,967
and it feels like he adores me.

911
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,891
(reporter 1) James!
(reporter 2) New York Times!

912
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,405
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

913
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,404
(reporter 2) James, how do you feel...
(James) It's all very amicable.

914
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,006
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

915
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,566
- I mean, lover, which makes her happy.
-(reporters laughing)

916
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,211
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

917
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,685
which makes him happy.

918
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,041
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

919
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,323
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

920
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,084
without it costing me a penny,

921
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,322
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

922
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,131
-(reporters laugh)
- I have a flight to catch.

923
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,925
(engine starting)

924
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,771
(both moaning)

925
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,483
(engine revving)

926
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,491
(commentator) We haven't seen
this sort of intensity

927
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,170
from James Hunt all season long.

928
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,170
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

929
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,682
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

930
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,444
(engine roaring)

931
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,561
(commentator speaking French)

932
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,284
(cheering)

933
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,568
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

934
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,082
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

935
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,050
Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt

936
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,731
as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.

937
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,524
(cheering)

938
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,403
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

939
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,285
So James Hunt gets the plaudits

940
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,209
of the crowd, the first Briton to win

941
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,930
a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch

942
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,929
since Jim Clark in 1964.

943
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,568
(Moss) James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

944
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,570
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

945
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,564
Big balls.

946
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,130
Would you... (laughs)

947
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,250
Following an inquiry
into the disqualification

948
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,721
of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,

949
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,251
it has been decided

950
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,243
-to overturn this disqualification...
-(all) Yes!

951
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,767
...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.

952
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,290
(excited chatter)

953
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,405
James! James!

954
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,289
(Moss) James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

955
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,249
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

956
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,244
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors -

957
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,448
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here -

958
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,804
butjustice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

959
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,366
and having my car
back at its best again.

960
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,801
(both speaking German)

961
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,371
(reporters laughing)

962
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,970
(girls) James! James!

963
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,523
(speaking German)

964
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,771
(chuckles)

965
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,407
-(clears throat)
-(exhales)

966
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,051
(registrar speaking German)

967
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,251
(Marlene laughing)

968
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,041
(both speaking German)

969
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,687
Welcome to the legendary Nurburgring.

970
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,283
This is a 14.2-mile track,

971
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,128
complete with 185 corners and bends.

972
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,805
(tyres screeching)

973
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,164
(driver screaming)

974
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,165
(siren wailing)

975
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,249
(fan speaking German)

976
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,731
(Niki speaks German)

977
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,330
(thunder rumbling)

978
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,923
(Moss) Welcome to the NUrburgring,

979
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,606
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.

980
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,730
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

981
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,569
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

982
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,250
and latest reports indicate

983
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,010
there is no relief in sight.

984
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,724
(overlapping chatter)

985
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,846
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

986
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,082
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

987
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,805
Thank you.

988
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,923
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

989
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,202
the Nurburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

990
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,730
and dangerous track in the world.

991
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,047
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

992
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,721
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

993
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,451
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

994
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,927
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

995
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,123
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

996
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,282
-(driver) Cancel the race?
-(drivers protesting)

997
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,402
There would be no change
to the situation

998
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,885
as far as points is concerned.

999
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,571
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

1000
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,881
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

1001
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,329
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

1002
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,644
(James) it also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

1003
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,606
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

1004
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,571
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

1005
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,241
No, but there would be one race less

1006
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,647
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

1007
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,007
James is right. This is just tactics.

1008
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,765
(driver) Maybe he's just frightened.

1009
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,805
Which asshole said this?

1010
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,649
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

1011
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,526
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

1012
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,170
and I can live with it,

1013
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,282
but not one per cent more.

1014
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,641
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

1015
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,491
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

1016
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,803
I have the track record here.

1017
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,730
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

1018
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,485
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

1019
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,521
- Because I'm quicker than all of you.
-(drivers scoffing)

1020
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,848
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

1021
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,405
(drivers agreeing)

1022
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,847
(driver) Come on, Niki, let's race.
(FIA official) Gentlemen, please.

1023
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,644
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

1024
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,330
(scattered agreement)

1025
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,801
(sighs)

1026
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,531
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

1027
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,484
All those in favour of racing.

1028
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,047
(scattered approval)

1029
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,325
Gentlemen, the race is on.

1030
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,208
(driver 1) Ridiculous.
(driver 2) What a waste of time.

1031
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,564
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

1032
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,845
(chuckles)

1033
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,046
(revving)

1034
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,048
(Moss) In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

1035
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,525
but following a drivers' meeting,

1036
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,125
a decision has finally been taken.

1037
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,361
(speaking French)

1038
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,124
(Moss) The race is going ahead.

1039
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,725
(speaking German)

1040
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,566
(spectator) Niki!

1041
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,364
(announcer) One minute to go.

1042
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,043
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

1043
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,560
(James) ls Niki gonna change?
(Caldwell) No.

1044
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,722
Then we stay on wets, too.

1045
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,610
(speaking German)

1046
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,324
-(mechanic) Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

1047
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,280
-(Caldwell) All right, fire her up.
-(starts engine)

1048
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,323
(engine revving)

1049
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,246
(commentator) This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship

1050
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,921
has so far been the story of two men.

1051
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,601
Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.

1052
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,325
But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.

1053
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,444
He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,

1054
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,603
with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.

1055
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,451
It's a long race.

1056
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,171
If the track starts to dry out,

1057
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,124
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

1058
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,450
(engines revving)

1059
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,810
(spectators cheering)

1060
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,127
(track commentator speaking German)

1061
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,562
(commentator) Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

1062
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,803
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

1063
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,207
Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,

1064
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,322
forcing the McLaren onto the grass.

1065
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,091
Lauda has the lead at the moment.

1066
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,527
Lauda leads into the first corner.

1067
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,688
Hunt is in second place.

1068
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,931
Mass storming past Hunt!

1069
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,685
He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.

1070
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,009
Mass passing Lauda now!

1071
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,045
Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!

1072
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,884
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

1073
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,088
with everybody else making the decision

1074
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,282
to change tyres
afterjust one lap of this race.

1075
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,567
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

1076
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,770
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

1077
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,644
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1078
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,405
(Caldwell) Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

1079
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,889
Come on!

1080
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,249
Come on! What's going on?

1081
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,082
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

1082
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,090
-with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
-(pitman) You're clear. Go!

1083
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,766
Quick!

1084
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,004
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

1085
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,241
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

1086
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,082
It's a disaster! Come on!

1087
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,210
What's going on, you assholes?

1088
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,322
(speaking Italian)

1089
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,521
(speaking German)

1090
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,122
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

1091
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,647
His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.

1092
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,965
Lauda passing car after car.

1093
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,482
He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.

1094
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,521
(groans)

1095
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,202
-(driver) Niki!
-(coughing)

1096
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,129
(Merzario speaking Italian)

1097
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,126
(groaning)

1098
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,282
Get me out! Help me!

1099
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,201
(announcer) We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.

1100
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,520
Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.

1101
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,564
(radio announcer speaking German)

1102
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,087
(driver 1) Come this way.
(driver 2) Come on, come on!

1103
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,650
(Niki screaming in agony)

1104
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,726
(gasping)

1105
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,881
(Merzario speaking Italian)

1106
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,731
(driver 3) Keep trying.

1107
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,245
(Merzario speaking Italian)

1108
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,970
(driver 1) Come this way.
(driver 2) Okay.

1109
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,001
(radio announcer speaking German)

1110
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,882

(speaking German)

1113
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,247
(speaking German)

1114
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,767
(reporter on TV) The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,

1115
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,524
was the worst since records began.

1116
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,086
In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted

1117
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,926
after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.

1118
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,923
Due to safety concerns before the race,

1119
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,367
the Austrian had said
he would not take part,

1120
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,890
but in the end he did.

1121
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,567
He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,

1122
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,047
puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.

1123
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,727
Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,

1124
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,804
but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,

1125
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,770
who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,

1126
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,521
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.

1127
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,642
Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute

1128
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,371
in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.

1129
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,407
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

1130
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,403
(doctor) Frau Lauda. Frau Lauda?

1131
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,402
(speaking German)

1132
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,245

(indistinct chatter on PA)

1163
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,049
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1164
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,890
Looking good.

1165
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,002
(spectators speaking Italian)

1166
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,930
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1167
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,048
- What about him?
- He's here.

1168
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,885
- What?
- He's racing.

1169
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,926
(clicking)

1170
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,604
(reporters clamouring)

1171
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,890
Niki.

1172
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,045
It's that bad, huh?

1173
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,771
No.

1174
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,564
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

1175
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,483
how bad my appearance would be.

1176
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,087
They said with time it would be fine.

1177
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,564
But it won't.

1178
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,324
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

1179
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,284
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

1180
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,166
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

1181
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,280
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

1182
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,926
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1183
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,327
That race should never have gone ahead.

1184
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,684
No, it shouldn't.

1185
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,761
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

1186
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,410
You were.

1187
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,809
But, trust me...

1188
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,010
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

1189
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,529
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

1190
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,126
-(cameras clicking)
-(overlapping chatter)

1191
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,965
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1192
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,967
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

1193
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,002
and the expectations for your recovery?

1194
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,005
Sure.

1195
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,969
I had a skin graft operation,

1196
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,321
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

1197
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,321
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

1198
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,647
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1199
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,088
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

1200
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,571
(laughing)

1201
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,010
When they heard about your condition,

1202
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,487
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1203
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,165
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1204
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,248
(French reporter)
ls Reutemann driving today, too?

1205
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,684
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1206
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,851
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1207
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,370
(reporters laughing)

1208
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,085
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1209
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,210
Yes.

1210
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,764
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1211
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,410
(reporters laughing)

1212
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,849
You still think you can win?

1213
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,044
Yes, of course.

1214
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,082
- I have the better car.
-(cameras clicking)

1215
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,680
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1216
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,281
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1217
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,410
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1218
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,245
(scattered laughing)

1219
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,045
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1220
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,722
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive.

1221
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,928
-"You just need a right foot."
-(reporters laughing)

1222
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,607
(Clive) I'm being serious.

1223
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,283
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1224
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,968
And I'm being serious, too.

1225
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,930
- Fuck you. Press conference over.
-(cameras clicking)

1226
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,849
(reporters clamouring)

1227
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,929
(Clive) That was hairy.
(man) Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1228
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,246
I'll tell you that.

1229
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,924
(Clive) I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1230
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,764
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1231
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,484
-(James) Clive.
- That's the game.

1232
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,841
- See you.
- See you later.

1233
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,809
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1234
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,604
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

1235
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,444
on that last question, about Niki.

1236
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,086
-(laughs) You heard about that?
- I did.

1237
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,049
James. (groaning)

1238
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,851
(coughing) Please, James...

1239
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,764
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1240
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,611
Prick.

1241
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,008
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1242
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,126
-(door opening)
-(speaking Italian)

1243
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,361
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nurburgring,

1244
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,970
will race here today at Monza

1245
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,806
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1246
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,170
(track commentator) ...Niki Lauda!

1247
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,844
(spectators cheering)

1248
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,281
(announcer) Photographers,
please clear the grid.

1249
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,682
(mechanic) Niki, it's time.

1250
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,690
Okay?

1251
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,210
(engines revving)

1252
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,771
(announcer) Please clear the grid.

1253
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,528
One minute to go.

1254
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,085
(revving)

1255
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,969
(spectators cheering)

1256
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,570
(engines roaring)

1257
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,723
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1258
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,164
(commentator) The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.

1259
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,686
He's being overtaken by car after car.

1260
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,090
(speaking Italian)

1261
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,609
(commentator) Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.

1262
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,124
He wrestles it back onto the track,

1263
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,130
but that was a bad moment for Niki.

1264
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,207
Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,

1265
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,489
but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,

1266
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,450
to himself and to the rest of the field.

1267
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,331
And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!

1268
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,643
Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.

1269
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,483
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1270
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,641
(commentator) Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.

1271
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,571
He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.

1272
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,641
Lauda's starting to find the form

1273
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,728
that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.

1274
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,245
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1275
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,731
Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,

1276
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,003
the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.

1277
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,849
And there's James Hunt's McLaren,

1278
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,406
smoking stationary
by the side of the road.

1279
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,123
This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.

1280
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,931
It's Ronnie Peterson

1281
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,407
who comes home the winner here at Monza.

1282
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,490
But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,

1283
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,568
- Niki Lauda!
-(spectators cheering)

1284
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,568
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1285
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,962
(speaking Italian)

1286
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,761
(Moss) What a race, what a man,
what a season.

1287
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,002
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1288
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,082
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1289
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,327
to retaining the World Championship.

1290
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,886
(thunder rumbling)

1291
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,007
(commentator) So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season

1292
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,407
comes down to this final race in Japan

1293
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,006
in the shadow of Mount Fuji.

1294
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,525
Niki Lauda goes into

1295
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,005
this deciding race at Fuji

1296
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,242
just three points ahead of James Hunt.

1297
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,609
Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.

1298
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,687
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1299
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,247
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1300
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,408
I love competing. I love racing.

1301
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,443
Maybe you should ask Niki.

1302
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,841
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1303
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,201
(Japanese reporter) Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

1304
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,726
- Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?
-(scattered laughing)

1305
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,930
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1306
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,042
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1307
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,202
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1308
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,409
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1309
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,608
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1310
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,645
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1311
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,087
-(all laughing)
-...then fine, I'm flattered.

1312
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,761
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1313
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,451
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1314
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,722
will be with me as World Champion.

1315
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,480
(reporters clamouring)

1316
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,006
(reporter) How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1317
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,562
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1318
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,122
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1319
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,129
rolling in from the mountain.

1320
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,571
(commentator) And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,

1321
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,404
Lauda's lead a mere three points.

1322
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,164
What a way to finish the season.

1323
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,250
Hunt or Lauda?

1324
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,324
Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...

1325
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,489
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1326
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,688
The race is going ahead.

1327
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,603
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1328
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,331
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1329
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,802
(commentator) With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1330
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,962
a decision has finally been made.

1331
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:09,005
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1332
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,765
(announcer) All drivers
to your cars, please.

1333
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,001
(exhales)

1334
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,811
Five minutes to go.

1335
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,362
(announcer speaking Japanese)

1336
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,009
(mechanic speaks Italian)

1337
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,445
- All right?
- All right.

1338
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,841
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1339
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,649
To let the condensation out.

1340
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,451
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1341
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,887
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1342
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,371
(Mayer) Need a hand here?
(Caldwell) Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1343
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,490
Okay, start the bastard.

1344
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,843
(starts engine)

1345
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,130
Good luck, kid.

1346
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,931
(Mayer) Good luck, James.

1347
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,244
(engine revving)

1348
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,482
(announcer) Thirty seconds to go.

1349
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,085
(engines revving)

1350
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,082
(commentator)
Electric tension here at Fuji.

1351
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,200
80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.

1352
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,408
And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,

1353
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,482
James Hunt alongside him.

1354
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,563
On Row 2 of the grid,

1355
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,529
there is Niki Lauda,

1356
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,046
and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa

1357
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,565
in the six-wheel Tyrrell.

1358
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,722
Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.

1359
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,410
(engines continue revving)

1360
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,565
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1361
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,244
(spectators cheering)

1362
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,963
In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive

1363
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,042
a 450-horsepower car.

1364
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,202
(engines roaring)

1365
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,204
And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.

1366
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,250
Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.

1367
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,890
Niki Lauda following him through.

1368
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,725
Hunt leads into the first right-hander.

1369
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,724
(Speaking Japanese)

1370
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,482
(commentator speaking Japanese)

1371
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,001
(speaking French)

1372
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,529
(commentator) Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,

1373
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,011
leading the field.

1374
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,208
At least he has clear vision
in front of him.

1375
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,482
Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.

1376
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,371
Lauda is slowing.

1377
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,330
Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.

1378
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,890
(Speaking Japanese)

1379
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,289
Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.

1380
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,047
(mechanic) What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1381
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,929
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1382
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,362
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1383
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,204
(mechanic speaking Italian)

1384
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,127
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1385
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,362
(commentator) His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.

1386
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,761
But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!

1387
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,484
This is sensational!

1388
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,484
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1389
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,084
- It's too dangerous.
-(speaks Italian)

1390
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,369
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1391
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,170
No.

1392
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,971
Tell them the truth.

1393
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,410
(commentator) Now, what is happening?

1394
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,445
They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.

1395
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,288
With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race

1396
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,126
in third place or higher
to be World Champion.

1397
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,885
But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.

1398
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,568
In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.

1399
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,523
Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.

1400
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,722
James Hunt or Niki Lauda ?

1401
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,883
This extraordinary season
is not over yet.

1402
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,407
In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?

1403
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,763
And the scoreboard tells a story.

1404
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,650
Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.

1405
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,483
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1406
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,884
(commentator on TV)
Brambilla very close behind now,

1407
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,928
closing on him all the time now.

1408
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,203
And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.

1409
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,806
Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.

1410
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,207
Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.

1411
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,443
He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race

1412
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,887
and out of the world championship.

1413
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,691
Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.

1414
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,208
Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!

1415
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,684
Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.

1416
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,284
Despite these wet conditions,

1417
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,089
these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.

1418
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,328
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1419
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,246
(commentator) Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.

1420
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,288
That back marker's going past Hunt.

1421
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,405
Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.

1422
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,643
No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.

1423
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,928
Let's go! Let's go!

1424
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,401
(James grunts angrily)

1425
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,881
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1426
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,564
Nine or ten laps ago.

1427
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,086
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1428
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,884
(mechanic) At the front.
(James) Let's go.

1429
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,169
(commentator) Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier

1430
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,890
have gone ahead.

1431
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,604
Come on, hurry!

1432
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,729
(mechanic) You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1433
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,245
Not yet.

1434
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,086
(commentator) A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.

1435
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,527
Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.

1436
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,371
- James.
- Come on!

1437
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,885
- Listen.
- What?

1438
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,201
Just go easy out there.

1439
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,251
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1440
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,209
We want you back in one piece.

1441
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,648
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1442
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,725
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1443
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,610
(mechanic) Clear!

1444
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,205
(Caldwell) James.

1445
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,803
-(mechanic) Clear!
- Fuck it!

1446
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,963
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1447
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,931
There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.

1448
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,040
Concentrate, Superstar.

1449
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,924
(commentator)
Just brings it back under control.

1450
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,246
Sliding the McLaren

1451
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,560
on the very edge there.

1452
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,766
(American commentator)
Hunt's M23

1453
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,450
twitching this way and that
under braking.

1454
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,925
And he almost loses it right there.

1455
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,287
(commentator) Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.

1456
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,171
Oh, don't do it, James.

1457
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,170
(commentator) He's inches away
from the pit wall.

1458
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,049
He's inches away from the Ligier.

1459
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,085
(mechanic speaks Italian)

1460
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,481
James Hunt has made up another place,

1461
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,561
but it's not enough,

1462
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,880
and this race is running out.

1463
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,922
And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.

1464
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,325
Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker

1465
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,402
and the stationary Penske.

1466
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,482
He's catching Regazzoni

1467
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,210
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1468
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,487
it's quite another to overtake.

1469
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,010
He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.

1470
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,965
He's got him!

1471
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,282
(Speaking Japanese)

1472
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,322
Hunt crosses the line.

1473
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,007
Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,

1474
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,608
and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.

1475
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,808
- He finished fifth?
-(speaks Italian)

1476
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,690
(commentator) Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.

1477
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,683
Well, if the scoreboard's right,

1478
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,286
it means he's just missed out
on the championship.

1479
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,001
Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.

1480
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,486
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1481
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,210
examining the official lap charts.

1482
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,681
We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.

1483
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,043
(men speaking Italian)

1484
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,890
(Mayer)
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1485
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,042
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1486
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,202
Sorry? What are you talking about?
(laughs) You did it.

1487
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,045
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1488
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:10,329
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1489
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,083
(commentator) James Hunt
is now officially confirmed

1490
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,248
as finishing third here in Japan,

1491
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,521
and that means
he is champion of the world.

1492
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,886
(all cheering)

1493
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,291
Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.

1494
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,442
(spectators cheering)

1495
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,970
(James on TV) Did we really win?

1496
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,966
(cheering)

1497
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,281
World bloody Champion!

1498
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,969
(Moss) Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1499
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,202
- I shall be getting drunk.
-(all laughing)

1500
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,451
(James) It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

1501
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,761
(reporters clamouring)

1502
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,284
(both speaking German)

1503
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,363
(spectators cheering)

1504
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,442
(TV show host) And our special guest,

1505
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,363
Formula 1 champion James Hunt.

1506
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,842
Wait. Come on.

1507
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,490
There's no better motor oil

1508
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,164
than Havoline.

1509
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,605
(all laughing)

1510
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,603
(woman) Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1511
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,170
Anywhere I want to go.

1512
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,481
- And I don't have to hijack it, either.
-(women laughing)

1513
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,210
As long as I pay for it.

1514
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,601
(woman) I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1515
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,449
(woman) Where are we going?
(James) You lot go ahead.

1516
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,488
- I won't be a minute.
-(woman laughs)

1517
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,004
Good to see you.

1518
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,481
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1519
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,848
- Do you fly?
-(chuckles) No.

1520
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,730
I don't think they'd insure me.

1521
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,723
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1522
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:17,400
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1523
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,091
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1524
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,170
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1525
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,844
about the romance of flight.

1526
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,770
No, that's all bullshit.

1527
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,365
So, what brings you here?

1528
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,000
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1529
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,924
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur. (chuckles)

1530
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,286
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1531
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,481
Pre-season testing.

1532
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,523
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1533
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,762
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1534
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,127
When do you start testing? Next week?

1535
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,128
No. What, are you nuts?

1536
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,929
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1537
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,445
so I could get right back to work.

1538
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,445
Why? You have to.

1539
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,128
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1540
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,602
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1541
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,168
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1542
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,883
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1543
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,804
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1544
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,042
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1545
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,168
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1546
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,362
- The risks were totally unacceptable.
-(sighs)

1547
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,360
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1548
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,050
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1549
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,964
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1550
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,970
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1551
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,491
And it felt great.

1552
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,721
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1553
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,168
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1554
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,320
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1555
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,084
(laughs)
You English, you're such assholes.

1556
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,485
You know my position.

1557
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,171
Twenty per cent risk.

1558
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,006
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1559
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,691
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1560
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,764
You kill the sport.

1561
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,530
(man) James!

1562
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,683
- James!
- Come on!

1563
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,045
I've got to go.

1564
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,528
Careful in this thing.

1565
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,050
James.

1566
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,046
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1567
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,284
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1568
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,283
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1569
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:32,645
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1570
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,927
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1571
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,562
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1572
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,927
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?

1573
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,726
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life.

1574
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,962
"It can be a blessing, too.

1575
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,805
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1576
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,727
And you know what? He was right.

1577
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,086
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1578
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,929
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1579
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,803
-(laughs)
- Disowned by our families.

1580
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,285
Headed nowhere.

1581
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,687
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1582
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,171
It was not bad, huh?

1583
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,163
No, it's not bad.

1584
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:14,801
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1585
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,005
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1586
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,808
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1587
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,481
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1588
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,922
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1589
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,162
if you don't have any fun?

1590
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,689
How is that winning?

1591
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,491
(man) James!
(woman) We're gonna leave without you!

1592
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,445
James!

1593
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,691
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1594
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,602
You will...champ.

1595
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,884
You look good, Niki.

1596
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,330
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1597
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,208
(Niki) Of course,
he didn't listen to me.

1598
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,725
For James,

1599
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,962
one world title was enough.

1600
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,490
He had proved

1601
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,808
what he needed to prove, to himself

1602
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,167
and anyone who doubted him.

1603
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,889
And two years later he retired.

1604
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,801
When I saw him next in London
seven years later,

1605
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,048
me as champion again,

1606
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,049
him as broadcaster,

1607
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,523
he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.

1608
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,484
Still living each day like his last.

1609
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,730
When I heard he'd died,

1610
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,207
aged 45, of a heart attack,

1611
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,845
I wasn't surprised.

1612
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,729
I was just sad.

1613
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,923
People always think of us as rivals,

1614
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,607
but he was among the very few I liked,

1615
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,890
and even fewer that I respected.

1616
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,771
He remains the only person I envied.

1617
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,802
