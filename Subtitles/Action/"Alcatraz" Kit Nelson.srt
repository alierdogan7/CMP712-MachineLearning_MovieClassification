00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,624
Previously on <i>Alcatraz...</i>

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:03,459
Meet the 63s...

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:05,261
The worst criminals
this country has ever known

4
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:06,595
are coming back.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,215
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.

6
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,466
Aah!

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,085
That's him.
He killed my partner.

8
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,059
Police!

9
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,228
So we have to find
these 63s.

10
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:17,729
We need to find
who took them.

11
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,382
I need you to watch them.

12
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,834
They're not so bad.

13
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,769
This is the place.

14
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:26,021
Manager I.D.'d Cobb,
room 123.

15
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:27,806
Lucy, get down!

16
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,433
Scream...

17
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,831
And I'll kill your brother.

18
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,012
<i>Hey, child killer.</i>

19
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,367
<i>Teach him a lesson.</i>

20
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,119
<i>That's right,</i>
<i>I'm talking to you!</i>

21
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:11,906
<i>Nowhere to run now, son.</i>

22
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:19,880
<i>Hey, child killer.</i>

23
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,183
How long's it been?

24
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,217
Not long.

25
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:42,719
Third dance they took him on
since the weather turned?

26
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,021
Could be the fourth.
Could be his last.

27
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:45,022
We'd all be better off.

28
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:50,070
Just get him inside
before they kill him.

29
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,903
You have
the best life ever.

30
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,237
Smoking hot partner,

31
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,572
secret task force,

32
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,257
<i>comic book guru.</i>

33
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,926
And you don't have
to go to school ever again.

34
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,712
So what you're saying is
I'm a 16-year-old's wet dream?

35
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,580
<i>- Hey, here's one for you.
- </i> <i>Chrysanthemum.</i>

36
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,933
<i>I'm not even sure</i>
<i>if I'm saying it right.</i>

37
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,585
<i>- Chrysanthemum?
- </i> <i>You planting a garden, Vic?</i>

38
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>I'm filling out a report.</i>

39
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,855
<i>11-year-old boy</i>
<i>went missing last night.</i>

40
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,925
<i>His mom says all she found</i>
<i>in his bed this morning</i>

41
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,110
<i>was a flower.</i>

42
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,708
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

43
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:49,946
Whoa.
You okay, Doc?

44
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,062
Any change?

45
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,966
Sinoatrial node.
You ever heard of it?

46
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,402
It's a group of cells
in the wall

47
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,020
of the right atrium.

48
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:17,358
It's supposed to generate
electrical impulses.

49
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,443
Well, there's...

50
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,231
Still every chance that she
could come out of it, right?

51
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>Hey, um...</i>

52
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,506
Guys.

53
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:35,925
I know it's Saturday
and all,

54
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,927
but there's a boy missing
in Walnut Creek,

55
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,512
and they found a flower
on his bed.

56
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,930
A chrysanthemum.

57
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,432
Which might just sound creepy
and not, like,

58
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,551
you know, a clue,
except the same thing happened

59
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,519
in 1958 three different times

60
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,138
with an Alcatraz inmate.

61
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,856
And since some of those guys

62
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,608
are, you know, back,
I think...

63
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,443
I mean, I know it's him,

64
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,811
Kit Nelson, AZ246,

65
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,529
who stole the kid
from his bed.

66
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:58,681
Where did you hear
about this?

67
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,516
I heard it
on my police scanner.

68
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,501
You have
a police scanner?

69
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,702
Not the point.

70
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:03,853
We need to go.

71
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,371
I mean, I know
what this guy does.

72
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,323
I know
what happens next.

73
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,859
What exactly is that, Soto?

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,878
He kills him.

75
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,214
<i>He steals them on a Friday,</i>

76
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:16,966
<i>brings their bodies back home</i>
<i>Sunday night.</i>

77
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:19,419
If we don't find this kid
in 48 hours,

78
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,421
he's gonna be dead.

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,676
On March 21, 1963,

80
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,813
Alcatraz officially closed.

81
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:37,237
All the prisoners
were transferred off the island.

82
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,940
Only that's not what happened.

83
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,942
Not at all.

84
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,108
ALCATRAZ
Ep. 3 - Kit Nelson

85
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:52,076
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

86
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:54,057
<i>So tell me about Kit Nelson.</i>

87
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,026
Does he have any family
that might still be alive?

88
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:58,105
No.

89
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,390
His mother died
while he was in Alcatraz,

90
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,693
his dad in the early '80s.

91
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:05,112
He had a kid brother who died
of Scarlet fever

92
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:07,915
when he was 11.

93
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,416
<i>11?</i>

94
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,251
<i>Same age</i>
<i>as our victim.</i>

95
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,792
This is it.

96
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,099
I found it
on Dylan's bed this morning.

97
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,416
I don't know
where it came from.

98
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,852
But Dylan wouldn't run away.

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,853
He's a good kid.

100
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,021
Did Dylan's brother
see anything?

101
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,606
<i>No.</i>

102
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,257
<i>Liam was asleep</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

103
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,560
Do you recognize
this man?

104
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,779
Yeah, that's Warren
from Keller's hardware.

105
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,264
He knocked on our door
looking for work.

106
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,367
I didn't think...

107
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,486
Wait, why do you have
his picture?

108
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,904
Does he have something
to do with Dylan?

109
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,205
Did he take my son?

110
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,623
He's a suspect
in another case.

111
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,075
A case
of kidnapping?

112
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,911
<i>What about you, Liam?</i>

113
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:56,613
Do you remember this man
working at your house?

114
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:05,472
Did you talk to him?

115
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,292
He gave me rock candy.

116
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,628
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

117
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,014
When's the last time
you saw him?

118
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,824
Was he in your bedroom
last night?

119
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:28,112
I pretended to be asleep
because I was scared.

120
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:32,699
You know what, Liam,
you helped us out a lot.

121
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,585
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

122
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:38,188
Do you have the address
for the hardware store?

123
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,682
Remember the rules.

124
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:55,105
One hour or two?

125
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,174
Ay...

126
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,110
Give me two hours

127
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:01,695
and a pail of worms.

128
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:18,962
<i>This ought to do you.</i>

129
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,248
I'd set your nose,
but, given your popularity

130
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,916
around here,
I don't think it'll hold.

131
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:28,205
You got anything stronger?

132
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,641
How about a cigarette?

133
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,759
No, not my brand.

134
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,845
Suit yourself.

135
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,684
You know, I got an eight
and ten-year-old.

136
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,154
So if you're looking
for something stronger,

137
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:47,658
you're crap out of luck.

138
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,237
Hey, what's so damn funny?

139
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,006
<i>You don't want to mess</i>
<i>with Dr. Beauregard</i>

140
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,508
<i>or you'll end up on this side</i>
<i>of the screen,</i>

141
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,678
<i>giving enough blood to put</i>
<i>the red cross out of business.</i>

142
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:11,965
<i>You know, your situation</i>
<i>might improve if you made pals</i>

143
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,600
<i>with some of your fellow lags.</i>

144
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:17,354
<i>But you don't like grown-ups,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

145
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,556
<i>No friends your own age,</i>
<i>as far as I can tell.</i>

146
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,476
Shut the hell up
and get off my back, would ya?

147
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,162
<i>What does make a grown man</i>
<i>pick on kids?</i>

148
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,582
<i>You really hate 'em</i>
<i>that much?</i>

149
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,600
That's it for today,
Madsen.

150
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:38,392
Wow. They really did
a number on you, didn't they?

151
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,660
Damn prison pecking order.

152
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,329
Now is it rapists,
robbers, thieves,

153
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,964
or thieves, rapists, robbers?

154
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,884
Robbers, murderers, rapists.

155
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,653
Then child killers.

156
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,841
They didn't beat you
because of what you did.

157
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,978
They beat you
because of what you are.

158
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,799
I've never seen him before
in my life.

159
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,635
Said his name was Warren
and that he worked here.

160
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,105
Hey, Warren.

161
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:11,191
That's Warren.

162
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,492
Where's his uniform?

163
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,995
We had a break-in last week.
They took it.

164
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,246
Take anything else?

165
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,497
A couple of kids'
fishing poles.

166
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,749
<i>I mean it stood to reason</i>

167
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,916
<i>that it was kids</i>
<i>did the stealing,</i>

168
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:21,001
so I didn't report it.

169
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,152
Where do people fish
around here?

170
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:25,339
Well, there's
really only one place.

171
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:26,957
Lafayette recreation area.

172
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:49,112
Okay, I need you
to get into the water now.

173
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,816
What do you mean?

174
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,685
Into the water.

175
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,237
Now.

176
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,171
Okay, now I want you
to hold me under

177
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:17,090
for as long as you can.

178
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,892
I can't.
You're bigger than me.

179
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,977
Just do it.

180
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,346
And don't let me up.

181
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:27,017
Do it.

182
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,568
Do it!

183
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,601
Your turn.

184
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,422
So, he took the kid fishing.

185
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,313
Rental guy said they
were wet when they left.

186
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:57,618
I guess they went swimming too.

187
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:59,620
So he wants
a buddy now?

188
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,854
Someone to play with?

189
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,823
You know,

190
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:05,209
a teenager in '58
said he saw Nelson

191
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:07,077
playing miniature golf
with one of his victims

192
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:08,195
the day before he killed him.

193
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,663
No one believed the kid.

194
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:11,965
They thought it was too creepy
to be true.

195
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,917
Didn't make it
in any of the crime reports.

196
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,870
I dug it up doing research
for my book.

197
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,473
But if he did take
that kid to miniature golf

198
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,143
and he took this kid fishing...

199
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,545
Maybe he lets the kids pick
things they like to do?

200
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:27,681
Like some kind
of sick last hoorah.

201
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:31,318
Lures 'em in,

202
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,571
makes 'em have fun
before he...

203
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,857
You know.

204
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:37,925
You okay?

205
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,910
What?

206
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,745
Yeah.
No, totally fine.

207
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:47,284
Okay, let's go find out
what else Dylan likes to do.

208
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:55,459
Eat your popcorn.

209
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:57,294
I don't want it.

210
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,763
Eat it,
all of it.

211
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,397
Let's you and me take a ride.

212
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:21,118
I'd rather stay in my bed
if it's the same to you, warden.

213
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:24,938
Get in the chair.

214
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:28,208
I take no offense
off your hostile tone

215
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,777
since it's me responsible
for the inmates

216
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,445
who wrought on you
this beating.

217
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,248
But know this.

218
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,000
Dusk till dawn,
I've racked my brains

219
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,785
and still can't fathom
what in heck to do

220
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:40,587
with the likes of you.

221
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:44,791
So I've decided to separate you
from the pack.

222
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,310
Meals in your cell,

223
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,313
ten minutes private time
in the yard.

224
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:52,933
Once you're back
on your feet, of course.

225
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:56,937
That's not what brings me here
to speak to you today.

226
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,859
I received a letter
from your father.

227
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:04,194
He'd like to visit.

228
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,146
Well, he's not on my list.

229
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:07,814
He's your father.

230
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:12,252
And served two tours
in the war, as did I.

231
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,556
Well, he's still not
on my list.

232
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,626
Well, that puts me
in a bona fide conundrum.

233
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:22,296
<i>Lord only knows</i>
<i>what kind of family business</i>

234
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:24,681
<i>he needs to speak to you about</i>
<i>so urgently.</i>

235
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,069
But if he's willing
to travel all this way,

236
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,688
he's earned the right
to see your ugly mug.

237
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:37,211
You leave it to me
to amend your list myself.

238
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,113
Now get up.

239
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,336
Hey.
How am I supposed to get back?

240
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,805
Walk.

241
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,977
The Amber alert
for Dylan Callahan...

242
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,179
You need
to cancel it immediately.

243
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,381
I already canceled
on a national level.

244
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,150
Walnut Creek's
all that's left.

245
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,570
No, no, you're not listening
to me.

246
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,406
I don't have time
to get down there.

247
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,493
She's still in the hospital.
That's why I'm calling.

248
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,994
We need to know
some of Dylan's hobbies.

249
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,662
<i>Are there places</i>
<i>he likes to go?</i>

250
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,080
Anything he likes to do?

251
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:24,217
Um, he goes to the comic book
store every Wednesday.

252
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:28,305
And he likes to watch cartoons,
<i>the Simpsons, South Park.</i>

253
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,057
<i>King of the Hill</i> sometimes.

254
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:33,927
Okay, does he like to do
anything outside?

255
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,462
Boating? Fishing?

256
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:36,563
- Swimming maybe?
- No.

257
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
He's not athletic.

258
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:39,683
He likes to be indoors.

259
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,737
Wait.
Wait, I got it wrong.

260
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,608
- Doc, that's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

261
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,027
- We got to figure it out.
- Doc.

262
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,144
Wait.
Wait, wait.

263
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:52,612
The other case
this man is wanted in,

264
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:53,646
<i>I want you to tell me</i>
<i>this time.</i>

265
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:54,998
Did they get their kid back?

266
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,334
- Cherry pie.
- Cherry pie?

267
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:59,953
Doc, why don't you go wait
out front for me?

268
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,506
Yeah, good idea.
I'll wait out front.

269
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,823
Thank you.

270
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,597
Uh, where are you guys
going?

271
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,215
Amber alert's
been canceled.

272
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
Wait.
What?

273
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,885
Probably has something to do
with the mom

274
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,503
divorcing the kids' dad
last year.

275
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:17,938
Dad? You think
the dad has any idea

276
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,058
what a chrysanthemum
even looks like?

277
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,559
You're not going anywhere.

278
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,010
The Amber alert,
it's uncanceled.

279
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,979
I'll take care of this.

280
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,515
You did this?
You canceled the Amber alert?

281
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:29,566
Yup, I did.

282
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,850
For the greater good.

283
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,119
The greater good?

284
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:33,186
What's more important
than finding this kid?

285
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,621
What's important
is that the house

286
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,039
doesn't look
like a crime scene.

287
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,024
Well, how else are we gonna
find out where he's going?

288
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:39,376
We know exactly
where he's going.

289
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,860
Right back here.

290
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:43,463
Oh, so that's how you're going
to catch him?

291
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,631
Great idea.

292
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,865
The only problem
with your strategy there,

293
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,501
Dr. Strangelove,
is the kid'll already be dead.

294
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,002
Lower your voice, Soto.

295
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,388
You don't get it.
We can save this kid.

296
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:53,706
<i>We need the Amber alert to get</i>
<i>Nelson's photo out there.</i>

297
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:55,392
That's exactly
what we can't do,

298
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:56,893
put out photos
of a '63.

299
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,929
Oh, 'cause God forbid
someone figures out

300
00:17:59,013 --> 00:17:59,930
- your little secret.
- Whoa, whoa.

301
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,064
Did you just cancel
the Amber alert

302
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,682
while the kid's
still missing?

303
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,518
- It's complicated.
- No.

304
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:05,736
It's not complicated.

305
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,987
It's simple.
I know this,

306
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,555
- because I'm a human being.
- Doc.

307
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:10,357
- I'm not like you.
- Doc.

308
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,691
Calm down.

309
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,410
Just let him walk it off.

310
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:16,246
The kid, Lucy,
he's emotional.

311
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,914
What if the mother had heard?

312
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,899
These situations
need to be handled...

313
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,585
Well, maybe you should have
told us about the Amber alert.

314
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,537
He's just not cut out
for this job.

315
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,055
He's a comic book writer.

316
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,174
In the past three days,
he's seen

317
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,426
about ten dead bodies,
and he watched Lucy

318
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,545
get shot 5 feet
away from him.

319
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,263
Look, we're a man down.

320
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,715
- We need him.
- You need him.

321
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:36,933
You know what,
you're right.

322
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,084
Just get rid of him.

323
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,186
While you're at it,
I'm out of here.

324
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,753
You're free to go
anytime you want.

325
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,755
But you can forget
about finding your grandfather.

326
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,442
Oh, my God, this isn't
about my grandfather.

327
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,694
There's 302 men, right?

328
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,862
And they're all coming back.

329
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,981
And they're all as evil
as that sick freak

330
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,115
that took Dylan.

331
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,450
Yes, I need Doc,
but I need you too.

332
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,819
<i>I know how upset</i>
<i>you are about Lucy,</i>

333
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:57,487
<i>but unless you have</i>
<i>a better idea,</i>

334
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,938
you're gonna have to
trust me... us.

335
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,709
If you don't, you're gonna end
up alone in this.

336
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,537
Hey, you got
any cherry pie?

337
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,289
Best in the County.

338
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,007
You think this guy's
been in to order any?

339
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:33,875
Might have been
with an 11-year-old kid.

340
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,410
No, if he had tried
my cherry pie,

341
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,348
he wouldn't look
so damn unhappy.

342
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,350
<i>You've
reached Doc,</i> <i>Dr. Soto,</i>

343
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,585
<i>Doc's comics,</i>
<i>your Doc in shining armor.</i>

344
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:44,686
<i>Take your pick.</i>

345
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:45,687
Come on, Doc.

346
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:46,722
Where are you?

347
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,724
I was thinking
about what you said.

348
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,559
The cherry pie thing.

349
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,926
Okay, I don't know.

350
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:54,563
If Nelson isn't doing
what the boys like to do,

351
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,097
is he doing
what he likes to do?

352
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,699
Is that what you meant
by cherry pie?

353
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,933
Is that something
Nelson likes?

354
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,436
Just call me.

355
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,455
Please.

356
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,773
<i>He's not picking up.</i>

357
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:07,125
You think he's out searching
for cherry pie?

358
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,544
Hey, he has a theory,
which is more than anyone

359
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,463
<i>in this room can say.</i>

360
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,336
Kit Nelson's box.

361
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,137
Nail clippers,

362
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:20,839
cigarettes, soap.

363
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,724
To you and me,
it means nothing.

364
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,509
To Doc,
it's a life story.

365
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:26,595
<i>And that's why we need him.</i>

366
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,434
Get him back.

367
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:43,328
Another round?

368
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,664
Make it a double.

369
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:55,340
<i>Hey, miss. Give us two
slices</i> <i>of cherry pie, would you?</i>

370
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,129
A couple of waters
with that.

371
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,130
Thanks.

372
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:12,474
Oh, hey...
Honey.

373
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:13,809
How are you?

374
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,976
Doc, what's going on?

375
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:15,977
Are you okay?

376
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,863
Yeah.

377
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,648
I mean, no.

378
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:23,151
I'm at the Hillcrest Diner

379
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,519
on Pacific drive,

380
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,521
<i>just, you know,</i>
<i>hanging out.</i>

381
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,156
Is Kit Nelson there
with you?

382
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:29,574
Yes.

383
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,126
Is Dylan with him?

384
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,715
<i>Yes.</i>

385
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,550
Huh?

386
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:40,168
<i>Doc, stay put.</i>

387
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:43,204
I'm on my way.

388
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:46,040
There you go.

389
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:51,379
Thank you, ma'am.

390
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:53,231
All right.

391
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:56,768
Dig in.

392
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:02,991
No, hold your fork
in your left hand.

393
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,413
Do it.

394
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:15,454
I'm glad to see
they're treating you

395
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:16,938
like you deserve.

396
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:24,396
Say what you came for...
and leave.

397
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:26,214
Your mama died.

398
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,717
She left you something.

399
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:30,952
A dried chrysanthemum.

400
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:35,590
Your mama told me
how she went

401
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,760
to her daddy's funeral
for the weekend

402
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:40,979
and left you boys alone.

403
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:45,383
How, when she came back,

404
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,736
Elliott was dead,

405
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:52,040
his body burning
from Scarlet fever.

406
00:22:56,162 --> 00:23:00,665
But that wasn't the truth,
was it?

407
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:04,302
<i>You hated your brother because</i>
<i>he was different than you.</i>

408
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:06,087
<i>He loved life...</i>

409
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:09,307
<i>Swimming in lakes,</i>
<i>miniature golf,</i>

410
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:10,959
<i>cherry pie.</i>

411
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,811
<i>But not you.</i>

412
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:15,881
Your mama knew
what you did.

413
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:22,438
But she wasn't prepared to lose
two babies in one day.

414
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,775
So she protected you.

415
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:28,326
And she told everyone a lie

416
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,579
and buried the body
before they could look.

417
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:33,748
<i>But your little plan</i>
<i>backfired.</i>

418
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:34,983
<i>You got rid of him,</i>

419
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:37,586
<i>and your mama ignored you</i>
<i>even worse.</i>

420
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,505
She was scared of you,

421
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,258
of what's inside you.

422
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,994
<i>So tell me,</i>

423
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:49,047
son...

424
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,033
Did you kill your brother?

425
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,476
It was Scarlet fever,

426
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,111
just like mama said.

427
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:07,181
Yeah.

428
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:10,702
I thank God
for Alcatraz.

429
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,904
<i>When I die,</i>

430
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:14,456
<i>it'll be in peace,</i>

431
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,958
knowing you will be
a rotting corpse

432
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,544
before they let you
out of here.

433
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:26,200
Let's go.

434
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:27,752
Come on.

435
00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:32,424
No.
This way.

436
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,261
Honey,
let me get that for you.

437
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:42,601
Excuse me!
Do you have change for a dollar?

438
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:45,654
No.

439
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,024
Hey.

440
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,726
What are you guys up to?

441
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:54,496
Beat it, fatso.

442
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:02,254
Kit Nelson.

443
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:03,588
Let him go.

444
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,258
<i>Dylan,</i>

445
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:09,077
don't give up.

446
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,352
Police.
Let the boy go.

447
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,437
- No!
- Take it easy.

448
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:21,422
Drop your gun on the ground.
Over there.

449
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:25,193
Now!

450
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,154
Now your phone and your keys.

451
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:43,828
Get over there.

452
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,582
<i>Now what you're gonna do is,</i>

453
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,583
you're gonna handcuff yourself

454
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:49,784
to that dumpster over there.

455
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:51,452
- We just want Dylan.
- Do it!

456
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:03,815
Okay.

457
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,235
Get in the car.

458
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:09,904
Now, if I see
any headlights,

459
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,690
anyone's,

460
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,825
this kid dies.

461
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:21,983
Oh!

462
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,344
I just got that kid killed,
didn't I?

463
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,247
Doc, wait up.

464
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:50,416
Doc.

465
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,500
Doc.

466
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,674
- Comb.
- Take it easy.

467
00:26:58,758 --> 00:26:59,925
Padlock.

468
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,928
Nail clippers.

469
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,664
Soap.

470
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:07,499
Guy that evil
who uses soap.

471
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:08,717
Same as us.

472
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:11,187
It's not your fault.

473
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:16,142
We're gonna catch this guy.

474
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:18,861
12 hours.

475
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:21,981
That's all we got.

476
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,205
Ottomans.

477
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,625
Look, there's got to be...

478
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,742
Eight, ten packs in here.

479
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:35,194
Okay,
didn't they all smoke?

480
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,213
Yeah, prison-issue cigarettes.
Not name brands.

481
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:40,633
These went for 5 bucks
a pack.

482
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,502
Only Al Capone or Machine Gun
Kelly could afford these.

483
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:44,637
So how did a guy like Nelson

484
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,172
get the money
to buy 'em?

485
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,560
Okay. So I went through
every check that came in

486
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:54,313
while Nelson was there,
and I found this...

487
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,884
A check from C&C cement company
for $148.28.

488
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,520
Ten days later,
a deposit

489
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:04,907
in the same amount made to Kit
Nelson's commissary account.

490
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,825
So Nelson worked
for C&C.

491
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,943
It must have been back pay.

492
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:09,328
There's only one check
made out to cash.

493
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,746
No paper trail.

494
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,232
C&C went belly up
in the early '60s,

495
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:14,399
but when they were
in business,

496
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:16,602
they built bomb shelters.

497
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:21,207
150 in the Western U.S.,

498
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,543
including the towns
where Nelson's three victims

499
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:25,544
<i>from 1958 lived.</i>

500
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:26,679
Bomb shelters, yeah.

501
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,730
That's a perfect place
to hide in.

502
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:29,632
If he worked there,

503
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:30,683
<i>he'd know</i>
<i>where they all were.</i>

504
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,134
Including one
in Walnut Creek.

505
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,890
50 years ago,
there was a house there.

506
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:40,025
<i>Now it's just woods.</i>

507
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,416
No. No.
No!

508
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:09,672
That was the wrong move.

509
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,059
I want to go home.

510
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,794
When can I go home?

511
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,153
Soon.

512
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:27,856
Where are you taking me,
huh?

513
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:28,907
I didn't do nothing.

514
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,242
Where are you taking me,
huh?

515
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,277
Where are you taking me?

516
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:33,829
The best
Alcatraz has to offer.

517
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:36,982
Two impermeable layers
of steel encasement.

518
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,984
Guaranteed not to bother you

519
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,552
is light or sound.

520
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:44,590
- Get him inside.
- No, no!

521
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,824
<i>It's thinner rations.</i>

522
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,426
You'd be wise
to conserve your strength.

523
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,178
No! No!

524
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:57,770
This conversation's
four matches long, son.

525
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,971
<i>Phillumeny.</i>

526
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:01,307
Word describes the collecting

527
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:03,809
of match-related items

528
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,528
such as matchbox labels

529
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:09,281
and matchboxes.

530
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:14,519
This matchbox
is a Swedish safety match

531
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,372
from the Jonkoping
match factory.

532
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:19,208
It was manufactured
in 1858.

533
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:23,695
Just in time
for the American Civil War.

534
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:25,664
I like it very much.

535
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:30,803
I guess that makes me
something of a...

536
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,639
Phillumenist.

537
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,215
That's number two.

538
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:48,437
Now tell me what you did
to your brother.

539
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:51,824
My brother died
of Scarlet fever.

540
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,159
That's a lie, son.

541
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,832
Your father would like
to know the truth.

542
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,166
It'll give me great pleasure

543
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,786
to be able
to tell it to him.

544
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,206
I think
you killed your brother.

545
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:09,458
I think your daddy
was off to war

546
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:10,793
and your mama left you alone,

547
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:12,928
and you killed him.

548
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:14,630
<i>Maybe you didn't mean to</i>
<i>at first,</i>

549
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:17,249
<i>but once you got a taste,</i>

550
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,101
indulged your dirty appetite

551
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:21,520
three times further
before they finally caught you.

552
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:30,262
How's your math skills?

553
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:33,216
I believe
that's number three.

554
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:37,771
You're doing this
out of loyalty

555
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,124
- for another vet?
- No, son.

556
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:46,245
I'm doing this...

557
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:48,213
Because I'm a father too.

558
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,602
Is it your intention

559
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,004
to remain in this dark casket

560
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,423
for the remainder
of your time,

561
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,641
or are you gonna say
what you did?

562
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:12,354
Last match, son.

563
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,411
Okay.

564
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,281
Yeah, it's like you said.

565
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:23,916
Yes?

566
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,369
I liked it.

567
00:32:27,454 --> 00:32:30,372
I liked it.

568
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:32,925
We were in a bomb shelter
out back,

569
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,377
and I squeezed his neck
as hard as I could,

570
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:38,797
and I got to tell you,
it was not...

571
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:44,686
Difficult.

572
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,021
<i>He was kicking and screaming.</i>

573
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:48,807
<i>He was trying to get</i>
<i>my hands off him, but...</i>

574
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:52,478
And then he just
looked up at me.

575
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,030
His eyes were red
with little specks

576
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:59,902
of blood in them
where the blood vessels broke,

577
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:02,871
the pressure from all
that screaming

578
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,957
and nothing coming out.

579
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,828
Not even air.

580
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:12,548
And then his body
just went soft.

581
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:16,585
And heavy.

582
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,171
And that's when I knew.

583
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:21,673
That he was dead?

584
00:33:21,724 --> 00:33:24,676
That I had to do it again.

585
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,602
Bonus match.

586
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,220
And the flower?

587
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,888
Oh, I put that
on my mama's bed.

588
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,607
A consolation prize?

589
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:40,526
Yeah.

590
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,027
It was her favorite.

591
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:47,082
Him too.

592
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,368
Good boy.

593
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,587
<i>I'm gonna do something</i>
<i>for you now.</i>

594
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:52,737
Mm-hmm.

595
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,740
I'm gonna let you keep
your clothes.

596
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:56,925
What?

597
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,210
No.

598
00:33:58,261 --> 00:33:59,628
No, I told you
the truth,

599
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:00,629
just like you said.

600
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:02,097
You're gonna leave me here now?

601
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,265
- That's not fair.
- Fair?

602
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:09,771
Interesting choice of words
for someone

603
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:12,975
who outweighs his victims
by 100 pounds.

604
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,260
Make 'em last.

605
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:36,915
I'm hungry.

606
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:39,451
Is there any food?

607
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,503
You'll get food.

608
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,558
It's cold down here.

609
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,678
Could I at least get
a blanket?

610
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:12,117
Hey!

611
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:46,724
Doc, there it is.

612
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,983
- Stop!
- Help!

613
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,735
<i>Please, help me!</i>

614
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,371
<i>Please!</i>

615
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:03,991
<i>Help!</i>

616
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,209
<i>Help!</i>

617
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,361
Please!

618
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:08,712
Please!

619
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:12,532
Don't move!

620
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,304
You know,
you didn't shoot before.

621
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:20,307
You're not gonna shoot now.

622
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,342
You don't have a weapon.

623
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:22,676
Let the kid go.

624
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:26,380
I think I'm gonna take
my chances.

625
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,654
Dylan.

626
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,714
You know,
even if we were allowed

627
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,550
to tell people what we did,
I doubt they'd believe us.

628
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,769
You're probably right.

629
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:09,890
I need a word.

630
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:11,525
With me?

631
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,027
Yeah.

632
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:15,429
I'd like to stay.

633
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,831
That's up to Soto.

634
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:23,871
Arrested development

635
00:37:23,938 --> 00:37:26,073
is what happens
when we're traumatized

636
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,107
as children.

637
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:30,044
We get stuck
at the age we were

638
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:32,446
when the trauma occurred

639
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:35,666
for our entire lives.

640
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,336
And you were what, 11?

641
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,595
Do you know why I allow you
to be here, Soto?

642
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:51,598
<i>10,000 hours.</i>

643
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,100
That's the time it takes

644
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,770
for a person to become
an expert at something.

645
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:00,074
<i>And I'm guessing you've spent</i>

646
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:04,361
twice that
studying Alcatraz.

647
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,366
But I need
the adult Soto,

648
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:12,753
not the 11-year-old.

649
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,623
Yes, Mr. Hauser.

650
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,258
Sir.

651
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,009
Uh...

652
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,196
The thing
he was talking about...

653
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,617
When I was 11, uh...

654
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,875
It's okay, Doc.

655
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,044
Whatever it is,

656
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,964
I bet you've got a pretty good
origin story yourself.

657
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,367
Oh.

658
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,136
The cherry pie thing...

659
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:03,370
I read that
in your book.

660
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,973
Nice call.

661
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:15,849
Wait for me.
It'll only be a minute.

662
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:23,690
Saw you were missing
12, 27, and 35.

663
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:28,545
No way.
This is awesome.

664
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,031
So...

665
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:32,566
You okay?

666
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:33,834
I'm fine.

667
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:39,756
Well, let me know
if you need any others.

668
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:43,910
I'm still scared.

669
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:55,539
When I was a kid,

670
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:59,193
about your age,

671
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,445
something happened...

672
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:06,266
Where someone took me.

673
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,603
<i>Just like that guy</i>
<i>who took you, right?</i>

674
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:12,372
And it wasn't easy,

675
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,661
but...

676
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:20,130
I got away too.

677
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:24,101
And once that happens,

678
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:28,505
once you know
that you can do that...

679
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:36,780
It sort of gives you
a superpower.

680
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:40,684
Like theirs,
but real.

681
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:47,574
I didn't give up,

682
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:51,811
like you said.

683
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,864
I know you didn't.

684
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:20,307
Dr. Beauregard,

685
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:22,842
I got one for you.

686
00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:29,566
Roger that.

687
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:34,237
I may need your help
with something...

688
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:37,857
Depending on how things turn.

689
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,743
It's for a friend
of mine.

690
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:43,463
Armed and ready, sir.
