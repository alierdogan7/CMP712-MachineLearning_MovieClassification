00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,290
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.

181
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,840
She's been... cold.

182
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,561
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

183
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,904
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

184
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,162
You're not worried about that?

185
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,463
I'm not worried about that.

186
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,732
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

187
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,968
Hm. You haven't mentioned anything

188
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,403
about about Earth-2, have you?

189
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,605
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

190
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,007
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

191
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,175
for her to heal.

192
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,944
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

193
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,313
That shouldn't be a problem.

194
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,814
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.

195
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,082
What are you guys doing here?

196
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,252
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

197
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,353
About what?

198
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,788
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

199
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,423
goes by the name King Shark.

200
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,525
King Shark?

201
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,394
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

202
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,195
months ago. I thought he was dead.

203
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,664
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

204
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,499
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

205
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,334
this half-shark is very much alive,

206
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,404
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

207
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,838
That's kill you, Barry.

208
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,940
[scoffs]

209
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,243
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

210
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,446
[sighs]

211
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,843
So how do you know about King Shark?

212
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,803
Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,

213
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,539
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

214
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,608
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

215
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,210
And it appears under her directives,

216
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,212
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

217
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,446
for the past two years.

218
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:34,873
Why?

219
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,956
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

220
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,156
Weaponized.

221
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,160
How do you know that he's coming after me?

222
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,863
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

223
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:47,897
"Zoom wants The Flash dead"

224
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,801
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

225
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,436
the readings we did
receive show he that was

226
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:53,537
headed towards Central City.

227
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:54,638
Let him come.

228
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,174
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

229
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,442
We just came here to warn you, man.

230
00:10:58,443 --> 00:10:59,543
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

231
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,245
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

232
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,581
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

233
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,749
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

234
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,250
This is the last one.

235
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,386
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

236
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,554
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

237
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,559
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

238
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,394
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

239
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,698
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

240
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,868
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

241
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,237
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

242
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,672
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

243
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:29,840
I just followed.

244
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,276
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

245
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,777
Can you find King Shark too?

246
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:34,878
I can try.

247
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,280
All right.

248
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:41,949
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

249
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,721
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

250
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,123
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

251
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,158
[beeps]

252
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,559
I can take the waterfront.

253
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,860
Can you have your team handle the rest?

254
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,361
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

255
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,732
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

256
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,433
Maybe he could help us somehow.

257
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,401
Or not. Looks like he died

258
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,938
when the particle accelerator exploded.

259
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,706
What about next of kin?

260
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,775
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

261
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,011
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

262
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,912
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

263
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:12,917
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

264
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,718
anything in her research
that could help us.

265
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,819
Sure.

266
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,154
Great.

267
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,991
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

268
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,124
How's that helmet treating you?

269
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,794
Could use some improvements.

270
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,495
I'll get to work on it.

271
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,630
Hey, Joe, what's up?

272
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,130
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

273
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,365
he wants to meet up with you.

274
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,467
All right.

275
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,200
He's working on his engineering project

276
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,974
at our place tonight.

277
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,438
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

278
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,696
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

279
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,130
right now is kind of a crazy time.

280
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,666
What? What's going on?

281
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,400
Remember that meta-human shark

282
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,569
that Patty was after and attacked me?

283
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,839
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

284
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,074
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

285
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,244
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

286
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,346
I get it.

287
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,712
I'll tell Wally some other time.

288
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,582
Hey, you know what?

289
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,484
It's all good, I'll make it work.

290
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,718
Tell him tonight should be fine.

291
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,055
Are you sure?

292
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,823
- Yeah. <i>
- Thanks, Bar.</i>

293
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,025
Yeah, bye.

294
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,762
[sighs] Why?

295
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,502
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

296
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,571
Seems a little late to be asking questions

297
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,406
about my husband, doesn't it?

298
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,644
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

299
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,745
I suppose you could say that.

300
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,880
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

301
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,514
to grow uncontrollably.

302
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:33,276
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

303
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,954
not human.

304
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

305
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,557
There's a meta-human in Central City

306
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,059
whose body seems to be mutating

307
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,561
in the same way as your late husband,

308
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,765
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

309
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,634
My husband was no monster.

310
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:50,037
That's not what she was implying.

311
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,938
What does this have to do with me?

312
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,074
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

313
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,242
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

314
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,143
although still preliminary.

315
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,746
We need to see it.

316
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,180
I beg your pardon?

317
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,050
Your research, all of it.

318
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,884
What my colleague means to say is that

319
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,587
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

320
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,622
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

321
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:17,094
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

322
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,266
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

323
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,700
This could help save lives.

324
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,437
I'll email you what I have.

325
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,441
Thank you.

326
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,546
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

327
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,250
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

328
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,652
You've been acting differently toward me

329
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:41,220
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

330
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,154
What's your problem, Cisco?

331
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,258
Nothing.

332
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,259
Let's just go.

Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.

Hey, how's Felicity doing?

345
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,362
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

346
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,930
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

347
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,504
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

348

She has a lot going on right now.

349
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,874
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

350
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,442
when this is all over.

351
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,079
Just want to catch this thing, man,

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,414
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

353
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,048
so we can just move on with our lives.

world on your shoulders.

Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.

357
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,128
Still nothing.

358
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,329

362
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:15,890
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

363
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,589
We don't find King Shark soon,

364
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,958

365
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,592
We'll find him, Lyla.

366
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,897
All right, I searched the whole area.

367
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:25,998
He's gone.

368
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,299
Couldn't have gotten far.

369
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,001
Still, he knows we're here now.

370
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,235
We lost the element of surprise.

371
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,295
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

372
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,789
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

373
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:37,300
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.

374

375
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:43,864
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

376
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:44,965

Never.

379
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,180
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

380
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:07,020
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

381
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,654
to get into CCU's engineering program.

382
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,560
Turbine supercars?

383
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,164
Turbines? Like jet engines?

384
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,399
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

385
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,767
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

386
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,051
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

387
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,673
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

388
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,308
the fuel economy issue here.

389
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,611
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

390
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,547
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

391
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,815
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

392
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,551
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

393
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:38,852
Gonna wake the neighbors...

394
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,153
[laughs] For sure.

00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,462
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

sure they don't have

399
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:51,998
any reason to say no.

400
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,367
Okay. [Laughs]

401
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,536
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...

All right, let's start over, okay?

404
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,178

405
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:09,213
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?

This is a complete waste of time.

410
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,740
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research

411
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:36,108
to tell us how to find King Shark.

412
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,944
Maybe I should take a look.

413
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,212
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor

another set of eyes, considering.

417
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,320

418
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,756

you've been acting lately.

You are not yourself, Caitlin,

421
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,762

422
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:59,596
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.

424
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,702

No. Uh, no.

Why not?

432
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,632

Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...

434
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,519
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

435
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,261
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,

436
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,962
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

437
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,896
There, great.

438
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:39,570
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

439
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,016
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

440
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,309
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

441
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,977
just like she did over there.

442
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,145

You're being detached.

Because I have to be right now.

445
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,385
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

446
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,025
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

447
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,393
just when I was beginning to love.

448
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,798
So if I let myself feel,

449
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:13,006
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

450
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,671
it's never gonna stop,

451
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,407
and that's not gonna help me either,

452
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,509
so let's just get back to this research

453
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,143
and figure out how to find King Shark.

454
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,647
Okay.

455
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:36,827
Here you are.

456
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,197
Yup, just like back home, always working.

457
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

458
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,267
He's here? On this Earth?

459
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,436
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

460
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,870
brought him here to kill The Flash.

461
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,109
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

462
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,911
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

463
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,486
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

464
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,317
Probability distribution algorithm?

465
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,952
Partial matching strategies, yes.

466
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:02,799
Based on what?

467
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,151
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

468
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,769
What about mobility behaviors?

469
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,539
Jessie.

470
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,508
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

471
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,378
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

472
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,348
Just let me help, please.

473
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,917

00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,924
Yeah.

476
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,747
Hardest part was amping the torque

477
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,081
without increasing drag.

478
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,616
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

479
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,418
but this streamlined
version should optimize

480
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,852
both the torque and the horsepower.

481
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:43,424
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

482
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,725
Here, let's do this...

483
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,060
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

484
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,362
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

485
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,465
reverse rotation and send more power

486
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,166
to the torque converter.

487
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:57,405
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.

626
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:01,413
Sharks are predators.

627
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:02,972
In order to track their prey, they use

628
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,007
what's known as passive electrolocation.

629
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:06,709
Passive electrolocation?

630
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,711
Yes, it's how they sense
the bioelectric potential

632

King Shark senses
electricity in Barry's system.

King Shark can track Barry,

We flip it. Instead of King Shark

636
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,423

active electrolocation.
