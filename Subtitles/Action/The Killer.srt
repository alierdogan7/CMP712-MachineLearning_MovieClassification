1
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,811
Do you believe in God?

2
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,343
No, but I enjoy
the tranquility here.

3
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,176
Want to check the gun?

4
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,741
I trust you.

5
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:05,728
Another quiet tear

6
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:10,397
Streaks down my face

7
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:19,006
Another night ofdesolation

8
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:27,181
And solitude

9
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,588
Just accept me

10
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:35,120
For what I am

11
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:38,689
Don't make promises

12
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:44,400
That you won't keep

13
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:53,415
Who needs dreams

14
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:58,283
When we have each other

15
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:05,117
Who needs tomorrow

16
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:13,260
When we have today

17
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:21,354
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.

18
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,517
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.

19
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:28,256
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.

20
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,820
Will I be blind?

21
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,663
Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang.

22
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,670
Do you remember
the murderer's face?

23
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,010
Please, leave me alone.
I'm frightened.

24
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,046
Calm down.

25
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:57,023
SIX MONTHS LATE R

26
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:43,862
Help! Help!

27
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,065
Please help!

28
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,604
Just go away.

29
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,942
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.

30
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,879
I'll take you home.

31
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,454
Jenny!

32
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:36,184
How do you know my name?

33
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,886
I've listened to you sing so often...

34
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,361
Who are you?

35
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,764
I feel as if I know you.

36
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,527
I know you can't see too well.

37
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,301
I've wanted to help,
but I never had the chance.

38
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:59,010
In this world,
not everybody is untrustworthy.

39
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,547
Will you let me help you
this time?

40
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,333
Is it all right for me to leave?

41
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:39,087
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.

42
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,117
It's only a cat.

43
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:48,459
It often sneaks in
and scratches my furniture.

44
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,259
What a pain!

45
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,692
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?

46
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,230
I only see shadows.

47
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,755
It was better last month.
I could see images.

48
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,769
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.

49
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,417
What are you doing now?

50
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,883
Looking at this scarf.

51
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:56,025
It's got my blood stains on it.

52
00:11:56,098 --> 00:12:00,501
The man who shot me
wrapped it over my eyes.

53
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,730
I'll never forget that.

54
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:07,299
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

55
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,742
It won't take a minute.
Please, sit.

56
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,643
I'll put some music on.

57
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:19,618
Another quiet tear

58
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:24,489
Streaks down my face

59
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,122
Another night of desolation

60
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,430
And solitude

61
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:43,744
Just accept me

62
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,545
For what I am

63
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:52,951
Don't make promises

64
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:58,254
That you won't keep

65
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,463
Who needs dreams...

66
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,801
Relax! You look exactly like
what you are, an undercover agent.

67
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,706
Lighten up,
or it'll be an open secret.

68
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,444
Come on.

69
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:19,003
Smile!

70
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:26,421
Now you look like something
out of a nuthouse.

71
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,857
Chang, this guy Eddie's
a lunatic. Be careful.

72
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,899
Same to you, pal.

73
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,593
Watch your ass!

74
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,476
Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting.

75
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,780
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.

76
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,911
- Say hello to Eddie.
- Eddie.

77
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,750
Search him!

78
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,193
Eddie, what's with the security?

79
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,286
It's not our filrst deal.

80
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,062
Maybe he looks familiar.

81
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:19,597
Here's $200,000.
We'll check the guns filrst.

82
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,646
What are you guys doing?

83
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,811
Nothing special, offilcer.
A reunion.

84
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,786
Open the trunk.

85
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,254
Open it!

86
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,291
Now!

87
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:17,231
Damn you!
You set me up, didn't you?

88
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,563
Are you a cop?

89
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,227
Talk!

90
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:28,775
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.

91
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,142
Then how come he's here?

92
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:34,080
He's no cop!
I stake my life on it, Eddie!

93
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,344
Lying bastard,
I shouldn't have trusted you!

94
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,942
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!

95
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,920
You've got it wrong.

96
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,094
Chang, I'll get him!

97
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,479
That shithead!

98
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,460
Don't move!

99
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,799
Goddamn mess, assho--

100
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,534
Finish your sentence.

101
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,076
Ass... assho--

102
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:51,277
Inspector Li, the suspect
Eddie Hung held a hostage...

103
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,344
in a crowded trolley car...

104
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,355
Could you see him clearly?

105
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,617
- Could you?
- Yes.

106
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,921
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.

107
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,690
Did you consider the safety
of the passengers?

108
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,253
Did you sound any warning
before you shot?

109
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,423
Insuffilcient time.

110
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,831
The hostage had
a coronary thrombosis.

111
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,427
She died of a heart attack.

112
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,597
Her family has registered
an offilcial complaint.

113
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,506
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy

114
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,874
How could I know she had
a heart condition?

115
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,311
I've been on Eddie Hung's case
for seven months.

116
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,147
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.

117
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,482
Should I have waited
until he killed her?

118
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:29,986
You forget
I'd just seen him kill a cop.

119
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:32,583
Who's responsible
for that cop's death?

120
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,934
Fine! Do whatever you want.

121
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:45,302
I'm used to all sorts
of complaints.

122
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,671
One more makes no difference.

123
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,052
Catch!

124
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:19,640
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.

125
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,211
Better use it more.

126
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,214
It won't help.

127
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,517
A one-handed killer's
out of the action.

128
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,588
I've had my day.

129
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,661
His name is Tony Weng.

130
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:49,170
He works with a drug ring
in Central America.

131
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:52,502
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions. Take it or leave it.

132
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:59,547
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.

133
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,377
This is my last hatchet job.

134
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,653
All right, it's a deal.
Money's no object.

135
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:18,096
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.

136
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,031
Untraceable.

137
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,365
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.

138
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:47,160
Easy to pick up, hard to put down.

139
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,988
Want to change your mind?

140
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:12,443
Why take this job?

141
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:22,162
If she doesn't have
a cornea transplant soon...

142
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,596
she might lose her sight forever.

143
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,930
There's a cornea bank
in Hong Kong...

144
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,266
but it's always empty.

145
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:34,138
When a donation does come in,
someone else gets it filrst.

146
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,336
So we're going to try abroad.

147
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,068
I have to leave you
for a few days.

148
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,098
When I return, I'll take you
overseas for surgery.

149
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,312
You will come back, right?

150
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,174
I promise.

151
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,359
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

152
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,929
Many VI Ps and government offilcials
will attend the opening ceremony.

153
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,872
You are assigned to protect them.

154
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,274
Their information is in your filles.

155
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:45,175
Make sure you're extra alert!

156
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,543
Yes, sir!

157
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:50,550
Tony Weng,
we're protecting that scum.

158
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,373
Attention please!

159
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:27,319
Will all the competitors please
assemble before the floating platform...

160
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,379
for the dotting
of the dragon's eye.

161
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,084
It's our pleasure to welcome...

162
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,458
the president ofTung Yuan
Financial Corp., Mr. Tony Weng...

163
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,590
the chairman of Rotary Club,
Mr. Peter Chu...

164
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,667
Cover him up.
Keep everything under control.

165
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,398
Red alert! red alert! Tony Weng's
been shot on the floating platform.

166
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,743
The shot came from
around the filshing junks.

167
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,179
The killer is probably nearby.

168
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:44,218
All units!
Prepare to seal off the area.

169
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,156
Mr. Weng fainted.
Everything's filne.

170
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:51,691
Please enjoy your day.

171
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,461
Chang!

172
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,733
Chang, look over there!
An explosion!

173
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,000
Let's check it out

174
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,083
Chang, we can't lose him now!

175
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,164
Freeze!

176
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,473
You'll be all right.

177
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,349
Don't be afraid.

178
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,981
Don't cry.

179
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,658
- He's down there! Step on it!
- Okay.

180
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,539
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?

181
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,873
He won't let the little girl die.

182
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,421
Nurse, where's casualty?

183
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,329
Go down the hall.

184
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,800
What happened?

185
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:49,001
- A gunshot.
- Quickly, put her down.

186
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:52,534
Nurse, check her blood pressure.
Prepare her for surgery.

187
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,604
Oxygen mask.

188
00:33:54,682 --> 00:34:00,348
How is she?

189
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,822
Blood pressure unstable.
Weak pulse.

190
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,189
Blood pressure low.

191
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:12,325
- Have you seen a man carrying a child?
- He went to casualty.

192
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,889
- Detain anyone suspicious.
- Yes, sir!

193
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,096
Are you related to the patient?
How was she wounded?

194
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:19,605
Sir, you can't leave now!

195
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:22,039
I have to register your name.

196
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,044
Where is he?

197
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:40,785
I'm an inspector.
Just continue.

198
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:54,440
- Right, nurses, ignore them.
- Yes.

199
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,475
Don't disturb the doctor.
Put your guns down.

200
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,327
- What happened?
- There was a gunshot.

201
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,225
- Where?
- Over there.

202
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,555
Get everybody out.

203
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:15,818
I'll call H.Q

204
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,451
- Any progress in the Weng case?
- No, none at all.

205
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:21,994
I nearly got the suspect,
but he escaped.

206
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:26,192
Where's your razor sharp
intuition?

207
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,735
Many people want me to fail...

208
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:31,828
so this case means a lot to me.

209
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,739
I don't need you letting me down.

210
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:37,971
You always were a pain in the ass.

211
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:41,242
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.

212
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,284
Sir, I do nothing for nobody.

213
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:47,650
I'll get the murderer.

214
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:50,554
You'll get your promotion.

215
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:53,525
I hope you don't forget
who helped you reach the top.

216
00:36:57,197 --> 00:37:00,030
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.

217
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,766
He's over 30.

218
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:05,532
He looks determined...

219
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,699
without being ruthless.

220
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:11,571
There's something heroic about him.

221
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:17,544
He doesn't look like a killer.

222
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,254
He comes across so calm...

223
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:25,157
acts like he has a dream...

224
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:27,386
eyes full of passion.

225
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,203
- Hello.
- It's me, Jeffrey.

226
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,214
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?

227
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,216
I want my money now.

228
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:30,886
I want it tonight. Tonight!

229
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,449
Sure, I'll bring it tonight.

230
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,169
Mr. Weng.

231
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,139
You should let me handleJeffrey.

232
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,141
He's my responsibility.

233
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:52,178
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.

234
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,340
I don't trust anyone,
including you!

235
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:02,679
I know the rules of the game.
I'll keep my word.

236
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,987
Forget the rules.

237
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,359
I want him dead
because he exposed his identity.

238
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,399
I'm the boss now,
and you'll do things my way.

239
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,663
Okay, you kill him for me.

240
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:21,265
Ifyou blow it,
you're dead meat.

241
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,502
I paid you well enough.

242
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,930
Eddie, this could be a lead.

243
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,699
Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu,
was cut down in Club Nine.

244
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:55,640
The killer was never caught...

245
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,177
but he accidentally blinded a singer.

246
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:00,679
What was her name?

247
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:01,771
Jenny.

248
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,351
She hasn't recovered yet.

249
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:11,884
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.

250
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,896
He's no ordinary assassin.

251
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:21,256
I hope we're just looking
for one man.

252
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,963
If I'm not mistaken...

253
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:26,870
this man is not
a cold-blooded murderer.

254
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,534
It only takes one bullet,
cold-blooded or not.

255
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,738
He risked his life
to save the little girl.

256
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,980
And if he did hurt
the singer by accident...

257
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,585
he's probably contacted her.

258
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,716
Ifwe meet again

259
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:49,421
We'll filnd out where we stand

260
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:55,162
But perhaps there will be
no tomorrow

261
00:40:56,603 --> 00:41:03,941
Only time will tell

262
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:10,208
-Jeffrey?
- I'm notJeffrey.

263
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:16,013
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.

264
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,114
I mistook you for my friend.

265
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,125
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?

266
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:25,757
I only sing for one person.

267
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,800
Jeffrey?

268
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,632
Your singing
is so fiIlled with emotion.

269
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,571
I feel I already know him.

270
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,699
I wish he was here now.

271
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,046
Wherever he may be,
you are in his thoughts.

272
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,801
Part of him will always be here.

273
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,926
You no longer trust me?

274
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:01,927
You know why.

275
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:05,263
Of course.

276
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:09,799
In our profession,
we shouldn't trust anyone.

277
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:21,642
How did they know
about that beach?

278
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:24,411
They might have followed me...

279
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:26,145
when I drove there.

280
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:28,016
That's my fault.

281
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:30,515
Who wants me dead?

282
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:33,425
Why do you ask?

283
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:37,394
You know the rules.

284
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,794
Why didn't you leave town
after the job?

285
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:44,359
I haven't got my money yet.

286
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,134
Who wants me dead?

287
00:45:55,202 --> 00:45:59,639
Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity,
he wouldn't want you dead.

288
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:04,309
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?

289
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,083
Answer me filrst:
Do you have any bullets left?

290
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:20,825
I always save the last bullet.

291
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,988
Either for myself,
or for my enemy.

292
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,502
It'sJohnny Weng,
Tony Weng's nephew.

293
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,438
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.

294
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,970
Do you really
have one last bullet?

295
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:27,193
Jeffrey, thank you for sparing me.

296
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,861
We're in the same boat now.

297
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:34,660
There's no way out for us.

298
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,596
Don't let me see you again.

299
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,744
Inspector Li!

300
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:50,782
Five dead witnesses.

301
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,810
- It was him.
- Are you sure?

302
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:27,319
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.

303
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:30,155
Okay.

304
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,822
No regrets

305
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,921
No remorse

306
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,991
Let bygones be bygones

307
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:46,930
No signs of melancholy

308
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:52,809
No tears of self-pity

309
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:56,440
I don't care about what's
right or wrong

310
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,349
I'm not sentimental about the past

311
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:03,185
Just set me free from this reverie

312
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:08,023
For the pain lingers on

313
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:12,224
It dwells deep in my heart and soul

314
00:49:12,298 --> 00:49:16,325
Only time will tell

315
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:22,399
Ifwe are meant for each other

316
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:27,171
My tears and laughter
are my own indulgence

317
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:31,809
Inspector, you hit the nail on the head.
The neighbors say he lives here.

318
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:40,390
Are you nuts?

319
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,325
Jenny!

320
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:18,023
Jeffrey, is that you?

321
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,032
Why don't you come back?

322
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,193
I'll be back this morning.

323
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:24,361
We're moving to a new home.

324
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:26,337
Why?

325
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:29,739
I thought you loved
to live by the sea.

326
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,299
I do.

327
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:34,369
Beautiful sea breezes.

328
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:36,415
I can imagine the view
of the clear blue sky...

329
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:38,974
and the deep blue sea.

330
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:41,748
Great! Pack your things
and wait for me.

331
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:44,819
I'll be here.

332
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:01,506
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong
immediately?

333
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:03,542
What stopped you?

334
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:21,186
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.

335
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:23,161
You're doing a lousy job.

336
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:25,288
This is a filre escape.

337
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:29,131
Look, there's garbage everywhere.
What if there's a filre?

338
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:31,568
I can't fly away like a phoenix.

339
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:35,005
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.

340
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:38,942
If I filnd you goofilng off again,
I'll fille a complaint.

341
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:43,142
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away. Shit!

342
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:17,282
Jeffrey, you're back.

343
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,147
Yes, Jenny.

344
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:24,050
Are you with a friend?

345
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,759
Yes, he's my old football buddy.

346
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:33,396
We grew up
in the same squatter area.

347
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:37,061
Yes. He's...

348
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:38,728
I'm Dumbo,
he's Mickey Mouse.

349
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:42,804
That's what you called
each other?

350
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:47,208
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.

351
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,307
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.

352
00:52:51,384 --> 00:52:55,150
- He's been causing me a lot of trouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.

353
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:57,314
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.

354
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,687
- Don't bother.
- No need.

355
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:01,618
- Please be careful.
- Take care, Jenny.

356
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:03,389
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.

357
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:06,091
Jeffrey, take care
ofyour friend, meanwhile.

358
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:11,099
Make yourself at home, Dumbo.

359
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,230
I am, Mickey Mouse.

360
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:17,572
Ma'am, why are you so concerned
about the garbage?

361
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:21,011
He paid me a thousand bucks
to keep you talking.

362
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,710
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!

363
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:29,585
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am l? Lets wait and see.

364
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:32,181
You're always the loser.

365
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:36,521
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.

366
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,764
Let's put your preparations
to the test.

367
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:46,904
- Are you always so determined?
- Yes, that's my style.

368
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,235
Mine too.

369
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,675
So we have something in common.

370
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:54,406
Is that what you think?

371
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:58,480
Defilnitely.

372
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:02,649
Have some tea while you catch up
on old times.

373
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,551
Thanks, Jenny. Be careful.

374
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:14,831
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.

375
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:18,802
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

376
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,339
Is he another friend ofyours?

377
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:25,309
No, he's the janitor. We don't have
a janitor in this building.

378
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:27,107
Oh, he's the plumber.

379
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,777
There's a burst water pipe outside.

380
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,082
Your voice sounds familiar.

381
00:54:35,154 --> 00:54:36,587
Have we met before?

382
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:39,523
I met you in the night club.

383
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,924
I loved your singing, but you wouldn't
sing withoutJeffrey there.

384
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:43,690
Oh, I remember.

385
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:45,697
What a coincidence.

386
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:48,859
Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while.
I'm going to the bathroom.

387
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:50,630
So am l.

388
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:54,662
There's a second bathroom
in the bedroom.

389
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:58,177
Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!
I'll catch it.

390
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:36,170
Hey! Don't shoot! It's me!

391
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,685
Somebody's aiming at my ass
from below!

392
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:09,338
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?

393
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:16,217
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!

394
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,885
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.

395
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:26,430
Jeffrey's a professional killer.
He murdered somebody.

396
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:29,764
I've been after him for months.

397
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:32,805
- I don't believe you!
-Jenny!

398
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,568
- Listen to me, Jenny!
- No!

399
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:38,872
-Jenny, it's true.
- Chang!

400
00:56:38,945 --> 00:56:41,971
Jenny, calm down.
Listen, please!

401
00:56:43,382 --> 00:56:44,974
Sit down.

402
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,419
Six months ago...

403
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,459
Jeffrey shot your face up by accident.

404
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,662
Now his employer wants him dead.

405
00:56:58,698 --> 00:57:00,598
I don't believe it!

406
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:09,432
I'd like to help,
but I can't, in my position.

407
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:15,040
I hope you'll cooperate with us.

408
00:57:15,114 --> 00:57:19,983
Jenny, we're using you as bait.

409
00:57:20,052 --> 00:57:22,680
It can bringJeffrey in this time.

410
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:24,689
I'll save his life for you.

411
00:57:26,492 --> 00:57:28,426
Otherwise, the guy who hired him
will kill him.

412
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:37,710
Name your price.
I want him dead.

413
00:57:37,782 --> 00:57:40,478
He was recognized doing the job.

414
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:42,815
I want him wasted,
the sooner the better.

415
00:57:42,887 --> 00:57:44,752
Deposit $ 1 00,000
into my account now...

416
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:47,222
and $200,000 more upon completion.

417
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,121
No money, no action, Mr. Weng.

418
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:54,130
Not even if I see his filnger on
the trigger ready to blow your head off.

419
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:57,961
- Put the hundred grand in his account.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:57:58,036 --> 00:57:59,970
Mr. Weng!
What do you want?

421
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,679
You should payJeffrey,
or he might come after you.

422
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:13,117
That's bullshit! I'm safe.

423
00:58:13,184 --> 00:58:15,482
Look at these guys.
They're killers.

424
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:22,125
You're the boss.
You should keep your word.

425
00:58:22,193 --> 00:58:23,854
Don't talk crap.

426
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:26,260
I won't pay him,
even ifyou beg.

427
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,197
Mr. Weng, let me keep my word
and pay him what I promised.

428
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:32,598
Then I'll bring him to you.

429
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:39,875
Mr. Weng, if it pleases you...

430
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:42,609
I will beg.

431
00:58:44,048 --> 00:58:45,242
Go to hell!

432
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:47,079
Ifyou hadn't worked for my father
for so long...

433
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:48,209
I'd have kicked the shit out ofyou!

434
00:58:48,286 --> 00:58:49,776
Who is he?

435
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:51,219
He doesn't deserve your sympathy!

436
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,725
Why are you doing all this forJeffrey?

437
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:57,260
He's my best friend.

438
00:58:57,328 --> 00:58:59,319
Cut the crap!

439
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:46,133
Come here now!
Mr. Weng's been shot.

440
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:08,724
Kill him!

441
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:13,297
Kill him!

442
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,271
Don't let him go!

443
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,466
- Mr. Weng, you've been hurt!
-Just kill him!

444
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:20,705
- Let's go! You're in danger!
- Go after him!

445
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:57,842
Ifyou consider me your friend,
kill me now.

446
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,942
I loathe seeing you demean
yourself by begging.

447
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:11,394
Though I didn't succeed...

448
01:01:11,462 --> 01:01:13,453
I risked my life trying
to get you your money!

449
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,191
I could have just killed you.

450
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:20,066
I didn't have to beg Weng
for your money.

451
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:22,765
I'm not completely
without honor, am l?

452
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:49,061
Our world is changing so fast.

453
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:55,629
It never used to be like this.
Perhaps we're too nostalgic.

454
01:02:05,316 --> 01:02:07,546
Nostalgia is one of our saving graces.

455
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:12,012
At least when I die, I'll know
I was remembered by a friend.

456
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:16,693
Let's settle our differences
in the next life.

457
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:30,937
Let's cancel them right now.

458
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:33,238
That's what friends are for.

459
01:02:34,612 --> 01:02:35,544
Right?

460
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,058
- A drink?
- Thank you.

461
01:03:22,326 --> 01:03:25,523
Jenny always wanted
to live by the sea.

462
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:30,390
You've done so much for her.

463
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:33,198
I wonder how she feels about you.

464
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:41,501
- Hello?
-Jenny!

465
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:45,015
Jeffrey, why did you leave
without saying good-bye?

466
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:48,210
I'm sorry.
I had something to do.

467
01:03:48,285 --> 01:03:51,448
We have to leave tonight.

468
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:53,956
- Tonight?
- Dr. Ho called this afternoon.

469
01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:57,654
He's reserved a pair of corneas,
but they're in Singapore.

470
01:03:57,728 --> 01:04:01,289
Ifwe're not there by midnight,
someone else gets them.

471
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,558
All right, I'll take you.

472
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,365
Meet me at the airport
at 7.30 tonight.

473
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:09,372
I'll wait at the information
desk, okay?

474
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,032
Of course.

475
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:16,546
Will he come?

476
01:04:25,856 --> 01:04:27,483
Will you go?

477
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,823
I trust her.

478
01:04:46,243 --> 01:04:48,074
Everybody's here. Let's go.

479
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:52,674
How's it going?

480
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,184
Right. Full alert now.

481
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:58,745
I want you to check
every inch of this place.

482
01:04:58,823 --> 01:05:00,654
Everything's ready.
He'll never get away.

483
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:30,944
Don't worry.

484
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:35,754
We'll take care of everything
while you're away.

485
01:05:35,826 --> 01:05:37,054
Thank you.

486
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,391
Have a nice trip.

487
01:05:42,867 --> 01:05:47,201
While I am gone, take good care
of the company business.

488
01:05:47,271 --> 01:05:51,537
Please take care.

489
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:55,976
Jeffrey!

490
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,606
Get away from here! Run!

491
01:05:58,682 --> 01:05:59,671
She's crazy!

492
01:06:01,552 --> 01:06:03,281
Jeffrey!

493
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:07,381
Jeffrey, the cops are everywhere!
Run away!

494
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:11,724
Jeffrey, the cops want you!

495
01:06:11,795 --> 01:06:15,162
Don't come near me!

496
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:19,362
Jeffrey, are you there? Run!
Don't let them catch you!

497
01:06:33,684 --> 01:06:35,379
Jeffrey, run!

498
01:06:40,257 --> 01:06:42,225
The cops are after you!

499
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:45,788
Freeze!

500
01:06:47,364 --> 01:06:49,195
Jeffrey, the cops are all around!

501
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:54,597
The cops are everywhere!

502
01:06:54,672 --> 01:06:55,366
Run!

503
01:06:58,509 --> 01:07:00,636
Jeffrey, run away!

504
01:07:02,813 --> 01:07:04,303
It's me, Jenny.

505
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:10,583
Don't move!

506
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:11,746
Let's go.

507
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:14,518
What's wrong, offilcer?
Flirting isn't a crime.

508
01:07:21,465 --> 01:07:22,932
Arrest him!

509
01:07:33,811 --> 01:07:35,403
Keep clear, everyone.
Let me through.

510
01:07:51,262 --> 01:07:53,389
Open those suitcases.

511
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:57,634
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Chasing a piece of ass.

512
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,191
What's yourjob?

513
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:04,207
I'm a casting agent
for movie companies.

514
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,839
- But you resisted arrest!
- I was drunk.

515
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:10,778
Stand up and walk a straight line!

516
01:08:26,397 --> 01:08:29,230
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?

517
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:34,296
You know who.

518
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,805
He's in grave danger.

519
01:08:40,244 --> 01:08:43,873
Help him.
Tell me where he is.

520
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:47,644
I want to help him solve his problem.

521
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:49,652
I have some questions to ask him.

522
01:08:51,655 --> 01:08:53,350
That's none of my business.

523
01:08:54,525 --> 01:08:58,325
If the guy you're talking about
is my friend...

524
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:02,163
he sure doesn't need your help.

525
01:09:07,571 --> 01:09:09,664
Starting now,
you're off the Weng case.

526
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,072
Inspector Chan will take over.

527
01:09:12,142 --> 01:09:13,905
You're getting another case.

528
01:09:15,379 --> 01:09:17,347
- What's the reason?
- I don't trust you.

529
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:22,678
Siding with the suspect
is not the way to catch him.

530
01:09:24,822 --> 01:09:27,552
Sir, you don't understand how I work.

531
01:09:27,624 --> 01:09:32,084
You said it!
That's why you're off the case.

532
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:37,364
I won't give up the investigation.

533
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:38,401
Bullshit!

534
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:41,370
Chang, you'll be Chan's assistant.

535
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:44,706
Yes, sir.

536
01:09:44,775 --> 01:09:46,766
Release the man you just arrested.

537
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:48,778
Give him 24-hour surveillance.

538
01:09:48,846 --> 01:09:51,508
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin.

539
01:09:51,582 --> 01:09:55,609
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir.

540
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:20,601
Will you kill again?

541
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:30,050
I thought the people I killed
deserved to die.

542
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:37,483
Now I believe everybody has
the right to live.

543
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:40,724
No, I won't kill again.
I hope I can keep my promise.

544
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,492
I've been followed.

545
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:07,833
Weng's men, and the cops too.

546
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,134
Don't worry, I lost them.

547
01:14:13,677 --> 01:14:16,145
Weng hired Paul Yau to waste you.

548
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:20,343
Don't worry,
you can use my guns and ammo.

549
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:28,213
- Where are you going?
- To get your money off Weng.

550
01:14:30,227 --> 01:14:31,353
I'll meet you in the church.

551
01:14:33,964 --> 01:14:37,331
- Are you going alone?
- Yes, of course.

552
01:14:37,401 --> 01:14:39,460
I must keep my promise.

553
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:43,467
Weng won't hurt me.
I still deserve some respect.

554
01:14:45,809 --> 01:14:50,109
Sidney, I don't need the money.

555
01:14:51,348 --> 01:14:52,610
I do need your friendship.

556
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:13,794
Chang! Chang!

557
01:15:19,276 --> 01:15:23,736
I followed him to 6 Horizon Drive.

558
01:15:23,814 --> 01:15:27,341
I almost got him.

559
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:28,714
I know.

560
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:30,116
I could have... got him.

561
01:15:30,187 --> 01:15:33,213
Don't worry, I'll filnd him.
Chang, don't worry.

562
01:15:36,193 --> 01:15:37,387
Eddie.

563
01:15:38,562 --> 01:15:41,463
You can't win all the time.

564
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:46,230
But you can't lose forever, either.

565
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:56,001
Chang... Chang...

566
01:16:15,432 --> 01:16:17,593
Inspector Li,
did he give us anything?

567
01:16:19,336 --> 01:16:20,963
Go ask him yourself!

568
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:49,686
-Jeffrey!
-Jenny, what is it?

569
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:53,559
Why is it so dark this morning?

570
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,928
It's just a cloudy day.

571
01:17:59,169 --> 01:18:02,229
Relax, it'll be all right.

572
01:18:03,673 --> 01:18:05,971
- Are we leaving today?
- Yes.

573
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:10,769
Freeze!

574
01:18:10,847 --> 01:18:12,974
Who is it?

575
01:18:13,049 --> 01:18:14,983
It's Mickey Mouse.

576
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:16,313
What does he want?

577
01:18:16,386 --> 01:18:18,320
He's come to say good-bye.

578
01:18:21,825 --> 01:18:23,087
What are you waiting for?

579
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:26,094
I'm a cop.
I don't shoot people in the back.

580
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:28,130
Another way we're the same.

581
01:18:28,198 --> 01:18:30,758
No, we're not the same!

582
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:32,825
I uphold the law,
and you break it!

583
01:18:34,237 --> 01:18:38,003
Chang died because ofyou.
I swore I'd get you this time.

584
01:18:42,712 --> 01:18:46,273
I'm sorry, but I won't
let you lock me up.

585
01:18:48,151 --> 01:18:52,588
Ifyou must take revenge
for your friend, shoot me now.

586
01:18:52,656 --> 01:18:54,590
Don't force me to kill you!

587
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,379
- You'd really kill me?
- I won't let you go this time.

588
01:19:16,446 --> 01:19:18,175
Go ahead.

589
01:19:18,248 --> 01:19:20,443
You can't win all the time.

590
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:23,680
Jeffrey, where are you?

591
01:19:23,753 --> 01:19:26,586
Where is he?

592
01:19:26,656 --> 01:19:29,454
Right in front ofyou.

593
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:31,619
- Don't take him away.
-Jenny!

594
01:19:31,695 --> 01:19:34,027
Jeffrey's promised me
he'll never kill again.

595
01:19:34,097 --> 01:19:36,361
Put that gun down.
Jenny, put that gun down.

596
01:19:36,433 --> 01:19:39,800
Not unless he leaves us alone.

597
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:43,532
I beg you, please, let us go.
I'll never let you arrest him!

598
01:19:45,775 --> 01:19:48,471
Did I kill him? ls he dead?

599
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:52,345
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.

600
01:19:52,415 --> 01:19:54,542
He's all right.

601
01:19:54,617 --> 01:19:56,710
I didn't mean to...

602
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:01,348
He's filne.

603
01:21:07,357 --> 01:21:09,484
Calm down, be brave!

604
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:11,151
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!

605
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:39,419
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.

606
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:49,331
Let's getJenny out of here.

607
01:21:50,033 --> 01:21:51,967
The car's outside.

608
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:27,064
Come on!

609
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:15,979
I won't let you put me behind bars!

610
01:23:16,052 --> 01:23:18,452
Throw the gun down.

611
01:23:24,027 --> 01:23:25,551
You wouldn't kill a cop.

612
01:24:11,574 --> 01:24:13,269
Thank you.

613
01:24:15,178 --> 01:24:16,736
You could have killed me
with one shot.

614
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,145
I don't kill anybody until I know
they are the real enemy.

615
01:24:21,217 --> 01:24:25,916
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.

616
01:24:28,057 --> 01:24:33,085
The only person who really knows me
turns out to be a cop.

617
01:24:33,162 --> 01:24:34,652
You could always give yourself up.

618
01:24:37,066 --> 01:24:42,902
No. I made a promise.
I keep my word.

619
01:24:42,972 --> 01:24:47,602
Sometimes, I really envy you,
your freedom.

620
01:24:47,677 --> 01:24:50,305
It's something I don't have.

621
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,008
I believe in justice,
but nobody trusts me.

622
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,812
I have the same problem.

623
01:24:59,322 --> 01:25:00,812
You're an unusual cop.

624
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,059
And you're an unusual killer.

625
01:25:07,897 --> 01:25:10,491
I'm sorry to drag you
into this mess.

626
01:25:10,566 --> 01:25:12,193
Tell me, who's behind all this?

627
01:25:12,268 --> 01:25:15,601
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.

628
01:25:17,273 --> 01:25:20,800
I knew you would never tell me.

629
01:25:20,877 --> 01:25:23,812
Take care ofJenny.

630
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,077
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.

631
01:25:51,974 --> 01:25:53,236
We'll stay here tonight.

632
01:25:53,309 --> 01:25:57,075
Sidney will bring me my money,
and we'll leave tomorrow.

633
01:25:57,146 --> 01:25:59,239
I'm scared those gangsters
will filnd us here.

634
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:03,915
Don't worry.

635
01:26:03,986 --> 01:26:06,750
This place isn't easy to filnd.

636
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:12,291
Why is it so dark?

637
01:26:15,164 --> 01:26:17,098
I can hardly see anything.

638
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:23,738
Jeffrey, turn on the lights.
Why don't you turn on the lights?

639
01:26:28,411 --> 01:26:29,969
Jeffrey.

640
01:26:37,854 --> 01:26:39,515
Please turn them on.

641
01:26:39,589 --> 01:26:42,217
There's been a power failure.

642
01:26:48,798 --> 01:26:51,062
Will your friend come back
with the money?

643
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:55,203
I'm sure he will.

644
01:26:56,539 --> 01:26:58,473
I'm sure he will.

645
01:27:01,644 --> 01:27:03,271
Boss.

646
01:27:03,346 --> 01:27:05,576
Here's the $ 1 00,000.
Please check it.

647
01:27:05,648 --> 01:27:06,672
You think he can kill Jeffrey?

648
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:23,293
Boss, Sidney Fung is here.

649
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,530
What if he betrays you again?

650
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:36,936
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.

651
01:27:41,284 --> 01:27:45,050
- Where isJeffrey's money?
- Where the hell is he?

652
01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:46,782
I wish that I had a friend like you.

653
01:27:49,559 --> 01:27:52,119
You will, one of these days.

654
01:28:07,977 --> 01:28:09,501
Drop your guns!

655
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:15,481
Your right hand still works?

656
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:18,645
Well enough.
It's still fast and accurate.

657
01:28:18,721 --> 01:28:22,418
You've got no way out.
Why are you doing this?

658
01:28:22,492 --> 01:28:23,959
You tell me,
what's the alternative?

659
01:28:25,661 --> 01:28:28,494
- Where's the money?
- Give it to me!

660
01:28:43,346 --> 01:28:47,305
I'm one step ahead.
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

661
01:28:48,718 --> 01:28:50,948
Maybe I'm no longer a professional.

662
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:57,388
I wish I could start all over again.

663
01:28:58,995 --> 01:29:00,792
It's a pity...

664
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:08,069
- Give me the cash.
- Where isJeffrey?

665
01:29:08,137 --> 01:29:10,628
Give me the money filrst.

666
01:29:14,977 --> 01:29:16,604
We owe it to him.

667
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,112
Hypocrite!

668
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,811
Do all killers
have a sense of honor?

669
01:29:26,889 --> 01:29:30,552
The world has changed.
Honor is now a dirty word.

670
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,994
Sidney, sometimes I think
you're not human.

671
01:29:37,066 --> 01:29:39,034
You're more like a dog.

672
01:29:42,538 --> 01:29:45,632
At least we have
one thing in common:

673
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,938
We both use guns for a living.

674
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:53,243
But our motivations are different.

675
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:54,977
Right?

676
01:29:57,787 --> 01:30:00,449
In some ways
dogs are superior to men.

677
01:30:09,999 --> 01:30:13,264
Ifyou don't tell me whereJeffrey is,
this is your funeral.

678
01:30:13,336 --> 01:30:15,429
Throw this garbage away.

679
01:30:36,459 --> 01:30:39,019
- Give me the money!
- Are you sure you still got bullets?

680
01:30:40,563 --> 01:30:42,053
You wanna bet?

681
01:30:43,432 --> 01:30:47,300
Jeffrey said,
always save one last slug.

682
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:49,065
Either for yourself,
or your enemy.

683
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:05,151
Hurry!

684
01:31:07,623 --> 01:31:09,250
Turn around!

685
01:31:18,334 --> 01:31:20,234
Goddamn it!

686
01:31:26,042 --> 01:31:27,168
Get him!

687
01:31:35,284 --> 01:31:38,583
Promise me one thing:

688
01:31:38,654 --> 01:31:40,588
If I don't make it,
take me to a hospital.

689
01:31:42,425 --> 01:31:46,384
Have them save my corneas forJenny.

690
01:31:48,597 --> 01:31:50,121
If that's impossible...

691
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,560
organize my money
and send her abroad for surgery.

692
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:58,132
Don't think like that.

693
01:32:02,078 --> 01:32:06,879
It's the filrst decent thing
I've ever done.

694
01:32:06,949 --> 01:32:09,042
Will you help me?

695
01:32:43,486 --> 01:32:44,510
What's that noise?

696
01:32:46,555 --> 01:32:48,489
Who is it, Jeffrey?

697
01:32:59,502 --> 01:33:01,265
Sidney.

698
01:33:07,343 --> 01:33:12,610
Here's your money.
I fought for it like a man.

699
01:33:17,019 --> 01:33:20,955
This is my last tribute to a friend.

700
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:25,224
Sidney, you didn't have to do this.

701
01:33:42,478 --> 01:33:43,911
He said I was a dog.

702
01:33:45,781 --> 01:33:50,480
Now I'm not sure
if I'm human or a dog.

703
01:33:50,553 --> 01:33:53,078
Sidney, nobody can call you a dog.

704
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:57,081
Sidney!

705
01:34:01,263 --> 01:34:02,662
Sidney!

706
01:34:10,506 --> 01:34:12,440
Sidney!

707
01:34:15,878 --> 01:34:17,368
Am I a dog?

708
01:34:19,348 --> 01:34:25,583
No, you're not a dog.
You're a great man!

709
01:34:25,654 --> 01:34:29,613
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.

710
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:34,185
I don't want to die like a dog.

711
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:41,768
But you see,
I didn't keep one last bullet.

712
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,369
I have one.

713
01:35:31,787 --> 01:35:33,379
-Jeffrey!
-Jenny, don't move!

714
01:35:33,455 --> 01:35:35,389
Don't leave me alone!

715
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:39,416
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!

716
01:35:39,495 --> 01:35:43,591
Don't kill anymore, please!
Give up your guns and come with me.

717
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:48,262
What? You saw me kill Sidney.

718
01:35:48,337 --> 01:35:50,396
He was my best friend!

719
01:35:50,472 --> 01:35:53,066
And you dare tell me to surrender?

720
01:35:55,577 --> 01:35:58,375
When Chang died,
I swore I'd kill you.

721
01:35:59,982 --> 01:36:02,542
But now I don't want you dead.

722
01:36:02,618 --> 01:36:05,280
Get out of here with Jenny.

723
01:36:05,354 --> 01:36:06,981
How?

724
01:36:07,056 --> 01:36:09,490
They'll chase me
to the ends of the earth!

725
01:36:09,558 --> 01:36:12,288
I have nowhere to go!

726
01:36:12,361 --> 01:36:15,455
Get out there
and say you're a cop.

727
01:36:15,531 --> 01:36:18,295
See if they give up their guns!

728
01:36:36,118 --> 01:36:37,380
Jenny!

729
01:36:43,959 --> 01:36:46,450
Jeffrey!

730
01:37:02,311 --> 01:37:03,835
Dumbo!

731
01:37:03,912 --> 01:37:05,607
Thanks, Mickey Mouse!

732
01:37:23,632 --> 01:37:25,566
I owe you.

733
01:37:26,935 --> 01:37:29,870
You owe me nothing.
This is a gift of friendship.

734
01:37:29,938 --> 01:37:31,496
Good luck!

735
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,335
Jenny, take cover!

736
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:48,346
Don't move!

737
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,012
Jenny!

738
01:38:53,922 --> 01:38:55,890
Jenny!

739
01:40:24,112 --> 01:40:25,079
Dumbo!

740
01:40:25,914 --> 01:40:28,405
- Give me a gun!
- Here!

741
01:40:52,808 --> 01:40:54,469
How good a shot are you?

742
01:40:54,543 --> 01:40:56,977
I'm a cop.
I have to be good!

743
01:41:31,546 --> 01:41:35,107
We've been through so much,
and I don't even know your name.

744
01:41:36,151 --> 01:41:37,175
Is it important?

745
01:41:37,252 --> 01:41:41,348
Whether we win or lose,
you won't be around.

746
01:41:41,423 --> 01:41:45,018
I'd like to have a name
to remember you by.

747
01:41:45,093 --> 01:41:47,721
Would you rather see me dead
or set free?

748
01:41:48,997 --> 01:41:51,465
Neither, if fate spares us.

749
01:41:53,168 --> 01:41:55,102
You're a hell of a good friend.

750
01:41:56,238 --> 01:41:58,172
Just remember me as Mickey Mouse.
Why not?

751
01:42:57,366 --> 01:43:00,301
Leave her alone!
She's innocent!

752
01:43:20,489 --> 01:43:24,323
Drop your gun!
You heard me, hurry up!

753
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,486
Jeffrey!

754
01:43:28,263 --> 01:43:30,823
Where are you, Jeffrey?

755
01:43:30,899 --> 01:43:35,768
Don't be afraid, Jenny.
I'm in front ofyou.

756
01:43:35,837 --> 01:43:37,964
Drop your gun!

757
01:43:40,409 --> 01:43:41,899
Jenny, don't move an inch!

758
01:43:43,845 --> 01:43:45,142
Don't hurt her.

759
01:43:45,213 --> 01:43:49,445
I won't hurt her.
I'll just kill her!

760
01:43:49,518 --> 01:43:50,780
Release her!

761
01:43:54,823 --> 01:43:56,848
- Let her go, Johnny!
- No way!

762
01:44:03,632 --> 01:44:04,792
What if I don't?

763
01:44:12,274 --> 01:44:14,606
Like I said, drop your guns!

764
01:44:25,587 --> 01:44:29,489
Dumbo.

765
01:44:31,026 --> 01:44:33,654
Will you do what you promised?

766
01:44:35,764 --> 01:44:36,958
No problem.

767
01:44:39,134 --> 01:44:42,535
Remember, there's always a friend
to back you up.

768
01:44:52,914 --> 01:44:55,747
Drop the guns,
or I'll kill her!

769
01:45:15,337 --> 01:45:16,599
Drop your gun, idiot!

770
01:46:01,816 --> 01:46:02,942
Jeffrey!

771
01:46:15,964 --> 01:46:17,761
Jeffrey!

772
01:46:41,256 --> 01:46:45,249
-Jeffrey!
-Jenny!

773
01:46:46,261 --> 01:46:50,129
Jeffrey, where are you?

774
01:46:57,906 --> 01:46:59,601
Jeffrey!

775
01:47:39,881 --> 01:47:41,815
Jeffrey!

776
01:47:49,124 --> 01:47:51,854
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Okay, okay, I surrender.

777
01:47:51,926 --> 01:47:54,394
I'll cooperate.
Arrest me, please!

778
01:47:58,299 --> 01:48:00,164
You're an unusual cop.

779
01:48:00,235 --> 01:48:01,896
And you're an unusual killer.

780
01:48:04,606 --> 01:48:07,632
I believe in justice,
but nobody trusts me.

781
01:48:09,411 --> 01:48:10,571
I have the same problem.

782
01:48:13,214 --> 01:48:15,739
- Arrest him!
- Yes, sir. I'll do it.

783
01:48:15,817 --> 01:48:19,116
Arrest me!
I'm asking for police custody!

784
01:48:19,187 --> 01:48:21,621
I'm a criminal!
Arrest me!

785
01:48:48,016 --> 01:48:49,950
Jeffrey...

786
01:48:56,257 --> 01:48:58,020
my friend.
