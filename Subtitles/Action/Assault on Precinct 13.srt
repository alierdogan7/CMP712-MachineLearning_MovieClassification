the painkillers?

Come on, Doc.

195
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,550
I mean, even you have got to be getting
a little bored of these conversations.

196
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,958
Why don't we talk
about the real reason...

197
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,294
that you would come down here
on New Year's Eve...

Okay. Uh, let's see.
We had an appointment.

200
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,538
I think the real reason...
is you're in love with me.

201
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,340
Huh. Interesting.
I can see it in your eyes.

202
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,813
That's why you come
wearing these fancy clothes.

203
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,146
It's very flattering,

204
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,152
but I think you should stop
denying it, you know?

205
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,279
I hear... No, I hear you.
You're right. You're right.

206

You're right.
My face obviously betrays me.

207
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,093
I didn't get dressed up like this
because I'm going to a New Year's Eve
party later tonight.

208
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,998
Oh, no. No, Sergeant.
This was all for you.

I don't care about the file.

at Precinct 21, I see.

You don't quit, do you?
How do you feel about it?

217
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,192
How do I feel about it?
It's no big change.

218
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,132
So I guess the new year's
not bringing anything different for you.

219
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,501
How's your leg, by the way?
I noticed you weren't limping anymore.

220
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,803
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's just an observation.

I'll see you at the new precinct.

337

Oh, yeah, yeah. You dropped this.

338
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,187
Oh, really? I dropped it? That's strange,
because I was sure that you took it.

That's what it is, right?

353
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,096
If you'd read further on,
you would see that's not what I think.

354

All right, well, then tell me what it is
that you think, Dr. Mrs. Mind-Fuck.

you think I'm hiding from?

if you're gonna act like a child.
Excuse me.

you can't handle this shit,
'cause you want to fuck me.

it would've happened already.

Gotta learn to control yourself,
Doc. It's affecting your work.
It's very unprofessional.

360

Don't try to discredit me
because you're afraid I may be right.

361

Right?
Yes.

362
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,526
About what? Come on. Tell me
what it is you think I'm hiding from,

363
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,089
and then I'll tell you
whether I think you're right.

364
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:15,003
Okay! I believe that the prospect
of responsibility has rendered you impotent!

365

Impotent?
Yes!

366
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,100
And that's why you're working
at this old precinct behind a desk.

367
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,112
I'm injured, all right?
That's why I'm here.
Bullshit!

368
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,674
You feel responsible for the death
of your team eight months ago,
and that's why you're here.

369
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,777
I didn't do anything wrong.
A board of inquiry cleared me.

370
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,788
That's right.
You didn't do anything wrong.

371
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:35,121
But it was your decision that sent them
down the left hallway...

372
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,924
and not the right,
out the front door and not the back.

373
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,463
And you don't want to make
decisions like that again.

374
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,972
Yeah. So? Maybe you're right.
What? You want a medal?

375
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,641
So now you're hiding
behind that desk.

in your drawer...

377

in that stupid little matchbox.

responsible for, no matter where you go.

- Yeah, your own.

00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,561
Some kind of a truck out there
in the forest. It's not moving.

487
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:32,501
Are you kidding me?
They must have assumed
we'd call for backup.

488
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,028
I'm having a little problem here.
The phones aren't working.

489
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,167
Sure, they cut the wires.
The storm could've
taken the phones out.

490
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,576
Bullshit! Those are Bishop's guys
out there. They cut the wires.

491
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,481
Just try the radios!
Forget it.
Frequencies are blocked.

492
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,213
The frequencies are blocked?
That's not easy to do.

493
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,654
Well, they must've got professional help,
because all the frequencies are blocked.

494
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,191
They probably screwed up
your cell phones too.

495
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,227
[Phone Beeping]
I'm not getting a signal.

496
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,355
Neither am I.
What the hell is this!

497
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,797
I told you!
They're Bishop's guys out there!

498
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,392
They're gonna break him outta here
one way or another.

499
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,462
Maybe somebody heard the gunshots
and will come check it out.

500
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,440
There's nothing out there
but factories.
No, no. I don't buy any of that.

501
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,909
They, whoever they are, are gone.
They're gonna think they're fireworks.

502
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,641
- They don't give a shit about me,
and I'm going! Thank you.
- [Gunshot]

503
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,845
[Whimpering]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

504
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,356
What the hell is happening here?
This is a fucking police precinct,
for God's sake! Jesus Christ!

505
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,451
Sarge, if you're all right,
you better take a look at this.

506
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,265
[Jasper]
They're surrounding the place.

507
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,238
- It's a goddamn siege.
- [Exhales]

508
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,036
I am not supposed to be here.
I am not supposed to be here.

509
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,704
I am not supposed to be here.
[Screams]

510
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,943
- Shit!
- Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire!

511
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,044
- It wasn't gunshots.
- Bishop.!

512
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,090
I told you. Those are
Bishop's troops out there.

513
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,456
They're taking him outta here
tonight, no matter what.!

514
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,018
This doesn't make any sense.
This is a police precinct!

515
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,690
Shut the fuck up, Doc.
You said that already.

516
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,495
All right, look.
Everybody just listen up.

517
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:14,197
Maybe they're trying
to give us a way out of this.

518
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,366
Let's just give them what they want.
Let 'em have Bishop, and it's all over.

519
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,638
- Nobody else gets hurt.!
- Not a bad fuckin' idea.

520
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,780
No, we can't let that scumbag gangster,
a cop killer, walk out of our precinct!

521
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,718
It's not an option!
[Jasper]
I'm trying to defuse this situation.

522
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,052
- You got a wounded cop over there!
- I already said no!

523
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,786
What in God's name
are we supposed to do then, Sergeant?

524
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,352
- They're gettin' ready to storm the fort.
- I don't think so, all right?

525
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,161
I think they're just tryin'
to scare us into giving up Bishop.

526
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,130
They're doin' a damn good job.

527
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,503
[Nervous Breathing]

528
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,214
See, this blackout, this is the kind of shit
that deflates human smugness...

529
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,278
about government's
so-called miraculous technologies.

530
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,689
Doesn't it? Shove it up their
lyin' corporate fuckin' asses.

531
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,559
This ain't no blackout, junkie.
Something suspect is goin' on.

532
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,258
I wanna know what the funk it is.

533
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,735
[Groaning]
I know it hurts, but we gotta
get you away from these windows.

534
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,901
[Indistinct Chattering]

535
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,536
Jasper, you got those flashlights?

536
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,639
I don't know where the fuck the are.!
Everything's been packed.!
Roenick!

537
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,207
Get down! Get down!
[Groaning]

538
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,219
Jasper, get the blinds!

539
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,051
All right. All right.

540
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,120
Yeah, we're perfectly safe now.

541
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,100
These are just scare tactics, all right?

542
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,402
They don't know how much firepower
we have or don't have.

543
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,206
They're not gonna come in here again.
It's too risky.

544
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,306
[Gasping] What about us
gettin' out there, Sergeant?

545
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,511
l-I need help real bad.

546
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,654
I need it.

547
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,070
Let's barricade up
these doors and windows,

548
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,335
and I'll figure out
how to get some help in here.

549
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,589
What are you doing this for, Jake?
Nobody gives a shit anymore
about anything.

550
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,255
We can end this right now.
I can't let a murderer
walk out of here.

551
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,697
I can't do that.

552
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,428
I'll get us out of this, Jasper.
I will. I promise.

553
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,199
You got almost no chance
out there, buddy.

554
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,798
That cop in there dies if I don't try.

555
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,975
You keep the place locked down
until I get some help.

556
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,718
All right.

557
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:20,814
I'd better cover from the front windows.
I can see the truck better from there.

558
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,828
Keep your head down.
[Chuckles]

559
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,161
Schmuck.

560
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,832
Oh, shit!

561
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,802
[Grunting]

562
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,555
[Yelling]

563
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,031
[Screams]

564
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,514
[Screams, Groans]

565
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,021
Oh, shit.!

566
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,243
[Grunts]

567
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:28,616
[Gunshots]

568
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,125
[Gunshots]

569
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,036
I found this on our friend out there.

570
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,309
Fuck it. Fact or fiction?
You pulled a guy's spine out
once, didn't you?

571
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,249
Are you a surgeon?

572
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,756
I heard that bullet
you took in your belly is still
lodged in there, rattling around.

573
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,124
I bet you it's causing you
a lot of intestinal issues.
Right? Right, man?

574
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,762
Bishop, I need to talk to you.

575
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,139
So I just killed a man.

576
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,567
His name was Danny Barbero.
A cop.

577
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,742
A cop who works for Ray Portnow.

578
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,750
The man you killed.

579
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:39,517
So tell me why cops are risking
their lives to get to you, Bishop.

580
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,287
Why should I answer that question?

581
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,660
Because I'm thinking
about sending you out to the wolves
and saving my own ass if you don't.

582
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,141
I assume you know
who I am, Sergeant.

583
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,972
You're a scumbag gangster.

584
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,880
And one of my scumbag partners in crime
is your fellow officer, Marcus Duvall.

585
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,714
Marcus Duvall and his entire team.

586
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:12,882
We used to split things 50-50.
Marcus got greedy. He wanted more.

587
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,222
- So you killed Ray Portnow.
- After he tried to kill me.

588
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,523
Mm. Right.

589
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,588
They're here to execute me,
because if I make it to court,

590
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,863
every single one of them goes to jail
for the rest of their days.

591
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,370
How many cops
are involved in this?

592
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,239
I can't say exactly, but the blood money
runs through your entire department.

593
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,803
I bet they're all here now,
and they can't allow me
to leave this precinct alive.

594
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,077
They can't allow any of us
to leave here alive.

595
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,018
Now that we all know
it's them out there.

596
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,022
Sarge.

597
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,921
Poor guy, he never had a chance.
Anyone know ifhe had any family?

598
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,988
Someone's coming.!
Shit, someone's coming.!

599
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,863
- Someone's coming.
- Hit squad, Sergeant.

600
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,935
They're here for all of us.

601
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:11,846
Me?
All of us. You especially.

602
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,748
Fuck you, dealer.
This is all your fault.

603
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,548
Those are your brethren
out there, old man, not mine.

604
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:22,422
Don't compare me with your scumbag
friends out there. If it was up to me,
I'd kick your ass out the door.

605
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,793
- I'd like to see you come try.
- Yeah, sure. You'd love to kill
another cop today, wouldn't you?

606
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,957
Only you.

607
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,127
They'll be coming on strong now.

608
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,035
Why? Why are cops
coming to kill us?

609
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,132
They need to kill him
before he fingers them in court.

610
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,236
They need to kill us too,
now that we know it's them.

611
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,545
So... here's what we're gonna do.

612
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,314
We're gonna take positions
all around the precinct,

613
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,947
and we're gonna hold 'em off
until dawn.

614
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,958
Iris, Alex, you know
how to use a firearm?

615
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,960
No. No.

616
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,222
Why don't you give me
one of them guns, Sergeant.

617
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,563
I'll help you fend off the black hats.

618
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,484
Oh. Oh, shit. Men are here.
Good.

619
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,082
What a fuckin' mess this is.

620
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,753
I know.

621
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:36,266
I'm lookin' at this as a matter
of simple mathematics.

622
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,427
If we walk
and those eight people survive,

623
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,666
then 33 lives are destroyed.

624
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,942
The lives of my men
and their families.

625
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,775
People I'm responsible for.

626
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,711
People l...

627
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,687
People I love.

628
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
I don't see any other way, Marcus.

629
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,989
The blood trail leads right back to us.
We have no choice.

630
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,455
If we go through this,

631
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,992
we are gonna have to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

632
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,164
But you know something, Mike?

633
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,574
I could live with that
more than I could live with a cell mate.

634
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,240
Once we step outside,

635
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,046
those people are no longer
civilians or cops.

636
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,352
We gotta put 'em all down.

637
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:39,828
Without pause, without regard.

638
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:45,563
1,024. 2,048.

639
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,901
Um, 4,096.

640
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,004
[Gasps, Sighs]

641
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,842
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

642
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,874
The complex problems
force me to concentrate,

643
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,547
neutralizing any feelings of fear
I have at a given moment.

644
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,119
I hide behind its structure.
[Sighs]

645
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,959
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

646
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,901
[Laughs]
We don't know that.
Don't know that. You're so calm.

647
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,474
Thank you so much. Thanks.

648
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,409
You don't have to do this.

649
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,351
Yes, I do. I do.

650
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,323
If I'm gonna die,
at least I should die gracefully.

651
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,154
How are you keeping it together?

652
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,827
I just think about living.
I want to live,

653
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,432
as opposed to
I don't want to die.

654
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:05,706
That, and I keep telling myself
everybody's gonna make it this time.

655
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,352
We both know what
could happen here, Sergeant.

656
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,863
[Clicks]

657
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:28,462
Safety off.
Yeah. Right.

658
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:06,369
All right! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

659
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,673
- [Beck] All right, already.
- Come on. Get up.

660
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,839
[Groans]
Oh, come on.

661
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,544
Look, uh, here's the deal.

662
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,851
Those men that came in here...
they're still outside.

663
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:24,860
And... I have no idea
how many there are...

664
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,556
or what they're prepared to do.

665
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,192
Don't sweat it.
There's nothin' you can do.
You can't stop Bishop's people.

666
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,068
Go ahead, Sergeant. Tell them.

667
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,672
They're not Bishop's people.
They are police officers.

668
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:47,081
What! "Po-po" popping each other?
This is the fuckingest shit I ever seen.

669
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,019
This ain't Smiley's fight, man.
Let Smiley go. Let me go.

670
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,252
I totally figured it out.

671
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,317
Assassination politics, right?

672
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,694
By the government-sanctioned thugs
abusing their authority again, man.

673
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:05,394
Who's gonna save us from your
corrupt brethren, Sarge? You?

674
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,460
You?

675
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,769
I'm gonna do my best to protect you.
All right? All of you.

676
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,245
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel real safe, man.

677
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,190

[Gunfire Continues]

680
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,338
Fuck!

681
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,946
Fuck!

682
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,679
[Groans]

683
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,997
What the fuck is goin' on now?

684
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,368
[Gasps]

685
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,537
[Gun Clicking]

686
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,258
Get down!

687
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,597
- [Groans]
- Fuck!

688
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,398
- [Grunts]
- [Whimpers]

689
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,566
- Fuck!
- They blew out the fuckin' window!

690
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,538
- Cover the front.
- [Groans]

691
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,275
I'll be right back.

692
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,561
- The window, Sergeant! The window!
- Look out.! Look out.!

693
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,536
- Shoot him again.! Shoot him again.!
- Shoot him.! He's not dead.!

694
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,543
Man down. Denied entry.

695
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,314
[Whimpering]

696
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,266
You gotta get us outta here, man.
Smiley feels very fuckin' unsafe.
It's scary. I'm scared to death.

697
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,929
You can't use us as fuckin' live bait.
Come on. Think about it. We're hostages.

698
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,564
I know.
They're gonna come for us.
Come on, man. Come on.

699
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,473
- You can't do that. Think about it.
- Please. Come on, man.

700
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,104
- You can't leave us here
as fuckin'animals to fuckin'die.!
- Smiley's scared shitless, man.

701
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,241
Please. We're sittin'ducks here.
Come on. Don't leave us like this, man.

702
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,252
[Sighs]

703
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,374
All right, choose a weapon.
Anything you see.

704
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,611
Tell me again why we should help
your little skinny white ass?

705
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,985
'Cause if you don't, you'll die.

706
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:31,031
No resistance. Advancing
to the front door. We're going in.

707
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:35,060
[Roenick]
Spread out across the precinct.
Stop anything that approaches.

708
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,868
- We might make it through this night.
- Christ Almighty. What are you doin'?

709
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,708
- You can't trust these people.
- What the hell are you doin'? You're
supposed to be coverin' the front. Goddamn it!

710
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:57,320
- Come on.
- [Karate Yell]

711

[Continues Counting, Indistinct]

715
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:02,788
All right. Just hold the front.
And don't move this time!

716
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,829
[Alex Continues Counting]

717
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,509

[Continues Screeching]

720
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,098
- You fucker!
- [Alex Screams]

721
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:51,638
You make me your defendant,
you son of a bitch!
Make me set bail!

722
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,768
[Alex Screams Hysterically]

723
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:02,010
- You all right?
- I feel better. I'm better.

724
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,898
I got mine, baby.
Oh, yeah.

725
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,596
[Panting]

726
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,476
Oh, yeah.

727
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,245
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come on! Run!

728
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,017
[Gunfire Continues, Distant]

729
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:20,187
[Gasping]
Come on.

730
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,791
Come on. Yeah.
There you go, secretary.

731
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,513
Jesus Christ.

732
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,757
All right!
They're pullin' back!

733
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,158
You all right?
He saved me.

734
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,994
There's nobody out there
in the front. Them motherfuckers
runnin' scared.

735
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,626
All right. All right.
I drove 'em back, baby.
I drove 'em back.

736
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,136
We're gonna have
a red-raw revolution on our hands, man.
All right. Good job.

737
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,400
Good job. Good job.
[Chattering]

738
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,966
Maybe they'll leave
for fucking good now.
[Bishop] They're not going anywhere.

739
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,535
- Put that goddamn weapon down.
- J...

740
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:14,014
Old man, you do not
wanna point that weapon at me.

741
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,177
- [Gun Cocks]
- [Bishop]
That is not a bright thing to do.

742
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:21,314
- [Gasps]
- Put that goddamn weapon down slowly,
then back away from it, all of ya.!

743
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,554
Jake, get their weapons.
Take their weapons.

744
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,721
Ain't this a bitch.
We saved your asses.
Now you wanna turn on us?

745
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,528
Yeah, well, thank you
for that, sweet cheeks.
Now, put your weapon down.

746
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:35,230
The problem is outside, not inside.
Put the gun down, Jasper.

747
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,865
No, no.
You know what the problem is?
That we criminals got rights, baby.

748
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:43,277
That's right. We got rights
to be protected against assault
under any circumstances.

749
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,907
- If you can't provide that,
well, fuck you... we will.
- You're a fuckin' psycho.

750
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,578
Jesus Christ, Jake!
What? Are you gonna
trust these freaks?

751
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,350
Huh? The first chance they get
to blow our brains out, they'll try
to make a break for it.

752
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,154
They need us as much
as we need them.

753
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,754
We all gotta start trusting each other
right now if we're gonna
make it through this night.

754
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,026
Put the gun down,
Jasper.

755
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,105
Put the goddamn gun down!

756
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,120
What?

757
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,128
- Shit.
- All right. All right.

758
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:47,142
Now, let's all introduce ourselves
to each other. It's New Year's Eve.
Let's turn over a new leaf.

759
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,848
All right. Let's not
all fuckin' speak at once.

760
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:57,477
The name's Smiley.
I'm a Libra, and...

761
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:01,182
[Pats]
I'll handle these jokers.

762
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,193
You handle your people,
maybe we get out of here tonight.

763
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,028
He armed his prisoners.

764
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,936
It's a smart play.

765
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,100
Must be at least eight guns
in there now.

766
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:25,011
Just a couple hours till the sun's up.
If we can't breach, what do we do?

767
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,116
Get the A.V. -5 here.
Are you sure about that?

768
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,984
Yep. I'm not takin'
any more chances.

769
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,150
[Sighs]
It's gonna take a while
in this weather.

770
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:40,559
Marcus? What the fuck do we do
if it doesn't arrive in time?

771
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,827
We'll have to think of some
other way of ending this.

772
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,796
You either flirting with me
or clocking my game
'cause you don't trust me.

773
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:53,501
I don't like your beady little eyes
all over my goodies,
so turn the fuck away.

774
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,714
You're manipulative,
weak knees and that sexy
copper complexion.

775
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,979
You're definitely
an Aries, baby.
You're pretty good.

776
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,577
Smiley thanks you.

777
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,852
We got something in common,
you know that?

778
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,326
You comin' down
off some shit, ain't ya?

779
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,091
Don't be ashamed, man.
Don't be ashamed.

780
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,325
What's your poison?

781
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,359
Seconal to bring me down.
Adderall to bring me back up.

782
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,838
You gotta get up
to get down.
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

783
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,899
All right.
That's enough. Come on.
Let's pay attention.

784
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:31,174
I want a cigarette so bad.

785
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,944
Stupid New Year's resolutions.

786
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:41,049
Hey, gangster,
you make any resolutions? Hmm?

787
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,285
What do you think,
secretary?

788
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,229
Oh, my God. I can't stop
thinking about sex.

789
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,460
I mean, I usually think
about sex a lot, but this is crazy.

790
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,632
Sex and death
are very closely related.

791
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:03,611
The Greeks called it Eros
and Thanatos... love and death.

792
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,241
Or sex as a way
of nullifying thoughts of dying.

793
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:12,720
What's your deal, gangster?
You actually been shot five times?

794
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,053
Six.

795
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,634
You really
pull a man's spine out?

796
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,796
It was an Adam's apple.

797
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:37,270
If you ever get
into tussles, secretary,

798
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,009
you grab a man
by his throat, hmm?

799
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:45,144
Dig it?
And then you squeeze.

800
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,683
I guarantee you he will drop.
He will not get up
for quite some time.

801
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,261
Oh, God. It's really quiet
out there now.

802
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,299
Yeah.

803
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,903
That's what worries me.

804
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,246
[Wind Whistling]
[Bishop] We're not gonna make it till
morning. Marcus Duvall will not allow it.

805
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,688
We've got eight people
covering six entry points.
If we work together, we will make it.

806
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,318
Look at it this way. That's me out there.
You think I'd let you survive
until the morning?

807
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:29,455
- We don't have a lot of options here.
- Well, we got to figure something,

808
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:34,469
'cause I'm not gonna stay here all night
waitin' to get killed.

809
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,303
If you use the situation
to try and escape,
it's about me and you,

810
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,899
'cause when this is over,
you're goin' back to jail.

811
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,741
- Relax, Sergeant.
- "Relax."

812
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,680
This ain't about me and you.
Not yet.

813
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,185
- Our shit's on pause, huh?
- Yeah. Our shit's on pause.

814
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:56,558
You saved my ass back there.
Why?

815
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,424
Everyone in here
is my responsibility.

816
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,157
It's my job.
That's noble.

817
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,860
Unfortunately,
I don't share the sentiment.

818
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,598
I see a cop in jeopardy,
he's on his own,

819
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,732
unless it benefits me
to jump in for the save.

820
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,107
Listen. I don't try
to be anything I'm not.

821
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,373
That ain't gonna change;
I don't care what day it is.

822
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,575
You remember that,
Sergeant.

823
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,415
Hey.! Someone's comin'.

824
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,790
Oh, God.
It's Capra, Sarge!

825
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,699
[Bishop]
You know this guy?
[Roenick] He's a cop. He works here.

826
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,237
They'll execute him.

827
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,932
- Capra!
- Shh!

828
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,040
Yeah. Drive. Drive!

829
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,417
[Iris]
Oh, my God. He's gonna make it.
[Bishop] He still has to get by the sniper.

830
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,888
[Roenick]
Come on, Capra.!

831
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,720
[Gunfire]

832
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,601
He's still moving.
They didn't get him yet.

833
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,662
Where are you going?

834
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,240
[Panting]
Come on. Come on.

835
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,813
Come on, Capra.! Come on.!

836
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,515
- [Gun Cocks]
- [Gunfire]

837
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,250
Come on!

838
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,060
What the fuck is goin' on?

839
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,831
Who's fuckin'
shootin' at us, Sarge?
[Roenick Panting]

840
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,671
Who the fuck
are all these people?

841
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:58,237
What are you doin'here, Capra?
What are you doin'here?

842
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,612
It's New Year's Eve.
I knew you'd be here alone.

843
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:06,053
- I came to have a drink with Iris.
- You picked the wrong night
to make your move, baby, believe me.

844
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,386
You know, that's really sweet.
[Gun Cocks]

845
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,188
That's really sweet, but, unfortunately,
I don't believe a fuckin' word of it.

846
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:17,127
Put that goddamn weapon down,
you psycho! He works here!

847
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,724
I don't care
that he fuckin' works here, man.
He could be a plant.

848
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:23,397
No, Jasper. Put the gun down, all right?
Let's not start that again, all right?

849
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:28,000
He comes here in the guise
of courting that lady.
It's a fuckin'ingenious plan.

850
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,513
They get one of their boys in here
and then take us out one by one by one.
Come on. Tell 'em.

851
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,014
They shot at him.
All right? They shot at him.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:38,247
Oh, but they conveniently
fuckin' missed, didn't they?
The act is a fuckin' charade!

853
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,685
Come on. Tell 'em.
He's fuckin' right, Anna.

854
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,916
[Beck]
Isn't it a fucking charade?
Do I have a gun?

855
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,824
Do I have a fucking gun?
I can't hurt you.

856
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,660
It's not fuckin' good enough,
rat-bitch. Come on. Just lock him up,
man, so he doesn't do any damage.

857
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,360
Come on. Come on, Roenick.
Listen to me, man.
We're not lockin'this man up.

858
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,199
Not in my precinct, all right?
I vouch for him.

859
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,339
Okay. Okay, I'm fuckin' sorry,
but your authority has been
super-fuckin'-seded.

860
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,574
You understand?
You're not in charge anymore.

861
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,742
Right, Bish? Bish, tell 'em.

862
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,912
He could be one of them, man,
so fuckin'easily.

863
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,478
You don't think
we see right through you?
Fuckin'believe that shit?

864
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,926
Comes in here playing that game,
playing stupid. You don't think we know?

865
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,861
Right, man?
Let's do the math.

866
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,191
Let's put him away, man,
just play it safe, you know?

867
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,705
Put it down.
No, no, no. Come on.
Come on, man. Come on.

868
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,537
Just do the math. Come on.
Motherfucker comes in like that,
playing...

869
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,036
[Beck Gasping]

870
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,641
[Gasping Continues]

871
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:50,591
Come here. Sergeant Roenick
is in charge. Understand?

872
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,627
"Yes."

873
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,135
Let's go.

874
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:11,370
Only because I respect you.
But I still say this shit
is fuckin' illogical bullshit, all right?

875
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:15,611
He may not be who he says he is.
Just mull that shit over.
Think it over. Think it over, man.

876
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,351
Iris, look after Capra,
fill him in on what's goin' on.

877
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,657
All right, Capra?
Just be cool so no one else here
gets spooked.

878
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,689
Everybody else,
back to your positions.

879
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,477
Thank you.
Don't.
That was self-preservation.

880
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,641
The more men we have,
the better chance we stand.

881
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:51,015
Are you sure
you vouch for this man?
I do.

882
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,547
Come with me.

883
01:09:56,725 --> 01:10:01,128
You know, I hate to admit it,
but Smiley agrees with what
you said back there.

884
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,325
Smiley want a fuckin' medal?
Hear me out, man.

885
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,563
Look, we're out of our shackles
for what? The last time
in the next 15, 20 years?

886
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,434
All right, man. Get to the point.
What do you want?

887
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,737
Listen to me, man.
Look out that window.
That's freedom, baby.

888
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,869
Get what I'm sayin'?

889
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,972
Look, maybe this New Year's
can bring something different
for us after all.

890
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,075
Beck like Smiley now.

891
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,212
[Man]
Eight months ago he loses his team
when a deal goes sour.

892
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,222
Problem with drugs and alcohol
since the incident.

893
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:34,058
Burned-out cop.
Only a matter of time
before he drops his guard.

894
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:38,498
Watch the truck.
They'll eye it as a way out.

895
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:43,436
- What's the word on the A.V.?
- Storm's starting to let up,
so it shouldn't be long now.

896
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,401
Good.

897
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,713
Someone gets inside,
takes off, goes for help.

898
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,515
It's too obvious.
We'd need a distraction.

899
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,318
We also need the keys.
Your cop said he dropped 'em
in the snow.

900
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,760
- [Anna] I could hot-wire a car.
- I thought you never committed a crime
in your life?

901
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,627
- I haven't.
- Yeah.

902
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,259
Just picked up some shit
along the way.
Whoa. Hold on.

903
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:19,069
How do we know she's not just gonna drive
out of here and leave us all here to die?
Who the fuck are you, Miss Fuckin' Little Skirt?

904
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,542
Shake that skinny ass
in somebody else's face.

905
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,138
Okay, Anna. No offense,
but I'll feel better if somebody
goes with you.

906
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:31,482
Maybe I should go.
I promise I'll make her get help.
Scout's Honor.

907
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,757
It's either me orJasper.
[Bishop]
Can't be.

908
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,762
We need your guns.
It's gotta be...

909
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,060
[Alex]
Me.

910
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,738
- Me.
- [Bishop] You?

911
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,932
[Throaty Laugh]

912
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,442
- Shoot.
- Hey, I'll go. I'll do it.

913
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,972
- What? It's the only thing
that makes sense, right?
- [Anna] Whatever.

914
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,485
Whatever the fuck ever.
Let's just do this. Come on.

915
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,919
Me and... me and the doc.

916
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,583
Fine. Okay.

917
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,924
What? It's the right move,
Sergeant. I know that.

918
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,260
All right. All right.
I'm the doctor, right?

919
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,266
Right.
You can handle that?
Yes.

920
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,529
You can?
I don't know. I don't know.

921
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,971
But I have to try, okay?
No. No.

922
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,373
Please. I have to go.

923
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,208
I have to do it.

924
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,810
[Screams]
Shit!

925
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,788
Hey! Those two skels are buggin' out,
just like I told you they would.

926
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,731
They torched the bus
for a diversion, I guess.

927
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,159
Come on!

928
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,968
- [Roenick] Aw, Jesus.
They're gonna get themselves killed.
- They're dead already.

929
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,542
We can use this.

930
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,817
[Duvall]
Very smart.

931
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,919
They knew we'd expect them
to make for the car.

932
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,759
Free life, baby!
We did it.
Yeah. I told ya.

933
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,733
Happy New Year. Now, how are we
gonna get the fuck out of here?

934
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:30,363
Visual on two men. No shot.

935
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,701
Moving to a better vantage.

936
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,045
Hey. You sure
you wanna do this?

937
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,016
Yeah.
All right.

938
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,590
[Gunshot]
[Screams] Aw, shit!

939
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,568
- They're fucking shooting!
- Where'd they hit you, man?

940
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,571
My shoulder.

941
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,733
Let's go! Come on!
Let's haul ass now!
Okay, okay.

942
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,300
Go. Go.
You go.

943
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,814
[Yelping]

944
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:27,955
All right. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

945
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,158
This was not the plan, man!
This was your idea.

946
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,225
Come on.
We're so fucking close. Come on.
I think I can still make it.

947
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,328
Come on, man. You can do it.

948
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:41,069
- I'm on target.
- [Gunshot]

949
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:50,482
Thirty-six, 45, 54, 63,
72, 81, 90, 99...

950
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,953
Come on, man.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do, man?

951
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,958
- Don't make me go at this alone!
- [Sniper] Target two blocked.

952
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:03,464
- No shot.
- Have position but no shot.

953
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,365
[Continues Counting]
What the fuck's up with
that multiplication table shit?

954
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,369
Fuck you!
It's freakin' me out.

955
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,338
You couldn't hot-wire my ass!
You're a liar!
Liar?

956
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,431
I will bite your little white head
right the fuck off!
Forty-five, 54,

957
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,605
63, 72, 81, 90, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45...

958
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,547
What is taking so long?

959
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:24,347

963
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,394
What'd I tell you?
You and your sergeant boyfriend
didn't believe me.

964
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:10,522
- What?
- Sergeant boy.
That's your boyfriend, right?

965

with the body, Marcus?

01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:08,606
Bishop's men were responsible
for all this, remember?

988
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,715

Sergeant.

993

There are two ways
you can handle it:

What did you tell 'em?
Why didn't you let 'em inside?

- I wasn't there.

Look at you.

1122
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:37,916
When I first approached you
10 years ago, you couldn't
look me in the eye.

1123
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:41,045
One of them nervous,
God-fearin' types.

1124
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:44,215
Now you put a bullet in me,
no hesitation.

1125
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,124
You're quite the changed man
this New Year's, Marcus.

1126
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:52,125
Now, for the last fucking time,
call him.
[Yelps]

1127
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:55,327

- Shut up!

1130
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:13,812
- Put the gun down, Duvall.
- What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

1131
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,825
- Arrest me? You gonna kill a cop?
- There's only one cop here.

1132
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,488
Now put the goddamn gun down.
You're caught.

1133
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:26,727
How many more people
are you gonna kill tonight?
As many as it takes.

1134
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:30,668
You make me fuckin' sick.

So it's about that time, huh?

1142
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,552
Looks that way, don't it?

1143
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:31,155
Well, thanks.

1144
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:35,292
- For what?
- You didn't call my name.

1145
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:39,601
That was self-preservation,
Sergeant, and it worked.

1146
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:43,738
I told ya.
I'm not gonna change.

1147
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:47,838
You try to follow me,
you'll find out just how true that is.

1148

You're not gonna
get very far.

1149
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:55,581
I'll manage.
[Grunts]

1150

Well, you take care
of yourself, Sergeant.

1151
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:02,985
[Grunts]
I will find you.

1152
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:10,533

Shh. Shh.
It's okay. I told these firemen.
They're not leavin' us alone.

1159
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:43,027
Not for a second. Okay?
All right. Help me up.

Ow! Ow.

1161
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:53,736
We have some questions
for you, Sergeant.
I'd like to get this wound looked at first.

1162
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,249
Anybody else out there?

1163
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:03,685
No, man. There's nobody else.
Just me and... and them.

1164
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:07,488
- [Officer]
Let me get you on a stretcher.
- No. No, man. It's all right.

Shit. This is fucking tempting.

No. Don't
break your resolution, huh?

1169
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:28,812
Give me one.

even recognize you tonight.

1172
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,517
You were like a whole different
bad-ass motherfucker back there, huh?

Yeah.
