00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,958
NOGRADY: <i>Today really
marks the first stage</i>

2
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:29,956
<i>of an unprecedented
technological advancement.</i>

3
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,116
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,978
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,100
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,900
<i>If a planet's too far away
from its sun, it's too cold.</i>

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,620
<i>If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.</i>

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,690
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.</i>

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,228
<i>Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.</i>

10
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,239
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,836
<i>that is the right distance
from its star to hold water</i>

12
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,718
<i>and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.</i>

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,588
<i>Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii</i>

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,231
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,359
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,513
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,660
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,638
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,472
Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,958
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,152
Start transmission.

22
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,620
JACKIE: <i>It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop</i>

23
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>right here in
our own backyard.</i>

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,358
<i>Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.</i>

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,396
<i>Satellite dishes
here on Oahu</i>

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,472
<i>sending out very powerful
signals into deep space</i>

27
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,910
<i>with an attempt to
communicate with anyone…</i>

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,380
STONE: Another round,
birthday boy.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,140
JACKIE: <i>…or anything that
might be out there listening.</i>

30
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,354
A toast.

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,820
Happy birthday,
little brother.

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,071
I'm wishing you success
and growth, and happiness.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,630
May this be
a great year for you.

34
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,380
It's going to
be a great year.

35
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,152
I love you.
I love you, too.

36
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,915
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,117
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,674
Johnny.

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,877
“Adversity is
the state in which man

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
“most easily becomes
acquainted with himself

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,753
“being especially free
of admirers then.”

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,989
Cheers.

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,180
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,340
It's a very
good quote for you.

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,980
“I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time”?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,115
Will you shut up?

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,620
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,914
Did you get me that?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,353
Yes, I got you that.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,860
Thank you,
that's very sweet.

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,553
I got this guy, Tony. He said he
can get you a construction job.

53
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,020
All you need to
do is call him.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,620
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,676
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,100
STONE: You're not going
to call him, are you?

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,588
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
or Tony's help,
for that matter.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,029
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,436
No.
Great. All right.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,910
Happy birthday. Blow out your
candle and make a wish.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,551
Do not waste
a wish on a girl.

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,631
Wish for a job,
an apartment.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,260
A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,510
A job, or…
You said “job” twice.

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,032
It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,915
All right?

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,831
Please don't waste it.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,020
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm going in.
You're not going in.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,348
How do I look?

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,192
Wait, let me
just fix that.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Awesome!

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,280
All right, princess,
go get 'em.

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,793
Great start.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,628
Ugh.

77
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,930
What seems to
be the problem?

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,957
I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,076
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,060

I'm hungry.

84

No! Let's just…

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,100
Just one twist of the key
and we will be good.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,348

94
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,556

Okay.

It's right there. Please?

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,100
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.

Because I was hoping
that maybe one day

125
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,460
you would learn
from your mistakes.

126

you would mature a bit!

there is a new dynamic at play.

From here on, until I state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,

no more compromise!

He said, “One day
we would find them,
