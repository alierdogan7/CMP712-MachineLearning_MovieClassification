1
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,979
The French tried to build a canal here
before the Americans.

2
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,671
At the height of their effort,
500 workers...

3
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,410
...were dying every week
from malaria and yellow fever.

4
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,389
They couldn't come up with
cemetery space fast enough...

5
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,653
...not to mention the morale problem
all those crosses would have made.

6
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,093
So they bought shiploads
of vinegar in Cuba...

7
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,859
...and in each barrel,
they sealed one corpse.

8
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,937
And then they sold them
as medical cadavers all over Europe.

9
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,837
And for a while, that was
their principal source of profit.

10
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,470
You see, this place has always had
a special way of dealing...

11
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,914
...with both profit and death.

12
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,343
As some of you may have heard,
there is a hurricane warning tonight.

13
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,504
Well, Rangers do not wait
on good weather.

14
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:33,414
Rangers do not wait
for a bright, sunshiny day.

15
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:39,684
Oh, no. Rangers are trained to operate
in the worst possible conditions...

16
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,159
...and take said conditions
and turn them against their enemy.

17
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,326
You each have one rifle, one sidearm
and one white phosphorus grenade.

18
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:55,668
This is a live E and E, so please
keep those weapons safetied...

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,710
...so as not to shoot off
your nonexistent dicks.

20
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:06,680
The rally point is a bunker
two clicks north of the LZ.

21
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,447
You will split into teams of two.

22
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:14,218
Each designated area
has 20 reactive targets.

23
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:20,128
The first team to get all 20
and reach the rally point wins.

24
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,664
Anything goes pear-shaped out there,
you pop white and radio in.

25
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:29,205
l will be in each area
monitoring your progress.

26
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,436
lf l see anybody drag ass...

27
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,879
...l swear to God,
you will swim the canal.

28
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,941
-Where is the original pickup point?
-About two klicks up the valley.

29
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:14,450
So this was a Ranger training team?
When were they due?

30
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,215
They missed contact six hours ago.

31
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,123
Colonel Styles, that doesn't necessarily
mean anything in a storm like this.

32
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,196
No, it wouldn't be any wonder
if they were delayed.

33
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,800
l'm not seeing them.

34
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,739
l'm gonna have to come back around.

35
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,274
Wait a minute. Wait a minute,
l'm coming around to your side.

36
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,709
We got one-- No, maybe two.

37
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,679
Wait, l think he's carrying somebody.
ls he hurt?

38
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,319
All right, let's get down there.

39
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,540
What is that?

40
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,210
ls that live fire?

41
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,749
Christ, they're shooting at each other.
Get us on the ground. Now!

42
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,264
l've got a bleeder down here.
A little suction down there.

43
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,004
There it is.

44
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,942
That's enough!

45
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:53,449
You went out with your sergeant
and six men last night on an exercise.

46
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,247
You came back a few men light.

47
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,550
Four, to be precise.

48
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,057
Where are they?

49
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,857
Not in this lifetime.

50
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,323
Captain...

51
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,391
...if you don't make progress on this, we'll
have Washington crawling all over us.

52
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,467
What did he write?

53
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,604
''l'll only talk to a Ranger.
Someone from off-post.''

54
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,404
Let me see it.

55
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,749
lt's a stall tactic. Nothing more.

56
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,458
Give him what he wants.
l know somebody.

57
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,504
-Sir, l am confident that l can handle this.
-And l'm not.

58
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,313
Oh, God.

59
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:54,473
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

60
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,404
-Hello.
-Tom, what's wrong with your phone?

61
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,511
l've been trying to reach you all day.

62
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,113
There's a hurricane.
Everything's shut down.

63
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,808
-Hola, Tommy!
-lt's carnival, come on.

64
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,852
-The girl's name is Gabriella!
-l want to meet all your friends!

65
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,388
-She wants to meet you.
-Yeah, we'll samba!

66
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,082
-Are you coming?
-l will. l will.

67
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,922
You better.
l'm gonna come and get you.

68
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,222
-Tom?
-What's that?

69
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,763
-l said, are you drinking again?
-Nothing like that.

70
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,800
Any time a cocaine dealer
is suspected of bribing an agent...

71
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,030
...we pull him off the assignment
and run a check. lt's not personal.

72
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,970
A drug lord that l helped bust
says that he paid me off...

73
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,077
...you guys believe him,
and say it's not personal? Fuck you.

74
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,080
Relax, l'm sure you'll come up clean.
You'll be back on the job in a week.

75
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,310
With everyone looking at me
sideways, wondering if l'm dirty.

76
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,286
Look, l'm DEA in cocaine central.
All we have down here is trust.

77
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,517
And after what you did,
nobody's ever gonna trust me-- Hold on.

78
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,921
Are you putting me--?

79
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,831
Tom, Bill. l need you
to come down here.

80
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,968
-Come down where?
-Clayton, as soon as possible.

81
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,569
-Something happened. lt's bad.
-Are you all right?

82
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,339
No.

83
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,337
No, l need your help.

84
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,914
Sir?

85
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,484
Sir, this is completely unorthodox.
This guy isn't even Army.

86
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,484
Go ahead, sir.

87
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,161
He was Army.
l hadn't seen him in years...

88
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,233
...until l ran into him the other night
in a parking lot. Trust me, he was Army.

89
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,929
He trained at Benning and here with me,
so he knows the territory.

90
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,506
Before he left the service, he was
the best interrogator l had ever seen.

91
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,237
Tom Hardy could get in your head
faster than you could tie your shoes.

92
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,678
-Why did he leave the Army?
-l don't know and l don't care...

93
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,942
...because there is nobody
better in a room.

94
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,211
Sir, if he's not Army, it's not official.

95
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,981
Well, then, Captain Osborne,
it's unofficial.

96
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,022
Evening, sir.

97
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,261
lt doesn't get unofficialer than that.

98
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,429
-Hey, Bill, how is it going?
-Pretty much fucked. You?

99
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,869
Wet. So how's the knee?

100
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,305
They're never gonna
make me a general anyway.

101
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,002
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Why am l here?

102
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,875
l'm curious about that myself, sir.

103
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,113
Sir, l am Julia Osborne.
l am the provost marshal here.

104
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,982
-Osborne, do l look like a ''sir'' to you?
-Not particularly, sir.

105
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:27,819
Captain, Osborne is the closest thing
we have to an in-house investigator.

106
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,861
And you're going out of house.
How does that make you feel?

107
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,391
-Hostile and uncooperative, sir.
-Fantastic.

108
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,160
Okay. Tom, look,
before this hurricane hit...

109
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,327
...l recalled all exercises
except for one...

110
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,565
...a six-man Ranger team
and their Black Hat out in the bush.

111
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,375
-We're missing three and the sergeant.
-Not West?

112
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,970
Oh, tell me it wasn't West.

113
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,412
-You know Sergeant West, sir?
-He was our Black Hat.

114
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,384
-That must have been an honor.
-That's one way to put it.

115
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,921
West is a professional,
the face of the modern Army.

116
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,616
You notice l'm no longer in the Army.

117
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,523
They were due for pickup at 1830.

118
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,096
So the problem is that
three didn't come back?

119
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,234
No. The problem is,
one of them is dead...

120
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,768
...one has a bullet in his hip
and one won't talk.

121
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,737
Now the one who won't talk was
exchanging live fire with the dead one.

122
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,274
l'm assuming that's what
made him the dead one.

123
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,742
Sergeant Mueller,
killed right in front of me.

124
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,279
lf Command finds out
you're using a civilian...

125
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,850
...with my background, forget it,
they'll cut you a new asshole.

126
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,682
Your involvement's a secret. Anything
you uncover will be credited to Osborne.

127
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,123
-Well, then, let her do it.
-Sir, that is not a bad idea.

128
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,397
Captain, will you excuse us
for a moment?

129
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,202
All due respect to Osborne,
this is way out of her league.

130
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,066
This kid we have in interrogation
requested a Ranger.

131
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,571
Someone he'd never met. That's you.

132
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,142
Jesus, Bill, he could have
requested a sailboat.

133
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,906
lt doesn't mean you have to
give it to him. l don't get this.

134
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,647
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?

135
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,649
Not exactly.

136
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,984
What does that mean?

137
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,820
There was a group of guys
down here and they....

138
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:14,024
And they what? Come on, Bill, spill it.

139
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,470
Permission to speak freely, sir?

140
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,273
Osborne, l swear to God...

141
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:33,145
...you call me sir one more time,
l'm gonna scream.

142
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,152
l know who you are. The DEA
is investigating you for bribery.

143
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,854
Suspicion of bribery.
lt's all in the wording, really.

144
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,519
l'm not comfortable
having you involved with this.

145
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,962
Three things:
First, you don't have a choice.

146
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,398
Second, l've never taken
a bribe in my life.

147
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,027
And third, l'm still
a little drunk from earlier today...

148
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,265
...so if l skip over the witty banter...

149
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,776
...and move straight into coming on
to you, l hope you don't take offense.

150
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,148
Dog tags identify them
as Sergeant Raymond Dunbar...

151
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,223
...and Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall.

152
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,156
Levi? Who would name their kid Levi?

153
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,230
General Jonathan Kendall,
of the Joint Chiefs.

154
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,334
Remind me to thank Bill
for mentioning that on the phone.

155
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,335
Kendall Jr. will be unconscious
for at least another hour.

156
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,837
The soldier we're talking
to first is Dunbar.

157
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,135
-ls he in an interrogation room?
-Yes, sir.

158
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,972
-Move him.
-Why?

159
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,378
lnterrogation rooms tend to look
suspiciously like interrogation rooms...

160
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,645
...which makes people
uncomfortable. ls he cute?

161
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,346
-Excuse me?
-Dunbar, is he cute?

162
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,957
-lf you're not gonna take this seriously--
-ls he handsome?

163
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,925
Does he carry himself well?

164
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,929
Does he look you in the eyes
or down at the floor?

165
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,795
Does he have good bones,
which suggests good breeding?

166
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,231
Does he slouch or sit up?

167
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,862
These are questions that reveal
a great deal about a man's character.

168
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,068
Get over yourself for two-and-a-half
seconds and tell me, is he cute?

169
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,776
Yes, sir.

170
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,278
Thank you.

171
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,682
l'll let you know how it turns out.

172
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,823
Agent Hardy, if this goes to trial
someone is gonna have to testify...

173
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,587
...about what's said in interrogation.
And with your colorful background...

174
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,196
...you'd be the most
impeachable witness in history.

175
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,969
Now, l may be stuck with you,
but you're definitely stuck with me.

176
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:38,107
Okay. At some point l want you
to go bad cop on him.

177
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,278
-The signal will be my rubbing my nose.
-Not scratching your balls?

178
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,642
Look for both.
Any donuts around here?

179
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,583
l questioned him for two hours.
He didn't make a sound.

180
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,019
You try poking him with a stick?

181
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,388
Sorry, no. l didn't learn
sophisticated techniques like that.

182
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,758
l bet l can get him to talk
in under three minutes.

183
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,229
Ten bucks. That's without
telling him l'm a Ranger.

184
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,937
Go.

185
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,434
Sergeant Dunbar, good evening.

186
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,412
l'm Tom Hardy. l believe you've already
met the vivacious Captain Osborne.

187
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,742
l understand that you've had
a rough time of it out there...

188
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,911
...and that you're not talking.

189
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,846
l'm sure you just want
to get some sleep and food.

190
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,050
Did they feed you yet?

191
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,164
Go on. You can still eat
in front of someone and not talk.

192
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,966
My parents did it for years.

193
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,443
You want another one?

194
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,243
Maybe later.

195
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,513
Okay, Ray, l'm gonna be
upfront with you.

196
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,487
l don't know if you did what you did
in self-defense...

197
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,956
...and frankly, l don't care.

198
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,527
The thing is, l made an agreement
with a friend...

199
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,222
...to talk to you till your
transport showed up.

200
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,923
So....

201
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,704
You like baseball?

202
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,370
Oh, l could talk baseball for days.

203
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:25,245
You know, batting averages, ERAs,
l got statistics in my brain.

204
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,386
l don't know how l remember them.
lt's freaky.

205
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,512
You wanna talk baseball?

206
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,824
Oh, come on, Ray,
we gotta talk about something.

207
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,519
We're gonna be here for six hours.

208
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,529
Come on, who do you like?
Who do you like?

209
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,070
Sir, l don't like baseball.

210
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,262
Why not?

211
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,174
l believe the game of baseball
to be too slow.

212
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,042
Too slow? lt's a game of anticipation.
That's the beauty.

213
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,080
Well, sir, l just don't like it.

214
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,584
l'm sorry l don't have
an adequate explanation.

215
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,623
Well, that's all right.
l'm not gonna kneecap you or anything.

216
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,522
Sir, l requested a fellow Ranger.

217
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,965
l apologize. l just....

218
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,903
lt's just that you thought
l looked like a scumbag. l know.

219
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,939
lt turns a lot of people off.

220
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,748
You know, l was here in the 75th,
under Sergeant West.

221
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,316
Yeah, he had a wicked-looking blade.

222
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,476
Yeah. He still got that?

223
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,383
Hand-carved. Yes, sir.

224
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,686
Well, the reason l remember is he would
use me as his knife dummy.

225
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,090
-He ever do that to you guys?
-Oh, yeah.

226
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,925
What West used to do
is he would say that he could...

227
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,933
...slice a man from stem to sternum,
the stem being your dick, okay?

228
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,661
-l get it.
-Okay. Well, anyway...

229
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:58,174
...if you're his knife dummy, he would
just ram this pipe into your balls all day.

230
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,574
And that was a long day.

231
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,550
By the way, Ray, l promised l would ask
where West and the others are...

232
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,152
...and can they be found?

233
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,519
There's no need.

234
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,186
They're dead, aren't they?

235
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,425
Yes, sir.

236
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,531
You kill them?

237
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,938
Look, we got enough on you
to deep-fry your ass!

238
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,980
Back to silent treatment, fine by me.

239
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,051
-l'm just gonna have to haul your ass--
-Okay, whoa. Time-out.

240
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,020
Look, Ray, this is what you call
''good cop-bad cop.''

241
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,751
She shouts. l stand up for you.
You're grateful.

242
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,794
This establishes
some sort of bond of trust.

243
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,864
l don't wanna play games with you...

244
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:58,628
...so l say we take a break. Okay?
And get you another donut.

245
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,931
You see if you wanna talk anymore.

246
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,769
-''Deep-fry your ass''?
-You set me up.

247
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,913
l believe somebody owes me 10 bucks.

248
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,606
You could have told me
what you were planning.

249
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,614
Everybody knows good cop-bad cop.

250
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,582
By admitting it,
l could gain his trust.

251
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,726
-You think he did it?
-No, sir.

252
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,161
Yes.

253
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,758
What about the rest of my people?

254
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:35,598
ln 5 1/2 hours, it'll be out of our hands.
l'm gonna have a lot to answer for.

255
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,743
l'd appreciate it if you could get me
some of those answers.

256
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:45,039
-Why did you ask for a Ranger?
-l'm not telling you what happened.

257
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,208
Why don't you tell us about the others?

258
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,116
Tell us about the course.
Tell us about Sergeant West.

259
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,120
ls he still the same prick?

260
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,852
l do not care
that you are triple volunteers.

261
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,520
l do not care
that you think you are hard.

262
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:04,067
And l especially don't give a rat's fuck
what four-star general's dick...

263
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,297
...you sucked to get the privilege
of being able stand before me today.

264
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:14,712
Those of you l deem unworthy
will not remain.

265
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,747
ls that understood?
Can l get a ''Hoo-ha, sergeant''?

266
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,178
Hoo-ha, sergeant!

267
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,650
Those of you l find lacking will quit.

268
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,781
And those of you who refuse to quit
will have a training accident.

269
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,157
This base suffers
three training accidents a year.

270
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,164
Unfortunate accidents that l will not
hesitate to repeat...

271
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,263
...if you cross me. ls that understood?

272
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,896
-Give me a ''Hoo-ha, sergeant.''
-Hoo-ha, sergeant!

273
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,135
-And what's your name?
-Sergeant, my name is Pike, sergeant.

274
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,179
Pike, surrender your sidearm
for inspection.

275
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,750
What the fuck are you doing?
Have you lost your fucking mind?

276
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,320
-You told me to relinquish--
-Are you talking? Did you speak to me?

277
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,714
Who the fuck told you to speak?!

278
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,826
A Ranger never relinquishes
his weapon!

279
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,021
lf George S. Motherfucking Patton
rises from his holy grave...

280
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,998
...and asks you for your weapon,
you will not surrender your weapon.

281
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,329
Everybody better give me
a ''Hoo-ha, sergeant.''

282
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,768
-Hoo-ha, sergeant!
-Now, son...

283
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,501
...there are people in this world
that will kill you for no damn reason...

284
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,271
...other than something
passing through their mind!

285
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,439
l hail from Biloxi, Mississippi,
where vanilla motherfuckers like that...

286
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,950
...used to hang us from trees
by our necks on a whim!

287
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,721
Does that sound like the kind
of fucking place you want to grow up?

288
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,153
Sergeant, no, sergeant!

289
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,160
Are you implying something negative
about the great state of Mississippi?

290
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,198
From the beginning, West had a chip
on his shoulder for this guy named Pike.

291
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:48,029
By the time we did Green Hell,
it was getting nuts.

292
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,465
Green Hell was 20 days
in the Darien at 40 clicks a day...

293
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,543
...with an 80-pound pack on your back.

294
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,010
We got real used
to number oddities like that.

295
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,182
The course was called Jungle Leader
and the idea...

296
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,411
...was to teach you how to think
when you were exhausted.

297
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,246
And West really knew
how to get you exhausted.

298
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,424
We spent our nights
doing escape and evasions...

299
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,529
...with live fire snapping by our heads...

300
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,859
...or else up to our noses in
some damn swamp...

301
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,001
...slapping bugs and dodging snakes.

302
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,163
The nights we did mock POW stuff,
they wouldn't let us sleep at all.

303
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,440
We humped over the Cordillera
three times...

304
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,242
...all the way to the Colombian border
and back.

305
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:37,286
Some of that stuff is steep as hell
and the rain never let up for days.

306
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,717
Those packs got heavy in the rain...

307
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:44,260
...and nobody ever hated anything
like we hated those damn packs.

308
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,255
There was this one escarpment,
it wasn't more than 500 feet...

309
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,230
...but, Jesus, it was slippery.

310
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:50,535
Mr. Pike...

311
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,264
Mr. Pike...

312
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,270
...can you tell me the muzzle velocity
of an M-16?

313
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,433
Yeah.

314
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,808
-Eleven hundred, sergeant.
-Eleven hundred what?

315
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,479
Meters per second, sergeant.

316
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,383
Take 40% of that
and multiply it by the exact number...

317
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,888
...of each animal Moses
took with him on the Ark.

318
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,726
-Come on.
-Twenty....

319
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,694
Come on. You tired, Mr. Pike?
Too tired to think?

320
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,328
Zero, schmuck.
Moses wasn't on the Ark.

321
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,903
Have you lost it?

322
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,067
Well, tell me this.

323
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,446
What is your weapon?

324
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,280
Your weapon, man. Your weapon.

325
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:43,018
What keeps you alive
and makes the other guy die?

326
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,624
What is your weapon?

327
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,594
lt's your brain, Mr. Pike.

328
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,559
Your noggin. Your noodle.
Your smarts. Your gray matter.

329
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,858
Your poise under fire.

330
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,697
Your wits, when all about you
are losing theirs.

331
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,602
l think you came to this party
unarmed, Mr. Pike.

332
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,202
Take off your pack.

333
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,936
Take it off.

334
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,649
Here, l'll help you. Come on.

335
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:38,004
You can't complete this march
without a pack, Mr. Pike.

336
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:44,445
l suggest you go back and get it,
even if it takes 40 days and 40 nights.

337
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,715
That business bothered
a lot of the guys...

338
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,918
...even Mueller, who was a redneck
you felt uncomfortable sleeping around.

339
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,319
Dumb shit.

340
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,734
So that's what we were coming back
from yesterday afternoon.

341
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,099
We figured we'd finally get
a shower and a hot meal.

342
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,070
l mean, we were the walking dead.

343
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,738
We were about as ragged-out
as a man could ever get.

344
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,614
Here comes Master West himself.

345
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,592
What we have here is an opportunity.

346
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:38,497
A unique opportunity
for a spectacular training event.

347
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,538
Dunbar. Kendall.
Mueller. Nunez. Castro.

348
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:47,906
Drop your packs. Weapons only.
Muster at the east LZ in two minutes.

349
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,707
-Jesus Christ.
-What was that, Mr. Pike?

350
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,277
You think a little rain
is inappropriate for combat?

351
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,853
That the game should be called
on account of weather?

352
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,923
Are you concerned for their safety?

353
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,590
Sergeant....

354
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,651
What?

355
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,292
-No, sergeant.
-Good, then you can join them.

356
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,098
Those are the guys that went
on the exercise with you?

357
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,503
Yeah, and that is all l'm saying.

358
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,110
Ray?

359
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,778
You smoke?

360
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,619
ls this a trick where you won't
give me a cigarette till l tell you more?

361
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,160
No, l just forgot mine in the car,
and l was hoping that you had some.

362
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,634
My brand. My lucky day.

363
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,208
You seem like a good guy, Ray.

364
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,507
You carried Kendall
wounded to the pickup...

365
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,377
...but l just don't understand.

366
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,043
What did you do to make
Mueller want to kill you?

367
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,524
l'm not saying anything else.

368
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:16,058
l just don't understand
why he asked for a Ranger.

369
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,965
The man's in trouble.
Never leave a man behind.

370
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,574
-So?
-Ranger code.

371
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,773
Never leave a man behind.

372
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,546
What's the matter?

373
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,645
This place gives me the willies.

374
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,084
-Not the happiest of memories, huh?
-No.

375
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,694
He's the son of a general,
so go easy on him. Kid gloves.

376
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,989
-All right.
-l mean it. Kid gloves.

377
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,995
l got it.

378
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,497
Yeah. Thanks.

379
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,767
Tommy, that you?

380
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,498
Pete Vilmer, as l live and breathe.
How are you?

381
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,337
-How are you? l'm good.
-Osborne, Pete Vilmer.

382
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,344
l know. Let me guess,
you two trained together?

383
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,914
Guilty as charged, Julie-bird.
What are you doing here?

384
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,052
-You're not getting all nostalgic on me?
-No, l can't tell you--

385
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,709
-l'm running this joint.
-No.

386
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,686
Yeah. We're busy as hell too.
Packing up supplies...

387
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,688
...getting ready for the move stateside.

388
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,123
Who'd have thunk it?
Pete Vilmer, bettering society.

389
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,695
Shall we see Kendall
or would you like to continue...

390
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,923
...the backslapping
for a couple of minutes?

391
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,091
''Julie-bird.''

392
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,602
Now if l were a smart man,
and l am not...

393
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:33,608
...l could come to the conclusion
that you two saw each other socially.

394
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:38,575
Oh, l've seen you around
the base before, but...

395
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:43,320
...well, are you in the Army or...?

396
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,218
Coast Guard.
We're worried about Florida beaches.

397
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,623
Oh, l've seen you before.
You were in the newspaper.

398
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,424
You're that DEA agent
with friends in low places.

399
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,897
Oh, the price of fame.

400
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,901
We were wondering if you'd
answer a few questions for us?

401
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:06,470
Oh, no. l'm really fatigued.
l feel all drugged-up.

402
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,545
Our collective hearts weep.

403
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,342
Well, we just wanna know
what happened out there.

404
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,680
Oh, you wanna know what happened?

405
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,655
Well, there are degrees of truth, captain.

406
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:23,317
You know, there are always degrees
and things are not what they seem.

407
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,087
You know, this is--

408
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,663
lt is too late and l am too tired
to give a shit...

409
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,393
...about some pissant lieutenant's
bad version of intrigue.

410
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,198
You're trying too hard, Levi.
You know how l can tell?

411
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,773
Because you're sweating,
and you're sweating...

412
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,605
...because you don't know
how much Dunbar told us already.

413
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,038
Excuse me.

414
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,182
-Those were kid gloves?
-l thought l did pretty well up till the end.

415
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,724
You mean when you yelled
at him and walked out?

416
00:29:55,894 --> 00:30:00,228
Well, that would be the end, yeah.
We'll play it differently when we go back.

417
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,889
Go back? We just blew it.

418
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,432
-l thought you didn't have any cigarettes.
-l lied.

419
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,904
-Will you just wait? Just wait.
-For what?

420
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:16,009
Excuse me. A patient is asking for you.

421
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,381
Shall we?

422
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,118
My father is what you would call
a very powerful man.

423
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:28,385
-So we've heard.
-Oh, come on, you know...

424
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,585
...you don't know the half of it.
l mean....

425
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:36,928
You know, all my life he's made me
feel weak and insignificant.

426
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,404
Yeah, l think that is reason why l joined
the military in the first place.

427
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,702
And how is that going for you?

428
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,335
Oh, it's horrible.
l fucking hate the military.

429
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,574
You're terrified of him, aren't you?

430
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,753
No, no, we just hate each other.

431
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:05,158
You know, and normally he wouldn't
lift a finger to do anything for me...

432
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,062
...but the one thing he cannot
stand is a scandal...

433
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:15,138
...and you know, a joint chief...

434
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:20,107
...with a homosexual son in the military
definitely qualifies as scandal.

435
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,076
Well, that blows ''Don't ask,
don't tell'' out of the water.

436
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,876
So is this family history lesson
coming to a point?

437
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:33,752
About four months ago,
l began a relationship with a local...

438
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:40,264
...and my father decided to
intercede. And Colonel Styles...

439
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:45,198
...made the incident quiet.
But according to my father...

440
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,237
...transferred me into
West's training course.

441
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,273
And, you know, West just hated that.

442
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,172
He made sure everyone
knew where l was and all that.

443
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,439
Couldn't kick you out so he
wanted you to quit on your own.

444
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,682
Well, he wanted more than that.

445
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,650
More intrigue, Levi?

446
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,088
Yes.

447
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:14,164
l swear to God, you will swim the
canal! The teams are as follows...

448
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,430
Dunbar and...

449
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,937
...Mueller.

450
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,775
Pike and Nunez.

451
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,205
Kendall and...

452
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,903
...Castro.

453
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:35,417
You have one minute to touch down.
Get your shit together!

454
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,482
That's when he did it.

455
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,354
He was threatening my life.
lt was clear as day.

456
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,394
Did anyone else see
or hear this?

457
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,800
No, of course not. There
was a helicopter, you know?

458
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,238
-Nobody could hear anything.
-l don't know how familiar you are...

459
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,537
...with investigative work,
but there's this thing called motive.

460
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,213
And you just gave yourself one.

461
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,818
Well, you wanted to know
what happened...

462
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,888
-...and l'm telling you the truth.
-What happened to degrees?

463
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,324
l didn't kill him.

464
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,024
Then who did?

465
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,426
Thirty seconds to LZ.

466
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,369
Click in! On the skids!
Lose the communicators!

467
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,039
l did want to tell someone,
but Mueller would've just laughed...

468
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,305
...and Nunez wouldn't
have given a shit.

469
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,348
l suppose
neither would Pike or Dunbar.

470
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,116
Of course, West had me
paired with Castro...

471
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,848
...who treated me like a leper
from the day that l met him.

472
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,453
l started getting it in my head
that maybe West had paid him.

473
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:55,087
Maybe he was the one who was
supposed to give me a training accident.

474
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,659
All l could think of was
West was out here...

475
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,032
...somewhere in this
godforsaken swamp...

476
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,240
...making us stalk around
in this hurricane, and just waiting.

477
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,155
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing? Huh?

478
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,987
-This is fucking ridiculous!
-Shut up and shoot something!

479
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,478
l was terrified,
and l wasn't about to be...

480
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,849
...the victim of some
discriminative hate crime.

481
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,218
You know, maybe l should say
l wasn't scared at all, but l was.

482
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,952
l was terrified.

483
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,989
You know, enough to want
to murder somebody.

484
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,159
But you didn't.

485
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,643
Come on!

486
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,143
Come on!

487
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,615
ls that West?

488
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,781
Whose area is this?

489
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,298
West.

490
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,037
-What did you do?
-We found him like this.

491
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,512
You kill him?

492
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:05,452
We found him like this.
Where's Pike?

493
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,321
Come on, tell me! Where's Pike?

494
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,795
-We got separated.
-Yeah?

495
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,094
-Yeah, we did.
-Before or after the explosion?

496
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,336
Before or after the explosion?

497
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,010
-l don't know.
-What do you mean?

498
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,549
l mean, l don't fucking know, okay?
We got separated, so shut the fuck up!

499
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,246
Shut up! Exercise over!
Get out of here!

500
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,394
Radio's had it.

501
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,796
-Are we gonna leave him like this?
-We have to.

502
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,833
The MPs will secure the site
till the ClD gets here.

503
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,665
-What about Pike?
-l'm not waiting for Pike.

504
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,935
You can if you want.
Fucking do something, okay?

505
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,204
Where you been?

506
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,002
You guys all right?

507
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,236
Where's Pike?

508
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,345
-West is dead.
-What?

509
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,778
What happened?

510
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,043
He took a phosphorus
grenade in the back.

511
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,016
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

512
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,452
He's out there smoldering.

513
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,319
How long have you guys been here?

514
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,326
Ten minutes. We finished the
course, and just before we got here...

515
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,761
-...we heard an explosion.
-That's your story?

516
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,061
-Yeah, that's our story, Nunez.
-Watch it, motherfucker!

517
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,365
Hey! Hey! Stop!

518
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,469
What?

519
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,576
Hey, calm down!
Everybody just calm down!

520
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,673
Where the hell is Pike?

521
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,215
We got separated, okay?

522
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,786
She just doesn't remember
if it was before or after the explosion.

523
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,618
-Before the explosion, all right?
-Oh, so now you remember? Now?

524
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,259
-Yeah.
-Now you remember?

525
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,692
-Before the explosion. Hear me?
-So you think Pike did it?

526
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,130
Does anybody know the shit that we
are in, how fucked we all are?

527
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,860
Kendall!

528
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,036
Let me see your grenade, Nunez.

529
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,111
-Yeah, let's see it, Nunez.
-Nunez?

530
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,342
-Let's see that.
-Get off! Fuck off.

531
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,748
This is bullshit, man.
This is so bullshit.

532
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,089
l'm so sick of you guys. Okay.

533
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,592
Are you happy now? Here it is. One.
Here it is. You see it?

534
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:01,459
So sorry to disappoint you. You're not
gonna have a strip-search tonight.

535
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,265
The man is fucking dead, all right?
So, what happened?

536
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,941
-Must be a level three out there.
-You okay?

537
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:17,308
-Yeah.
-Pike, you got your grenade?

538
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,676
No, l used it.

539
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,053
You know West is dead?

540
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,683
Of course l do.

541
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,722
l killed him.

542
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:35,496
-He admitted it?
-He thought we would all be on board.

543
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,067
He was that type of guy, l guess.

544
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:43,536
You know, apparently, Pike wasn't
even his real name. He changed it--

545
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,538
Come on, come on, focus, Levi.

546
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,008
Okay, fine. So then
Mueller went after him...

547
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,479
...and we had to pull him back
and calm him down...

548
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,484
...and we said that we would turn
Pike in. So then everybody agreed...

549
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,315
...and....

550
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,922
Kendall!

551
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,987
Come here.

552
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,424
Come here!

553
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,229
Come here.

554
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,439
Don't tell me that you ain't glad
that West is dead.

555
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,012
Now we got a opportunity here.

556
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,251
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-What l'm talking about...

557
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,877
...is we can all walk out of here
heroes. All right?

558
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,015
Now, all we gotta do
is get rid of Mueller and Nunez.

559
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,418
We get the other guys
to play along...

560
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:43,033
...and we can be the men that
took down our sergeant's killers.

561
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,103
All we gotta do is tell the story right.

562
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,400
You're out of your mind.

563
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,216
After l woke up,
l saw Pike and Dunbar talking.

564
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,286
No! No!

565
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,820
You sack of shit!

566
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,580
lt was just a reflex.
Castro had already been hit.

567
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,452
l must've passed out,
because the next thing l knew....

568
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,898
-Mueller was chasing Dunbar?
-Because he had shot Castro.

569
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,663
Why did he carry you out?

570
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,003
l don't know. Maybe he wanted
somebody to cover for him.

571
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:39,448
But l can't. l know what l saw.
And he killed those men.

572
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,214
And you'll testify to this?

573
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,521
Of course.

574
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,850
Okay. That's it.

575
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,690
Agent Hardy?

576
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,099
What did Dunbar say to you?

577
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,232
Let's go have a beer.

578
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,463
l don't drink beer.
What about the case?

579
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,268
You don't drink beer?
Who doesn't drink beer?

580
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,309
Me. What about the case?

581
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,779
The case is done, with two hours
and 40 minutes to spare.

582
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:19,013
l thought we'd get a beer and l'd get
to flirt with you. What do you think?

583
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,623
-You believed Kendall?
-Absolutely.

584
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,558
Because Dunbar wouldn't tell us
everything. Why? Because he did it.

585
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:30,223
No. Dunbar came back for Kendall.
l don't think he's capable of murder.

586
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,063
-How long you been doing this?
-What's that have to do with it?

587
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,465
That means less than a year.

588
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,631
Osborne, murder is basic. No
conspiracies, no grand mysteries...

589
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,074
...no puppet masters behind
the scenes pulling the strings.

590
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,441
Everyone is capable of murder.

591
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,617
Dunbar's our guy.

592
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:52,449
Look, there's no physical proof.
We need a confession.

593
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,091
From Dunbar? Forget it.

594
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,220
You're not gonna talk that kid into
giving himself up for the death penalty.

595
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,024
-Nevertheless.
-Nevertheless what?

596
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,430
Kendall will testify.
That's all we need.

597
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,635
lt's not enough for me.

598
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,042
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk
with your buddy, Kendall.

599
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,273
Hey, Ray. Had a nice talk
with your buddy, Kendall.

600
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,415
-Seems you killed a bunch of people.
-That son of a bitch.

601
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,483
-Well, that'd be my reaction too.
-He's lying.

602
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,780
Why didn't you say something?
We would've dropped the charges.

603
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,320
l'm serious, goddamn it!

604
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,017
Fuck your ''serious.'' Right now, we'd
take the word of a crackhead over yours.

605
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,220
You got something to say? Say it.

606
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,761
Did Kendall tell you about the drugs?

607
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,461
-About the business Mueller ran?
-What drugs?

608
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,964
He sold them out of the hospital
for 50 bucks a pop.

609
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,837
West is easier to handle
when you can't feel the pain.

610
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,379
Oh, that's good, Ray. You know l'm
DEA and you figure you say ''drugs''...

611
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,948
-...and l'm all ears, right?
-lt's not like that.

612
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,747
Then why didn't you bring this up
before you were accused of murder?

613
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,880
No, wait! Don't say it. l'll tell you.

614
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,392
Drug charges in the Army come
with a 20-year sentence.

615
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,531
You figured Kendall fucked you,
you'll fuck him right back.

616
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,260
-l didn't shoot West.
-l know. Pike did.

617
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,404
You think you know
everything, don't you?

618
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,239
You haven't even
scratched the surface.

619
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,637
l know enough to know
that you've got two choices.

620
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,777
You can sign a confession and
spend the rest of your life in a cell...

621
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:34,151
...or you can tell us to fuck off
and you'll be hanged.

622
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,386
Now...

623
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,663
...am l scratching your surface yet?

624
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,370
Dumb bastard!

625
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,837
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

626
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,432
-Excuse me?
-The next time...

627
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,511
...l wanna borrow your balls,
l'll ask you.

628
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,510
Tom? Where are you going?

629
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,708
-l'm done. l'm out of here.
-Wait. What about the confession?

630
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,321
Why don't you confess?
The only reason you brought me here...

631
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,255
...was to protect your career. People
are dead and you don't give a shit.

632
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,394
-What are you taking about?
-About West!

633
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,464
You're the base commander. You know
what he's all about and you stood by.

634
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,795
lt was just a matter of time
before someone fragged his ass!

635
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:23,133
He deserved it. Now, there!
There's your fucking confession.

636
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,870
Hardy?

637
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:32,474
Hardy! What about Dunbar? What
about what he said about the drugs?

638
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:37,018
You are incredible! lf someone
said ''Santa Claus,'' you'd say:

639
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:41,214
''You can't leave. We haven't
explored the flying reindeer angle!''

640
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:45,157
-You fucking coward!
-No, no, wait! You stop right there.

641
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:51,268
l was there! l was tortured by that guy!
l wanted him dead 15 years ago!

642
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:55,098
And now, l should feel bad about
someone who offed him? Forget it.

643
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,433
-No can do.
-So fuck the Army, right?

644
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,269
-Fuck the Army and fuck those kids too.
-That's right.

645
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:04,039
Yeah, all they wanted to do is serve
their country and take a stand...

646
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,911
-...and protect assholes like you!
-Oh, don't you even start.

647
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,145
Don't you talk to me like
some recruiting poster...

648
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,586
-...because l did my time!
-Yeah, please. Oh, yeah.

649
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,318
-And you couldn't hack it!
-Yeah.

650
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,532
You were like me once. You believed
in the whole honor and duty thing...

651
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,828
...and trying to make a difference.
lsn't that what you said?

652
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:32,601
-l was trying to get your number.
-334-5644.

653
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:36,911
-Thank you.
-You believed it. l saw it in your eyes.

654
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,949
You believed in it and those kids did
too. Now they'll never tell their story.

655
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,782
Never gonna get to expose West
for the monster you say he was.

656
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,689
l thought you wanted me gone.

657
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,621
You grew on me.

658
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,056
Look, l'm gonna go in there,
and l'm gonna talk to Kendall...

659
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,669
...and to Dunbar, and l'm gonna
try to figure this whole mess out...

660
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,829
...because l care what happened
out there. And l think you do too.

661
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,475
-''l didn't shoot West.''
-What?

662
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,851
That's what Dunbar said. ''l didn't
shoot West.'' West wasn't shot.

663
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,785
Kendall said he was burned
by a phosphorus grenade.

664
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,019
Dunbar never saw the body.

665
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,805
Hey, look, l apologize.

666
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,805
-You saw West's body?
-Of course l did.

667
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,043
-Where?
-Down by the creek bed.

668
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,912
-And he was shot?
-Yeah.

669
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,080
What about the phosphorus grenade?

670
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:59,959
One went off, yeah, but it didn't
touch him. l thought you knew this.

671
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,791
Tell us.

672
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,549
-What did you do?
-We found him like this.

673
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,058
You kill him?

674
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,355
We found him like this!

675
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:35,259
Stop. Kendall said that only Nunez
showed up at the body.

676
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,526
-You were at the bunker with Mueller.
-He's lying.

677
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,695
l was at the body. We didn't see
Mueller till we got back to the bunker.

678
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,334
-Where you been?
-West. He's dead.

679
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,775
Back up.

680
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,609
-Mueller was alone in the bunker?
-Yeah.

681
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,342
What are you doing here alone?

682
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,681
Pike and l got separated, then
l heard gunfire. lt was close.

683
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:05,017
Well, so did we.
Why you didn't come?

684
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,562
So where's your grenade?

685
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:23,339
And l didn't buy it,
but Mueller still had his grenade.

686
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,512
At least you and
Kendall agree on that.

687
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,675
Okay, what happened next?

688
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,022
Pike came back.

689
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,159
Mueller, what the hell
happened to you?

690
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,660
Where were you? One minute you're
next to me, the next you're gone...

691
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:45,029
-...the sky lights up like Christmas.
-Where've you been, Jay?

692
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:50,139
There's a hurricane out there, okay? l
couldn't find the spot. My radio's busted.

693
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,435
-Where's West?
-Yeah, right.

694
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,272
Shut up.

695
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,510
West is dead.

696
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,473
What?

697
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:08,715
-Where've you been, Jay?
-l said, l couldn't--

698
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,992
No, no, no, no. No.

699
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,931
Fuck you.

700
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:25,201
-Fuck you! No! Stop it! No!
-Okay, hello!

701
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:33,108
We just wanna see your pack.

702
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:38,953
-We wanna see your pack because....
-Why?

703
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:43,218
Because whoever shot the sarge
popped a grenade first. That's why.

704
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,453
A dead body shows up and just
put it on the darkest face in the room?

705
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,825
-lt's not like that and you know it.
-Do l?

706
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,859
Do l, Dunbar?

707
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:59,701
l just want you, papi,
to show them your pack.

708
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,740
Right now.

709
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,323
Good.

710
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,635
Tie him up.

711
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,005
Ray? Come here.

712
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,813
Come here close, l wanna
talk to you. Come on.

713
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,745
We're friends, right?

714
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,384
-Ray, we're friends, right?
-Yeah.

715
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,155
Well then, come on, man, untie me!
You know that l didn't do this.

716
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,934
-You hated West more than any of us.
-Maybe, but not enough to be a killer.

717
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:03,370
-You're the one missing a grenade.
-Anybody could have taken that out.

718
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,703
Did you check your pack
coming in on the bird?

719
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:12,276
Look, you know
l don't have this in me.

720
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,250
-lf not you, then who?
-Mueller, that's who.

721
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,749
Oh, come on, man.

722
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,515
We were scanning the area together
then he just ups and disappears?

723
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,523
-That's what he says about you.
-Who you gonna believe...

724
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,627
...a redneck or your friend?

725
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,961
-Listen, check my pack.
-Why?

726
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,831
That's a combat cocktail.
Demerol and anabolics.

727
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,997
-Mueller gave it to me.
-You're lying, man.

728
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:43,975
Does that look like l'm lying? lt kills
the pain, focuses the brain, man.

729
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,014
l've been using for
about eight weeks solid.

730
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:50,846
After that first night, man, it was bad.
Malnutrition and exposure.

731
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:56,220
l needed something to keep me from
crashing and Mueller hooked me up.

732
00:54:56,393 --> 00:55:00,352
The way l see it, West knew. He
found out and was gonna report him.

733
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,464
-But they killed him first.
-They?

734
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:07,467
Yes! Mueller and Castro. They
must've sabotaged the radios and...

735
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,368
...one of them must've taken a grenade
out of my pack on the chopper.

736
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:21,276
Who popped white?
What the hell's going on?!

737
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,045
l don't know, sarge!
l don't know what happened!

738
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,086
Get down!

739
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,559
You saw West's body.
How was he killed?

740
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,431
His chest was hamburger, Jake.

741
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,405
See, that's close range. You go full-auto
on somebody, close range...

742
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:50,603
...they're gonna be swimming in blood.
Look at me. l don't have a drop on me.

743
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:55,080
Now, how about Mueller? When
l walked in, he wasn't wearing shit.

744
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,550
-l don't know, man.
-What don't you know?

745
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,282
This is a lot of shit to digest!
l gotta think!

746
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:05,756
Come on, Ray, man, we don't have
time to think! We need to go now!

747
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,564
Look. No, listen.

748
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,101
Let's wait till we get back, then
we'll tell everything to the MPs.

749
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,794
lf we wait, l am a dead man.

750
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,839
l have a black face and there are
a hundred men out there...

751
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,101
...dying to testify
how much l hated West.

752
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:25,646
My court-martial will take five minutes.
lt's me or them. l don't got that time.

753
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,942
You gotta make up your mind, man.

754
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,421
Ray. Untie me.

755
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,256
Come on, Ray.

756
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,734
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, wake up!

757
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,272
-Hey, hey. This place is gonna go!
-Shut the fuck up, Pike!

758
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,568
-You were gonna cut him loose!
-Why?

759
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:57,213
-Because l didn't do it, Nunez!
-We all know what you did, Pike.

760
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,440
Yeah, where's your shirt, Mueller?
Ask him where his shirt is!

761
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,145
My shirt? l tossed it.
l was soaking wet.

762
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:06,481
That's a convenient excuse for the
murderer. He tossed his bloody shirt.

763
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:11,389
-l was freezing from the hurricane!
-So you took your shirt off?

764
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:16,021
l wasn't wearing a poncho, goddamn it!
Hey, what about him?

765
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,030
Maybe you brought an extra shirt.

766
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,829
-We have to go.
-We're not going anywhere.

767
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:25,407
Sergeant Mueller, you are under military
arrest for the murder of Sergeant West.

768
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,668
-You have no authority--
-lt doesn't matter...

769
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,971
...because you will be
charged with murder!

770
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,944
-Shut up, Pike.
-You will be court-martialed....

771
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,708
-What are you doing?
-l said, shut up!

772
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,980
-Shut up, you dumb fucking nigger!
-You fucking white-trash motherfucker!

773
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,713
l saw you do it!

774
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,025
Jesus!

775
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:51,162
-Oh, my God.
-He wouldn't shut the fuck up!

776
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,068
So you killed him?

777
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,401
Put the gun away!

778
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,841
-You too?
-l'm sorry, Ray.

779
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:07,449
Okay. Pike got free. He got a weapon
and he came after us. That's our story.

780
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:11,144
-West was one thing, but this is--
-Shut up! Shut up, Mueller!

781
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,948
We have two dead bodies
and a story that explains them.

782
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,648
That's what we're gonna say.

783
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:22,694
-You're either with us or against us.
-Castro, put it down!

784
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,730
Which is it?

785
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,695
Castro!

786
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,572
Goddamn it, now we're gonna
have to shoot them both.

787
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,852
Can l get some more coffee?

788
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,418
Can l get another cup of coffee?

789
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:27,154
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

790
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,893
Okay. So the plan was
kill West, blame it on Pike.

791
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,300
Right. And for that to work,
okay, you need a witness.

792
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,235
-Dunbar.
-Exactly.

793
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,071
So it's a good plan,
but it goes wrong.

794
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,440
Mueller flips out
and shoots their fall guy...

795
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:48,105
...so they have to bring Dunbar
and Kendall into their cover story.

796
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:52,118
Right. And Kendall might've agreed if the
hurricane hadn't butt-fucked the bunker.

797
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,186
''Butt-fucked the bunker''?

798
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,484
Well, l just-- Well, you know.

799
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,356
Happy endings. What do you think?

800
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,492
l think we're gonna need proof.

801
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,301
Ray, you're gonna have to put
what you said in writing.

802
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,142
And, Ray? Ray? For you to have
any chance of coming out of this...

803
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:19,714
...we need to corroborate your testimony.
Otherwise, this is just another story.

804
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,986
Pike said the supplier was
somebody over at the hospital.

805
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,957
Guy named Vilmer.

806
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:46,039
Oh, my God. l haven't had
one of these since college.

807
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,979
-How long you and Pete been together?
-On and off for two years.

808
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,650
Serious?

809
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,210
Semi.

810
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,652
For you or for him?

811
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,483
You don't get to interrogate me, Hardy.

812
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,360
Know about the drugs?

813
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:12,995
-Sorry, l gotta ask. Did you?
-No!

814
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,629
Gotta put him in a room, you know.

815
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,238
Try and stop me.

816
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:23,142
l need that consult report on the chart.
On the chart, okay?

817
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,075
Yes, sir.

818
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,876
Pike said the supplier was someone
over at the hospital. Guy named Vilmer.

819
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,954
Well, shit, if it's on tape,
it's gotta be true.

820
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:39,026
Piece of advice? Charming's not
the tack to take with us right now.

821
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,127
l want a lawyer.

822
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,869
No.

823
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,904
Excuse me?

824
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,870
No, you can't have a lawyer.

825
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,645
Fuck you, Julie-bird.

826
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,511
Uniform Code of Military Justice
says l get a lawyer.

827
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:04,380
l don't have to say shit to you.

828
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,793
How about them Yankees?

829
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:18,827
Now, Peter, what l just did is illegal.
lt'll kill my career in the Army.

830
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:22,164
And that will end any chance
of going to law school...

831
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,501
...so l don't have anything to lose.

832
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:30,301
Now, do you really want
to go round two?

833
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,781
Jesus Christ. What the fuck!

834
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,821
l called them ''combat cocktails.'' Okay?

835
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,624
l got them hooked, l had them push,
once they were in, they couldn't get out.

836
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,460
lt was a perfect goddamn crime.

837
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,499
How'd you get around
the drug testing?

838
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,068
Who do you think
administered the tests?

839
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,697
l swapped their dirty piss
for someone else's clean.

840
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:03,243
They could use all they wanted
and never pop positive.

841
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,848
-Who else was involved?
-You broke my goddamn nose!

842
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,541
Who else was involved?

843
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,223
Mueller and that kid who took a bullet.

844
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,757
What, you didn't know that?

845
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,495
How'd you recruit them?

846
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:26,798
You know how it is in Panama, Tommy.
lt's easy to spot the bad eggs.

847
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:30,302
First week l snuck a couple of them
off base. Bought them some drinks...

848
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,067
...tried to find out which one
of them was interested.

849
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,302
After that it was smooth.
l handled the cooking supplies...

850
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,040
...they handled distribution. That's it.
Broke my fucking nose.

851
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,646
When did West find out?

852
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,849
l didn't know he knew.
l just supply.

853
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,388
l don't know shit about
what happened last night.

854
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,088
That's real noble.
Thanks for clarifying.

855
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,486
How long have you been doing this?

856
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,660
Gee, l wasn't looking at my watch.

857
01:03:56,866 --> 01:04:01,360
-Were you doing this while we were--?
-While we were fucking? Yeah.

858
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,732
Right under your nose.

859
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:07,103
-Riggs?
-Yes, ma'am.

860
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,267
Read this gentleman his rights and...

861
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:13,414
...see to it that he gets medical attention
and stick him in a cell.

862
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,516
Yes, ma'am.

863
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,377
Nice seeing you again, Pete.

864
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:25,426
Why would he risk 20 years in prison
just to sell a few painkillers?

865
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,222
Doesn't add up.

866
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,489
Kendall's the key.

867
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,927
Ma'am, colonel's looking for you
and Mr. Hardy.

868
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,296
Tell him we'll be right up.

869
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:40,402
Now, look. How far do you want
to go with this?

870
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,872
l think we should go see Bill,
hand over Vilmer...

871
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,881
...give him Dunbar's confession
and forget about Kendall.

872
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:52,646
So Vilmer admitted to
supplying the drugs?

873
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,488
Yes.

874
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,955
-Christ.
-Now, look, Bill...

875
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,422
...you know, you got Vilmer's confession,
Dunbar's confession...

876
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,225
...that is more than enough
to clear you with ClD.

877
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,061
Great. Good.
Good job, both of you. Thanks.

878
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,535
Thank you. All right.
Then we'll get out of here.

879
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,174
There is one more thing, sir.

880
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,070
Vilmer says Kendall
was involved in the drug scam.

881
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,340
Captain, l don't wanna hear this.

882
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,625
Well, actually, Kendall did try to
burn Dunbar with us, so...

883
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,818
...that usually means
someone's involved.

884
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,658
Captain Osborne, you are not
to go near Lieutenant Kendall.

885
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,928
That's an order. Understood?

886
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,806
Pike never admitted shooting West.

887
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,275
You tried to pin three
stone murders on Dunbar.

888
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,342
Why don't you ask him
about the murders...

889
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,310
...he's covered up
for his drug dealer?

890
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,477
Did it ever weigh on your
conscience or did you just--?

891
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,318
Or do you just not think about it?

892
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,892
Running out of time!
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

893
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,867
Mueller shot Pike point-blank
in cold blood.

894
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,492
l don't remember that at all.

895
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:18,162
Don't get me wrong.
Mueller was perfectly capable of murder.

896
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,902
He was the type of guy that you felt
uncomfortable going to sleep around.

897
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:28,240
Why did you pin three murders on
Dunbar? The man saved your life.

898
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:33,645
Oh, so l should cover up
for his misdeeds?

899
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,755
-What? l was just telling you the truth.
-Not according to Pete Vilmer.

900
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:43,323
Vilmer. Vilmer.

901
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,523
Vilmer, Vilmer, Vilmer.

902
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,296
Vilmer. ls that what you think
you have on me?

903
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,875
lt's his drug-peddling word against mine.
You have to do better than that.

904
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,441
You guys are on drugs.

905
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,881
-They got their story straight.
-What do you mean?

906
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:03,416
What Kendall's saying about ''the
type of guy you feel uncomfortable...

907
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:06,521
...sleeping next to''?
That's what Dunbar said about Mueller.

908
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,988
Hardy, they planned this.

909
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,756
Not bad for hostile and uncooperative.

910
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,331
-You're running out of time now!
-You and Dunbar got your story straight.

911
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,436
You two just kept bouncing us
back and forth, trying to...

912
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:25,096
...figure out the differences, killing time
till transport can whisk you away.

913
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,639
You're accessory to murder,
you understand that?

914
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,402
You're going to jail.
Right, Hardy?

915
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,741
-lf he's lucky.
-You know what? You're full of shit.

916
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,745
You are fucking full of shit.

917
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,414
What, you scared, Levi?
ls that why you're laughing?

918
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,787
You think we got nothing on you?
That doesn't matter, Levi.

919
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,519
No, it doesn't. Know why?
We'll find one of those bodies...

920
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,063
...and l'm gonna make sure it has
a bullet in it that matches your weapon.

921
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,066
l'm just gonna get your pistol,
take it to the morgue...

922
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,999
...shoot it into one of their skulls.

923
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,499
What's going on?
What's happening? Kendall?

924
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,608
Nurse!

925
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,909
Get in here, get in here!

926
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,414
What happened? Suction!
Give me suction!

927
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:15,416
-Get that tube in there!
-Hold him!

928
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,368
Captain Osborne?

929
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,966
Sir.

930
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,904
You're relieved of your duties
until further notice.

931
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,668
-Yes, sir.
-You'll be lucky if l don't put you in...

932
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,404
...for a court-martial.

933
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,975
-He was dirty, Bill.
-He's dead, Tom!

934
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,450
And don't think you're not
on my shit-list too.

935
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:50,190
We found the bunker. lt was
demolished, like they said. No bodies.

936
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,261
Come on, a hurricane like that could've
blown them three counties away.

937
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,022
What happens to Dunbar now?

938
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:00,257
ln 10 minutes he gets on a plane,
which means you're done.

939
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,371
You'll understand
if l don't walk you out.

940
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:10,009
-Strange kid.
-What?

941
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,113
Kendall.

942
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:16,012
Even while he was dying
he was making jokes about infinity.

943
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:26,923
What?

944
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,265
What?

945
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,236
Dunbar wrote this when
he asked for a Ranger.

946
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,001
There's an 8 on it.

947
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,053
l don't know.

948
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,551
Okay.

949
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,487
l'll find out by myself.

950
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,492
Stop.

951
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,997
Okay.

952
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:11,840
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?

953
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,139
Any spooks involved here?
ClA? FBl?

954
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,144
Not exactly.

955
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:21,539
-What's that mean?
-There was a group of guys down here....

956
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:27,214
There was a group of guys down here
who were way out on the hairy edge.

957
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,949
They did covert stuff and they--

958
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,459
They what?

959
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,723
They went rogue. They went renegade.

960
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,959
Dropped off the face of the earth,
disappeared into drug land...

961
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:44,936
...and with their special skills cut one hell
of a swath through the competition.

962
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:48,270
West trained some of these guys.

963
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,277
And he hated them for what they did,
and they hated him.

964
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,941
-That could be what this is about.
-Who knows about this?

965
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,779
How do l know?
They're ghosts, right? They're dead.

966
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:01,286
This could all be a story.
None of this could be true.

967
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:06,191
But the note that that kid wrote...

968
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,125
...had an 8 on it.

969
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,666
And that's what this outfit
called themselves.

970
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,836
Section 8.

971
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,973
Section 8?
You mean, like, they're crazy?

972
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:26,812
-How could you keep that from me?
-Classified.

973
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:35,618
You son of a bitch!
Mister, l've had it with you!

974
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,324
Okay, so are you happy?

975
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,805
ls that a no?

976
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:07,487
Ma'am. Need your signature
for this guy's transport.

977
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,146
Sure thing.

978
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,518
What the hell happened to you two?

979
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:15,686
None of your business.
Kendall's dead and you're going to jail.

980
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,729
ClD's here to take you to Washington.

981
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:22,926
Guess l'm on the same transport as Pike.
Hey, Julie-bird, you bitch...

982
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,433
...why don't you go on and get me
something to eat? l'm starving.

983
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:30,009
-What did you say?
-l didn't mean to call her a bitch.

984
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,579
No, no, no, before. What did you say?

985
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:38,543
What, that me and Pike were on
a transport plane going to D.C. together?

986
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,212
You mean Dunbar.

987
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:45,556
No, Pike.

988
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,525
The one that they just
hauled out of here.

989
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,726
The guy that they brought in
with Kendall on the chopper.

990
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,370
That was Dunbar.

991
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:00,363
No. That's not right.

992
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,067
What do you mean? Why not?

993
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,176
Tom...

994
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:08,078
...Ray Dunbar is black.

995
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,832
Son of a bitch did the whole thing!

996
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,202
Files don't show race.
All he had to do is switch dog tags.

997
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,470
-Where's this transport going from?
-Hangar Four.

998
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,171
Move it. Come on, go!
Go! Go! Go!

999
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,066
-Sir!
-We got company, sir.

1000
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,106
-l need to talk to your prisoner right now!
-What, captain?

1001
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,710
-l need to take him back for questioning--
-We're not finished with you yet, Pike.

1002
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,779
-Wanna bet?
-Let go!

1003
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,541
Hey! Hardy, what the fuck
are you doing?

1004
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,012
Gun!

1005
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:23,021
-Sir! We have tried to--
-Come on down, Pike, come on down!

1006
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,289
You wanna talk baseball now?
l don't think so!

1007
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,498
You don't have any bodies yet!
What are you gonna do?

1008
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,729
-You're not gonna shoot me!
-You see what happens when you lie?

1009
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,840
What do you got?!
You got nothing on me! You got--

1010
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,050
Hardy, what are you doing, man?
Stop that!

1011
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,984
-Let him go!
-Stand down!

1012
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:57,590
Tom, what the fuck are you doing?!
Stand down, goddamn it!

1013
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,774
Shut up!

1014
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:30,181
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?

1015
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,986
l told you he knows.

1016
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,288
Now, wait. Knows what?

1017
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,091
About the other operation.

1018
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,865
What other operation?

1019
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,593
The coke.

1020
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,638
They were sending pounds of it back
to the States, using military supply lines.

1021
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:50,274
Vilmer would hide it in crates of files.
Hell, he'd ship it in a corpse if he had to.

1022
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:55,406
West figured it out about a week ago.
He was gonna go to the colonel.

1023
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:00,646
Kendall and Mueller must've decided
to take him out of the equation.

1024
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:05,088
You have got to be the dumbest bunch
of sons of bitches on God's green earth.

1025
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,785
You think you can ship that shit
right under my nose?

1026
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,992
Mueller, what are you doing?!

1027
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,665
Get his weapon.

1028
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,629
Castro, wait!

1029
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,730
Castro!

1030
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,943
-Put it down.
-Fuck you, let him go!

1031
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,636
This ain't some drive-by! You think
you can kill a man face to face?

1032
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,248
-Put it down, Pike!
-He'll fucking shoot you!

1033
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,978
l am your objective, right? You fire, l fire.
You're down to four. Well, three.

1034
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:36,352
You can't trust him. Maybe l'll take one
or two more of you before you take me.

1035
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:41,121
The odds are in your favor that at least
two of you walk out of here alive.

1036
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,494
Conversely, there's absolutely no way l
should be able to walk out of this bunker.

1037
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,842
This is bullshit! l'll do it!

1038
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:11,252
So pretty.

1039
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,661
So dead.

1040
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:40,384
Kendall, what are you doing? Kendall!

1041
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:46,822
What, you don't believe me?

1042
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:56,128
Medical crate 8469846 in
Shipping D awaiting transfer.

1043
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,431
See for yourself.

1044
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,414
Vilmer and whoever his partner was
must have been making millions.

1045
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,817
Where did the coke come from?

1046
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,252
Fuck if l know.
l mean, this is Panama.

1047
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,689
Throw a rock in any direction,
you'll hit three cartels.

1048
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:22,896
About an hour later,
Kendall and l found Dunbar.

1049
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:45,246
Put it down! Put it down, son.

1050
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:49,881
-l just wanna go!
-Understandable. Now, put it down.

1051
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,152
-Look, l never meant to hurt anybody!
-Let's keep it that way!

1052
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,229
You surrender, l take you in.

1053
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,728
l know it sounds like a shitty deal,
but you get to live.

1054
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,427
l'll go my way, and you go yours, okay?

1055
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:08,804
Not gonna happen! You either surrender
or we die where we stand.

1056
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,172
-So, what's it gonna be?
-Sarge!

1057
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:28,688
l knew if sarge died they'd blame me.
That's why l took Dunbar's dog tags.

1058
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,226
Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!

1059
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:39,362
Mueller didn't die after all.
Came after us with a vengeance.

1060
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,339
You know the rest.

1061
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,345
How'd you get Kendall to go along
with switching Dunbar's dog tags?

1062
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:51,009
l gave him a choice. Either go along
or l drop a dime on his drug scam.

1063
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,446
How about the bodies?

1064
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:59,258
That hurricane almost lifted
me off the ground.

1065
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,189
But they're out there.

1066
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,866
lt's there, just like you said.

1067
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,507
So you'll testify to all of this?

1068
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,873
l don't think you're gonna get any deals.

1069
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,972
l don't want any deals.

1070
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,377
l'll take him now, if you don't mind.

1071
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,760
We should've died out there
with the others.

1072
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,260
Did you get what you wanted?

1073
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,797
Not even close.

1074
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:01,882
Just that one thing
that l wanted to ask you about.

1075
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,685
-Say when.
-Yeah, this is Hardy.

1076
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,657
Oh, really?

1077
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,054
Okay. Thank you.

1078
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:14,733
The kid said that West waited till the
end of the week to tell the colonel.

1079
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:19,533
Now, why would he wait until
the end of the week to tell you?

1080
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,144
l mean, that doesn't sound
like the West that we knew.

1081
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,311
You think the kid was lying?

1082
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:31,052
No. l don't.

1083
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,254
-l think you are.
-What?

1084
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:38,017
l do. l think you're lying. l do.

1085
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,490
l think that....

1086
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,821
-l think that West came to you--
-And?

1087
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,123
And you told Mueller
and Kendall to kill him.

1088
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:50,133
Then what did l do,
go and poison Kendall?

1089
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,602
-Well, who said he was poisoned?
-What?

1090
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:57,039
l just found out. The hospital
found out three minutes ago.

1091
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:01,615
-l was on the phone with the pathologist.
-Golly, Tom, the kid was puking blood...

1092
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,546
...all over the hospital.

1093
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:06,744
You know, gunshot and childbirth
just didn't seem to fit...

1094
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,619
...so l took a wild-ass fucking guess.

1095
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,929
Was that really the pathologist?

1096
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,293
No, that was my message service.

1097
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:22,868
Even if it was, does that prove anything?

1098
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:26,235
You keep forgetting...

1099
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,670
...l don't have to.

1100
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:32,210
-What?
-l don't have to prove anything...

1101
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,942
-...because it's not my job.
-l mean, golly, Tom....

1102
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,687
l just have to get you
to the real guys.

1103
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,315
One-third.

1104
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:52,863
Come on, Tom.

1105
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,502
You've never met a bribe you didn't like.

1106
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,834
Oh, l see. l see.

1107
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:03,637
You called me so in case
l stumbled upon something...

1108
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,244
...you'd just buy me off.

1109
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,739
Crossed my mind.

1110
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,652
Like l said, they were never
gonna make me a general anyway.

1111
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,847
This is about quality of life.

1112
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,728
Tom, you've had a hell of a run of
bad luck. Bounced out of the Army...

1113
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:24,854
...hanging by a thread at the DEA. You're
gonna wind up a fucking process server.

1114
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:29,595
lf you lose enough times,
what you are is a loser.

1115
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,001
Why don't you cut yourself a break,
for chrissake? Forty percent.

1116
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,506
Once l'm up and running again.

1117
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,674
Up and running again?

1118
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,780
This is just a hiccup.

1119
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:44,544
l can get another three, four months
before they close the place down.

1120
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,698
l'll have to think about that.

1121
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:20,787
And then l saw the gun
and then he drew it...

1122
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,652
...so l had no choice but to fire.

1123
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:27,590
How many rounds did you fire, captain?

1124
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,063
-Two. Three, maybe.
-Okay.

1125
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,293
All right, ma'am. Thank you.

1126
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,081
Thanks.

1127
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,416
Now what?

1128
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:56,055
l'm gonna go home and get drunk
and try to forget all of this.

1129
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,419
Well, in that case...

1130
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,186
...there you go.

1131
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:04,461
Your phone number?

1132
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:08,067
Yeah, l thought maybe later
l'd slip by and we'd do the old--

1133
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:14,804
lt's just in case you need me
to testify about the shooting.

1134
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,336
But you don't worry,
they'll clear you on that.

1135
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,640
He was your friend.

1136
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,942
Yeah, but he was
a lot of other things too.

1137
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,110
Besides, my friends don't
betray their country.

1138
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:37,197
Tuesday?

1139
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:39,897
Tuesday, pick me up at 7?

1140
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:44,502
Tuesday at 7. You're one of
the good ones, Osborne.

1141
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:46,970
l don't want you to worry about
what happened.

1142
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,134
All we gotta do is tell the story right.

1143
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,386
All we gotta do is tell the story right.

1144
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:18,237
And we can be the men that
took down our sergeant's killers.

1145
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:21,864
All we gotta do is tell the story....

1146
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:25,068
-Tell the story right.
-Tell the story right.

1147
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:38,111
--friends in low places.

1148
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:42,585
--the murders he's covered up
for his drug dealer?

1149
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,321
--wasn't even his real name.

1150
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,355
Pike wasn't even his real--

1151
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:52,124
They're dead, right? They're ghosts.

1152
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,109
West trained some of these guys.
And they hated him.

1153
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:07,610
l wanted him dead--
l wanted him dead--

1154
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,850
l am your objective, right?

1155
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:25,415
Osborne?

1156
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:29,251
lf you don't like the music, just say so.

1157
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:34,922
Don't move. Put your hands
on the table. Now.

1158
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:36,854
Who are they?

1159
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:41,695
They are my colleagues. And they're
discussing breakfast recipes.

1160
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,896
-You knew about the coke.
-Yes, l did.

1161
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,132
You knew about Vilmer.

1162
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,607
You knew about Styles.

1163
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:56,578
ln fact, they work for you,
because you're Section 8.

1164
01:30:56,751 --> 01:31:00,687
You planned all this.
And you killed West.

1165
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,885
Give me one good reason why l should
not fucking blow your head off right now.

1166
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,125
Tom?

1167
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:14,158
Why did this young woman have
a weapon pointed at your head?

1168
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:17,826
This is Captain Osborne,
and she has had a long day.

1169
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,633
Oh, l'll bet it was something you said.

1170
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,242
She thinks l killed you.

1171
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,578
He didn't.

1172
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,407
l thought you hated each other.

1173
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:31,415
l'm not particularly fond of him, and he is
sort of a jerk, but what can you do?

1174
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,951
-Will you cut me some slack?
-Slack?

1175
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:36,112
Did he say ''slack''?

1176
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,817
Captain. Sit, it's safe.
You wanna talk about slack?

1177
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,625
You take a simple find-out-
who's-working-for-who operation...

1178
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:47,495
...next thing l know, there's corpses
flopping around like it's raining fish.

1179
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,761
-Yeah, but l rescued your ass.
-Rescued my--?

1180
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:52,633
-Did my ass need rescuing?
-Don't put me in this.

1181
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,502
You stumble upon a drug operation...

1182
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,768
...in the middle of 10,000
heavily armed men...

1183
01:31:56,944 --> 01:31:58,912
...and you didn't have to be pulled out?

1184
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:02,571
See now, that's different.
l was going to retire early anyway.

1185
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:07,015
So you found out about the coke
and you told Styles?

1186
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,553
Yeah, who did nothing.

1187
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:11,452
Except order Kendall
and Mueller to kill you.

1188
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,489
And you figured that they
were gonna do it in the jungle.

1189
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,960
That's why l called this genius.

1190
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:21,225
Breakfast is ready! Do you remember
the triplets? Raul's daughters?

1191
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:24,371
-This is hotter.
-This might eat me!

1192
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,407
Captain.

1193
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:30,371
Dunbar.
Or is it Pike?

1194
01:32:30,745 --> 01:32:33,305
-Oh, actually it's neither, ma'am.
-Right.

1195
01:32:34,348 --> 01:32:38,717
-So you're not Nunez.
-No, ma'am. l'm afraid l'm not.

1196
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:43,084
Right. Because none of y'all
exist. You're all dead.

1197
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:47,785
Well, you could refer to it as
bureaucratic absence of presence.

1198
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:50,658
l mean, we're here.
But we're not here.

1199
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:55,291
Now, he would be dead in the ground
if you hadn't saved his ass. l mean dead.

1200
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:56,936
You are on it today!

1201
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:58,833
What are you laughing at?

1202
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:01,497
The idea that you
just transferred into his unit.

1203
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:04,406
Negative. l just transferred
to Arlington Cemetery.

1204
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,173
You keep talking shit
and you're liable to make roll call.

1205
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:12,380
-So you're all Section 8?
-l told you she was smart.

1206
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:15,613
No, you said she was....
What did he say she was?

1207
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,724
-Hot.
-Hot.

1208
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,753
Yes, ma'am. We're officially Section 8.

1209
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,589
And what about the story
about you guys being all...

1210
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:27,791
-...renegade drug dealers and stuff?
-More like ragamuffins.

1211
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:30,836
That's been our unit's cover story
since the beginning, ma'am.

1212
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:34,998
And it's a story that scares
the frijoles out of the Colombians.

1213
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:40,244
Okay, so now that l know all this,
what happens?

1214
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:44,544
l get a needle in my arm and wake up
tomorrow morning with no memory?

1215
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:47,481
lsn't that what you guys do?

1216
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:51,385
We actually thought you handled
yourself quite well in this situation.

1217
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,919
We were gonna offer you a job.

1218
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:00,123
Did she tell you the story
about the carnival last night?

1219
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:02,234
-Oh, don't start.
-Shit.

1220
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:05,269
-What do you want to know?
-Miss Festival Party Lady.

1221
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:06,599
What do you wanna know?

1222
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:09,334
Don't act like you weren't
all over this man.

1223
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,808
Yeah, tell him the truth.

1224
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:17,577
So, what are you gonna do?

1225
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,716
l think l need a beer.

1226
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,524
Here you go, colonel.

1227
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,324
Colonel?
