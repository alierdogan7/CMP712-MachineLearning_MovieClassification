Like car alarms
and babies crying.

172
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,314
And inators blowing up.
(GRUNTS)

173
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,918
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! This
time I've got an eyewitness!

174
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,187
Go on, go on.
Tell my mom everything!

175
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,924
Well, when the empty
window feels like talking,

176
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,992
you let me know.

177
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,262
There it is.
I dropped my penny.

178
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,063
Did you say
something, dear?

179
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,598
MONTY: How was your meal, Dad?

180
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,001
Absolutely delicious.

181
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,035
What a great
new place.

182
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,004
I know, right?
Carl found it.

183
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,139
Well, then. Let me
just say, thank you,

184
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,307
to the chef.

185
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,342
Thank you, for
that delicious meal.

186
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,078
You're most welcome.
So glad you enjoyed it.

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,282
Dad, isn't there something you
wanted to say to Carl, as well.

188
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,951
Of course.
What was I thinking?

189
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,453
Don't be rude, Carl.
Thank the chef.

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,319
Thank you.

191
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,958
I like this table. And to show my
gratitude, dessert is on the house.

192
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,594
Now, if you'll excuse me. I must
go and fire a member of staff.

193
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,063
Luchenzo, come here!

194
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,567
There, you see? A little
gratitude goes a long way.

195
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,602
Pay attention, Carl.
You could learn something.

196
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,170
Really learn
something from you...

197
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,172
Just chill out.
I got another idea.

199

Check you out,

201
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,985
Well, this is awkward.

202
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,987
Seriously,
you're gonna...

203
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,224
(GRUNTS) Well, I'm so glad to
have this helipad installed.

204
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,159
Mmm.

206
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,000
Upsy-daisy.

207
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,669
No really. I swear, the old
lady is there in the window

208
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,770
right now. I swear!

209
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,106
No need to swear.
I'm coming.

210
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,174
There she is!

211
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,676
Funny, Candace, I could
swear your old lady

212
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,111
looks just like
a houseplant.

213
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:33,811
What?

214
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,481

thirsty, weren't you?

Oh, wow.

217
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,324
Aw, man, we're not
getting anywhere.

218
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,592
How about we
take a time out?

219

(HISSING)

220
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,165
Wait. Your hat has a
pressure release valve?

221
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,702
Wow! So that's what the inside
of a platypus smells like.

222
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,305
I could have gone my whole
life without knowing that.

223
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,540
Hey!

224
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,508
Aw, man! Another
inator bites the dust.

225
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,478
Now I'm stuck listening to Jerky
MacIrritating across the street, now.

226
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,682
(WHISTLES) Shh.

227
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,518
What's that? Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll stop.

228
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,420
I didn't realize I
was disturbing you.

229
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,621
Cheery-bye.

230
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,124
Huh. I guess I might
have overthought

231
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,759
that solution
just a little bit.

232
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:25,096

CARL: This had better work.

237
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,172
Don't worry, Carl. Once
you save my dad's life,

238
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,575
there's no way even he could
avoid thanking you for it.

239
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,243
I hope for your
sake you're right.

240
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,079
Y'know, it's funny
how no one's noticed

241
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,449
a grand piano dangling
precariously over our table.

242
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,785
Well, I also tied up a
couple of violins over there

243
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,785
so it would seem
like a theme.

244
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,088
All right, listen.
So when my dad returns,

245
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,723
I'll excuse myself
and cut the rope

246
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,759
and you push my dad out of the way
of the falling piano. Got it?

247
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,628
Well, let's get to
that dessert menu.

248
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,263
Excuse me, Dad.
It's my turn.

249
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,864
I'll be right back.
You guys start.

250
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,567
Sure, sure. Thank you
for not making us wait.

251
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,869
(CHUCKLES) That bathroom
attendant was lovely.

252
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,172
He gave me mints
and some floss.

253
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,373
I just couldn't
thank him enough.

254
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,741
(GASPS) Watch out, sir!

255
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,411
Dad! Carl!
Are you all right?

256
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,180
Oh, I'm fine.

257
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,549
I'm all right too, sir.

258
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:21,152
Wow, Carl. You saved
my dad's life.

259
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,189
Yes. It's a shame he
couldn't save the table too.

260
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,558
Let's go find the host. No, wait.
What? Seriously?

261
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,859
What?
Dad.

262
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,694
Aren't you going
to thank him?

263
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,464
Oh, well, I didn't
realize, I hadn't.

264
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,232
Thank you for pointing
that out to me, Monty.

265
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,567
Dad!

266
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,370
Oh, uh, yes, right.
Thank you, Carl.

267
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,607
Oh, well, more
dessert for us.

268
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,342
No, it's different
this time!

269
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,144
She promised to come
down and meet us.

270
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,613
Right. My expectations have
been completely reversed.

271
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,815
No! You'll see. She'll
explain everything.

272
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,916

Danville's biggest pyramid scheme.

Pyramid scheme?

selling these all over town.

This is for the book club,
Jeremy and I joined.

304
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:12,706
We all read the same book, and then
get together and discuss over tea.

305
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,974
Sounds sophisticated.

306
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,442
Yeah, the tea
was my idea.

307
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,411
This week we're
reading, <i>The Iliad.</i>

308
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,545
That's a great book!

309
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,447
It's all about
the Trojan War!

You read this?

311
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,984
You're not the only one
with a book club, you know.

312
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,786
I like your idea
about the tea, though.

00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,786
Ferb, make
a note of that.

314
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,890
The war started because Paris
fell in love with Helen of Troy.

315
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,690
It's so romantic.

316
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:34,962
Yeah, and Helen could launch a
thousand ships with her face!

was Achilles,

00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,601

Isn't there something
about a wooden horse?

323
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,609
Yeah, the Greek army built
a huge wooden horse

324
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,911
and left it outside
the gates of Troy.

325
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:53,280
<i>The Trojans thought that</i>
<i>the Greeks had given up</i>

326
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,549
<i>and that the horse was</i>
<i>some sort of tribute to them.</i>

327
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:56,549
So, they wheeled
it inside the gates.

328
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:00,420
Hey. How did they get that
big horse in that tiny door?

329
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:02,890

imaging a larger door.

Oh, yeah.
That's better.

332
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,596
Then late at night, the Greeks climbed
out of the horse, opened the gates...

00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,746
If I were Achilles, I could
have taken the city of Troy

342
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,548
like in one afternoon.

343
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,683
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today!

344
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,819
We're gonna finally
recreate the Trojan War.

345
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,354
I'll be Paris because my
name starts with a "P."

346
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,789
And I'll be
Helen because

347
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,692
uh, my name
starts with "I"

348
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,928
which is right
after "H."

349
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,063
And I'll be the
great Achilles!

350
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,065
And I'll be all wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.

351
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,700

Cut it out!

352
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,635
And you can be Hector.
Now get over there.

353
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:49,770
I'm taking Ferb.

00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,972

BUFORD: No!

355
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,607

I would have kept Baljeet.

In case you are wondering, the word you
are looking for is "impenetrable."

382
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:15,522
Actually, the word I was
looking for is "decimate."

383
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,657
Fair enough.

384
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,725
Yeah, we're gonna need
a bigger army.

385
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,827

But I got you!

394
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:41,882
You see, I was just doing a little
inventory and reorganization

395
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:45,619
of all the stuff that I've
collected over the last 40 years.

396
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:49,222
Yeah, I know it's gotten
a little out of hand.

397
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:52,492
I kinda let it go and Norm's
been in Maui for, like, a month.

398
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,927
So I made
the De-clutterinator.

399
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,996
I was actually gonna
shoot myself with it,

400
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,966
which would make me want to
unclutter everything, and,

401
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,134
uh, then I lost it,
'cause, you know, it's...

402
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,703
It's really cluttered
in here.

403
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,571
So then I hired a nice
young lady named Doreen

404
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:07,741
to help me get organized, and, well, I
think she may have gotten lost, too.

405
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,543
I haven't seen her in days.

406
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,178
Doreen, are you out there?

407
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,847
DOREEN: So thirsty.

408
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,016
I never approved overtime!

00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:18,251
DOREEN: Food.

410
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:21,822
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to my search for Doreen.

411
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:25,025
Maybe I'll get lucky and find
the De-clutterinator, too.

412
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,961
Hey, Doreen! Marco!

509
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,962
Uh-oh. Looks like
Ferb's goin' off book.

510
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:23,129
Everyone to
the chariots!

511
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:24,998
Hang on!

512
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,040
Whoa-ho! Laser-proof.
Nice touch, Ferb.

513
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,110
(YELLING)

514
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,512
This is really cool.

515
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,515
Book club starts
in 10 minutes.

516
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,353
I have an idea! Throw that
rope to the other chariot!

517
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,256
Well, that
can't be good.

518
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:54,260
I guess they knew a T. rex's
weakness is also its Achilles' heel.

519
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,528
(SCREAMING)

520
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,534
That was awesome!

521
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:02,568
Who won?

522
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,537
This time I think
it was a draw.

523
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,506
Come on, let's go tell
Candace how it ends.

524
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:08,074
Yeah, and maybe we
can pick up some

525
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:09,809
Greek frozen
yogurt on the way.

526
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,246
Doreen, come on,
quit kidding around.

527
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,848
(GASPS)
Perry the Platypus?

528
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,283
You've found the
De-clutterinator!

529
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:17,550
Excellent,
okay, shoot me.

530
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,486
Shoot me and I'll clean
this whole place up.

531
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,286
Oh wait.
(STAMMERS) What?

532
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:23,322
Oh, it's not plugged in.
Hold on one sec.

533
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,225
My, word! What a mess.

534
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,427
Okay, here's an open socket.

535
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:29,396
That doesn't sound good.

536
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,497
(EXPLOSION)

537
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,803
Oof, I say, I feel the
sudden urge to declutter.

538
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,975
Well, you have to admit it
did get rid of the clutter.

539
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,209
There you are.

540
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,844
Doreen!
What's happening?

541
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,914
My invoice. You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

542
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,949
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

543
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:53,286
And there goes
the last of it!

544
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,458
Lawrence, what are
you doing out here?

545
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,593
Oh, you know, just
tidying up a little.

546
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,395
Well, the yard
looks great!

547
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:03,395
Come on in the kitchen.

548
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,298
I've got a plate of cake
that needs cleaning up.

549
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,566
I'm your man.

550
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,205
Now that we're all here.
Who wants to go first.

551
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,974
Ooh, me! In general I thought
the Greeks' decoy platypus

552
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:17,977
was a brilliant idea until it
got smashed by the T. rex!

553
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,113
Its use of lasers to
destroy the city of Troy

554
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:23,516
really seemed unbeatable until Paris
flew down in his laser chariot.

555
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,119
The flying chariots were
all, pew, pew, pew, pew!

556
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:27,354
Ga, ga, ga, ga!

557
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,122
And... (IMITATES
BOMBS FALLING) Cool!

558
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:30,924
<i>The Iliad </i> is truly an epic!

559
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:33,493
Candace, you didn't
read the book, did you?

560
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm so busted.

561
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,730
Oh, that's okay. I don't
think anyone did.

562
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:38,865
I just come to book
club for the tea.
