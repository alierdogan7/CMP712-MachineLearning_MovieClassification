1
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,176
I'm late

2
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,077
It's nice of you to rush back

3
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,682
Where is everybody?

4
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,290
They've all gone to the funeral

5
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,683
Take along an umbrella

6
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,697
Teacher!

7
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,207
Chen!

8
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,971
Teacher's beyond hearing

9
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,180
Chen!

10
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,017
What's the matter with you?

11
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,493
Take him back for a rest

12
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,611
Have some porridge!

13
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,054
You haven't eaten in two days

14
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,696
Teacher's dead
I know how you feel

15
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,963
But it hurts me

16
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,159
to see you like this

17
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,467
Please, eat something

18
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,242
He still refused to eat?

19
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,211
Talk to him

20
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,113
Why won't you eat?

21
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,021
We all feel sad ever his death

22
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,823
But we must live on

23
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,428
Can ulcers kill a man?

24
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,338
He had ulcers but died of pneumonia

25
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,175
Can that kill a man?

26
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,921
How did he die?

27
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,884
The doctor said

28
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,288
he died of pneumonia

29
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,894
I don't believe it

30
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,198
He was in perfect health
How did he die?

31
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,859
Something must have happened

32
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:24,442
Calm yourself

33
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,675
We've all been thinking about it

34
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,804
But we mustn't be rash

35
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,281
We are investigation quietly

36
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,818
I must find out the truth

37
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,249
of course

38
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,914
It's our duty too

39
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,787
Many people will come

40
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,360
to pay homage tomorrow

41
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,863
You must be calm
Get some rest

42
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,967
Ho Yuan-chia was a great instructor

43
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,936
He was a champion of the weak

44
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,599
Everyone knows that

45
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,509
I've known him for 30 years

46
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,048
I admire him

47
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,985
for founding Ching Wu School

48
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,760
He traveling all over the country

49
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:23,202
Using up all his money and energy

50
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,803
He even sacrificed his life

51
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,032
I remember what he used to say

52
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,645
His purpose in founding Ching Wu School

53
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:38,944
was to strengthen the mind and body

54
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,951
not to aim at winning over others

55
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,488
He was against conflict among schools

56
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:51,619
He hoped all of us
would be of one heart

57
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,424
to be strong and love the country

58
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,369
We must remember

59
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,405
his words

60
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:07,509
and develop martial arts accordingly

61
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,906
that every Chinese

62
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,613
will be strong

63
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:17,119
to serve the community and the country

64
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,289
as well as the future generation

65
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,128
He died soon

66
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,361
after Ching Wu School began

67
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,329
He contributed so much

68
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,438
to martial arts

69
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,445
We have lost a great man

70
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,543
our respects to Master Ho!

71
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,915
Let us have 3 minutes' silence

72
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,989
Please sign your name

73
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,025
We're just in time

74
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,091
You're...?

75
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,766
I'm interpreter for Hungkiu School's

76
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,928
Mr. Hu

77
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,473
I've brought something for you

78
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,587
What is it?

79
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,061
Chief Ling Mu Kuan sent me

80
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,337
Sick Man of East Asia?

81
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,937
What do you mean by that?

82
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,512
It's very simple

83
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,343
We know you're training here

84
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,782
The name is a gift from our master

85
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,524
Are you a Chinese?

86
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,456
Yes, but I'm different from you

87
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,934
Calm down
I won't come if I'm afraid

88
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,131
I know you are all here

89
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,069
I come to challenge you

90
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,506
Well? Who'll step out?

91
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,741
Chia Chi

92
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,993
Step back!

93
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,469
My friends here are eager for a dual

94
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,370
Who will satisfy them?

95
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,243
You have trained hard

96
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,185
but now you dare not speak out

97
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,427
What's happened to your courage?

98
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:31,706
Hold it. You're...?

99
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,581
I'm Hu, the interpreter

100
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,915
our teacher told us

101
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,689
to train for physical fitness

102
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,489
but not for fights

103
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,459
our school won't fight you

104
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,466
Then you're conceding defeat

105
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,537
If anyone can defeat me,

106
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,339
I'll eat those words

107
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,580
Listen to my Japanese friends

108
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:10,586
They've made a bet

109
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,820
Well? Anyone care to try?

110
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,524
If the Ching Wu people won't fight

111
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,926
how about the other schools?

112
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:24,900
Well? You want to; K

113
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,572
Don't be mad, kid

114
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:33,235
You're all useless sick man of Asia

115
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:39,908
Chen, hold yourself

116
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:48,887
Why won't you speak up?

117
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,855
You can all attack together

118
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,231
We shall always oblige

119
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,343
It's too much, too much!

120
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,387
Why won't you let us fight?

121
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,685
I wanted to fight too

122
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,791
But teacher told us not to get in trouble

123
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,233
Whom do you want?

124
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,505
Your chief, Hiroshi Suzuki

125
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,049
He's not here
What is it?

126
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,615
I have something to return to him

127
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,109
You really get the nerve

128
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,612
I'm the worst of Ching Wu students

129
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,491
I want to try your Japanese martial arts

130
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,107
You must be tried of living!

131
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,640
Let's me teach you something

132
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:32,280
Will fight alone or in group?

133
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,517
Just myself is enough

134
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,537
I have it

135
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:21,903
Surround him

136
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,839
Hold it!

137
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:30,208
We Chinese aren't sick man

138
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,789
Eat

139
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,438
You eat paper this time

140
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,005
Next time will be glasses

141
00:23:55,267 --> 00:24:01,399
What is it! Are you mad!

142
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,640
Here we are. Pull over

143
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:37,174
Ching Wu people dared come to our gate!

144
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,248
What's his name?

145
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,085
I know him, Master

146
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,058
He's Chen, Ho's favorite

147
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,031
Let me ask you this

148
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,565
Could we <i>Bushido</i> people

149
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,635
take it lying down?

150
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:07,996
As a master of Japanese martial arts

151
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,162
we won't be bullied easily

152
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,239
Right

153
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,971
Bushido is the world's best

154
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,815
Now tell me what to do

155
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,006
We must take revenge!

156
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,588
Right, revenge!

157
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:31,828
Smash up the Ching Wu School

158
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,225
Don't come back if you fail

159
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,658
What is it?

160
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,426
Go in and take a look

161
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,968
No

162
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,912
Where's the dog?

163
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,379
It belongs to a foreigner

164
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,695
Come here!

165
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,509
Don't you want to get in?

166
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,371
Come on

167
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,741
Act like a dog and I'll get you in

168
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,987
Hurry, the police are coming!

169
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,395
What do you want?

170
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,242
You attacked without warning

171
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,478
What's the purpose?

172
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,248
Why all this rough stuff?

173
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,492
Take that down

174
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,100
Don't fight, stop fighting

175
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,718
Don't insult our teacher

176
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,638
Stop!

177
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:32,383
Right, let's go!

178
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:39,622
That's only a little warning

179
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,357
Hand over Chen three days

180
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,568
or we'll have you closed down

181
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,771
and you'll all be arrested

182
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,181
Brother!

183
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,719
Come and help

184
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:22,803
Teacher, if you had been alive

185
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,877
We wouldn't have been bullied like this

186
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,283
He wants us to hand over Chen

187
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,483
His rashness got us into trouble

188
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,719
Don't blame him

189
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,091
Don't blame it on him

190
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,361
He's back

191
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:56,837
Salute

192
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,308
You got us into trouble

193
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,115
Where have you been all day?

194
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,979
Did you go to Hungkiu School?

195
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,050
You want to be a hero

196
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,192
Look what happened to us

197
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,385
Why didn't you tell us?

198
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,761
Listen

199
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,597
We build our body

200
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,671
and love our country?

201
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,968
But not fight and make trouble

202
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,309
Then why didn't you tell us?

203
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,574
Many Japanese came

204
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,081
and beat us up

205
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,980
They asked us to hand
you over in three days

206
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,484
What shall we do?

207
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,390
Let him finish what he started

208
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,354
How can you say that?

209
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,493
What then?

210
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,059
Wait to be closed down?

211
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:51,991
Not only that

212
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,790
We'll all be arrested

213
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,456
Think!

214
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,965
We must not deliver him to them

215
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,331
and we must protect all of us too

216
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,333
We can't surrender him

217
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,243
or he'll be killed for sure

218
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,980
There's only one way
Leave Shanghai

219
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,752
Right
You must leave Shanghai

220
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,080
Not me

221
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,381
Why not?

222
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,023
I don't want to get
you into trouble

223
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,956
We all understand

224
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:28,155
You must think for yourself too

225
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,157
I'm not leaving

226
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,859
You'd better leave

227
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:33,969
If they can't find you

228
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,005
despite Japanese influence

229
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,338
They can't do anything without proof

230
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,936
I didn't mean
what I just said

231
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,240
We're brothers

232
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,713
I can't let you die

233
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,872
You don't want to leave now

234
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,033
Do you think staying is a brave thing?

235
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,072
None of us is afraid to trouble

236
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,805
Why don't you listen to our advise?

237
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,220
Go

238
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,855
We won't blame you

239
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,588
Go, go

240
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,350
We won't blame you

241
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,328
Have you forgotten

242
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,162
What teacher always said?

243
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,036
You know the principle of our school

244
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,540
His death increases our burden

245
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,942
Think of the school if not yourself

246
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,511
Why sacrifice needlessly

247
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,081
As you elder

248
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,447
I order you to go

249
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,424
Buy him a train ticket for tomorrow

250
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,238
It's late, you'd better sleep

251
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,070
Is everything packed?

252
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,646
Yes

253
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,051
I came back to marry you

254
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,186
but look what's happened

255
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,021
I don't care much for ceremony

256
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,635
We can return to Shanghai some other day

257
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,532
We can have great fun then

258
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,769
Friends suffer because of me

259
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,541
Nobody is blaming you

260
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:33,445
It's the first train
Go to sleep

261
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:40,356
I must stay with Teacher tonight

262
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,105
You go to sleep first

263
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,437
Did anyone see you?

264
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,104
No. They're all asleep

265
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:41,974
Got it?

266
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,871
Yes. Mr. Wu told us to get away

267
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,615
If they found out Ho died of this

268
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,616
We'd be in deep trouble

269
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,521
Why does Mr. Wu want us to leave?

270
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,155
He said the job's done

271
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,386
There's no point tarrying

272
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,924
What should we do?

273
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,796
You're returning home tomorrow

274
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,994
I'll resign

275
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,833
And we'll go together

276
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,007
You're Japanese?

277
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,145
Yes

278
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,380
I came to kill Ho Yuan-chia

279
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,455
How could you
say such words?

280
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,457
Why not?
I'm not afraid of your Fist of Fury

281
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,158
You're Ho's favorite pupil

282
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,456
I must test your mettle

283
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:37,319
Feng, come out here

284
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,660
Why did you kill Teacher?

285
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,857
Why did you kill Teacher?

286
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,131
Why did you kill Teacher?

287
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,706
Teacher was killed by
poison in the biscuit

288
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,941
I'll all find out the murderer
and make revenge

289
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,017
Captain! Captain!

290
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,232
Big Brother

291
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:31,775
Where is Big Brother?

292
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,541
What's it?

293
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,302
What's going go? Where is Big Brother?

294
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,180
Two of them...

295
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,789
Hung on a pole

296
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,825
I saw it myself
They're out there

297
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:51,893
What is it?

298
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,456
I just bought my train ticket

299
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,929
I saw two men hung on a lamppost

300
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,898
They are Feng and cook Tien

301
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,630
Are you sure?

302
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,274
Yes

303
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,137
Feng and the cook

304
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,300
There's absolutely no mistake

305
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,278
Let's go and have a look

306
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,918
What is it?

307
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:20,151
Feng and Tien are in trouble

308
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,210
It is Feng!

309
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,057
Let's go back and discuss things

310
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,601
Get transportation

311
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,734
The two men; s faces

312
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,534
were all cut up

313
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,501
Who could it be?

314
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,244
Will our Ching Wu
School be involved?

315
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,378
No

316
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,040
Since we don't know who did it

317
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,942
Not really

318
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,145
But they belonged to the school

319
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,855
So what?

320
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,455
We didn't kill them

321
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,855
Here's International Settlement
I see troubles

322
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,227
We must find the killer

323
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,331
Chen did it

324
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,601
Chen?

325
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:44,672
Who else?

326
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,776
He left a note for me, saying

327
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,942
Teacher died of poisoning

328
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,907
I wonder where he could have gone

329
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,749
Hiding doesn't help

330
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,351
He always acts as he pleases

331
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,820
Why didn't he tell us?

332
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,622
We must find him

333
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,795
How? Shanghai is so big

334
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,665
He does not know Shanghai well

335
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,836
organize a search!

336
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,073
We must find him out

337
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:23,045
We'll settle this when he returns

338
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,366
Who's there?

339
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,100
It's me!

340
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,519
I thought you'd be here

341
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,924
Hiding is useless

342
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,230
Come an discuss it

343
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:22,729
I won't

344
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,795
Nobody knows about your part yet

345
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,535
Why hide and suffer?

346
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,773
Let's go back and find a way

347
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:46,121
I'm not hiding
I don't want you involved

348
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,087
What are you going to do then?

349
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,856
I've made my plans

350
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,068
What are you going to do then?

351
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,936
Wort you tell even me?

352
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,396
We grew up together

353
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,469
We; ve confided to each other

354
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,101
Why have you changed?

355
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,163
I haven't changed

356
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,978
Then why won't you tell me?

357
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,882
You must know how concerned I am

358
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,391
I love you as I used to

359
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:05,959
I believe you

360
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,000
Then don't ask questions

361
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,822
Remember the many plans we had

362
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,158
I do

363
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,496
We hoped to continue

364
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,168
Teacher's cause

365
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,733
and to have a happy family

366
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:52,172
Two children, a boy and a girl

367
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,581
Everyday you'd teach boxing

368
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,683
and I'd do the housework

369
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,049
I'd come and fetch you

370
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,819
and bring the kids
home from school

371
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,393
Can such a dream come true?

372
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,233
I hope so

373
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,971
If you haven't changed,

374
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,207
this may happen

375
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,011
You mustn't think that way

376
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,775
Do you really love me so much?

377
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:31,116
Next to Teacher,
you mean most to me

378
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,257
Really?

379
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,622
Will you tell me your plans now?

380
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,801
Why won't you speak?

381
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:06,605
Trust me
I'll take you away

382
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,875
Where to?

383
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,822
A place where our dream

384
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,528
will come true

385
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,470
Do you know any Hu?

386
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,109
Hu?

387
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,478
He's connected
with Teacher's death

388
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,041
Wasn't that interpreter

389
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,551
named Hu?

390
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:45,913
Could he be the one?

391
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,501
Something terrible has happened!

392
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,474
Come in

393
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,024
What is it?

394
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,729
Look at the papers
Mr. Yoshida's brother

395
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,265
and Feng are dead,
they're strung up

396
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,107
I know. Sit down

397
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,713
My brother became
Ching Wu School's cook

398
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,477
to find about the Fist of Fury

399
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,182
Now he's been killed

400
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,618
You must avenge him, Master

401
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,785
of course. They killed him

402
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,461
We'll kill them all!

403
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,121
I'll assemble the men

404
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,100
Wait! If we do that

405
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,262
It's connect us to Ho's death

406
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,431
What do you propose to us?

407
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,169
I have an idea

408
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,369
Let's hear it

409
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:20,979
We'll use pressure on the police

410
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,420
to force them
to hand over Chen

411
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,718
or close the school

412
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,361
and arrest everyone

413
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,125
Chinese are very loyalty

414
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,163
Chen won't let that happen

415
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,632
He'll surrender himself

416
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,901
When we have Chen

417
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,303
We can do whatever
we want with him

418
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,308
He'll be helpless

419
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,538
How does it sound to you?

420
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,283
You're Japan's best friend

421
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:01,485
I've always been
loyal to the Empire

422
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,650
I do my best until I die

423
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,625
Go ahead with it immediately

424
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,636
In respect for Master Ho

425
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:18,234
We've been lenient with your people

426
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,337
But you are causing
much trouble

427
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,638
Why did you raid
Hungkiu School?

428
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,038
We haven't made
any trouble for you

429
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,210
They came and
beat us all up

430
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,374
We really started nothing

431
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,282
You must have

432
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,715
provoked them

433
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:34,853
If they hadn't brought,

434
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,651
this first...

435
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:39,254
And...

436
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:43,092
How did your Feng and Tien die?

437
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,255
Do you know?

438
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,190
No, we don't

439
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,902
We really don't

440
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,470
We don't know

441
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,836
It's no simple affair

442
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,774
The Japanese are powerful here

443
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,412
You're asking for trouble

444
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,014
I've been kind to you

445
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,678
But I have my duty

446
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:07,982
to perform

447
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,688
Where is Chen?

448
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,195
He hasn't returned

449
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,168
Know where he is?

450
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,999
No
We're looking for him too

451
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,071
You must not hold back on me

452
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,076
My patience is limited

453
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,945
We don't know
We're looking for him

454
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,983
We don't want to be involved

455
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,182
Let me told you

456
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,855
The Japanese Consulate
has demanded action

457
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,551
This is no joke

458
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,719
Hand him over in two days

459
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,827
or I'll have to be tough

460
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,765
Let's go!

461
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,232
Japan is great!

462
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,867
Even its dancing is superb

463
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,540
Now I'm escape from Russia. Im your man

464
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,345
Don't worry,
leave things to me

465
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,445
Get out?
What happened?

466
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,881
Mr. Petrov is head of the
Russian Hampers

467
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:31,220
A good fighter and
a friend of our master

468
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,722
He has some trouble
and is thus visiting

469
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,462
Under our master's wings

470
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,030
You're safe

471
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:47,968
Drink, Mr. Petrov

472
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,145
Three glasses

473
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,748
Three? All right
Three cups

474
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,734
I'm drunk. Excuse me

475
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,466
No, three more cups

476
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,544
Wait, come back

477
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,771
Sit down

478
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,710
If you must go,

479
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,580
then crawl out!

480
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,991
Crawl?

481
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,092
Well?

482
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:45,924
Sure. I'll do whatever you ask

483
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,366
I'll crawl

484
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,414
Bye

485
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,470
Get up

486
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,208
Where to go?

487
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,043
North Szechuan road,
Yokohama road

488
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,504
Stop, where are you going?

489
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,936
This is a dead end alley

490
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,279
What are you doing?

491
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,680
I want to ask you something

492
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,157
It's you!

493
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,424
I want to ask you something

494
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,597
You needn't ask
I know nothing

495
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:28,227
I want to ask you something

496
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,030
I know what you want
I didn't do it

497
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:38,466
Yes...
Someone asked me to do it

498
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:47,208
Mr. Suzuki told me to
pass the poison to Feng

499
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,609
Feng gave it to Tien

500
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,150
He's Japanese

501
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,954
Spare me
I am just a dog

502
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,129
Have mercy

503
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:27,454
Why do you pick on me?

504
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,596
Look another man hanged!

505
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,996
Come and look!

506
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,813
Chen first invaded our School

507
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,211
and now killed our interpreter

508
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,522
He don't give face to our Empire

509
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,126
Where's the law in this area?

510
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,361
What are you detectives for?

511
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,760
Please told me

512
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,597
Sir! Aren't you overstating things

513
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,065
I give them two days to deliver Chen

514
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,107
I know what to do if they don't

515
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:25,306
What can you do?
You're Chinese

516
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,241
You help your own kind

517
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,179
I don't care about nationality

518
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,083
We policeman

519
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,984
have to be reasonable

520
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,854
I have no intention of being reasonable

521
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,818
Chen is a killer

522
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,993
Find him

523
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,831
You can say that, sir

524
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,296
But this is not our procedure

525
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,439
Hu was murdered
but there's no proof

526
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,270
We can't say Chen did it

527
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,716
Proof or no proof

528
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,755
I want him!

529
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,917
Or I'll report to the consulate!

530
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,365
You're making it difficult for us

531
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,998
Then I'll take over

532
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,632
this matter myself

533
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,675
I have ways of handing this

534
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,547
All right, I'll do my best

535
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,094
They're gone
They won't get anywhere

536
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,363
Chinese are Chinese, after all

537
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,166
We'll report to
the consulate first

538
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,133
and then catch him

539
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,914
Newspaper

540
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,989
They're forcing me to deliver Chen

541
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,954
How can I find him
in this big city?

542
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,552
Forget it

543
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,628
We'll go to Ching Wu School

544
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,829
Things are getting worse

545
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,734
Chen has killed
a Japanese interpreter

546
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,468
But he's taking on us too

547
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,004
I'm a policeman

548
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,646
What would you do in my place?

549
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,979
We really can't find him

550
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,947
What are we to do?

551
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:21,219
Everyone knows you're a fair man

552
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,558
We wouldn't care lie to you

553
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,387
We don't know where he's hiding

554
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,552
We've all

555
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,664
been around

556
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,164
You must hand him out

557
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,097
Don't you know the
Japanese can be tough

558
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,534
If they close down your school

559
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,730
and arrest you

560
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,536
you'll find it really tough

561
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,076
If you arrested us now

562
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,840
We still couldn't
tell as we don't know

563
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:56,722
I've make things clear anyway

564
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:57,916
There's one more day left

565
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,651
Please hand him out

566
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,487
The Japanese aren't kids

567
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,263
Don't blame me

568
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,230
for taking you in

569
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,176
It's really serious

570
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,046
What are we to do?

571
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,088
Let's stop looking for Chen

572
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,691
If we find him,
we're sending him to dead

573
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,721
They won't dare touch us

574
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,562
So many are suffering
because of him

575
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,596
Let's go to jail

576
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,165
if we must

577
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,432
Captain!

578
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,929
I want to talk to you

579
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,765
What is it?

580
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,207
If they really can't find Chen

581
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,600
Will it cause the
school much trouble?

582
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,838
Yes, Japanese is
influential in Shanghai

583
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,645
They very well may close down the School

584
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,680
What if they found Chen?

585
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,289
He'll surely be killed

586
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,118
How can we let them found him out?

587
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,058
I wonder where
he's hiding

588
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:43,221
We must find him
and tell him to escape

589
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:44,566
I...

590
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,005
You what?

591
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,684
You know where he is?

592
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,393
It is a matter of life or death

593
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,670
If you know,
don't be silent

594
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,909
I know where he is at night

595
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,440
Where is he now?

596
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,988
I'm from the
telephone company

597
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:21,558
What took you so long?

598
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:24,190
I just got my orders

599
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,725
Come with me!

600
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:34,998
There

601
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,381
Don't just stand there,
hurry up!

602
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,493
There's another one inside

603
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:07,652
Wait here

604
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:21,633
The telephone man is here

605
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,163
Master, it's the telephone man

606
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,534
Come in!

607
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,007
Tell him to come in

608
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,034
Come here

609
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,017
Chief, it's the telephone man

610
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,324
Go on

611
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,798
I am dying to find Chen

612
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:03,168
and see just how good he is

613
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,241
It's not only his Fist of Fury

614
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,880
He moves like lightning

615
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,648
I think we need not to fight

616
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,152
We'll concentrate
on Ching Wu School

617
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,753
Wait!

618
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:29,633
Okay

619
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:50,349
What do you suggest?

620
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,954
Kill all of them in one stroke

621
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,357
How about the consequences?

622
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,099
We're the International Settlement

623
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,632
As long as we
leave no evidence

624
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,930
Nobody can prove a thing

625
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,601
Send someone tonight

626
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:09,835
Do a clean job

627
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:10,909
Yes, sir!

628
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:22,623
Why isn't he here?

629
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,489
Look around

630
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:39,029
Chen!

631
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,470
I wonder where
he could have gone?

632
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,679
Let's wait for him

633
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,241
Where could he be?

634
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:51,977
I wonder

635
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,538
Won ton noodle

636
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:08,218
I'm here to avenge my teacher

637
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:24,511
It's none of your business
Get out!

638
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:28,840
Scram!

639
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,753
Scram!

640
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:16,113
Hold it!
Who are you?

641
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:21,279
I'm Chen
I want your master

642
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:22,582
Chen?

643
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,667
Let me take care of him.

644
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:08,046
Li-erh!

645
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:14,024
Yao Chang!

646
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,392
What happened?
Who did it?

647
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:21,095
Japanese

648
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:22,961
What bout the others?

649
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:24,104
Any survivors?

650
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,839
Everyone...

651
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,608
Yao Chang!

652
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:01,942
He might yet pull through

653
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:05,970
Help those who have a chance

654
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,205
We'll go upstairs and see

655
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,749
If there are any survivors

656
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,070
None, Captain

657
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:16,214
I'm unworthy of Teacher!

658
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,444
I'm unworthy of Teacher!

659
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:26,619
They died so horribly

660
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,393
What are we going to do?

661
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,059
Our inaction was a mistake

662
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,237
Chen was right

663
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:41,900
Japanese

664
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:46,104
I'm from the consulate

665
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,211
You dared kill
at the judo hall

666
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,212
It's really too much!

667
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:50,907
I don't want this
to get out of hands

668
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,781
I'll hand over
the man to you

669
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,454
You're Chinese
I don't trust you

670
01:34:56,757 --> 01:34:57,849
I must go in

671
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,519
All right, just you

672
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:07,628
Keep guard here
Admit no one

673
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:31,951
What's up?

674
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,754
The Japanese did it

675
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:37,225
The Japanese?

676
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,422
Watch your tongue

677
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:41,864
You must not slander people

678
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,303
What proof do you have?

679
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,599
These two survivors

680
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,872
If I wasrt in charge
of Ching Wu School

681
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:51,568
If not for Ching Wu
School's future

682
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,577
I'd fight you to the end

683
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:55,805
Stop talking

684
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,917
Go ahead and
file a complaint

685
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,313
I don't care anything

686
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:01,717
I only want
Chen immediately

687
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:09,094
He killed many people
in Hungkiu School

688
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:12,094
The consulate has
asked the police for him

689
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,663
You'll have to
hand over Chen

690
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:15,529
What?

691
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,432
They killed so many
of us but are free

692
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,768
And nobody knows if Chen

693
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,101
Was the killer
at Hungkiu School

694
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,709
Now you want us
to hand him over

695
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:26,608
Is that fair?

696
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:34,380
We Chinese are not
in good standing

697
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:43,427
You know the situation here

698
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:46,760
Chen must be delivered!

699
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:48,528
I don't know where he is

700
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,329
Now, you call the play

701
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:53,738
Right
Take them away!

702
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:00,236
You really don't know
where he is?

703
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,952
What if we can't find Chen?

704
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,859
I've been kind to you

705
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:50,056
Now I cannot help
you any longer

706
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:51,664
You're taking us all in?

707
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,233
Not only you'll go to prison

708
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,367
but your school will be closed too

709
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,836
Ching Wu School is finished

710
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,770
Do you Japanese
listen to justice?

711
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:03,534
Isn't there a law?

712
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,872
I'm the law in Shanghai

713
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,536
Don't blame me

714
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,243
Blame it on Chen

715
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:13,217
Who asked him to
go into hiding?

716
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:18,223
He should surrender
for your sake

717
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,654
Chen is here!

718
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:33,557
Now tell the truth

719
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:35,934
No lies

720
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:39,069
If I surrender

721
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,307
will you spare
Ching Wu School?

722
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:49,180
Well?

723
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:55,749
I can give you
my word of honor

724
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:59,192
Don't forget,
I'm also a Chinese

725
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:20,708
I shall pay for the lives I took

726
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,841
Leave Ching Wu School alone

727
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:35,821
Who says knight errantry is dead?

728
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:43,198
Who says life is always preferred?

729
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:05,155
Here goes a true hero

730
01:41:05,526 --> 01:41:14,025
Caring little what lies ahead
