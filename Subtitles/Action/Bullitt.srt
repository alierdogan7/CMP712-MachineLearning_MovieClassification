360

As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

361

CHALMERS: I'm Walter Chalmers.

362
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,149
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

363
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,074
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

CHALMERS:
I thank you for doing all you can, Doctor.

365

Get the supervisor.

366
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,795
Now, what went wrong, Lieutenant?

367
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,950
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

368
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,992
Who else knew where he was?

369
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,518
What are you implying?

370
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,389
They knew where to look for him
and they used your name to get in.

371
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,838
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

372
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,389
Somebody did.

373
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,792
And it didn't come from us.

374
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,992
That's hardly the issue.

375
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,358
Well, it certainly is.

376
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,640
I've got an officer with a family.

377
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,951
And he's shot up pretty bad.

378
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,475
Mm hmm.

379
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,835
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

380
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,311
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

381
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,355
Deal?

382
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,598
Lieutenant, don't try
to evade the responsibility.

383
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,080
In your parlance, you blew it.

384
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,200
CHALMERS: You knew the significance
of his testimony.

385
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,352
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

386
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,314
So to you it was a job. No more.

387
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,757
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe...

388
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,158
You believe what you want.

389
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,517
You work your side of the street
and I'll work mine.

390
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,715
Lieutenant, I shall personally
officiate at your public crucifixion...

391
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
...if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

392
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,795
...so I can at least present his deposition.

393
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,518
CHALMERS: And, I assure you...

394
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,478
...I shall not suffer the consequence
of your incompetence.

395
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,516
And even if there wasn't any...

396
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,677
...l'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

397
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,711
There may be another attempt on his life.

398
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,076

was in the hospital.

CHALMERS: Joe, I'm sorry,
but there has been...

526
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,030
...some medical complication
as regard to my witness.

527
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,839
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

528
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,832
...as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

529
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,718
But, in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

530
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,830
WESCOTT: Does this mean
your surprise witness...

531
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,558
...won't be able to make any statement?

532
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,915
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

533
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,638
In view of the attempt on his life...

534
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,517
...l'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

535
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,989
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

536
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,513
WESCOTT: Hmm.

537
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,993
Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.

538
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,354
Keep trying.

539
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,108
I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

540
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,997
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

541
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,470
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

542
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,752
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

543
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,195
...in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

544
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,999
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

545
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,150
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross!

546
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,309
I'll get on that right away.

547
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,436
Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

548
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,877
CHALMERS: Where's my witness?

549
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,394
I've got him.

550
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,629
Where is he?

551
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,031
Are you going to tell me or not?

552
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,110
Well, I can't at the present time.

553
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,159
Captain Baker would like
to have a word with you.

554
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,713
Now, listen to me, Lieutenant.

...the two of them first came in
and you saw them.

568
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,832
Anything you can remember?

569
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,669
DESK CLERK: Like I said. They hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

570
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,354
I don't remember nothin' about them.
Nothin'.

571
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,878
DELGETTl: Start remembering.

572
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,915
I can't!

573
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,199
And that's the honest truth.

574
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,510
BULLITT: Delgetti, take him downtown.

575
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,878
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

576
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,791
He's not trying hard enough.

577
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,279
It will come to him.

578
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,872
You're wasting your time.

579
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,788
Okay. Come on.

One thing about the guy who hit me...

581
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,957
He had a square face.

587

Let's go to the guy in 634. No luggage?

588
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,919
That's right, sir.

589
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,514
DELGETTl: And he didn't store anything?
CLERK: No, sir.

590
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,910

means you gave him a good look-over.

CLERK: Always do.
They're the ones I give the eye to.

592
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,119
Then you saw how he arrived?

593
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,679
Yes, sir. In a cab.

00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,309

Meet you at Enrico's.

The second was long distance.

617

Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

622
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,751
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

623
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,512
My son, Paul. My son, Tony.

624
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,874
Tony, how are you?

625
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,349
Would you mind if I had
just a moment alone with Sam?

626

MRS. BENNET: No, of course not.

in the world of today.

Yes, that's right.

630
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,830
I can well imagine the financial strain...

631
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,832
...of sending a boy to university
on the salary of a captain.

632
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,195
There's no reason why a man
with your potential...

633

He removed him from the hospital.

637
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,035
As his superior officer,
I've given him complete charge of the case.

638
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,714
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

639
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,753
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

all over town, Frank.

to keep him from leaving the country.
