To draw them naked women or
 flowers in jardinieres.

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,600
You see, comrade lieutenant.
Accordingly to dr. Freud

150
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Any painting is a sublimation of
subconscious instincts.

151
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,720
Including the instinct of violence.
But you can disagree with this.

152
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,400
Because Soviet science does
not recognize the bourgeois doctrine
of doctor Freud.

153
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,480
Very clever.

154
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,400

your position and report me
the situation.

179
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Comrade lieutenant . The second
unit is ready.

180
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
The preparation of
the mission is done.

181
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
Stand up.

182
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,720
Run, forward.

183
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,000
Forward, forward.

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,920
Forward.

185
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,880
The mission failed

186
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,600
You are all corps.
You, you and you.

187
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
Cargo 200
in the black tulip.

188
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,000
Piece of shit 
in a zinc coffin.

189
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,320
The convoy that will go here

190
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,800
encounter the enemy's ambush

191
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,000
You know what's the
meaning of one machine-gun?

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Up there, on the height.

193
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
Huh!

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Do you know?

195
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
Get up, dead men.
Put on your helmets. Run down.

196
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,000
I said, run, run.

197
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,720
I wish to get to
Afghanistan already.

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Sparrow.

199
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
Whatcha want?

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,720
Take my dick to piss
so tired, can't get up

201
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,640
Him?! Nah...
He'll overstrain himself.

202
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,000
Look, Snow White comes.

203
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,720
Come over here.

204
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,080
Snow White.

205
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,600
Snow White, come over here, sit with us.

206
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,520
Snow White, come here.
Come over here. Don't be afraid.

207
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,600
Dammit, now it'll stand till next morning.

208
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Who's this?

209
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,420
Were you born yesterday?
This is Snow White, the
paramedic's daughter .

210
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
Half of Afghanistan have fucked her

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,920
They say she's hot
Not you her,
but she fucks you.

212
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
There's such a disease
How you call it?

213
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,800
Get outa here, scholar.

214
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Can you try to arrange it with her?

215
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
Why to try?

216
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,920
She's non-refusable, just
like Kalashnikov gun.
Grab and go

217
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
How we gonna get her through two sentinels?

218
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
No, Guys. I think it's a bullshit.

219
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,620
The previous call up 
 leaving in couple of days.

220
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
And we will stay here
for three months.

221
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
If you get caught - it's your end.

222
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,240
Listen, Lutyi. Would you
sleep with her after
 them fourty men been with her?

223
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
No.

224
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Me neither. It's better
to die than
eat from garbage cans.

225
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah?
and l ate. I ate.

226
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,600
Have you ever been
starving so bad ,
that you even can't sleep?

227
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,480
So shut the fuck up your hole!

228
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,600
Our dinner was three spoons
 of carpenters glue.

229
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,400
After eating that, we were
wandering around the city

230
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,880
Looking how you and your bitch
sit there in a restaurant.

231
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Hoping to get your leftovers after! 
Dig it?

232
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,000
And the bitches l had were all like her
l can't have something else, fuckface

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,480
Guys, stop it.

234
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Shut up whelp ! First smell a woman.
Then talk.

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Quiet, quiet.

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,080
How to quiet? You don't touch
mine

237
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
and l won't touch yours

238
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,480
Pick from the lgarbage cans...

239
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,400
Maybe she's better
than all of your rich sluts.

240
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,320
You bastard, one more word from you
and you'll eat shit. Got it?

241
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Who is Soviet paratrooper?

242
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Soviet paratrooper

243
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Is the glory ,
power and pride of the military forces

244
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,600
Who is Soviet paratrooper?

245
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,520
Sovie paratrooper is the assurance
of all units and people.

246
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Who the hell are you?

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,320
We are the shame of all
units and you personally.

248
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
 Iisten.

249
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,600
Iisten, he is an idiot.

250
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,520
Nah. He's cool
l don't get only one thing.

251
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Why the first unit is
always in the front?

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Run with light equipment.
And  have
an hour to sit and smoke.

253
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,880
While we eat shit here.

254
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,200
We have done nothing bad.

255
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Should be by turns. One time
for them, one time for us.

256
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes, it because
their lieutenant is sane.

257
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,000
And ours Dygalo is an idiot

258
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,240
Making his ranks on us, bitch

259
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
No, he was hurt badly.

260
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,880
In the head

261
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
He lost all of his men
in Afghanistan

262
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,800
He's the only one who survived.

263
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
He's been reassigned here

264
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
But he writes letters to the minister ,
wants to come back

265
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
But with his head injury
Who needs him there? 

266
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
So he's going mad on us.

267
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,120
We are in the deep shit guys.

268
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Company get up !

269
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880

273
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
What's taking so long?

274
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,200
You are not soldiers,
but pregnant cockroaches!

275
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,800
15

276
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,320
What's the matter girls,
 is it heavy?

277
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
Is't because of your skirts?

278
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,480
What a hell is this line ?

279
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,600

How you think to fight like this?

285
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Go back, clowns

286
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600

10

298
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,720
Raising your head like this
is a gift for sniper

299
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,320
And your mothers get obituaries then!

300
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320

317
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,720
Tell me Sparrow,

318
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,400

321
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,640
I can't stand it anymore

322
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,720
Then fuck off,

Yeah, l will tell !
What?! You despise me?!

324
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
I don't give a shit,
I don't care.

325
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,520
Olya's waiting there for you,

326
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,400
Tomorrow l quit too, guys

327

Got a letter from my mom

328
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,240
It's been a while already,
she is sick

329
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
If l die,
then she has no one

330
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Didn't want to quit first,
 like some scum-sucker 

331
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,520
Ok, guys,
is there anyone else?

332
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,400
I herad from the first call up

333

In Afghanistan you make one week out
Two at the base

334
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,720
And here Dygalo will finish you even before 
you get to war.

335
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,200
He'll destroy you.

336
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,120
What do you say, Ryaba?

337
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Sparrow, then we decided, yeah?

338
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,240
We quit together, ok?

339
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,320
Eyes to the center, attention !

340
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,080
 Comrade colonel , 

341
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,000

Made a decision to serve in Afghanistan

346
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,000
Now l must ask you one question

347
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,240
Is there anyone who has changed his mind?

348
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,320
I don't ask why

349
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,240
Your will be merely
reassigned to another division

350
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,720
Who doesn't want to go to Afghanistan?

351
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,320
Thanks for your service

352
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,240

353
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,880

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,400
Harder

355
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,320
It ain't no girl, but iron gun

356
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,480
Kill him

357
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,400
Don't fear, kill, don't fear

358
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
You only have one strike
to save your ass

359
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Crush the ribs, rip the guts

360
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
Take 'em down

361
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
Give it to me, like this, look

362
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,320
Like this

363
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,200
Right, kill him

364
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Come, soldier, kill him

365
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
Kill

366
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,720
Vorobyov

367
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,600
Yes

368
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,400
Come here

369
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,080
Yes, Sir

370
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,320
Stasenko

371
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,240
Come, take off your weapon,
put down your bag

372
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,880
Come on

373
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,600
Soldiers

374
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,720
Take the stuff away

375
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
Beat him,
punch him in the face

376
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
You are going to war,
come on, son

377
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,800
That's how you're gonna pet your girlfriend

378
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,720
Punch his mug!

379
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,800
Full contact , quick ! Both of you

380
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Sparrow,
Hit first

381
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah, that's it

382
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
Come on Sparrow

383
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,600
Don't back off, don't fear

384
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,520
One more try

385
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,880
Get up

386
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Come on Sparrow, hold on

387
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,400
Get up

388
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Come on, come on

389
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,400
Come on, more

390
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,320
Get up, warrior, punch him!

391
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,520
Finish him, Stas

392
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,480
Get up, when he falls down,
you must finish him

393
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Only dead man won't
shoot you in the back

394
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,200
Sorry, Sparrow, forgive me

395
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,120
Sparrow, good done

396
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,920
Let's continue

397
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,720
Looks like a plasticine

398
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,720
Everybody touch it

399
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,880
Touch it, feel it

400
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,720
You see, it's soft

401
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
It can take any form

402
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
looks like a harmless toy, 
that everyone of you had

403
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Every one of you molded,
squirrels, rabbits

404
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,000
But in a fact ,in your hands

405
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,920
you hold a powerful weapon

406
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,400
Plastic explosive

407
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,760
Stas!

408
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,680
It has its chemical formula

409
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,400
But we do not need to know this

410
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Plastid is irreplaceable

411
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,120
It's a necessary item 
in equipment of every paratrooper

412
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,120
The question, why

413
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,240
First, in this condition

414
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,120
It's absolutely safe, easy to store 
and always available

415
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,520
As they say, in the hand

416
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
But in war

417
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
It is very efficient

418
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,320
 and has enormous destructive power

419
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,240
But you've got to be skilled,
for using it

420
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,240
Warrior...

421
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,800
There are two simple rules

422
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,320
First ,the more you squeeze it,
the more it blows

423
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,720
Number two,
don't stick it everywhere!

424
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,200
But by itself this thing won't work

425
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,080
For it to blow we need what?

426
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,040
Detonator

427
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
Exactly

428
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,800
We need to insert detonator

429
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
Your name soldier?

430
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,600
Private Petrovsky

431
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,520
You screwed, soldier
l've got to report to your commander

432
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,600
Come in

433
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Comrade lieutenant, private Petrovsky

434
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,920
Come in

435
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,240
Well molded, quite realistic

436
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,480
Can you paint?

437
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,400
I  learned painting

438
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,000
A portrait, kinds of big

439
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,920
I could

440
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm here...,
The girl's writing...

441
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,240
We met before the war

442
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
She wants my photo

443
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,000
What am l gonna do?
Send it with this?

444
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,920
Can you , like...
Without it...
more handsome?

445
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Yes, just need some  time,
couple of days

446
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,520
I certainly won't go to
see her after war

447
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,640
Just let her write for the meanwhile

448
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,080
Attention!

449
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,000
Go!

450
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,720
Goddam tractorists...

451
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,120
Eat this

452
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,520
Look

453
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,480
Pissed his pants

454
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,400
You laugh? My bed 
is under Sparrow's bed

455
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
So what , birdy, do l need 
to sleep with umbrella now?

456
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
I don't get it, soldier

457
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,320
Did you see something?

458
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,720
Nothing, Sir

459
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,880
And you?

460
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
I misunderstood, sir

461
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,480
Then tell me what's it all about !

462
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,400
I also wanna share you joy

463
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
You can swallow your snots
Can call your mama

464
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Piss your pants, but your mission

465
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,920
Must be accomplished,
Die but do it , and he did

466
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,120
Turn back

467
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,880
Basic knowledge of your
communication with locals

468
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,800
You can get from this

469
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,480
But

470
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,400
The first thing, you should rember
when you cross the border

471
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,800
That you're in 
a muslim state

472
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,720
Islam it's not merely
another religion

473
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
It's another world which
has its own laws

474
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,400
Another approach to life and death

475
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,000
Muslim doesn't afraid to die
fighting the infidel, in other words - us

476
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,920
If he gets killed he goes straight
to heaven

477
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,640
Where all he was missing in this life
awaiting him there

478
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,880
Water

479
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,800
The fruits in the garden,
beautiful maids

480
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,640
How Muslims treat women
it's another topic

481
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,520
The most important holy
thing for muslim is his house, Harram

482
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,400
From which derived the word Harem

483
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,320
The second meaning of it - "forbidden", "prohibited"

484
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,480
Looking at the muslim women is Harram

485
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,880
Everything regarding
sexual intercourse is Harram

486
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,720
Harram to show a muslim indecent gestures

487
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,000
Those you all are so used to them

488
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,080
For this you can get a bullet
even from a common peasant

489
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,000
Another important thing,
Muslim will never profane
his house with blood

490
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,160
That means when you enter
their village, you are
their guests

491
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,240
To kill a guest
even an infidel - harram

492
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,000
So, you must remember
this one

493
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,480
As long as you're in the village,
you are safe.

494
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,720
But after you crossed
 the borderline of the village

495
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,400
The same man, 
who drinked tea with you 5 minutes ago

496
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,000
May shoot you in the back

497
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,920
Because it is a glory to kill
an infidel

498
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,920
It is a staircase to heaven.

499
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,120
I'm telling it for you, soldier

500
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,640
Ah...

501
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,320
After all, Afghanistan is a
multinational country.

502
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,200
Over 20 nations live there.

503
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Tajiks Turkmen,
Uzbeks

504
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,600
Pushtuns live along the Pakistani border

505
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,520
In the north, live
Khazars and Mongoloids

506
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,320
The word khazar means 
thousand in Turkic languages.

507
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Am I boring you, soldier?

508
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,800
Comrade captain, Does it matter
who you shoot?

509
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,400
During the whole history

510
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,320
No one ever succeded to conquer Afghanistan

511
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,800
No one, ever

512
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,200
Squad, Get up

513
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,720
What are we doing
in Afghanistan?

514
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,640
Fulfilling our
international incumbency,
and help our Afghan brothers

515
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,800
to resist the aggression
of imperialism.

516
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,800
Fire!

517
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,080
Private Ryabokon, done!

518
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,400
Private Chugainov, done!

519
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
Right down

520
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,520
You pull the trigger too sharp

521
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,920
Very dense, but too high
Breath slowly.

522
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,000
OK

523
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
Have you ever shot before?

524
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,880
No sir, I'm a painter,
l have a very accurate eye

525
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
Over here.

526
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,600
Ok

527
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,320
Give him.

528
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,400
Private, Vorobyov

529
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,320
Yes

530
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,600
Put down the gun and
come here.

531
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,800
Yes, sir!

532
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,080
Here. Put it there.

533
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,600
Yes, sir!

534
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,520
Run!

535
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Oh, cool, Gioconda

536
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Cool!

537
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,600
Listen, Gioconda, tell me honestly.

538
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,480
Why did you come
to Afghanistan?

539
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,400
You could sit at the headquarters and draw.
They even offered you.

540
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
You won't understand

541
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,320
So make it simple

542
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,480
Simple?

543
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,400
Do you see the
tank over there?

544
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,880
Beautiful, isn't it?
What a power!

545
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,800
and nothing otiose,not a bit

546
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,320
Weapons are
the most beautiful!

547
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,600
The most beautiful thing the mankind created

548
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
So what?

549
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,480
There was an artist named
Michelangelo in the renaissance

550
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,880
One day, someone asked him how
he sculpts his works.

551
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,600
He said, very simple,
l just take a rock and get rid of the otiose parts

552
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Understand? Beauty is
something without anything otiose,

553
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,520
Without any crap.

554
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
In the war,
there is only life

555
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,240
and death, nonting otiose

556
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,800
War itself is a beauty.

557
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
Listen, Gioconda, l don't
understand you

558
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,480
Are you a fool or what?

559
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,400
What is so beautiful?

560
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,880
When the guts are
twisted around the tank tracks?

561
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,800
You think it's a kids play?

562
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,000
I said you won't understand

563
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,920
Fuck you, freak!

564
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,480
Guys,  letters.

565
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,880
Calm down!

566
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Stasenko,
 it is mine.

567
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,480
What day is today?

568
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,400
Wednesday. Third!

569
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
Sparrow,
 mine

570
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,600
Lutaev, 
mine

571
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,720
Suvorov, 
me!

572
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,080
Ryabokon

573
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,600
That's it

574
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,520
That's it?

575
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,480
My friends asked me out to disco.

576
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
But l will not go without you
because l love you!

577
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,880
Give it to me!

578
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,800
But tonight l found two nice boys...

579
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,320
You fucking got tough, bitch, motherfucker

580
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,800
Come on! Come on!

581
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,240
Come on, sparrow!

582
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,480
Ah... 

583
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,000
Attention, soldiers!

584
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,920
Stand at attention! You screwed soldiers!

585
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,400
You two come to me later.

586
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,400
Very good!

587
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,320
Very good, man.

588
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,400
Stand at attention!

589
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,800
Turn back and march!

590
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
March!

591
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,000
Ok, guys. Listen carefully!

592
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,480
March steady. Don't fan out.

593
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,720
To the top of this rock.

594
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,080
Sparrow, Stas and Ryaba, you guys
hold their legs and push them over.

595
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,320
I don't give a fuck how, even bite 'em

596
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,880
Pinochet, Chugun, Gioconda,
you guys come with me.

597
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,600
All come with me!

598
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,400
March!

599
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,320
Be steady!

600
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,800
Hooray

601
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,400
All squads, stand up!

602
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,320
Stand up, l said!

603
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Come out, lie down!

604
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,000
All down on the floor.

605
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,600
Creep, l order you!

606
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,600
Creep quickly! All! What?

607
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
What did you say?
I don't understand.

608
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Stand up

609
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,400
I don't understand
what someone said.

610
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,200
Who said? Who?

611
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,600
Who said? 
I don't know.

612
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,320
Who?

613
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,480
It is you?

614
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,720
I don't know who said.

615
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,480
Who said?

616
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,400
I don't know.

617
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,200
Go there, you!

618
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Do you want to tell me?

619
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,320
Tell me. Tell me what you know
Tell to my ears!

620
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,720
Whisper, l will forgive you.

621
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,600
All of you!
Come on, l'm alone

622
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,080
Come on , you and me.
No one will know

623
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,600
Are here some normal people?

624
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,520
Or just  fucking freaks?

625
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,080
Was it a bad dream?

626
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,800
Aha! Maybe
dreamed something.

627
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,880
Looks like an aggravation

628
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,800
Wait! I heard that he wrote
a request again
to the headquarters.

629
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,920
He wanted to go to
Afghanistan with us.

630
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,520
He was refused

631
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,400
Hold on .
Who's there?

632
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,000
What are you doing?
Stay where you are!

633
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,920
Come on, quickly! Slient!

634
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,480
Hold this.

635
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,720
Is there any pot left?

636
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,640
Hush!

637
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,480
Heh! She sings again!

638
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,400
Did you see it !
she comes like a machine gun

639
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,400
Guys, Dygalo won't be looking for us?

640
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,480
Nope!

641
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,320
Why?

642
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,240
Because...

643
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,800
Lutyi ,
l thought l smelled something good!

644
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,080
Something left?

645
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,000
Take..

646
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:41,120
I'm gonna fuck tonight so hard, that it
won't rise for the next year and a half

647
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Man, let's smoke some more

648
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
Ah, Sparrow, bird!

649
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,080
You know how we used to smoke
in orphan house?

650
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,720
Like Gypsies
One joint for all
Wanna see?

651
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,640
Show me

652
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,720
Look, what they doing!

653
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,480
Hey, guys, you are so good
l love y'all

654
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,320
Bird had enough ! Don't give him more

655
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,800
Otherwise we'll need to cary him again

656
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Alright

657
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,720
I'm going

658
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,240
Tell me, you a man ?

659
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,720
No really, tell me,
are you a man or what?

660
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,080
Let's not , Oleg

661
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,200
What?

662
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
I have a girl, Olya,
you know how she is.

663
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:48,880
Ah, Olya

664
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,800
So love your Olya 
Everyone has his Olya,

665
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,000
We all have ,
but do you remember
what you were?

666
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,720
Now you became a real man,
and there's last test left

667
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,600
You must, bird,
You gotta!

668
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,320
It's not a resort we going to

669
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,080
maybe this your last chance

670
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,800
You can't go a virgin to war

671
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,200
it's a men thing, understand?

672
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,320
Come on, Sparrow, 
go for it, come on

673
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,800
Maybe she don't want me

674
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Are you fool ?!!!
she likes you the most

675
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,080
Really? You kidding me

676
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,320
I swear, ask the boys
l am not kidding

677
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,800
C'mon c'mon , go!

678
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,400
She has seen you many times at the camp

679
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,320
But you paid no attention,
she felt hurt

680
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,600
No, l can't do this before you all

681
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,520
Well, drink in the meantime,
l'll be back

682
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,200
Are you so special?

683
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,600
Better than others,
l don't get it!

684
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Shut up,
I'll explain you later

685
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,200
You need help Sparrow? 
Want me to hold your legs

686
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,120
Sparrow, just go

687
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,000
Go fight ! 
Take the sword out !

688
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,800
If l don't come back

689
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Say, he died bravely

690
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,720
Warriors, forward

691
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Stas, what's the matter?

692
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,720
Why are you so sad?

693
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,640
I miss my family,
toss me one

694
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,320
It's scary a little , isn't it?

695
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,720
If to be honest, 
without any bullshit

696
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,080
Scary

697
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,320
Not all die...

698
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,240
If it happens fast,
It's not that scary

699
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,720
The worst thing if you get crippled

700
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,640
When l was in Tashkent, l went to
that hospital, and some
soldiers were there

701
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,200
The whole ward

702
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,120
Each one occupies only half a bed ...

703
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,080
I knew a guy who came from
the battlefield

704
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:32,000
He is good, 
only his bladder is cut by splinter.

705
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,120
He got a pipe coming from his stomach,
and a bag tied to a leg.

706
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,280
They call him bagpipes...

707
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,800
What's up with Sparrow
ls he sleeping there or reading books?

708
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,520
Wait, l'm going to see

709
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,480
You are bruts!
Understand, animals!

710
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,400
You all are like animals,
don't care with whom and where

711
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,320
I can't do like this, 
You all are animals

712
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,520
I wanted it to be good...

713
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,920
What are you looking at?

714
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,240
Have anyone told you
that you are very beautiful?

715
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,400
Are you in love with me?
so marry me,
and they will come visit us

716
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,640
You must know it,
you are so beautiful

717
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,080
Are you an idiot?

718
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,000
Artist

719
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,320
Cyprida (Aphrodite)

720
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,000
Cyprida, coming from a sea

721
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,920
Cyprida

722
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,080
Goddess of beauty

723
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,400
The sea washes away
all the sins

724
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,880
Eternal purity

725
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,480
Goddess

726
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,880
Everyone worship her!

727
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,800
On your knees, you freaks

728
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,120

Run towards the plane, move

734
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,200
Krasnoyarsk

735
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,320
Is there someone from Krasnoyarsk?

736
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,880
Krasnoyarsk

737
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,080

Ok

Take this

746
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,120
4 over-periods, 28 missions,
and not a scratch

747
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,400
Wear this, don't take it off,
do you understand

748
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,720
Yes

749
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,640
Countryman, don't take it off

750
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,720
Then pass it to others when you come back, 
just wear it

751
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,600
Aye

752
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,800
What's your name

753
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,000
Oleg, and you ?

754
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,920
Kolya

755
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,200
Look there, guys

756
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,120
Commander, from the right

757
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,400
No brakes

758
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,720
Keep it steady

759
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,520
Help me

760
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,400

761
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,320
Sitroylov, yes

762
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,320
Ryabokon, yes

763
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,200
Vanifatiev, yes

764
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,880
Demchenko, yes

765
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,800
Bekbulatov, yes

766
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,720
Go to the fourth company,
follow me

767
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,480
Bye, guys

768
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,720
Take care, bye

769
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,640
So long, man, bye

770
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,480
So what's your story,
junkies, alcoholics and sex maniacs.

771
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,600
Yor are in the 9th company

772
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,520
Follow me

773
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh, a fresh meat is coming

774
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,400
Get hanged, ghosts

775
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,480
Attention

776
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,400
Stand at attention

777
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,720
Warriors, congratulations for
coming to the valiant 9th company

778
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,200
I don't get it,
Warriors

779
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,600
Welcome

780
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,720
To

781
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,600
The ninth

782
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,880
Company

783
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,200
Hooray, hooray, hooray

784
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,120
Fuck it Hohol 
Take them outside and wank them there

785
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,520
I am lieutenant Pogrebnyak,
Forget all you've known

786
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,400
Here you ain't bad and ain't good
Here, you're nothing

787
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,400
Yes, brothers, we've  already heard
it in some other place

788
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,320
I plan to deal with you day and night,
until you become a good soldiers

789
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,800
Is it clear?

790
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,720
Yes, comrade lieutenat

791
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,880
Huh?

792
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,800
Yes, comrade lieutenat

793
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,320
That's good

794
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,240
Private Chugainov

795
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,320
Why is it so gnawed?

796
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,240
This machine gun is Samyilin's,
He heroically died

797
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,600
He killed 8 ghosts by it

798
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,400
And got a medal

799
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,480
It's scratched a bit,
because he died of grenade

800
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,400
It's not such a big deal,
Glue it

801
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,800
The barrel is skewed,
How am I gonna shoot?

802
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,800
You are very lucky, dumbass

803
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,000
This gun is special

804
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You should feel proud,
instead you're bitching here

805
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,920
Comr...
Solder! Sign here!

806
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,640
Turn left, move

807
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,800
Who was your former commander?

808
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,720
1st lieutenant Dygalo

809
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,640
Sashka...

810
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,240
I thought he retired
He slept there

811
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:14,000
Been screaming all night long,
going to a combat ,no one could sleep

812
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,000
Then they took him to the hospital
To Tashkent l guess

813
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,400
Aha

814
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,320
Was a good guy, joyful, 
Used to laugh a lot

815
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,800
He had some illness, 
hey doc, how'd you call it?

816
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,400
It is called contusion

817
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,320
I thought you'd say something clever
what a dickhead

818
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,480
Oh , shut up!

819
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,480
Is that snow white
girl still there?

820
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,400
Snow white's there

821
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,000
Say, painter

822
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,400
Is this good?

823
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,200
More or less

824
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,120
Some boy here made it by memory

825
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,600
Listen, Hohol

826
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,520
Pomidor - this son of a bitch,
 gave him broken Samylin's gun

827
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,720
And the new one probably sold...

828
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,240
What? He trades weapons ?

829
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,240
Some die at war, and some make profits of it

830
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,240
Sir, l heard that we'll
go to combat in two or
three days, is that right?

831
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,640
Not a combat, but we go out, our mission
is occupying a height

832
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,640
Hold the line of defence,
protecting our convoys

833
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,400
Is this all?

834
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,320
Yes, what you thought
it's Stalingrad here?

835
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,320
He's so monumental,
 l'd make him a statue of bronze

836
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,600
Kagraman

837
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,800
What?

838
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,880
Kag - ra - man

839
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,400
 Dushmans call him so

840
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,800
It means angry giant

841
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,600
Our commander is the only one
 in the whole Afghanistan

842
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,480
He's been nominated for hero three times

843
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,720
But each time he returns from a combat
He beats shit out of some brass hat

844
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,640
They don't take him 
to the martial court, though

845
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,320
But he ain't getting his star .

846
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,880
Afanasyi, who are them?

847
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,600
These are the Green

848
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,000
Afghanistani army,
Darned Allies

849
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,920
There is nothing worse
than working with them

850
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,640
When it gets tough a little, they run

851
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,880
While you think they
cover your flank,
they're far behind

852
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,720
Three kilometers away

853
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,000
We got surrounded once because of them assholes

854
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Where the Dushman
territory begins?

855
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,480
After the block station

856
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,000
There they are

857
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,480
They say - Russians are our friends and brothers

858
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,400
But when the night falls 
dig out their guns

859
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,000
And go Allah Akbar,
and shit.

860
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,400
So do not haste to
join this war,kids
You'll get it anyway

861
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,880
You probably already made
 a bet who kills a ghost first

862
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,880
Of course

863
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,080
Bet on what?

864
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,720
Marlboro pack

865
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,880
I add another one

866
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
Who was the first then, lieutenant?

867
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,800
Samylin, 
He killed the first ghost

868
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,720
He also left first, in the zinc,
What remained of him,
The pieces we could gather

869
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,800
There they are ,savages

870
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,800
The frontier guard

871
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,720
We'll drop some ammo and food and go on
