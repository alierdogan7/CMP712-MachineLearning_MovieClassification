"It is said, that everything around you
is getting quiet,

3
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,420
in the moment of death."

4
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,860
Take cover!

5
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,660
Open fire on my command.
We need to shoot.

6
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,620
On my command!

7
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,900
"That is Friedhelm, my brother."

8
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,060
"He won't be
much of a help anymore."

<b>OUR MOTHERS, OUR FATHERS</b>
Episode 1: <i>A different time</i>

10
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,900
"Six months ago
in Berlin

11
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,180
we said Goodbye
to our parents."

12
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,300
"A human live."

13
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,740
I expect you
to make us all proud.

14
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,820
Its about nothing less
than the future of Germany.

15
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,460
You've already proven yourself.

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,900
And you,
you stick to your brother.

17
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,140
Maybe something will
become of you.

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,460
You are going to take all of them?

19
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,940
Yeah, sure.

20
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,580
Hurry up, the girls are waiting.

21
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,860
Take care of yourself.

22
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,660
Wilhelm.

23
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,660
You bring him back to me.
Promise.

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,100
Promise!
I promise.

25
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,900
Bring the <i>Unteroffizier</i> another
<i>Korn</i> on the house and the bill.

26
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,380
Then you call it a day.

27
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,540
Won't your soldier get a kiss?

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,260
If I fall tomorrow,
your heart will be broken.

29
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,260
If you fall, <i>Herr Unteroffizier</i>
then in the gutter only.

30
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,540
Good night.
Good night.

31
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Greta.

32
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,700
And?

33
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,580
I made it.

34
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,140
I knew it. Come!

35
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,580
It's time to party.

36
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,460
With an A, what else.

37
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,980
Even though they wanted to trick me.

38
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,500
They asked me what
came after the Third Reich.

39
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,460
Nothing.

40
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,940
The millennial realm
remains eternally.

41
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,420
Just a few days until
I go to the front.

42
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,180
Did you tell him,
that you love him?

43
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,980
Stop it.
Dear Lord, you've got to tell Wilhelm.

44
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,100
We're at war,
life can be pretty short.

45
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,780
Do you want to wait until <i>final victory</i>?

46
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,020
These few months.

47
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,380
There they are.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,620
All right,
I'm going to tell him today.

49
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,460
You can use my room.
Greta!

50
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,300
What?

51
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,980
Ladies.

52
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,220
Na.

53
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,140
Don't you have any luggage?
Luggage?

54
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,980
This man is a <i>Leutnant</i> -
he will be picked up.

55
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,580
I understand.
Where is Viktor?

56
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,700
Shalom, <i>Volksgenossen</i>.
Shalom.

57
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,660
Where's your luggage?
"We were five. Five friends."

58
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,220
Since when do you have a bicycle?
Stolen.

59
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,060
"We wanted to bid our farewells,
before we parted ways."

60
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,740
To us. - To us.
- To us.

61
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,620
"We grew up in the same neighborhood

62
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,980
and knew each other,
since we were kids."

63
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,840
"We could not have been more different"

64
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,380
"But we were friends that
stick together."

65
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
"Charly, our baby of the family,

66
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,340
wants do do her duty
for the fatherland."

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,740
"She will work as a nurse
in a military hospital,

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,740
which follows my unit
behind the front."

69
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,660
"Viktor Goldstein."

70
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,300
"His father was an <i>Unteroffizier</i>
in World War I and later
a well respected tailor."

71
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,580
"Viktor was supposed to
take over the business,

72
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,020
before it was shattered
in the <i>Reichskristallnacht</i>."

73
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,580
"This is his girlfriend Greta.
They are inseparable."

74
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,700
"Greta does not mind,

75
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,260
that their relationship is considered
to be racial defilement."

76
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,500
"She is going to be a star."

77
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,700
"The new Marlene Dietrich."

78
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,580
"My little brother Friedhelm."

79
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,740
"The bookworm,
who loves Rimbaud and Jünger."

80
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,060
"I admire him for his
intelligence and his sharp humor."

81
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,020
"For him, it's the first time."

82
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,780
"And here am I, Wilhelm Winter."

83
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,020
"<i>Leutnant</i> of the <i>Greyhound Company</i>."

84
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,140
"Deployment to Poland and France.
Tomorrow we'll be heading to Russia."

85
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,460
Friedhelm, give it to me!

86
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,740
The war will make
a man out of him.

87
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,980
The War will bring out
the worst of us.

88
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,380
If you lose, they'll say
it'll be our fault again.

89
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,940
This is no country for wimps and traitors.
Everyone has to make sacrifices.

90
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,340
Ah!

91
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,020
Wilhelm...

92
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,540
Hide.
No.

93
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,620
If they find out that you as a Jew
do not respect the curfew...

94
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,260
...you'd go to a camp
and we would go with you.

95
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,740
Same rights for everyone.
Selfishness is treason to the fatherland.

96
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,860
Isn't it?
Yes.

97
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,020
<i>Heil Hitler</i>.
<i>Heil Hitler</i>.

98
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,780
How can I help you?

99
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,020
May I?

100
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,060
A farewell party.
We're leaving for the east tomorrow.

101
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,060
Wilhelm Winter.
This is my brother Friedhelm.

102
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,200
Miss Charlotte
will serve as a nurse on the front lines.

103
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,940
You stay at the home front?

104
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,340
It seems there has been a call,
Somebody is listening to Swing.

105
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
With Jews.

106
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,660
With Jews?
We wouldn't tolerate something like that.

107
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,740
Teddy Stauffer.

108
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,740
I didn't know that
Swing was prohibited.

109
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,140
Your Name?
Greta Müller.

110
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,580
<i>Incitement of hatred</i>, Fräulein Müller.

111
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,100
Report yourself in the
Prinz Albrecht Straße 8.

112
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,780
To the <i>ultimate victory</i>.
- Heil Hitler.

113
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,820
Heil Hitler.

114
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,220
A drink?
Yes.

115
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,580
What?
You flirted with him.

116
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,580
I saved you,
you <i>Schmendrik</i>.

117
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,380
Greta, we have to go.

118
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,580
Now? Charly wanted to...

119
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,060
That can wait.
The war is over on Christmas.

120
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,540
Yeah, let's vow.

121
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,620
We'll be here again on Christmas
here in this room.

122
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,620
Alive.
Christmas in Berlin.

123
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,700
Christmas in Berlin.
Christmas in Berlin.

124
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm going to take another photo.
Go there.

125
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,420
There in front of the shelf.
Come on.

126
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Here?
Yes, take a chair.

127
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,620
Friedhelm,
 in front, next to Greta.

128
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,020
"We were five friends."

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,180
"We were young and we knew
that the future belonged to us."

130
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,060
"The whole World laid before us
We just had to grab it."

131
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,140
"We were immortal."

132
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,700
"We should know better soon."

133
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,460
"July 10th 1941."

134
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,940
"This war will be different
to all other wars before."

135
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,580
"It's a joy to push forward."

136
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,140
"The frenzy of speed.
To go further and further and further."

137
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,540
"The endlessness of space."

138
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,060
"Landscapes like we've never
seen before."

139
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,140
"Fields extending to the horizon."

140
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
"The sky so far and blue,

141
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,140
as if God wanted to bedazzle us
with the beauty of his creation."

142
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,460
Isn't that great?
Soon here will be German farms.

143
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,500
"My men are putting up flawlessly."

144
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,220
"On every mission
they're always at the forefront."

145
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,180
"Everyone except Friedhelm,

146
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,820
who everyone considers to be a coward,
who provokes me daily.

147
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,060
who I feel ashamed of."

148
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,700
How far is it to Moscow?
- About 700 Kilometers.

149
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,580
Let's drive through,
we're the greyhounds.

150
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,580
Breakfast on the Red Square
with vodka and caviar.

151
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,860
And how are you going to
become a hero then?

152
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,420
Didn't get a single Russian and
already wants to have won the war.

153
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,500
Well, if the Russians
surrender all the time?

154
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,460
Shall I shoot captives?

155
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,100
Winter here would rather
tell them poems.

156
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,980
Koch, how many do you have?
- Koch has at least ten already.

157
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,100
Then Freitag will send his wife
a postcard from the Red Square tomorrow.

158
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,780
It's not going to be that bad

159
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,820
You coming?

160
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,220
He's just going to give you a real ticking off.

161
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,140
And why should I report in
personally then?

162
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,940
I already testified.

163
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,940
I'd come with you,
but my train doesn't wait.

164
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,020
All right, I'll manage.
I'm sure you will.

165
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,140
Charly!
How do I look?

166
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Like a movie star.

167
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,180
Miss Müller, please.

168
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,140
How are your friends?
Any news from the front?

169
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,020
Only victories.

170
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,540
So, you love Swing?

171
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,380
I like it modern.

172
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,940
Reich Secretary of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels

173
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,300
calls Swing
degenerate Nigger music.

174
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,820
We all... can be mistaken.

175
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
I agree with you.

176
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,380
Cigarette?

177
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,700
Thanks.

178
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,380
I've read your testimony.

179
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,380
You have sung?
Yes.

180
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,980
I have good connections
to state broadcasting.

181
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,820
Maybe something can be arranged.

182
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,580
That would be wonderful.

183
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,460
Marlene Dietrich...
We better shouldn't mention her.

184
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,060
Maybe you could sing
a song to me sometime?

185
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,940
<i>Hauptmann</i> Feigl.
Wilhelm.

186
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,060
Six kilometers northeast.
A pocket of resistance in a factory.

187
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,060
The company circumvents it
and continues.

188
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,660
You take your best men
and smoke it out.

189
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,100
Afterwards you'll advance to us.
- Jawohl.

190
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,060
Good luck.

191
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,860
There is a factory site Northeast of here
which has to be cleared...

192
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,140
Jawohl, Herr <i>Leutnant</i>.
Then lets go!

193
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,500
Now it's hunting time!

194
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,460
Jawohl, <i>Hauptoffizier</i>.

195
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,460
Let's whack the Ivan.

196
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,180
Welcome,
I am Head Nurse Brigitte.

197
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,580
Hildegard.
Charlotte, my pleasure.

198
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,260
Come in.
I'll show you everything.

199
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,300
Here are the light casualties.

200
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,100
The severely injured
are in Section A.

201
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,020
In C are the contagious cases.

202
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,900
What did this used to be?
A station for women in child bed.

203
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,140
You know, why you're here?

204
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,340
To serve the German soldiers
and the Fatherland.

205
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,980
These are the new nurses.
<i>Oberfeldarzt</i> Dr. Jahn.

206
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,500
I need you in the OR.
- Right away, Dr. Jahn.

207
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,820
No private contact with
the soldiers.

208
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,940
Especially not with the doctors.

209
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,980
If I hear about anything
I'll have you relocated immediately.

210
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,100
We represent
the German woman.

211
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,500
Serving the German soldiers.
Sounds promising.

212
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,180
Hildegard...

213
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,620
Four or five
up there in the factory.

214
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,900
Heavy MG, a Maxim.

215
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,700
We've told them to surrender.

216
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,620
Machine gun.

217
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,820
Were going with two squads,
I need two men.

218
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,740
And? Any volunteers?

219
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,140
Bartel, Schmidt, with the <i>Leutnant</i>.

220
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,740
The LMG will provide suppressive fire.

221
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,540
Give Schmidt your rifle, you buffoon.

222
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,420
Freitag, Koch and Verbinsky with me.

223
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,500
Show them what you're made of!

224
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,900
<i>Schweiß für Blut</i>!
- March!

225
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,320
Go, go, go, go!

226
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,500
Maybe we've got them all.

227
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,740
Or maybe they're calling
Comrade Stal- ...

228
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,040
Cover!

229
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,060
Schmidt, hang in there.

230
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,260
Bartel, go!

231
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,460
Go, go, go!

232
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,180
Shall I shoot?

233
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,900
Tell me, goddammit!

234
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,220
Goddamn Jewish bolshevik bastard!

235
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,860
Schneider, pull yourself together!
Schmidt could still be alive.

236
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,900
But he...
No buts! Get the MG from upstairs.

237
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,780
Jawohl, Herr <i>Leutnant</i>.

238
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,220
Where is Freitag?
The medic is treating him.

239
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,980
Get the men to the truck.

240
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,860
He is one of those <i>Commissars</i>.
He will be interrogated, understood?

241
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,660
Bring them away!

242
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,420
You heard it, men.

243
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Verbinsky.

244
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,140
Look!
That's for the cook sergeant.

245
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,660
I have a recipe for a beef soup
from my grandmother.

246
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,740
Come, Schnitzel.
Come. Come, Schnitzel.

247
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,700
Door opens

248
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,900
This seam here, it's skewed.
You have to open it up again.

249
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,540
And here, this cuff as well.

250
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,540
Is that everything?

251
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,100
A good work
will always stay a good work.

252
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,620
Were not humans anymore
for them

253
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,100
You're exaggerating.
Why should they set us aside?

254
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,300
When we've won the war,
everything will calm down.

255
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,220
Since when is this our war?

256
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,540
I have always served Germany
well and faithfully.

257
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,860
That will not be forgotten.

258
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,380
Are you still meeting that girl?

259
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,100
Why?
You know its prohibited.

260
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,060
Do you trust her?

261
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,260
Charly has written.
She says the war is splendid.

262
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,660
You grow stronger and harder.

263
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
And that we're going to
celebrate Christmas together.

264
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,700
Her military hospital is pretty close
to Wilhelm’s unit.

265
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,460
I'm going to the American
embassy tomorrow.

266
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,500
Why?

267
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,300
When I'm famous I'll make sure
that nothing happens to you.

268
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,820
Heinz Rühmann has
a Jewish wife as well.

269
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,780
Heinz Rühmann has divorced his Jewish wife.

270
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,540
What did he want?

271
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,180
Trust me.

272
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,740
Aaah!

273
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,940
Clamp.

274
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,100
Compress. Compress, quick!
This man is going to bleed out!

275
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
Scalpel.

276
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,100
Out! Out with you!
Get lost!

277
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,700
It seems the comrades have understood
the superiority of the Aryan race.

278
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,100
This is a present from the Führer.

279
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,060
Here. This is just the appetizer.
Afterwards there'll be Schnitzel.

280
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,700
And from the rest of the calf
there'll be ribs.

281
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,340
There will be soup, cook.
Jawohl, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>.

282
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,060
Friedhelm.

283
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
Why are you doing that?

284
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,700
What? Did I forgot to salute,
<i>Leutnant</i>?

285
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,540
You damn well know what!

286
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,100
You never volunteer.

287
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,300
For the battle against the
international finance Jewry?

288
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,060
I thought one hero in the family
was enough.

289
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,620
Here I'm not your brother,
but your superior.

290
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,580
You know, what they think about you.

291
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,980
I could protect you from father.
- I never asked you for this

292
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,060
If you want me to be in a squad,
then assign me to one.

293
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,900
We drink a last time
to Schmidt.

294
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,100
Winter, you can carve a notch
into your stock as well.

295
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,860
If you need a kill,
just lend us your rifle.

296
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,540
Have you heard anything from Freitag?
- He is in the military hospital.

297
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,900
Nice Work, <i>Leutnant</i>.
Thanks, <i>Herr Hauptmann</i>.

298
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,500
Shall I inform Schmidt's parents?

299
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,580
I'm doing that right now.

300
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,980
The Russian Commissar was interrogated.

301
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,420
Completely fanatic.
He says, that we will never win.

302
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,980
He can be shot now.

303
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,340
The man is a prisoner of war.
You know the order.

304
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,100
The Soviets did not sign
the Geneva Convention.

305
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,820
Commissars are to be executed immediately.

306
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,900
That is not a normal war,
but an ideology.

307
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,100
Do it somewhere off,
so the men won't brutalize.

308
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,900
Here you are.

309
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,580
That can happen to anyone.

310
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,460
On my first operation I mixed up
the clamps and the scissors.

311
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,260
Did he make it?

312
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,100
Better make it two centimeters less.
Stay still.

313
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,900
And the neckline has to -
- reach the navel, I know.

314
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,460
Now stay still.

315
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,380
How long are you going to need?
All right, I'll stay still.

316
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,900
We can't continue like this.
There are rumors.

317
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,340
Rumors?

318
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,940
The Jews are sent to the East.

319
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,220
Have you been at the American embassy?

320
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,260
There are no new numbers.

321
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,300
Nobody gets out anymore.

322
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,980
Turn around.

323
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,380
Is it true that the <i>Leutnant</i> had to
execute the captive?

324
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,580
Yeah, that's true.

325
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,060
I hope, Stalin
holds out a little longer.

326
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,460
If the Russian capitulates tomorrow,
we'll never get to Moscow.

327
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,940
All of them would come home
with neat uniforms and medals.

328
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,900
And me? I'd just be a normal civilian.

329
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,860
Isn't it?

330
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,140
His whole life, my old man was
never further away from his
farm than ten kilometers.

331
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,140
And I am a thousand away.
And you know why?

332
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
The Führer said that
when the war is won,

333
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,860
there will be land here in the East
for every one of us.

334
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
I'll find myself a woman and stay here.

335
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,460
It will be fertilized quite well...
...with our blood.

336
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,300
Not with yours, Winter.

337
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,020
You are clever enough to duck your head,
as soon as the Ivan lets one off.

338
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,580
I just want to defer to you,
Schneider,

339
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,780
because you're that keen on getting
an Iron Cross, huh?

340
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,060
What?

341
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
What did you say?

342
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,140
Attention!

343
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Call it off for today.
We're leaving at six.

344
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,760
It's going to be a hard day tomorrow.
Good night.

345
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,580
Go to sleep men,
tomorrow at six we'll be starting.

346
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,380
Goddammit... That with the <i>Leutnant</i>...
- Koch, he did it for us.

347
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,420
Not for me.

348
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,100
Otherwise one of us
would have had to have done it.

349
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,340
No, we wouldn't.

350
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,460
Do you think the Russian would
do it differently?

351
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,900
Maybe he is learning from us.

352
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,980
What did you learn?
Head nurse, I don't know...

353
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,700
Do you think it's enough,
to pledge loyalty to the Fuhrer,

354
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,340
and suddenly you're a nurse?

355
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,180
It won't happen again.
Bedpans and changing bandages.

356
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,660
There are Ukrainians waiting outside.
Select an assistant.

357
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,900
Who is experienced
with sick and injured people?

358
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,420
Who speaks German?

359
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,220
What is a syringe?

360
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
For injections.

361
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,860
In the hat?

362
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,020
Yes.

363
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,060
But if the hat is sick,
it won't be healed with just that.

364
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,780
You're experienced with sick people?
Yes.

365
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,980
Are you Jewish?

366
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,860
No.

367
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,900
Good, come with me.

368
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,420
The others... <i>Davai!</i>

369
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,500
Where were you last night?
Were you with that girl again?

370
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,140
What are you doing?

371
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,180
The newest idea by
Herrn Doktor Joseph Goebbels.

372
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,340
We all have to wear it now.

373
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,860
It's a law.
Even if it's wrong

374
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,340
a good German
does not violate the law.

375
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,940
Here, Thread No 3.
We are no Germans anymore.

376
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,620
Not for them.

377
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,460
Your arrogance
is going to cost you dear.

378
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,500
Viktor.

379
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,420
Viktor!

380
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,060
What are you doing?
That's no way to speak to your father.

381
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,860
There are so many things he doesn't understand anymore.
What?

382
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,660
It's all right.

383
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,180
Did you go to the embassy?
Yeah.

384
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,460
As soon as they have new quotas,
we're on board.

385
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,420
"September 19th, 1941."

386
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,980
"We're arresting
hundred thousands of Russians."

387
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,620
"But they don't give up,
they fight for every house."

388
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,420
"The twitching of a colossus,
just about to fall."

389
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,060
"I am optimistic, that we will
be back home by Christmas."

390
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,380
"And yet, its still a different
war from what I imagined."

391
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,060
Security service is conducting
a cleansing operation here.

392
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,540
The Order: Nobody gets in,
nobody gets out.

393
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,020
What do we do if somebody
wants to get through?

394
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,220
Shoot them.

395
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,380
You like to shoot, don't you?

396
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,820
When I was seven,
my dad got laid off.

397
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,420
So we went to the woods, hunting.

398
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,300
Only after the Führer came,
my dad got work again.

399
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,020
Here they are, finally.

400
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,260
Auxiliary police. Ukrainians.

401
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,780
There are children present.
...they are not allowed to kill civilians.

402
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,260
Hey!

403
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,660
Stoj! Let her go!
What does 'immediately' mean?

404
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
Sehtschassje.
- Sehtschassje.

405
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,300
What's going on here?

406
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,620
Let go!

407
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,420
Apustijt.
Apustijt.

408
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,140
<i>Herr Sturmbannführer</i>.
<i>Herr Leutnant</i>.

409
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,660
That girl belongs to the security service.

410
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,540
Like all civilians this girl is
under the control of the Wehrmacht.

411
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,340
That's no civilian,
that's a Jew.

412
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,580
An order is an order.

413
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,660
And your orders are to lead
an Ukrainian mob?

414
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,380
How honorable
for a German officer.

415
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,140
This girl is your responsibility
until I have sorted out this issue.

416
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,220
Understood.

417
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,100
As you wish, <i>Leutnant</i>.
<i>Herr Sturmbannführer</i>.

418
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,980
I need papers.

419
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,820
For a friend,
who has to leave Germany.

420
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,020
For a friend?

421
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Can you help him?

422
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,140
Do you mean the Jew?

423
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,660
Believe me, that problem
is going to settle itself.

424
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,500
What do you mean with that?

425
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,300
You better take care about
the things you know.

426
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,500
That problem is going to...

427
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,740
I said, only worry about the things
you really know.

428
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,860
Are you doing well with your program?

429
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,060
Yeah.

430
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,820
Good.

431
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Believe me,

432
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,900
I'll make a star out of you.

433
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,460
Leningrad is trapped since
September 7th,

434
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,700
Kiev will fall any minute, and it's only
500 Kilometers to Moscow.

435
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,660
High command assumes that the Russians
will do a last, desperate attempt

436
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,860
to stop the Middle Army Group.

437
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,260
Use the time to get your material
and weapons back to shape.
You are dismissed, gentlemen.

438
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,300
<i>Leutnant</i> Winter. A Word.

439
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,340
Are you mad?

440
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,180
A <i>Sturmbannführer</i>
of security service.

441
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,980
He executed a child in front of my eyes.
- Where there's Jews, there's partisans.

442
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,260
We are waging a war.
That is no war.

443
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,580
Yes it is. A new one.
In the name of the Fuhrer.

444
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,660
If we lose this war,
not even God will save us.

445
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,140
and most definitely not the Fuhrer.

446
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,180
Then we must not lose it
under any circumstances.

447
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,260
You're my best man.

448
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,660
You can make it far.
Don't ruin your career.

449
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,820
Wilhelm.

450
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,820
We should bid farewell to
the World as we know it.

451
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,220
She wasn't older than eleven.

452
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,780
It's about the purity of our race.

453
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,420
The Jews are tainting
the blood of the Germans.

454
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,780
Shut up, Schneider.
- It's in "Mein Kampf".

455
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,260
You can read?

456
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,620
We're defending our fatherland.

457
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,180
And what do you think are they doing 
over there? Exactly the same thing.

458
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,740
<i>Herr Sturmbannführer</i>.
<i>Leutnant</i>.

459
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,860
I'm sorry about the mess earlier.
That was not necessary.

460
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,620
But the Jewish blood is so malicious,
it just spreads everywhere. Unpredictable.

461
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,980
That's why the Jews
are so dangerous.

462
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,680
Achtung!

463
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,420
Lilija, no!

464
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,900
Better Doktor Jahn.
Grab.

465
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,580
That's a broken upper arm.
We really have to wait for Dr. Jahn.

466
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,220
Not broken. Grab.
Here. Here!

467
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,620
Not broken.

468
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,460
What do we have here?

469
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,860
A dislocated shoulder.

470
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,460
We have put it right ourselves.

471
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,700
Good, nurse Charlotte.

472
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,780
You're slowly getting better.

473
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,100
Thanks.

474
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,420
Everything’s quiet.
Ivan is shitting his pants.

475
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,060
Don't think you can fall asleep, Winter.

476
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,100
Yeah.

477
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,820
A damn Russian sewing-machine.
They've turned off the lights.

478
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,980
Winter, put out the damn cigarette.

479
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,420
Put down the cigarette!

480
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,740
Winter, you moron!
You're gonna pay for this.

481
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,140
You did that on purpose, Winter!

482
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,260
We have a dashing Artillery <i>Leutnant</i> on the A.

483
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,300
What? These man haven't seen
a woman for weeks.

484
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,700
We're boosting the fighting power.
If they catch you...

485
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,700
She's so much better than us.

486
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,020
There's morphine missing again.

487
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,260
Maybe she's working with the partisans?

488
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,220
They say, they sneak into the
military hospitals at night.

489
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,620
and kill soldiers that can't
defend themselves in their beds.

490
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,580
And I even selected her...

491
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,740
You're not only a disgrace
for the company,

492
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,220
but for your brother as well.

493
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,860
Say, Schneider...

494
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,460
...did anyone ever tell you that...

495
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,500
...you look pretty Jewish?

496
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,500
Stop it!
Schneider, that's enough.

497
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,460
Get him to the medic.

498
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,940
Did you see her legs?

499
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,460
Yeah.

500
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,540
So?
So...

501
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,460
Yours are more beautiful.
So it is.

502
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,060
And I sing better than Marika Rökk
as well.

503
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,460
The box seats were sold out.

504
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,100
Darling, are you coming?
We're missing the newsreel.

505
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,740
They're saying the Russian
Southwest front broke down.

506
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,380
You were lucky.

507
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,420
We can release you soon.

508
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,220
In the Kiev cauldron,
five Russian armies have surrendered.

509
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,500
The military hospital
is going to be moved east.

510
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,380
As soon as the 60th arrives,
we're leaving.

511
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,740
The 60th? That's Wilhelm’s unit
isn't it?

512
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,700
Does he talk about me from time to time?

513
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,540
Yes.

514
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,260
Disembark, men.

515
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,460
<i>Leutnant</i> Winter.
My orders are to...

516
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,180
I know, we'll be escorted.

517
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,700
The number of partisans
has considerably increased.

518
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,260
Because of our farsighted policy to consider
the indigenous population inferior.

519
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,620
Friedhelm.

520
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,540
How are you?
Good.

521
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,540
I'm happy to hear that.

522
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,900
Such a handsome <i>Leutnant</i> definitely
has a big lighter.

523
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,740
Wilhelm.

524
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,740
Charly.

525
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,940
How are you?
Good.

526
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,740
You look great.
Thanks.

527
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,700
Like a real front nurse.

528
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,020
So, already found the right one
from all these men?

529
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,940
Yes.

530
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,940
Farewell, Charly.

531
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,780
Take care of yourself.

532
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
Christmas in Berlin.

533
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,020
I have one hour.

534
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,300
There are rumors that Himmler is
going to enact a regulation,

535
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,380
that ultimately prohibits
the departure of Jews.

536
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,300
Tell him, the noose is tightened.

537
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,980
And I warn you.

538
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,220
Race betrayal is a crime.

539
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,180
It's dangerous to have a Jewish friend

540
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,740
if you want to achieve something here.

541
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,340
What's going on?

542
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,780
You mean, more dangerous than
having an affair with a German

543
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,940
if you have a wife and daughter?

544
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,060
Do you have the papers?

545
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,140
I need a photograph.

546
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,620
Did you for...
Surprised?

547
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,500
Have you finally
finished my dress?

548
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,140
What for?
You're just going to take it off anyway.

549
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,020
Since when am I accountable to you?

550
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,380
A money-grabbing
hook-nosed Jew.

551
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,860
We're not engaged.

552
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,380
You should be a little more thankful.

553
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,060
"October 7th, 1941."

554
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,260
"The rainy season has begun."

555
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,940
"It's a flood that cripples
and brings everything to a halt."

556
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,300
"The end of the Blitzkrieg."

557
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:03,620
"As if god averted us for
all the horrors that we bring."

558
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,780
"Maybe it's just the last test."

559
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,340
What?

560
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,460
He says we should stick to the left, and that
we need approximately 12 hours through the swamp.

561
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,580
Left. So there?
Da.

562
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,420
And partisans?
Njet.

563
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,540
I don't trust him.

564
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,300
All right, let's go.
On your feet, ladies.

565
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,860
Dorgerloh, Schneider, Bartel with me.

566
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,420
Winter, you lead the rest.

567
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,620
I want to get out of this damn...

568
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,500
What?

569
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,340
Stay calm, Koch. Stay calm.
Don't move, Koch.

570
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,140
Friedhelm.

571
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,180
Friedhelm, come.

572
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,860
Mines!

573
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:40,580
Mines!
Retreat, men. Back everyone.

574
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,580
Come, Friedhelm.

575
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:54,020
Greet... greet my sister.
Come on, now!

576
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
And now get lost!

577
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,100
Where is nurse Hildegard?
Hildegard?

578
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,540
Where were you this whole time?
Emptying bedpans.

579
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,020
There's morphine missing again.

580
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,580
If you see anything...
theft is forbidden under penalty of death.

581
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,900
And turn this up.

582
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,580
Probably this whole swamp is mined.

583
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,420
We have to go back and
send the combat engineers in.

584
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,420
Then we'll get stuck here.

585
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,580
My men are already demoralized.

586
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,860
No preparations for the winter
have been made.

587
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,300
If we're not in Moscow in six weeks,
we're going to freeze to death.

588
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,220
Without engineers we lose
at least a third of our men.

589
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,980
It doesn't have to be our men.

590
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,340
Dammit, Winter, that's good.

591
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,500
These damn farmers are all partisans anyway.
This guy sent us in there.

592
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,940
Better them than us.

593
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,540
Move, Move.
Move, you bastard.

594
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,100
Everyone that stops or flees
will be shot.

595
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,980
Do you hear that Ivan?
Do you hear that?

596
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,900
Dawai! Dawai! Dawai!

597
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,860
Marching row. Follow me.

598
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:06,140
Do you remember our
last evening in Berlin?

599
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,260
Us five.

600
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,220
I was right.

601
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,940
The war will only bring out
the worst of us.

602
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,340
Dawai. Dawai. Dawai.
Move!

603
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,220
You're so quiet. Everything ok?
Bad news?

604
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,860
You lied to me.

605
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,900
You're a doctor.

606
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,380
Yes.
And a Jew.

607
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,020
Yes.

608
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,260
Head nurse.

609
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,980
"...only beats for you."

610
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,700
His name is Hans Müller and he's traveling
to Paris on behalf of the IG Farben.

611
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,460
Written and signed by
the defense inspection 3.

612
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,500
And he should hurry.

613
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,020
From Paris he has to make it
to the unoccupied part.

614
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,060
To Marseille.

615
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,220
After that he's on his own.

616
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,500
Thanks.
If I see him again...

617
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,300
You won't.

618
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,700
"December 1941.
three meters of snow."

619
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,840
"Minus 40 Degrees Celsius."

620
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,420
"Water, that turns to ice
in seconds."

621
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,000
"The assault on Moscow
has failed,

622
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,820
and we are not prepared
for the Winter."

623
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,500
"We have dug into the
rock-hard ground."

624
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,120
"As deep as possible,
like animals in caves,

625
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,400
who are afraid of freezing to death."

626
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,140
"Nothing turned out
the way we imagined."

627
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,840
What do you have here, Winter?

628
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,460
Keep controlling the guards, Bertok.

629
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,820
Are you crazy?

630
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,940
I just wanted to burn it
to warm myself.

631
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,660
We don't even have snow shirts.

632
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:34,660
Every Russian can see us from a thousand
meters away and shoot us like dogs.

633
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,220
Dogerloh is organizing bed sheets
from the population.

634
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,900
Why are you helping us?

635
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,220
The enemy.

636
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:27,100
I help people.
You're doing that as well, don't you?

637
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,220
Why don't you tell?
What?

638
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,260
The handsome, young man.
Why don't you tell him?

639
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,540
It's not that easy.

640
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,900
You love him a long time?

641
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,820
Yes.

642
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,620
And always silent? He knows?

643
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,500
I don't know.

644
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,580
I don't think so.

645
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,220
Men never know, always only fighting.

646
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,100
And you?

647
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,540
I not hear anything from him
since July.

648
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,580
Maybe you should leave.

649
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,140
Why?

650
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,180
Nothing... It's all right.

651
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,540
Hitler has declared
war on America.

652
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,380
When he starts a war
then properly.

653
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,780
That's going to
break his neck eventually.

654
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,700
We shouldn't have read the
Torah.

655
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,740
but their Bible.

656
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,660
You never read the Torah,
you always wanted to be a Smock.

657
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,500
Lay down.
I'll make you a cup of tea.

658
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,820
Viktor.

659
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,460
You were right.

660
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:10,740
Your German friend was there.

661
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,420
She brought this.

662
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,180
And she said,

663
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,700
tomorrow at 9.56 AM.
at Bahnhof Friedrichstraße

664
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,780
Merry Christmas.

665
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,580
Say, Charly in the military hospital...

666
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,180
...did she say anything there?

667
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,860
You mean, about you?

668
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,660
Doesn't matter, forget it.

669
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,340
Wilhelm.

670
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,500
She speaks of you the whole time.
Of you only.

671
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,780
Why don't you just tell her?

672
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,500
Hm?

673
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,820
Oh, I understand. You don't
want to give her any hope,

674
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:20,780
because you don't know if you
come back alive.

675
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,260
Do you still have your photo?

676
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,700
Of course.

677
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,340
Do you remember,

678
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,220
you said, that the war would
be over by Christmas.

679
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,660
And then us five, together in Berlin.

680
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,780
German Christmas carols on the radio.

681
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:25,580
Lilija, you have to go.
He needs new bandages.

682
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,540
You have to go. Now!

683
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,660
Sister Charlotte has reported,
that a Jew is hiding here.

684
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,260
I'm sorry.

685
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,980
When do you think,
it's going to start again?

686
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,860
I don't know.

687
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:36,260
Maybe when the snow melts.

688
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:04,780
Mein Bubele. Mein Bubele.
Mein Bubele.

689
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,420
No. He's sleeping.

690
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:23,060
It would only break his heart.
You have to go now.

691
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,500
Mein Bubele...

692
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:31,140
You must only think about yourself, ok?
Do it for me, please.

693
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,140
Go, go now, go.

694
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,020
When I'm in New York,
I'll get you. Yes.

695
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:46,420
Write...
Write, when you're there.

696
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:54,460
Viktors Mother cries.

697
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,380
Good Morning, Ladies.

698
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,140
We need someone to carry our food.

699
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,100
I'll do it.
- Good, Winter.

700
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,740
<i>Herr Oberleutnant</i>?

701
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,340
Is my brother back yet?
No.

702
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,740
How long is he away now?

703
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,580
More than three hours.

704
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:58,020
Miss Müller?

705
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,620
Del Torres.

706
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,620
Miss Del Torres,
are you ready?

707
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,180
Greta.

708
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:13,660
Yes, of course.
I'm ready.

709
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,500
Then, please.

710
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,700
Recording.

711
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,620
"My tiny heart"

712
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,140
"only beats for you,"

713
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:42,020
"counts the hours
until you come back,"

714
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,140
"then you embrace me."

715
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,260
"My tiny heart"

716
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,460
"already dreams of luck."

717
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:58,060
"At home it only waits for you"

718
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:02,180
"and knows, you come back soon."

719
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:06,420
"Lovingly,"

720
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:09,620
"you look at me."

721
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,580
"Our lips
touch each other very soft"

722
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,660
"and I know, you're a man."

723
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,500
"My tiny heart"

724
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:26,220
"does not rest at ease."

725
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,700
"It keeps me awake the whole night"

726
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,740
"and it always beats, you,you"

727
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,060
"My tiny heart"

728
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:42,300
"is longing for you,"

729
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:47,140
"knows the answer,
if you ask me then."

730
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,140
"Yes, I belong to you."

731
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:56,740
"Yes, I belong to you."

732
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,380
Bon voyage.

733
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:17,220
Alarm!

734
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,300
Go! Go! Go!

735
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,060
March! March! March!

736
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,780
Let's go, Men!

737
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:32,020
Man that MG, go.

738
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,340
That is, that is your brother!

739
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,340
Request artillery!

740
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,540
Cover!

741
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:04,900
Don't shoot,
wait for my command!

742
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:08,380
Don't shoot,
wait for my command!

743
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,940
Open fire!

744
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,620
"We were five. Five friends."

745
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,820
"The whole world laid in front of us."

746
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,140
"We just had to grasp it."

747
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,980
"That's six months ago."

748
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,340
"A human live."

749
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,100
Friedhelm!
