00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,605
<i>Ja,</i> all this is under control.

2
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:41,561
A hundred and fifty million dollars
and my dope is on the way.

3
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,159
Today is gonna be a good day.

4
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,677
We are 25 degrees north,
84 degrees west.

5
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,325
<i>The cargo's being dropped.</i>

6
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,884
Good.

7
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,881
- Do you want to see his gun?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,001
Bang. Bang.

9
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,645
Sorry, Johnny.

10
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,237
Fucking bitches.

11
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>Infrared's</i> got a live one
on the water.

12
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,320
Air Force Stallion C-14
to Coast Guard.

13
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,767
We've got a fast-moving contact
heading 3-5-0 toward South Florida.

14
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,807
Captain, Air Force Stallion has a
contact at 1-8-0 closing fast.

15
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,081
This is Coast Guard cutter <i>Valiant.</i>
Request to know your intentions.

16
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,008
<i>Vessel off our port bow,</i>
<i>this is U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

17
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,923
Intercept is 1-8-0, speed 17 knots.

18
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:02,681
Make it so, chief. Scramble the helo.

19
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,919
<i>Vessel off our port bow.</i>

20
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,442
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

21
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,924
<i>Request to know your intentions</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

22
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,568
Incoming.

23
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,163
<i>Valiant, Valiant.</i>

24
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,126
This is Coast Guard 6-0-0-3.

25
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,486
<i>Negative contact with target. Over.</i>

26
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,208
Captain, we've lost target.

27
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,959
<i>Here's</i> your delivery and payment.

28
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:55,998
<i>Is it done?</i>

29
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:59,002
<i>- Cargo is on</i> Dixie 7.
- Okay.

30
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,367
All right, TNT, for the millionth time,
listen up.

31
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,642
Since 9-11, we've gone hi-tech over
water. Dope runners have gone low.

32
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,687
Our source says the biggest X
shipment on record arrives tonight...

33
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,441
...and we want to know
<i>who's</i> behind it.

34
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,368
Hopefully in a few hours
we'll have our answer.

35
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,087
We'll hit from three directions:

36
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,720
We'll go in with a water team, vehicle
assault and we got guys on foot.

37
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,519
We cannot make a move until our UCs
have <i>ID'd</i> the drugs and called us in.

38
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,199
No call, we back away.
And these guys we're going after...

39
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:42,681
<i>... they got a lot of firepower and they</i>
<i>hate the law. So eyes open out there.</i>

40
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,002
<i>Brav o's on the move.</i>

41
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,601
<i>Heads up. Here comes the drop.</i>

42
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,157
Fuck. My lens is flaring.

43
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,961
I <i>can't</i> see shit.

44
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,805
Brothers! Gather around!

45
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,518
Hey.

46
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,965
- Why <i>didn't</i> you say there was a rally?
- <i>Who's</i> looking?

47
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,723
- Take that shit. <i>I'm</i> out of here.
- Shit.

48
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,881
- White power!
- White power!

49
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,358
- White power!
- White power!

50
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,318
Blue power, motherfuckers.
Miami PD.

51
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,923
Aw, damn. <i>It's</i> the Negroes.

52
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,928
Casper, drop the bag.
Alpha leader, bring them in.

53
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,001
<i>Bad boys, bad boys</i>
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

54
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,042
<i>What you gonna do</i>
<i>When we come for you?</i>

55
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:10,007
- Dude, you gotta learn the words.
- We usually only do the chorus.

56
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,887
Alpha leader, hit it. Br...

57
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,368
Repeat your transmission.

58
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,246
<i>Alpha leader to Brav o Four,</i>
<i>please continue relay.</i>

59
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,324
<i>Where's</i> backup?

60
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,686
- Alpha leader, bring them in. Hit it.
- Mike, <i>I'm</i> only getting static.

61
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,601
<i>It's</i> all static.
The radios are fucked.

62
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,086
- Something funny? Something funny?
- Mike, where are they?

63
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,441
Got you, nigger.

64
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,040
- Looks like we got us a situation here.
- You <i>won't</i> shoot.

65
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,758
You got a gun to his head, so you
think I <i>won't</i> splatter you all over?

66
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:45,918
<i>That's</i> what I think.

67
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,842
My partner came here tonight
prepared to die.

68
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,078
Hell... Hell, no!

69
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,763
Incinerating trash like you.
Ready to die, right, Marcus?

70
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,568
- The fuck I want to do that for?
- Scared, <i>ain't</i> you, boy?

71
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,163
A: Put the gun down, tell me
who brings this shit in...

72
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,365
...and maybe I'll just
pop one in your shoulder.

73
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,089
Or B: Keep acting all Brody
and I'll put one in your chest.

74
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,922
Or C: You know, take the time
to talk a minute.

75
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,487
You know, de-escalate the situation.

76
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,924
See, <i>that's</i> my <i>partner's</i>
new spiritual bullshit.

77
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,649
Me? I actually prefer shooting
motherfuckers.

78
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,647
A lot of movement going on.

79
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:16,958
<i>Can't</i> see the UCs.

80
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,438
- <i>I think something's going down.</i>
- <i>Don't</i> move yet.

81
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,804
Mike, the man has a gun to my head.

82
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,324
He'll put it down if a hollow <i>point's</i>
in his eye!

83
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,241
Your <i>partner's</i> a cocky nigger.

84
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,441
- Damn. Now, was that necessary, sir?
- See?

85
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,839
He <i>can't</i> just be a cop?
He got to be a nigga too?

86
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,044
I'll hot this fool.

87
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,359
- Calm down.
- Calm down? <i>I'm</i> calm.

88
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,885
<i>I'm</i> calm! Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

89
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,960
I am way too unstable
for that bullshit.

90
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,644
Stop all the goddamned movement!
Everybody stop moving!

91
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,687
We <i>can't</i> let you all go, but this
shit'll get worked out in court.

92
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,727
We got our rights.

93
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,005
Exercise your right
to shut the fuck up.

94
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:57,324
<i>I'm</i> all right. I'll give you a warning.
<i>It's</i> the best I can do for all of youse!

95
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,081
Okay? <i>He's</i> crazy.

96
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,043
- You got 3 seconds to drop your gun.
- He has anger issue problems!

97
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,279
- One.
- He goes to bed early for this shit!

98
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,917
Just to wake up to pop one
in a motherfucker!

99
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,761
- Two!
- Mike, no!

100
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:10,918
Gun!

101
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,327
Rock <i>'n'</i> roll! <i>Let's</i> go!

102
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:16,808
Kill them cops!

103
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,758
Marcus!

104
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,879
Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, go!

105
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,008
- Get down!
- Drop the...!

106
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:35,482
- I <i>didn't</i> do shit!
- Get your hands up.

107
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,638
I <i>didn't</i> do it!

108
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,119
The radios were fucked up. Get some
medics over here. You guys okay?

109
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,564
- Yeah, we're fine.
- What you mean, "we"?

110
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,289
Motherfucker shot me
in the ass, man.

111
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:49,161
- Who shot you in the ass?
- Who? That "who" would be you.

112
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,240
- Me? I shot you?
- Yeah.

113
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,725
I mean, I was shooting.
Yeah, I did a lot of shooting.

114
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,244
But I <i>ain't</i> saying I shot you
in the ass.

115
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:59,917
I <i>ain't</i> saying I <i>didn't</i> shoot you...

116
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,718
...but, damn! Somebody shot you
in the ass.

117
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:04,958
Tell me about it.

118
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:07,199
- Yo, man, <i>how's</i> it feel?
- <i>It's</i> hot, man.

119
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,087
I can smell my ass burning.

120
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:12,281
Mike, you should give it a little kiss
so it'll feel better.

121
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,201
Pretend like we're not even here.

122
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:17,122
Hey, <i>isn't</i> Ricky Martin having
a concert? Get the fuck on.

123
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,008
- You always gotta go racial, man.
- <i>It's</i> sad, man.

124
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,841
I think <i>it's</i> cool. It hit the meat.
It <i>ain't</i> nowhere near the hole.

125
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,528
Two lousy bags?

126
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:32,278
What about the biggest shipment
of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam?

127
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,121
Let me worry about my snitch,
all right?

128
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,280
<i>It's</i> a lot of cop work for nothing!

129
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,246
Take your ass home somewhere.

130
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,282
Tonight <i>la policia</i> jacked my mules.

131
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:53,119
Who can tell me how those jackals
knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?

132
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,598
Speak up, cousins.

133
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,727
You're lucky they did not find
my drugs on <i>Dixie 7.</i>

134
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,643
Change the boat schedule.

135
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,118
We can't.
We got a shipment Thursday.

136
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,361
Change it after.
Just keep them guessing.

137
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,525
You know, unlike you, my daddy
<i>didn't</i> leave me no trust fund.

138
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,004
I got real-world shit
to deal with, Mike.

139
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,440
<i>I'm</i> not in it for the thrills.

140
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,565
Same old shit, different day.

141
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:23,202
All right, yes, damn.
I shot you, all right?

142
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:26,283
But <i>you'd</i> be seeing nothing at all
if I <i>hadn't</i> made my move.

143
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,007
I <i>don't</i> know why
you acting so angry.

144
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,366
- You're misinformed. <i>I'm</i> not angry.
- No, you're very angry.

145
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,281
No, <i>I'm</i> not angry.

146
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,967
You are angry. <i>It's</i> okay.

147
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,407
<i>I'm</i> not angry. Except when
you keep repeating "you're <i>angry."</i>

148
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:43,406
That <i>shit's</i> fucking annoying.

149
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,407
Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.

150
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,799
Just bugging the fuck out of me.

151
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,846
Good. I want you to say:

152
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,207
<i>" I'm</i> angry. <i>It's</i> okay.
I'll process my anger.

153
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,007
I love myself.

154
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,563
<i>Whoosah."</i>

155
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,287
I <i>don't</i> know what the fuck
you mean.

156
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,758
Yes, you do know what the fuck
I mean.

157
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,442
You're the one that needs therapy.

158
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,803
- I did my therapy.
- When?

159
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,967
Capt. Howard made me do it after
I shot them people at the airport.

160
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,680
Whoosah.

161
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,046
Whoosah!

162
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,082
Officer Mike.

163
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,759
- <i>Papi. That's</i> "daddy," right?
- Yeah.

164
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,203
Whoosah.

165
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,799
Mike, you go to therapy
to get your issues worked out...

166
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:29,761
...not bang your therapist.

167
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,205
- See, now you just talking nasty.
- I gotta survive.

168
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,887
I gotta start loving me for me.

169
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,080
That sound like that group thing.

170
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,918
Maybe I did the group thing
once or twice.

171
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,722
Whoosah.

172
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,164
- And whoosah.
- Whoosah.

173
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,084
A bunch of men hugging and kissing,
<i>that's</i> some cult shit.

174
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:27,638
Buy.

175
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,884
Ignore him, doc, <i>he's</i> blowing
this out of proportion.

176
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,843
My ass is <i>what's</i> out of proportion,
Mike, okay? I got a big chunk missing.

177
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,448
<i>It's</i> actually a small chunk.

178
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,924
This tension you bringing
into this relationship...

179
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,602
<i>...won't</i> be healthy
in the long run.

180
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,800
Maybe there <i>ain't</i> gonna be
no long run.

181
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,158
Whatever.

182
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,047
<i>He's</i> seeing a shrink. I mean...

183
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,802
<i>- Icepick, Lowrey.</i>
- Hey, brother.

184
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,887
Two bags? You embarrassed me
in front of my people.

185
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,202
Wait, brother. No, no, no, brother.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

186
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,843
Whatever. You better pray
to whoever it is you pray to...

187
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,564
...because you got 24 hours
to find that X before I find you.

188
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:52,803
<i>The cops hit my mule.</i>

189
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,688
Well, Mr. Tapia, I <i>don't</i> know
where the heat is coming from.

190
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:58,488
<i>It's a delicate situation</i>
<i>for both of us, isn't it?</i>

191
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,846
- <i>I'm</i> telling you, I've checked them.
- Alex, look. A <i>guy's</i> OD'ing.

192
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,328
<i>I'm</i> sorry, I gotta hang up.

193
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,838
Some fucking punk
thinks he can die in my club.

194
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,726
Ecstasy fucks them up.

195
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,921
- Get him out of here, Josef.
- We'll dump him around the block.

196
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,728
Dump him.

197
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,527
Auntie Syd, it must be so cool.

198
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,799
Young, single, living in New York.

199
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,159
Probably hook up
with a lot of cute guys.

200
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:50,805
- Just like <i>Sex and the City.</i>
- Theresa, cancel the damn cable.

201
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,765
So, Auntie Syd,
you're a cop too, huh?

202
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,608
Sort of. I work for the DEA,
but I just push a lot of papers.

203
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,919
- Nothing exciting.
- Well, you keep pushing papers.

204
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,679
<i>Don't</i> have to worry about
my little sister fighting crime.

205
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:03,838
Okay?

206
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,559
Possibly getting hurt.

207
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,762
James. Get my screwdriver.
Damn bolts.

208
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,124
Ignore him. <i>He's</i> being mean
because he got injured.

209
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,326
- Are you okay?
- His wound is fine. It's...

210
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,083
...other things
that were affected.

211
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,807
- Theresa!
- What?

212
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,363
You... <i>It's</i> just nerve damage,
<i>that's</i> all.

213
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:27,761
Y'all not gonna spoil it.

214
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:29,284
I'll talk to you about it.

215
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,286
<i>It's</i> a donut.

216
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,564
<i>It's</i> a medical thing.

217
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:43,687
I got it from a maternity store.
You know, pregnant women use it.

218
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,807
They can put one cheek here.
It take pressure off the other cheek.

219
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,120
- For you, dog.
- Thoughtful.

220
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,603
Look, man...

221
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,558
...last night there was something
different in your eyes.

222
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,602
You know, Mike, I had an epiphany.
You know?

223
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,607
- I realized you're an enigma.
- Yeah, I could see that.

224
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,642
God sent you here to test me.
But guess what?

225
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,647
You not gonna break me, Mike. No.

226
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,760
Whoosah.

227
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,522
Is that Syd?

228
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,600
- <i>That's</i> Syd.
- <i>Now's</i> not a good time.

229
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,720
Mike, listen, <i>now's</i> not a good time.

230
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,362
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

231
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,318
No throwing balls in the house.

232
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,244
Whoosah.

233
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,962
- <i>What's</i> up, Theresa?
- Hey.

234
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,000
Aw, they <i>ain't</i> tell me it was a luau.

235
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,681
Syd, hold up. Hold up.
Hold on.

236
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,409
Behave yourself, girl. Hey, hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,964
Oh, look at you. Look at you.

238
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,245
Oh, okay. Okay. I see now.

239
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,201
You <i>didn't</i> tell Marcus
about New York.

240
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:49,161
- He knows about New York.
- About us? You told him about us?

241
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,200
No, he knows about New York.

242
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:55,362
You know, <i>it's</i> a nice city and that I
dropped a witness off last month.

243
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,240
Mike is so sweet.

244
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:04,680
- So sweet he make your teeth rot.
- So have you told him yet?

245
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,797
Baby, soon, okay? Real soon.

246
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,240
He needs to know you're transferring
and <i>won't</i> be his partner anymore.

247
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,087
Theresa, timing is everything.

248
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,359
Marcus is not very happy
with me right now.

249
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:19,046
No, no, Syd, <i>I'm</i> telling you, that is
Scarface limping around in there.

250
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,121
We need to give that boy a few
minutes to let his butt heal up good.

251
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:24,160
We like each other.
<i>What's</i> the big deal?

252
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,207
<i>I'm</i> just gonna go tell him right now,
because this is dumb.

253
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,360
Hold up. Hold up. <i>I'm</i> gonna tell him.

254
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,838
It <i>ain't</i> like I <i>won't</i> tell him.
How am I not tell him?

255
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,601
- When?
- I need a minute.

256
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,006
Straight up. We're not vibing
right now. I just need a minute.

257
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:41,397
Mike, <i>he's</i> my brother, okay?
<i>Don't</i> be scared. Toughen up, chief.

258
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:44,248
Whoa. Hey.
Hey, I <i>ain't</i> say I was scared.

259
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:47,288
Just... <i>There's</i> something wrong
with your brother.

260
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:53,959
So, Mike, I understand you
were in New York last month.

261
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,082
Yeah, I was...

262
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,519
- Remember I did the thing?
- No.

263
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:02,003
You remember?

264
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,798
The two of you should've gotten
together. That would've been nice.

265
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,804
I never told you Mike was in New York.

266
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:10,802
Well, you know what, Mike?

267
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:14,126
Syd, <i>she's</i> gonna be in town,
what, another week?

268
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,359
Why <i>don't</i> you show her around?
<i>That'd</i> be nice.

269
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,848
That would be so great.

270
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,008
Yeah. Yeah, I could...
Well, me and...

271
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:24,846
Marcus, you want to show her
some stuff?

272
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,318
Yeah, because <i>I'm</i> in town
on vacation.

273
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,326
<i>I'm</i> staying
at the most amazing hotel.

274
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,282
The view, the pool. Oh, my God.

275
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:34,604
We got a pool right here.

276
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:37,648
That <i>ain't</i> exactly a pool, man.

277
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,119
<i>That's</i> like a big-ass puddle
wrapped in blue plastic.

278
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,923
<i>Didn't</i> they have any good pools
when you bought this one?

279
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:46,085
Megan, that pool cost $3900.

280
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,041
Okay, so how much
do the good pools cost?

281
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,158
- <i>It's</i> all right, baby.
- It is kind of whack, huh?

282
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,081
I gotta go meet somebody.
It was nice seeing you again, Mike.

283
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,160
Nice... Good to see you.

284
00:19:58,569 --> 00:19:59,558
Where you going?

285
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:00,804
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

286
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,601
I thought you were on vacation.

287
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,968
So glad you could join us, Mike.

288
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,002
<i>I'm</i> telling you, spending time like this
make a partnership strong.

289
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,961
Mike, can I see you
by my stupid pool?

290
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,681
<i>What's</i> the deal, baby?

291
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:16,367
Why you gotta always come over
here and try to take over, Mike?

292
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,566
- What are you talking about?
- This is my family, man. Okay?

293
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,999
- What are you talking about?
- My place of peace.

294
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,887
Are you taking medication?

295
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:25,926
You taking medicine
for the thing, right?

296
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,199
- <i>What'd</i> I do?
- Forget it. Just forget it.

297
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,837
- <i>What'd</i> I do?
- Mason, go fetch.

298
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,724
Oh, shit!

299
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,802
Now, that shit is funny.

300
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,203
<i>That's</i> some funny shit.

301
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,127
Oh, man, hold up.

302
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,084
Yo, Lowrey, you hot.

303
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,564
Thirty-nine hundred dollars.
Thirty-nine hundred.

304
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:58,284
You better pray to God you right
this time. Yo, dry off, sweetheart.

305
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,486
Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds
about to do a rip. <i>Let's</i> move.

306
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,160
All right, guys, smarten up.
Talk to me.

00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:17,880
<i>Eyes on, agents. Good luck.</i>

308
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:19,723
This is 105.

309

They're backing in.

310
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:24,918
<i>I got a good look.</i>

311
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:27,559
- We got a good eyeball.
- All right, we're in.

312
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,083
<i>What's</i> up?

313
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,681
You come highly recommended
out of New York.

314
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,006
You did some good jobs
for our Russian crew up there.

315
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,443
How old are you?

316
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:51,964
Old enough.

317
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,406
Come on. If you want to move
this stuff you gotta do it quick.

318
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,602
Wow, nice getup. You can start
to run these through.

319
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,561
<i>I'd</i> like to see
how your machine works.

320

Ooh, that sounded dirty.

00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:08,366
<i>" I would like to see how
your machine works, <i>baby."</i>

322
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:10,958
<i>I wouldn't be so crude.</i>

323
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:13,478
<i>I mean, I'm more of a refined kind</i>
<i>of a human being.</i>

324
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,682
You follow ballet?

325
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:21,403
Three of my cousins are dancing
with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.

326
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,801
I like hippie-hop too.

327
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,647
<i>I gave you 5000.</i>

328
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,123
<i>You gave me 4900.</i>

329
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:36,081
- I gave you 5000.
- 4900.

330
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,278
- 5000.
- Count it.

331
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:40,839
If you want to fuck with me again,
find yourself another chump.

332
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,438
Okay.

333
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,722
- How much?
- Three.

334
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,363
Look at this. Money everywhere.
Clean it up.

335
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,482
Okay, we want to change a little
over $3 million, all right?

336
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,962
How many jobs did you do with
my friends up there in New York?

337
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,118
Quite a few.

338
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,287
How you behave with me
has consequences for a lot of people.

339
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:03,525
You found me,
not the other way around.

340
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:07,085
You need me to change small bills to
large ones and deliver to a third party.

341
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:09,365
I bet <i>he'd</i> like his money
in a timely fashion.

342
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:12,037
<i>Delivery's</i> late, <i>it's</i> your ass,

for your 50,000 in 10s.

344
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,643
Third party takes his million
in these five briefcases here.

345
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,562
- I hope <i>I'm</i> not losing you, chief.
- I hate math.

346
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:36,283
So for your $3 million
that we shrunk for you...

347
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,559
...you get 2 million in clean money
back.

348
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,488
Less our percentage: $300,000.

349
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,239
- I'll be delivering these to your dealer.
- Alexei.

350
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,405
- What?
- We're giving too fucking much away.

351
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:56,157
Yeah, we'll call the general,
renegotiate.

Stand by.

364
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,367
I <i>don't</i> want to get spotted,
take a burn.

365
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,844
Zoepound a bunch of pirates, man.

Heads up, guys.
I got an orange muscle car.

372
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,164

375

Get over here, <i>I'm</i> undercover.

- All right.

- I <i>can't</i> tell you that.
- Why not?

451
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,040
Because I have a career and if I
want to keep it, I have rules to follow.

452

<i>What's</i> that mean?

We <i>didn't</i> sink it.

496
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:15,486
Whoosah.

497
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:21,487
All right, the positive.
Thank God no cops died.

498
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:26,484
The negative: I got a police
commissioner so far up my ass...

499
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:29,601
...if he spits <i>it's</i> coming out
of my mouth.

500
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:35,005
But I know that <i>there's</i>
always two sides to a story.

501
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:36,922
So, <i>what's</i> yours?

502
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,637
Well, I was at a family barbecue.

503
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,646
We got a tip that the Zoepounders...

504
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:45,279
...were gonna do a hit on cash or
drugs from this big-time X-Man.

505
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,758
<i>That's</i> what they call
a ecstasy dealer on the streets.

506
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,005
Marcus, I know what they call them.

507
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,040
<i>That's</i> why <i>I'm</i> captain. <i>It's</i> cool.

508
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:53,968
So you got the drugs.

509
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:58,606
No drugs. Oh, okay. All right.
How about the money?

510
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:00,158
- No money.
- Nope.

511
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,728
Then who is this X-Man?

512
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:04,518
Captain, I was at a family barbecue.
So l...

513
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:07,442
We <i>don't</i> know,
but we are going to find out.

514
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:09,520
Well, then all that...

515
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,123
...was for nothing?
- We <i>didn't</i> do all of that.

516
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:15,002
If you look close...
Watch. Hold up. Let me s...

517
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:18,764
<i>There's</i> DEA all over.
Wait, the... Wait, hold up.

518
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,920
The DEA? Without consulting me?!

519
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:22,682
<i>That's</i> a DEA car right there.

520
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:25,487
Christ! Fuck!

521
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:28,880
Cap. No. Remember
your pressure points.

522
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:31,364
Do my... My exercises.

523
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:33,401
- Holler at your boy.
- Whoosah.

524
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,763
Twenty-one thousand?
What?!

525
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,406
Oh, kiss my black ass.

526
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:43,721
It was the dashboard.

527
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:46,804
- You know what?
- Better.

528
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,402
Yeah, you'll get your money.

529
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,639
<i>Somebody's</i> on they way
with your money.

530
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,168
Is it possible we could discuss
potential reimbursement...

531
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,321
We <i>don't</i> cover personal property.
<i>That's</i> why we drive police cars.

532
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,081
So where do we go from here?

533
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,847
Zoepounders knew exactly when
to hit the drop, where to hit the drop...

534
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,920
...so we figure they know
where the cash is.

535
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,886
We find the cash, we find the X-Man.

536
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,280
Hey, <i>I'm</i> through playing games,
all right? I have three cops critical.

537
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:15,168
I got kids dying on my streets
from souped-up X.

538
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:19,004
I do not want these animals
taking over my city.

539
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,284
Do you understand?

540
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:24,044
So I want you guys to do whatever you
do, whatever it takes, but do it now.

541
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,968
<i>It's</i> not good, boss.

542
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:39,562
Oh, my God.

543
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,927
Fucking <i>ratones</i> eating
my fucking money.

544
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:50,600
Carlos, this is a stupid
fucking problem to have.

545
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:54,120
But it is a problem nonetheless.

546
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,168
Rat fuckers.

547
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:57,882
Rat fuckers.

548
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,723
Boss, it ended up crazy.

549
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:06,041
This black <i>chica</i> working for the
Russians was a maniac lunatic.

550
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,198
She saved your money.

551
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:09,644
She wasted some Haitians
and got the load to the drop.

552
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,607
Also, Roberto saw these two
crazy gangbanger homeys.

553
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,521
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah. Chasing and shooting.

554
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:17,563
Old days, did I have
this problem? No.

555
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:21,165
Just fly the drugs in
and ship the money out.

556
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:26,966
Now American <i>security's</i>
so goddamned tight over the water...

557
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,278
...and in the sky...

558
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:31,646
...that the rats eat my money
before I can get it to Cuba.

559
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:35,961
- You see?
<i>- Fiery crash...</i>

560
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:39,883
I <i>can't</i> even get my money across town
without making the news.

561
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,238
Hey, man. Man.

562
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,003
Tell me...

563
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:47,522
...should I be worried?

564
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:49,725
- No, boss.
- Shut the fuck up.

565
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,961
People is trying to jack my loads
here in Miami.

566
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:55,967
I own this fucking town. You see?

567
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:57,557
This is my town.

568
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,639
Oh, my God. Pink.

569
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:04,841
Pink, <i>niña,</i> pink. Pink.
No powder blue.

570
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:06,158
Pink is prettier.

571
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:09,241
But the lady at the store
said I look like a model.

572
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:14,762
You're lucky your mother
was my <i>mother's</i> cousins.

573
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,687
<i>Don't</i> pay attention to Roberto.

574
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:20,681
Besides, models are filthy creatures.

575
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,726
You look more like an angel.

576
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:25,567
- What do you think, Carlos?
- Of course.

577
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:28,402
- Roberto, what do you think?
- <i>It's</i> fucking beautiful.

578
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:33,481
Talk polite in front
of my little bonbon...

579
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,963
...or <i>I'm</i> gonna chop your balls off.

580
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,564
For real, <i>I'm</i> straight with all your
spiritual enlightenment and that shit.

581
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:46,205
But I need to know if a crackhead rolls
to me with a.9, you'll cook that fool.

582
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,519
No question about it.
Shoot him in the leg.

583
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:50,122
Come on with that leg shit.

584
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,247
- Everybody deserves a little dignity.
- What about my dignity?

585
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:56,207
Your crackhead will be missing
a kneecap. I'll be in a body bag.

586
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:58,325
- So sad.
- <i>What's</i> so sad?

587
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,089
Your untreated control issues.

588
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:02,568
<i>It's</i> not your fault.

589
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,245
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

590
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,526
Your mama probably refused you
her tit when you were a baby.

591
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:11,362
You grew up a malnourished
high-school softie.

592
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,997
Got your gun, little tight T-shirt...

593
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:16,683
...and became
a overcompensating tough guy.

594
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:22,679
That is the last time you will ever
refer to my <i>mother's</i> titties.

595
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,799
I <i>don't</i> even want them
up in your head.

596
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:31,524
You know, I said all that, Mike,
and all you heard was "titties."

597
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:35,042
Man, you <i>can't</i> keep suppressing
my spiritual growth, Mike.

598
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:38,360
You need to suppress my <i>mother's</i>
titties out of your psychoanalysis.

599
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:42,124
You just remember one thing,
my friend. I may not always be here.

600
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,046
<i>What's</i> up, Icepick?

601
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,006
Jesus is the way, my brothers.
Step inside.

602
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:53,319
You just went number one
on Uncle <i>Mike's</i> shit list.

603
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:56,322
- We got two lousy bags, man.
- My brothers.

604
00:44:56,489 --> 00:44:58,525
Haitian blond with dreads.
Where is he?

605
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,168
Blondie Dread?

606
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:03,719
<i>He's</i> very expensive.

607
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:07,518
You and you
have to do something for me.

608
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:09,919
Oh, you trying to get gangster
on me like that?

609
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:12,359
- Yeah, he went gangster.
- So we should probably...

610
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:14,918
- So we want to do the... You got them?
- Yeah, sure.

611
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:18,923
Me and my partner, we're on
the Miami PD tandem dance team.

612
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:21,319
We got a routine.
We won all the local talent shows.

613
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:22,888
We thinking about going national.

614
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,324
You want to show him
some of the routine?

615
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:28,402
Warm it up. <i>Don't</i> hurt nothing.

616
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:29,922
Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this.

617
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,284
This the shit right here.
This is the shit.

618
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:43,683
- What you doing to my shop?!
- Watch this spin.

619
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:44,918
Wait.

620
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,880
- What are you doing?!
- Oh, give me some.

621
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:51,637
You're ruining my shop. Stop!

622
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,882
- Do the dance thing.
- <i>I'm</i> gonna bring the house down.

623
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:02,401
Stop! Stop!

624
00:46:03,049 --> 00:46:06,803
He lives in a pink house
eight blocks from here on Carl Street.

625
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:13,768
One...

626
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:16,167
- Police! Get down.
- Police!

627
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,726
Who that? Who in my house?!

628
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:56,888
- <i>I'm</i> the devil, <i>who's</i> asking?!
- The devil is not welcome here!

629
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,967
You got to call yourself the devil
in his house?! Shit!

630
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:02,721
You're in my house!

631
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:04,641
This is all your fault!

632
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:07,403
- You're in my country, though.
- Fuck you, <i>how's</i> that?

633
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:10,402
- <i>I'm</i> gonna kill you, motherfucker!
- Your country, my ass!

634
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:13,879
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

635
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:15,478
You no problem!

636
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:18,243
Mike, do you have to be
so combative?

637
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:19,842
Fucking...!

638
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,081
You calling me a bitch?!

639
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:25,604
Do or die, man!

640
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,807
A bullet in the head'll
really mess up your extensions.

641
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:31,529
Take your bullet
and eat that shit, man.

642
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:33,202
How about that?

643
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,248
What the fuck?

644
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:49,682
Sir, we just want to talk.

645
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:52,283
You want to talk?! Well, go ahead.
Go ahead.

646
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:53,962
We're not lmmigration.

647
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:57,121
They <i>can't</i> hear you because
they're still shooting at you.

648
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:01,160
Fucking Haitians in
a fucking little-ass room...

649
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:03,803
...with fucking guns. Shit!

650
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:18,726
Got to make it home to my babies.
Damn, now.

651
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,958
Motherfucker! You killed my brother!

652
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:33,248
<i>That's</i> a bitch!

653
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,326
Shoot them. Fucking shoot them.

654
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:41,886
They shot me.
They got me, man. Yo!

655
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:56,644
Got you.

656
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:02,325
Oh, shit! Motherfucker!

657
00:49:02,529 --> 00:49:03,723
They killed the boy!

658
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:05,083
They kill me!

659
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:06,887
They're killing everybody!

660
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:09,762
Motherfucker!

661
00:49:14,649 --> 00:49:16,002
My eyes!

662
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,921
<i>I'm</i> gonna kill you, motherfucker!

663
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:24,168
Come. Come kill me, motherfucker.

664
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:26,400
Come. You <i>don't</i> take me alive.

665
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:28,446
You got three seconds
to drop your weapon!

666
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,008
I got a present for you!

667
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,081
- A nice present for you!
- One!

668
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,646
- Two!
- <i>I'm</i> gonna kill you.

669
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:46,084
<i>Don't</i> shoot. <i>Don't</i> shoot, man.
<i>Don't</i> kill me.

670
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:52,760
- Bullets and all... Excuse me.
- You all right, man?

671
00:49:55,129 --> 00:49:58,201
Apologize to that man.
Apologize to that man.

672
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:00,604
Apologize! Apologize.

673
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:03,121
Hey, listen, I owe you...

674
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:05,923
<i>It's</i> just that, you know,
you was disrespect...

675
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,762
But that <i>don't</i> mean it give me
the right, though. It don't.

676
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:11,358
Excuse me. Whoosah. Whoosah.

677
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:13,281
Whoosah, motherfucker!

678
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:19,526
See, the interesting thing is <i>he's</i>
the one of us <i>that's</i> not pissed off.

679
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:22,362
- I <i>don't</i> know nothing.
- I <i>didn't</i> ask you no question yet!

680
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:24,008
- I <i>don't</i> know nothing.
- Lying already?

681
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:26,205
- No, get...
- <i>How'd</i> you know about the drop?

682
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:28,121
- I <i>don't</i> know nothing!
- Stop lying!

683
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:29,688
Do you know anything?

684
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:32,729
<i>I'm</i> gonna be nice about it.
Do you know anything?

685
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,847
<i>Let's</i> ask some other suspects.

686
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:38,081
- Hey, look, man, fuck it.
- <i>Let's</i> try this. <i>Let's</i> talk to his homeys.

687
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:40,721
Hey, look here, man.

688
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,484
Can you tell me who was driving
the black Suburban?

689
00:50:45,729 --> 00:50:47,606
Oh, he <i>don't</i> know nothing.

690
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:49,919
His brains is under the end table.

691
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,641
He <i>can't</i> tell us shit, Mike.

692
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:57,243
- <i>He's</i> all fucked up.
- <i>What's</i> your point?

693
00:50:57,609 --> 00:50:59,804
Dead suspects <i>can't</i> say shit.

694
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:03,848
It seems like live suspects <i>don't</i> say
shit either, so I'll hot this dude here.

695
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:06,079
- Save us the paperwork.
- I <i>don't</i> know nothing!

696
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:09,321
I <i>don't</i> do motherfucking surveillance,
man. He do surveillance.

697
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:11,684
He <i>don't</i> let nobody
touch his camera.

698
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:16,798
- <i>What's</i> on that camera?
- Trigger Mike strikes again.

699
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:19,480
<i>Hi, welcome to Phat's.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

700
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:22,483
- Miami PD.
- Whoa. <i>Cops.</i> I love that show.

701
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,084
- We need to see <i>what's</i> on this video.
- Absolutely.

702
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,685
You got a little bullet hole in there.
You guys tell me about it?

703
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:32,168
Guess not. We'll put this
in our central floor model.

704
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,559
It has kick-ass bass.
You like hip-hop? I love it.

705
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:38,278
We freestyle in the break room. If you
guys ever want to kick it, we'll flow.

706
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:41,886
We're gonna set you up on
the wide-screen. Correct ratio.

707
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:43,687
There you go.

708
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:49,037
<i>"Spanish Palms Mortuary."</i>

709
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:52,958
Why would they be doing
surveillance at a funeral home?

710
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:54,723
Is that a Cuban flag?

711
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,762
Right there. See the gun?

712
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:00,763
Never knew guards at funeral homes
needed to carry them kind of weapons.

713
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,845
It just seems like
we should turn it off...

714
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:07,488
...because my dad owns the store.

715
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:09,237
She got a tongue ring.

716
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:13,888
- This is like a porno. We're not...
- Dude. Dude.

717
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:15,323
- All right?
- Yeah.

718
00:52:17,129 --> 00:52:18,482
Okay. Okay.

719
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,958
<i>It's</i> just, you know,
my <i>dad's</i> gonna be...

720
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:22,642
I just need to... I think l...

721
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,765
- I think I screwed this up.
- Relax.

722
00:52:26,129 --> 00:52:29,326
- My <i>dad's</i> gonna... This is like a porno.
<i>- Oh, yeah. I want more.</i>

723
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,440
- Okay.
- This is official police business.

724
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:37,444
- What the <i>fuck's</i> going on here?
- Out of my way.

725
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,645
My dad is coming.
My dad is coming.

726
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:42,361
What the hell is going on
in my store?

727
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:46,799
Son, how did this porno crap get
on my videos in my store?!

728
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:49,678
What the hell is going on in here?!

729
00:52:51,649 --> 00:52:54,561
- You all right?
- No, <i>I'm</i> not all right, Mike.

730
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:58,598
Three days of this shit.
Got my nerves all rattled.

731
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:03,961
My ass still hurts...

732
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:07,078
<i>... from what you did to it</i>
<i>the other night.</i>

733
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,723
Oh, my Lord.

734
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:10,921
Yeah, it got rough.

735
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:12,718
You know?

736
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:16,638
I mean, we got caught up
in the moment, shit got crazy.

737
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:17,924
You know how I get.

738
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:24,245
<i>When you popped me from behind,</i>
<i>I think you damaged some nerves.</i>

739
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:25,798
Okay.

740
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:28,161
Now, I can't...

741
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,079
I can't... Now, I can't...

742
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,281
- <i>Can't</i> what?
- I <i>can't</i> even get an erection.

743
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:37,566
<i>What's</i> an erection?

744
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:41,438
I tried taking Viagra, you know,
pop one, pop two.

745
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:43,441
Been eating them like Skittles.

746
00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:46,169
That poor man is pouring out
his heart.

747
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:48,880
And <i>I'm</i> still flaccid.

748
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:51,803
Okay. <i>I'm</i> comfortable talking
to you...

749
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,960
<i>It's</i> got 5.1 Dolby.

750
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:57,127
<i>... about what I did to your ass...</i>

751
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,964
...but you not getting an erection...

752
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,880
<i>...that's</i> a real problem for me.

753
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:05,438
- I just figured I could talk to you.
- Yeah. No, no.

754
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,761
We're... We partners, but we are
partners with boundaries.

755
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:12,088
We got a new rule.

756
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:16,083
From now on you <i>can't</i> say
the word "flaccid" to me.

757
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:18,127
<i>He's</i> a mean fuck.

758
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,519
Look here.
This is our little boundary box.

759
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,441
So we gonna take the word
<i>"flaccid"...</i>

760
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:25,288
...and we're gonna put it in there
with my <i>mom's</i> titties...

761
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:28,600
...with your erection problems,
and we're gonna close this box...

762
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:30,805
...and we're gonna throw
this bitch in the ocean.

763
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,927
And the only way that you can
get to this box...

764
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:36,887
...is you got to be motherfucking
Jacques Cousteau.

765
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:38,642
We cool?

766
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:47,520
Oh, shit.

767
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,681
We gotta go.

768
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:53,127
In front of my babies you got porno
and homo shows up in here?

769
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,359
What kind of freak-ass store is this?

770
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,003
And you two motherfuckers
need Jesus.

771
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,762
Cover your ears, baby.

772
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:04,238
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...

773
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:06,326
...which, after 17 layers of bullshit...

774
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:09,566
...turns out to be registered
to Donna Maria Tapia...

775
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,324
...mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,
who calls himself Johnny.

776
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:15,565
Johnny Tapia. Shit.

777
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:17,725
Every time the PD goes after him...

778
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:20,966
...he sues for wrongful arrest.
And, oh, does he win.

779
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:23,637
Last year he was awarded $9 million.

780
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:26,767
And got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.

781
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:28,925
Well, he <i>hasn't</i> run across us yet.

782
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:31,324
<i>We'd</i> love to hear <i>what's</i> going on
in that house.

783
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,838
Use your computer brain
and tap the phone.

784
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:40,078
Well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.

785
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:45,602
We were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.

786
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,003
No, I <i>can't</i> do that.

787
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:49,598
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.

788
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:52,084
With thick-ass glasses
you <i>don't</i> need floor seats.

789
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,007
He can see the game
from the parking lot.

790
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:57,758
- I <i>can't</i> work under these conditions.
- Floor seats to the Heat. You got it.

791
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:00,164
- Lakers.
- Yes, Lakers.

792
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:01,961
Okay. Watch me work.

793
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,399
<i>Hello? Is this the pest control?</i>

794
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:18,123
<i>Yeah. We got a fucking problem.</i>

795
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:19,648
<i>You know where we live.</i>

796
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,999
<i>- Yeah, South Miami.</i>
- We got it.

797
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:23,718
Got our way in.

798
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:25,726
- Illegally?
- You got to put a word to it.

799
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:26,964
<i>It's</i> like, secret.

800
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:28,803
So y'all want to kill roaches?

801
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:31,648
- Illegal.
- We'll plant a couple gypsy wires...

802
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,202
<i>... find out what Tapia's up to.</i>

803
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,559
These are your basic household bugs.

804
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,088
Dog, this is what we do.

805
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:43,398
- <i>What's</i> the sprayers for?
- The roaches.

806
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,840
- Roaches? We got rats.
- Say what?

807
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:49,119
<i>That's</i> not an issue.
We can handle that.

808
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:52,366
We'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.

809
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:55,317
Nope. Nope. I <i>don't</i> mess
with no rats.

810
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:57,360
Hey. Stop it.

811
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:00,879
- We're in. Get your head right.
- Mike, <i>I'm</i> a grown-ass man.

812
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,603
Get your grown-ass self together
and <i>let's</i> do this.

813
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:08,361
- You got a beautiful house, sir.
- Well, start looking.

814
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:11,398
They're all over.

815
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:19,758
Those <i>ain't</i> normal rats.

816
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,608
What he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.

817
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:25,198
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.

818
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:27,685
Disposing of the rats <i>isn't</i> a problem.

819
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:30,608
But we should ensure <i>there's</i> no
breeding elsewhere in the house.

820
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:32,447
Yeah, at Zook...

821
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,607
...we like to work from the outside in,
you know.

822
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:38,403
So we gonna leave these...
Excuse me.

823
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:40,964
We'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.

824
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:43,319
<i>It'd</i> be better to begin
in the rest of the house.

825
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:45,167
You're not getting
in the rest of the house.

826
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:47,166
We <i>won't</i> be able
to guarantee our work.

827
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:49,606
The only thing that we can
guarantee...

828
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:52,403
...is that these rats will keep fucking.

829
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:55,077
Giving off offspring
until we find the colony.

830
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,287
Rats <i>don't</i> got no stinking colony.

831
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:59,207
Well, actually these are colonial rats.

832
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,481
What they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...

833
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,407
Marsupials.

834
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,282
Marsupials.

835
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:10,442
These drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.

836
00:58:10,649 --> 00:58:13,447
They just looking for rat pussy.

837
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:17,164
- You know.
- Are you fucking with me?

838
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,889
Hold on. You called us.
We can leave.

839
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:23,320
But what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.

840
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:26,441
All right. Down there. Just kill them
and bring me the bill.

841
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,837
<i>That's</i> that bullshit.
<i>That's</i> that bullshit right there.

842
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,601
- You see these rats?
- Plant your wires.

843
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:36,243
- You're not leaving me with them.
- Plant your wires.

844
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:40,599
Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef.

845
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:44,478
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
<i>"Gentlemen."</i>

846
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:48,125
<i>I'm</i> just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.

847
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:50,644
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?

848
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:53,204
Of course. And you? Josef.

849
00:58:53,409 --> 00:58:55,877
<i>I'm</i> told you're a wine connoisseur.

850
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:57,078
I am.

851
00:58:57,569 --> 00:59:02,199
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and
Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come.

852
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:11,006
- Where the fuck you going?
- Pretty bad problem you got here.

853
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:14,366
<i>I'm</i> gonna head down to the truck,
get some poison pellets and stuff.

854
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:16,321
Come straight back.
No screwing around.

855
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:21,478
They're all over.

856
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:24,324
Nice place you got here.

857
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:30,006
<i>It's</i> Mama's. And <i>it's</i> a shithole.
Built a fucking million years ago.

858
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,643
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.

859
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:37,320
My new place <i>I'm</i> building in Cuba.

860
00:59:37,529 --> 00:59:41,204
Almost finished. Everything fucking
shiny new. Come on upstairs.

861
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:43,848
Oh, shit.

862
00:59:44,609 --> 00:59:47,567
Oh, shit! Look at the balls
on that motherfucker.

863
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:27,318
Roberto...

864
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:31,158
<i>...the general's office camera is out.</i>
- Everything in this house is broken.

865
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:39,718
My <i>wire's</i> planted.

866
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,045
- <i>How about yours?</i>
- Almost got three wires planted.

867
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:48,838
Mike!

868
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:53,198
<i>There's</i> a papa rat humping
the shit out of this mama rat.

869
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:55,764
No, <i>he's</i> straight pile-driving her!

870
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:58,927
Now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?

871
01:00:59,249 --> 01:01:01,080
They fuck just like us.

872
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:02,967
<i>Where's</i> the pest guy?

873
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:21,801
<i>There's</i> something going on
down here.

874
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:38,326
Goddamn rats.

875
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,800
Yeah, they everywhere.
Just like cockroaches.

876
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:43,887
No disrespect...

877
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:48,082
...but I do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.

878
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:52,083
<i>It's</i> baffling. You secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?

879
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:56,003
<i>Let's</i> wait for Josef. You know,
me and digits.

880
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:59,037
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?

881
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:14,083
So...

882
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:18,480
...your partner is here.

883
01:02:21,089 --> 01:02:22,363
Would you like to talk now?

884
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:26,484
Carlos, another box.

885
01:02:29,529 --> 01:02:34,080
So you sign over ownership papers
for all the Florida clubs you own...

886
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:36,080
...and I will control everything...

887
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:38,558
...from point of origin to sale. Okay?

888
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:42,119
No middleman. Especially Russian
middleman.

889
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:44,797
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...

890
01:02:45,609 --> 01:02:48,965
...in my country, I see such things
all the time.

891
01:02:49,129 --> 01:02:50,847
<i>I'm</i> sorry for your country.

892
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:54,644
That must be some Cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.

893
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:57,283
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.

894
01:02:57,449 --> 01:03:02,000
I, me, Johnny Tapia,
will sever your head off!

895
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:05,406
You kill me and you will have
a shit-storm.

896
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:12,527
Should I screw your young wife...

897
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:15,801
...or visit your son,
the soccer player?

898
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:19,839
My daughter knows your son.

899
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:32,885
- You're gonna regret this.
- I hope that we can remain friends.

900
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:36,206
Because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...

901
01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:38,047
...honour.

902
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:43,680
Without this,
we are no more than beasts.

903
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:58,640
The kitchen <i>monitor's</i> out.

904
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:00,802
What the <i>hell's</i> going on out there?

905
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:05,441
Shit.

906
01:04:06,649 --> 01:04:08,446
I found something.

907
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:16,564
<i>- It's a guy's finger.</i>
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?

908
01:04:17,529 --> 01:04:20,919
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, I was just looking for you.

909
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,040
I think I figured out your problem.

910
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:25,041
Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.

911
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:28,404
Blow out!

912
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:30,725
- <i>What's</i> going on? Shit!
- <i>Get out of the house!</i>

913
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:37,124
This <i>shit's</i> got to stop.

914
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,688
Fuck!

915
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:48,528
We should go.

916
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:53,442
Go! Go!

917
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:55,167
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.

918
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:03,606
- Damn! Go!
- Come on!

919
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:13,885
Roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...

920
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:15,926
...that tried to hijack the drop, boss.

921
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:20,479
How did this thing happen?

922
01:05:22,729 --> 01:05:26,768
I <i>don't</i> know. We called the rat people
and these guys showed up.

923
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:28,721
Maybe you're the rat, huh?

924
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:33,727
They tried to steal from me, and
you let them into my <i>mother's</i> house.

925
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:35,885
Johnny. Hey, no.

926
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:37,761
I would never...

927
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:42,880
Nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...

928
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:44,883
...or my money.

929
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:52,045
Send him to the mortuary.

930
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:55,999
Johnny. Johnny,
what happened to Roberto?

931
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:58,558
He killed himself, Mama.

932
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:04,005
- Very sad.
- Write a nice letter to his mother.

933
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,488
I'll do it.

934
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:07,202
Okay. Bye.

935
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:12,240
- Yo, run the print.
- Mike, stop playing, man!

936
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:15,009
- Run the print.
- <i>Don't</i> touch me with no dead finger.

937
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:19,680
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.

938
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:21,238
Thank you.

939
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:23,724
Think you can find out
<i>what's</i> on these shreds?

940
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:25,203
Of course.

941
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,599
We're thinking about ordering lunch.

942
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:33,603
Should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?

943
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,445
<i>" Couple of grape sodas."</i>

944
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:39,809
- Very funny. <i>That's</i> hilarious.
- <i>Isn't</i> it low tide?

945
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:40,998
I think it is.

946
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,240
- <i>Don't</i> you have relatives to pick up?
- What?

947
01:06:44,449 --> 01:06:47,486
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no, <i>that's</i> not funny.

948
01:06:47,689 --> 01:06:50,886
We're fucking with you. We planted
wires, we need some help. No bullshit.

949
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,520
I want you...

950
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:01,087
...to find out...

951
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:04,487
...who those two black
<i>puta de mierda</i> are.

952
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:08,599
And I want them lying right here...

953
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:12,962
...in <i>Mama's</i> garden
in these coffins!

954
01:07:14,169 --> 01:07:17,127
And our mystery finger
belongs to:

955
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:19,405
Josef Kuninskavich.

956
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:22,077
He was a lieutenant in a Russian mob.

957
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,684
Owned a couple dozen
Florida nightclubs.

958
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:27,323
<i>Tapia's</i> starting to knock off
Russian mob bosses.

959
01:07:29,609 --> 01:07:31,042
Got something.

960
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:32,644
What you got, dickhead?

961
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:35,369
The computer matches half tones,
grey tones, densities.

962
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,918
Sort of like a visual code-breaking.

963
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:40,000
Little something I put together.

964
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:44,567
The shredded papers was a photo.
Some kind of boat. <i>"Dixie 7."</i>

965
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,758
<i>Dixie 7.</i>

966
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:50,800
- <i>It's</i> registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- The Poteet brothers.

967
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:55,522
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?

968
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,045
Mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?

969
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:01,200
Listen to what we got at Tapia's.

970
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:09,922
The second-in-command is talking.

971
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:14,367
<i>He's</i> telling him, "Yes, boss. We
found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...

972
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:17,367
...and we're getting them <i>emptied."</i>
- Fat does emptied?

973
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:20,601
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.

974
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:24,807
<i>- You know who I am?</i>
<i>- Name sounds familiar.</i>

975
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:26,925
<i>Sense of humour. I lik</i> e <i>that.</i>

976
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:30,328
<i>Meet me on the sand,</i>
<i>2:00, Shore Club.</i>

977
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:33,885
- She has no idea. <i>Let's</i> roll.
- Y'all come with us.

978
01:08:43,129 --> 01:08:45,404
I ordered a couple
of Bacardi Mojitos.

979
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:51,643
Miami.

980
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:56,927
Okay, zoom in on nine.
A little more audio, please.
