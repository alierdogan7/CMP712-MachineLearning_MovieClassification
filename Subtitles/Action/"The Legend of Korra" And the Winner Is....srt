1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,073
Earth

2
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:03,769
Fire

3
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:05,556
Air

4
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,225
Water

5
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:11,954
Only the <i>Avatar</i> can master 
the four elements

6
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:14,561
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:19,891
The Legend of Korra

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,283
After a close encounter with Amon

9
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,858
Korra took a little absence from Tarrlok task-forces.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,860
But the Avatar still had it work

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,822
bringing the Fire Ferrets to 
the pro-bending championship finals.

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,550
Only one team stand in their way : 
The Wolf-Bats

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,241
Lead by team captain, Tahno,the brutal
Wolf-Bats look to repetitive champs.

14
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,926
Have the Fire Ferrets finally 
met their match?

15
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,148
Book I: Air
Chapter six : And the Winner is...

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,894
The music hour brought to you by 
Cabbage corp.

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,607
Republic City's trusted name in
technology for fifty years.

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,340
Man, I got a good feeling 
about tonight.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,988
I don't care if we are the underdogs, 
we can take those Wolf-Bats.

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,996
It's gonna be our toughest match ever,
but I think you're right.

21
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,490
Introducing your new champs:

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,955
the fantastic Fire Ferrets!

23
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:24,137
Good morning citizen of Republic City.

24
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:25,627
This is Amon.

25
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,464
I hope you all enjoyed last night 
pro-bending match

26
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,301
because it'll be the last.

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:37,556
It's time for this city to stop worshiping bending athletes 
as if they were heroes.

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,069
I'm calling on the Council to 
shut down the bending arena

29
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,480
and cancels the finals. Or else...

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,124
there'll be severe consequence.

31
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:52,321
- That guy's got some nerve.
- You think the Council will give him.

32
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,866
I'm not waiting to find out.
We need to get to the city hall.

33
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,250
Korra, you shouldn't be here,
this a closed meeting.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,892
As the Avatar and a Pro-Bending player
I have a right to be heard.

35
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,505
You can't cancel the finals.

36
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,323
I know winning the championship 
means a lot to you.

37
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:16,053
But as far as I am concerned 
we need to shut the arena down.

38
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:20,682
What about the rest of you? Tarlokk 
there's no way you're backing down for Amon, right?

39
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,294
Actually, Tenzin and I agree for once.

40
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,064
The Council is unanimous.
We're closing the arena.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,864
No, you can't.

42
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:33,420
I don't understand, I thought, you, 
out of all people would take a stand against Amon.

43
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,074
While I'm still committed to bring 
that lunatic to justice,

44
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,791
I'll not put innocent lives at stakes,

45
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,038
just so you and your friend can 
play a game.

46
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:45,683
Pro-bending might only be a game to you,

47
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,538
but think of what it means to the city.

48
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:51,249
right now the Arena is the one place
where Benders and non-Benders

49
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,786
gather together and in peace

50
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:56,593
- to watch Bender...
- Beat each other up!

51
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,055
In peace!
It's an inspiration to everyone!

52
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,653
I appreciate your naive idealism

53
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:05,227
but you're ignoring the reality 
of the situation.

54
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,873
The reality is, if you close the Arena,
you let Amon win.

55
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes, exactly what she said! Yes.

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,113
I'm sorry, but our decision has been made.
This meet is adjourned.

57
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:25,330
I can't believe I'm saying this, 
but I agree with the Avatar.

58
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,916
- You do?
- Yeah, you do?

59
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,253
I expected this cut and run response
from Tenzin.

60
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:35,743
But the rest of you?
Come on, show a little more backbone.

61
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,322
It's time that the bender of this city

62
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:41,680
to display some strength 
and unity against these Equalist.

63
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,359
But we must prevent the conflict 
between Benders and non-Benders

64
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,352
from escalating into all-out war!

65
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,938
The Council isn't changing 
his position.

66
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,092
Now, just a moment Tenzin.

67
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:56,270
Let us hear what our esteemed chief 
of police has in mind.

68
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,211
If you keep the Arena open

69
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:03,577
my metal benders and I 
will provide extra security 
during the championship match.

70
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,138
There's no better forces to deal 
with the Chi-blockers.

71
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,623
Our armors is impervious 
to their attacks.

72
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,191
Are you saying that you will 
personally take responsibility

73
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,880
for the safety of the spectator 
in the Arena.

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,465
I guarantee it.

75
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,635
It is hard to argue with Chief Bei Fong
track record.

76
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,511
If she's confident her elite officer 
can protect the Arena,

77
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,579
then she has my support.

78
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm changing my vote.
Who else's with me?

79
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,399
The Arena stays open.

80
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,898
Good luck in the finals.

81
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,490
And good luck to you
Chief Bei Fong.

82
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,672
A word please, Lin.

83
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:48,830
Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want
to see you get hurt.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,535
I know what I'm doing and the risk 
that come with it.

85
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,135
In that case, I'm going to be 
by your side during the match.

86
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,461
You don't need to baby-sit me.

87
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,383
It's for Korra.
I want to make sure she's safe.

88
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,178
Do what you want.
It's not like I've ever been able
to stop you before.

89
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,410
Excuse me Chief Bei Fong, 
I want to thanks you for your help.

90
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,022
It... really... means... a lot.

91
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:13,852
What is her deal? Even when 
she's on my side she's against me.

92
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:15,857
I've known Lin she's we're children.

93
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,528
She's always been...challenging.

94
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,864
What did your father do to
make her hate the Avatar so much?

95
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,365
My father and Lin got along famously.

96
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,245
I'm afraid her issue is me.

97
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,765
Wait a second.

98
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:32,754
It all makes sense now!

99
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:36,378
You and Bei Fong, Bei Fong and you,
you two were a couple!

100
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,131
What? Where did you get that idea?

101
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,049
Your wife.

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,906
I'll have a word with her.

103
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:48,161
So Pema stole you from Bei Fong.

104
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,784
I'm surprise our esteemed chief of 
police didn't throw her in jail.

105
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,084
Well she tried.

106
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:57,950
Anyway, Peme didn't steal me, Lin and I
have been growing apart for some time.

107
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:01,188
We both had different goals...

108
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,276
Why am I even telling you this?

109
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:06,788
It all happened a long time ago 
and we've moved past it.

110
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,660
Apparently Bei Fong hasn't.

111
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,951
What are you...
Of course she has!

112
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,082
Anyways this is not of your business.

113
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,962
See you at home, Mr.Heart-breaker.

114
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,510
I just got word.

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,840
The Council defied your threat.

116
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,040
They're keeping the Arena open.

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,268
Perfect.

118
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,145
Everything is going according 
to the plan.

119
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,329
All clear, Chief.

120
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,516
How's the security sweep going?
Fine.

121
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,636
They checked underneath the stands?
Yes.

122
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,314
Had you enough officers to cover 
all points of entry?

123
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:12,599
I have the sky, the bay and every 
looking cranny of this place covered.

124
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,946
Now leave me alone and 
let me do my job.

125
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,460
Lin, with so much on the line

126
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,024
it would be nice if we could 
help each other out.
At least for one night.

127
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,029
- Like old times?
- Like old times.

128
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:31,134
Ok, I'll try to be less abrasive 
than usual.

129
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,536
I'll appreciate that.

130
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,640
Anticipation is palpable as we are just
moments away from the championship match.

131
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,713
Will the Wolf-Bats ferocity 
our repetitive champs?

132
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,759
Or will the underdog Fire Ferrets serve
up a surprising bowl of smack-down soup?

133
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,023
Now I know there's a big crowd,
but don't be nervous.

134
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,558
You're gonna do great, 
I believe in you.

135
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:06,232
Introducing the challengers,

136
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:10,388
the Future Industries, Fire Ferrets!

137
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,348
We're along, Pabu!

138
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,424
Yes! Nailed it!

139
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:46,150
He's so talented!

140
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,865
And their opponents, 
the three times defending champions,

141
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,784
the Whites Falls, Wolf-Bats!

142
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,299
They got nothing on us buddy, 
anybody can howl.

143
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,722
Whatever.

144
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid 
hair off his stupid head.

145
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,610
The champs and challengers face off
at the center line.

146
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,612
And here we go!

147
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,285
Tahno try to clean the Avatar 
with some dirty water mud.

148
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,954
Ming escape Mako's attack 
and return the favor.

149
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,043
Shaozu get fancy, but Bolin 
ricochet his disk off the cords

150
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,675
and says "No thanks you, sir!"

151
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,426
Nice shot!

152
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,140
The water benders slug out 
with an evenly match.

153
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,228
Tahno get a little too worked up 
and unleash a deluge on Bolin

154
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,398
that will certainly gives him a fault.
Apparently not.

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,651
What's the big idea, ref?
That was an hosing fault!

156
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:14,072
And the Wolf-Bats advance despite
Tahno exceeding the water bending
time limit.

157
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,699
A questionable call by the official.

158
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,953
Ming trips out Mako with 
another dirty trick.

159
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,767
Oh come on ref! There was some funny
business in that last hit!

160
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,197
Who would have guessed you knew 
the rules of pro-bending?

161
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:27,864
I've been brushing up.

162
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:30,964
That Wolf-Bat blatantly bended 
outside of his zone.

163
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,897
The Ferrets brother are backed up in 
zone 3 and the Wolf-Bat smells blood.

164
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,976
Looks like Tahno snugged an 
illegal icing move.

165
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,724
But once again there's no call.

166
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:48,326
I don't what match the ref are watching
but it's obviously not this one.

167
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:54,487
Oh! A splashing par send the 
Avatar in zone 3 as well.

168
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,077
It's a K.O. The Wolf-Bat win the
championship for the fourth year

169
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,997
Oh! Hold on a second folks.

170
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,500
Scotch that! The Ferrets are still alive,
but just barely.

171
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,334
What an unbelievable move!

172
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:23,016
These Ferrets aren't just bending
elements, they're bending my minds!

173
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:26,581
The underdogs survive to see round two.

174
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,442
What's wrong with these refs?

175
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:34,277
They've been paid off. 
It's the only explanation.
Somebody wants us to lose.

176
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,049
If the Wolf-Bats  are gonna fight dirty
then should we.

177
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,281
No we can't.

178
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:42,619
The refs have it out for us, if we're
gonna win this thing it 
has to be fair and square.

179
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:46,289
It's not fun, but right.

180
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,208
Round two!

181
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,331
Dealing with Tahno's a brutal call as
both side give it their all.

182
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,953
But once again Tahno sneaks in little
ice to get the upper hand.

183
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,850
Wow those look likes illegal
head shot to me.

184
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,188
Round two will be decided with
a tie-breaker!

185
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,118
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!

186
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,249
Which element do you choose?

187
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,617
I'm taking this one!
Let's go!

188
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,995
You and me, pretty boy!
Thought you'd never ask.

189
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,635
Come on little girl, give me your 
best shot.

190
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,108
Chump.

191
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,532
Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets!

192
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,200
Nice one!
That's the stuff you're my heroooo!

193
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,791
We might actually win this thing.

194
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,046
Let's dig them a watery grave!

195
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:21,724
I can't believe your sweet heart father
was reincarnated into that girl.

196
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:25,539
She as though as nails.Remind me 
of someone else I knew at that age

197
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:28,308
You two might get along if you would
 give her a chance.

198
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,728
One round a piece.

199
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,646
Who wants it more?

200
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,484
The Wolf-Bats fire up the game swinging
bad intention.

201
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,071
The challenger are showing a lot of
heart, but the champs are really starting
to find their rhythm now.

202
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,050
Can the Ferrets hang in there 
with the best,

203
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,202
especially when the best are frankly
getting a little from the ref?

204
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,456
It's all to this final round.

205
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,584
Mako is giving all in the ring.

206
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,211
but it look like Tahno and Ming are up 
to more shenanigans.

207
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,213
This has gone too far.
That water had rock in it.

208
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:07,764
K.O.!

209
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,684
Come on those were illegal head shot!
Open your eyes ref!

210
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,581
Well folks it's a controversy calls,

211
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,773
but the Wolf-Bats notch a nasty K.O. 
to win the match.

212
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,944
For the fourth year in a row,
they'll be crowned tournament champion.

213
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,605
I barely broke a sweat.

214
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:27,533
Anybody else want to scrap 
with the champs?

215
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,627
Look out!

216
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,126
What?

217
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,840
Folks there's some sort of electrical
disturbances in the stands.

218
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,825
Metals benders cops are dropping 
like bumble flies.

219
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:39,451
There appear to be masked members 
of the audience wielding strange 
device on their hands.

220
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:43,500
One of them is in the booth with me 
right now folks.

221
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,320
He's leveling one of those globe device
at me now.

222
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,361
I believe he's about to electrocute me.

223
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm currently wetting my pants.

224
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,545
What's going on here, ref?
I don't know!

225
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,897
Alright, you want a piece of 
the Wolf-Bats?

226
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:25,943
Here it comes.

227
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,880
Wait, please, I'll give you the
championship pot,

228
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,217
I'll give you everything just please, 
don't take my bending.

229
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:28,047
I believe I've your attention, 
benders of the Republic City.

230
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:33,052
So once again, the Wolf-Bats are your
pro-bending champions.

231
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,817
It seems fitting that you celebrate three
bullies who cheated their way to victory,

232
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,475
because everyday,

233
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,072
you threaten and abuse your fellow
non-bending citizen.

234
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,233
Just like the Wolf-Bats did to their
opponents tonight.

235
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:52,361
Those mens were supposedly the best in
the bending world.

236
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:57,599
And yet, it only took a few moments to
cleanse them of their impurity.

237
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:02,039
Let this be a warning of you all benders
out there.

238
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,750
If any of you stand in my way,

239
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,796
you'll meet the same fate.

240
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,479
To my followers :

241
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:16,254
for years, the Equalist have been forced
to hide in the shadow.

242
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:20,303
But now, we have the numbers 
and the strength

243
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:23,186
to create a new Republic City.

244
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,189
I'm happy to tell that the time for
change has finally come.

245
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,649
How are we gonna get out of here?

246
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,195
There is soon, the current tyrannical
bending regime...

247
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,988
Pabu! Listen up buddy.

248
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,530
will be replaced by fair minded Equalist
government.

249
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,412
Stop fooling around!
I'm trying to save us!

250
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,001
See?
Pabu's not just one trick poodle pony.

251
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,051
For centuries, benders have possessed 
an unnatural advantage

252
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,174
over ordinary people.

253
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,399
But thankfully modern technology,

254
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:59,430
has provided us a way to even out 
the play field.

255
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,185
Now, anybody can hold the power of a 
chi-blocker in their hand.

256
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,790
My followers and I will not rest,

257
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,391
until the entire city has achieved
equality.

258
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:13,076
And once that goal is achieved,

259
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,614
we'll equalize the rest of the world.

260
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,195
The revolution has begun!

261
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:45,466
Tenzin.

262
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:57,304
It's okay Pabu, it's just a little
explosion.

263
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:00,199
Keep chewing, you're almost trough it.

264
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,234
Yes! Great job buddy.

265
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going after Amon!
Be careful!

266
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:45,599
You alright?

267
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,632
Yeah, I,m fine thanks to you.

268
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:49,326
It's nothing.

269
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:52,455
Looks like we lost this one.

270
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,666
I'm so glad you're okay.

271
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,346
Me too!

272
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,502
I can't believe Amon did this.

273
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:04,925
I played right into his hand.
He played us all.

274
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,720
Republic City is in war.

275
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,813
