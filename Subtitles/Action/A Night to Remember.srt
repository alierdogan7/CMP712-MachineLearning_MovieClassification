Look.

504
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:17,396
She could float with any three of her
first five watertight compartments flooded.

505
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,606
She could even float
with four of them gone.

506
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,650
- But she can't float with all five full up.
- Yes, but -

507
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,737
These watertight bulkheads here
only go as high as E Deck.

508
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,573
The weight of water in the bow
is going to pull her down by the head.

509
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,284
So you're going to get the fifth watertight
compartment overflowing into the sixth...

510
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,912
the sixth into the seventh and so on
as she gets lower.

511
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,831
It's a mathematical certainty.

512
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,542
With that amount of underwater damage,
she can't stay afloat.

after the collision.
