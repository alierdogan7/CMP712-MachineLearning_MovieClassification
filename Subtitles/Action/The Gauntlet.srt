1
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,474
JOSEPHSON: You look awful!
- I had a late-night poker game.

2
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,915
You should have at least shaved.

3
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,629
This new Police Commissioner Blakelock
is very spit-and-polish.

4
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,915
Fuck him.

5
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,317
But, Jesus God, Ben!
You got to watch the way you look.

6
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,233
You can't walk in on these
bigwigs without shaving.

7
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,959
You just can't do that.

8
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,715
You should've put on a tie.

9
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,598
You should've shined your shoes.

10
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,515
You should've made an effort
to spruce up a little bit.

11
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,516
SHOCKLEY:
Mr. Feyderspiel.

12
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,034
Shockley. How are you?

13
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,633
Fine, sir.

14
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,316
How's our Assistant D.A. These days?

15
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,154
Shit! He couldn't convict Hitler.

16
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,832
JOSEPHSON:
Don't use any profanity.

17
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,752
And remember to say "sir" to him.

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,753
When he speaks to you, say "sir."
Then stand up straight.

19
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,116
And for God's sakes,
don't breathe on him.

20
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,116
Here.

21
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,873
Wait a minute, guy! Come on!

22
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,553
Open your mouth.

23
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,357
I wish I had time to shave you.

24
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,033
Nag, nag, nag!

25
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,549
E.A. Blakelock.

26
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,759
Ben Shockley, sir.

27
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,198
I've heard about you, Shockley.

28
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,475
Oh?

29
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,108
As Commissioner of the
police department...

30
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,590
...considerable responsibility.

31
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,430
Watchdog of the department,
so to speak.

32
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,193
Policing the police.

33
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,631
So that the need for
absolute secrecy is...

34
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,035
I understand.

35
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,715
Plane tickets.

36
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,190
Extradite and subpoena.

37
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,997
You're flying to Las Vegas,
coming back with...

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,157
...a prisoner for us...

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,996
...whom you will remand
to custody at County.

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,718
And then you report, you know,
back here.

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,828
Respectfully, sir,
I work for Metro squad. Why me?

42
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,231
Your division commander says
you're a man who gets the job done.

43
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,952
Is there anything special
I should know about this case?

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,957
What it is, is this:

45
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,714
It's a nothing witness
for a nothing trial.

46
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,554
That'll be all.

47
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,395
Oh, Shockley?

48
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,036
You represent the Phoenix P.D.
Get a shave.

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,109
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,036
JOSEPHSON: 15 years on the bricks
together, look what happens to us.

51
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,477
I land a lousy desk job.
You get a freebie to Vegas.

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,188
SHOCKLEY: Big deal. A two-bit
witness for a two-bit trial.

53
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,273
JOSEPHSON: Anybody I know?
SHOCKLEY: Gus Mally. Heard of him?

54
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,993
No. What's the charge?

55
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,395
SHOCKLEY:
He wouldn't say.

56
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,278
I'm just going there...
Hi, Shirley.

57
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,034
And coming back. You won't
even have time to get laid.

58
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,390
You won't have time.
Helen'd kill me.

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,473
Listen, are you still
getting serviced by Shirley?

60
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,917
Why not? You've got a
very shapely lady there.

61
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,875
SHOCKLEY:
She was after me for my money.

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,555
The trip to Vegas is 2 hours.
Have dinner with us.

63
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,519
Not tonight. Say hello to Helen
and the kids, though.

64
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,469
And thanks for the escort.
I know how busy you execs are.

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,517
JOSEPHSON:
In your ear, Jim!

66
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,876
SHOCKLEY:
Congratulations on the promotion.

67
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,876
I don't know why they promoted me.
We're partners, for chrissake.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,838
You deserved the promotion.

69
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,957
I hate paperwork, you know that.

70
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,749
If it wasn't for the family,
I'd tell them to shove it.

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,752
Why don't you quit bellyaching?

72
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,998
- You're off the bricks, aren't you?
- I like the bricks.

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,869
SHOCKLEY:
Relax and enjoy life.

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,469
JOSEPHSON:
Hey!

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,514
You and me been through
some doors together.

76
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,909
We've had our times.

77
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,956
We've had our times.

78
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,516
Ever been to Las Vegas before?

79
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,039
A lot of tourists in town.

80
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,670
It's always this way, the Strip,
choked with traffic all the time.

81
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,993
You can't drive. You can't go fast.
30 miles an hour all the way.

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,355
The old days...

83
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,556
Buddy, drop the tourist crap,
will you?

84
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,552
SHOCKLEY:
What do you mean my man isn't here?

85
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,597
You heard what I said, bud.

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,959
I've got papers for one Gus Mally.
The address is this building.

87
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,077
You better check again.

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
SERGEANT:
I've got all kinds of fellas in here.

89
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,032
I got a Smith.
I got a Gonzales.

90
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,157
I got a McNaughton.
Take your pick.

91
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,517
But I don't have a fella
named Gus Mally.

92
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,636
He was to have been picked up
yesterday, held for extradition.

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,390
Somebody screwed up.

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,073
SERGEANT:
Wait a minute now!

95
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,629
When you get back to
Phoenix empty-handed...

96
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,030
...all I said was...

97
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,397
...I ain't got no guy named Gus Mally.

98
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,155
Augustina Mally I got
over in women's detention.

99
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,389
Asshole.

100
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,790
MATRON:
She's been spitting up since morning.

101
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,793
I don't know.
She might have a fever or something.

102
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,596
We called the prison doctor,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,156
SHOCKLEY:
Hit the deck, Mally.

104
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,196
Has she eaten?

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,751
Just a cup of coffee this morning.

106
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,153
Looks like she put
cigarette ashes in the coffee.

107
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,915
Old army trick.

108
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,631
She wanted to look sick.

109
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,234
MALLY: Let me go!
They're going to kill me!

110
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,391
I want a fucking lawyer!

111
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,995
Terrific!

112
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,198
My life on the line and they
send me an on-the-ropes bum!

113
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,149
What kind of record?

114
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,914
Hooker.

115
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,151
We've got a problem, you and me.

116
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,198
We don't like each other,
but we're taking a trip together.

117
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,273
You can come along peacefully
or be a pain in the ass.

118
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,472
But I warn you, mess around
and I'll put cuffs on.

119
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,319
Talk dirty, I gag you.
If you run, I'll shoot you.

120
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,028
My name is Shockley.
We've got a plane to catch.

121
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,236
They're still cutting her papers.

122
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,516
Swell.

123
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,711
SHOCKLEY:
Can you ask them to hurry it up, please?

124
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,188
You...

125
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,434
...think about what I said.

126
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,913
MALLY:
You're a dead man, Shockley.

127
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,275
They'll kill me.

128
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,471
And if you're with me,
they'll kill you.

129
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,949
Who's "they"?

130
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,638
I don't know.

131
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,195
Why are they going to kill you?

132
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,675
I don't know.

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,194
Pack your lipstick.

134
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,839
MALLY:
Damn it, it's the truth!

135
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,759
They've even got a line on it.
On us!

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,037
They got a betting line on
everything in this town.

137
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,759
Ponies, football, the fights.

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,595
Nobody cares about a dumb-ass cop
and a two-bit hooker on Airwest.

139
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,398
Shockley, listen to me.

140
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,155
It's 50-to-1 we don't make it.
Ask any bookie.

141
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,231
Don't drown in the sink.

142
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,589
Shockley! You big prick!

143
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,148
That's a hooker?

144
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,188
The kick now is the schoolgirl look.
She's on the high side.

145
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,432
Finds it hard to maintain
those hundred-dollar tricks.

146
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,716
SHOCKLEY:
On a scale of 10, I'd give her a 2.

147
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,599
And that's only because
I've never seen a 1 before.

148
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,599
Okay, sir. Here you are,
just what you ordered.

149
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,034
How about another one?

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,156
This is fine.

151
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,277
- You sure?
- I've got a plane to catch.

152
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,432
Holy gee!
No way you'd get me on a plane.

153
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,353
Not after the airline pilots
I've dated.

154
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,795
I wouldn't let those
assholes drive my car.

155
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,949
Really?

156
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,589
Just last week
I was reading this article.

157
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,114
It talked about flying.

158
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,430
Said we'd all become just like cattle.

159
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,558
Trusting our lives
to people we don't even know.

160
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,155
Like pilots.
Said we do it all the time.

161
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,675
Then we get our heads bashed in...

162
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,229
...like cattle,
for being so trusting.

163
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,277
Did you ever think about that?

164
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,397
Like those pilots I dated.

165
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,952
They're so snockered
they don't know what button to push.

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
One minute you're flying
30,000 feet in the air...

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,195
...next you are splattered
all over the ground...

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,035
...somebody's dachshund
nipping at your pancreas.

169
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,389
Flying really sucks,
you know what I mean?

170
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,757
How much on what, sport?

171
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,195
Mally No Show.

172
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,032
What's the score on her?

173
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,395
50-to-1.

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,509
I can read.
I mean, how does she run?

175
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,913
I don't know shit from horses.
I just put up the names.

176
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,478
She started out at 20-to-1.

177
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,029
The house has been raising the odds.

178
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,358
The smart money must figure
she ain't got a chance.

179
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,589
You want to bet or not?

180
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,993
Maybe later.

181
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,072
BOOKIE:
<i>Ed's Pony Book.</i>

182
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,357
You got a horse in the 10th race
called Mally No Show.

183
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,830
- Got a line on her?
<i>- Hang on.</i>

184
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,197
<i>We've got her, 70-to- 1.</i>

185
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,159
70? It was 60-to-1
10 minutes ago.

186
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,470
<i>So aren 't you glad you waited?</i>

187
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,030
<i>But the odds are bound to go down.</i>
<i>No filly can be that bad.</i>

188
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,755
You found out I was right, didn't you?

189
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,479
I didn't find out dick.

190
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,070
But a horse named Mally No Show's
in the 10th race at Santa Anita.

191
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,596
Somebody's betting she'll
drop dead at the starting gate.

192
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,592
And this is the gate right here!

193
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,400
You see? They're saying
we haven't got a chance!

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,355
For all I know,
it's just a coincidence.

195
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,556
It's not a coincidence.
There isn't any 10th race at Anita!

196
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,115
Wagon's outside.

197
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,555
What about that horse?

198
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,115
75-to-1.
Sounds like a real nag.

199
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,039
Go back home. Leave me be.
Call it off. Please!

200
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,111
We're splitting right now.

201
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,238
One of you call Hertz or Avis.
I don't care which one.

202
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,358
Have them leave me a car
between here and the airport.

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,989
Leave the keys. I'll pay
once she's on the plane.

204
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,793
If, and I say if,
what you're saying is true...

205
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,316
...somebody's betting I can't do my job.
They're full of shit!

206
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,674
These people laying these odds
will chew you up and spit you out!

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,390
You're fucking crazy.
I'm not going anyplace with you.

208
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,154
SHOCKLEY:
What about that car?

209
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,949
'74 Plymouth, blue.
It's parked at the Christian Center.

210
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,679
- Who's the driver?
- That's me.

211
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,114
Let's go.

212
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,999
- Just him.
- We're a team.

213
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,474
Next time.

214
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,477
You cheap-shot, gutless bastard!

215
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,631
You get off roughing up girls,
don't you?

216
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,235
Big man!
Big 45-caliber fruit!

217
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,228
That's me.

218
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,829
Macho mentality.

219
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,550
You'll get us both killed
before we get out of here!

220
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,159
Jesus!

221
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,672
Breathe deeply.

222
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,675
DRIVER:
There it is.

223
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,475
SHOCKLEY:
All right.

224
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,679
Pull around in front.
I'll get her ready for transfer.

225
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,148
Check for the keys.

226
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,470
I'm hyperventilating, you bastard!

227
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,030
Go die by yourself.
I won't get out of this ambulance.

228
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,519
Come here.

229
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,989
- Take this.
- What's that?

230
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,355
It's a gun. Take it.

231
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,955
- I don't want it.
- Take it!

232
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,750
Anybody comes up behind us,
shoot him.

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,991
You got to be kidding!

234
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,953
Where the hell are you going?

235
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,395
I'll take a less popular way
to the airport.

236
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,837
After what happened back there?
They'll be waiting for us!

237
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,038
By the time they sift through
that wreckage, we'll be gone.

238
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,155
MALLY:
Pull over.

239
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,634
Until you pull that trigger,
I'm headed to the airport.

240
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,355
I mean it.

241
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,353
I swear to Christ,
if you don't stop, I'll shoot.

242
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,956
What's that?

243
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,229
They're shooting!

244
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,670
- Shoot at them!
- Stop! It's the police!

245
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,638
SHOCKLEY: It's not the police!
Shoot at them!

246
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,915
I can't!

247
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,556
You were ready to
shoot at me, damn it!

248
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,239
Oh, my God!

249
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,073
So we don't go to the airport.

250
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,276
But I'll be damned
if I know where to go.

251
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,716
Six blocks down, hang a left.

252
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,279
Second house on the right.

253
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,678
You got a telephone in this place?

254
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,319
It's over there.

255
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,078
This your house?

256
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,589
Yeah.

257
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,588
SHOCKLEY:
What kind of guys do you bring here?

258
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,479
MALLY:
Locals, mostly.

259
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,154
Married men cheating on their wives.

260
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,994
OFFICER: Police Department.
- Commissioner Blakelock's office.

261
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,633
Ben Shockley.

262
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,115
You were supposed to be
on the plane 15 minutes ago.

263
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,636
Somebody doesn't want
your nothing witness...

264
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,155
...to testify at your nothing trial.

265
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,830
If I'm going to get her to Phoenix,
I'll need your help.

266
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,999
Call the Vegas police
and send two squad cars...

267
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,994
...one for a decoy, the other
to take her to the airport.

268
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,315
Where are you?

269
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,352
Where the hell is this place?

270
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,272
MALLY:
316 Rothdale.

271
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,748
316 Rothdale.

272
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,958
You can't miss it.
There's an ambulance in front.

273
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,269
Yeah, it's a cathouse.

274
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,875
Stay there.

275
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,277
- Where the hell would I go?
<i>- Don 't get smart, Shockley.</i>

276
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,835
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,957
You win, Shockley.
I'm through fighting it.

278
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,195
I appreciate what you did
in the ambulance.

279
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,869
If you hadn't pulled me back...

280
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,430
My job's just to get you
back to Phoenix in one piece.

281
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,999
I know.

282
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,798
Still, I owe you.

283
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,435
You married?

284
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,313
What do you care?

285
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,837
I'm interested in you.

286
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,752
Want a glass?

287
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,232
It's fine.

288
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,909
Every woman has her thing about men.

289
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,639
Something that turns her on.

290
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,794
With me, it's hands.

291
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,954
I love strong hands.

292
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,633
Like yours.

293
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,758
We have time.

294
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,750
We'll have such a good time, baby.

295
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,514
Such a good time.

296
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,274
You're so beautiful.

297
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,272
You just lie there now.

298
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,919
Just lie there...

299
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,958
...and momma will do all the work.

300
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,831
Somehow I get the feeling
your heart isn't in your work.

301
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,115
You bastard!

302
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,157
Even if we do get to Phoenix...

303
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,595
...I'm not testifying
at any lousy trial.

304
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,559
That's your problem.
My job's to get you there.

305
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,149
You'd risk your life
for something this stupid?

306
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,833
All you've got's your job!

307
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,999
I just do what I'm told.

308
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,151
Yeah? So does an imbecile.

309
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,436
OPERATOR: <i>Information.</i>
SHOCKLEY: Number for Airwest.

310
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,637
SHOCKLEY:
We won't be here long.

311
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,316
Do you mind?
Once we're in the air...

312
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,154
...I'd hate you to worry
I'll leap out the washroom window.

313
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,435
SHOCKLEY:
Go ahead.

314
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,638
Air-worst has planes leaving
almost every hour.

315
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,754
Airwest?

316
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,160
When's your next flight to Phoenix?

317
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,755
You have planes leaving every hour?

318
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,191
I'd like to book a reservation
on your next flight for two.

319
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,230
Two people, name's Smith.

320
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,391
We'll be there. Thanks.

321
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,315
Let's go.

322
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,430
You, in the house!

323
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,597
Come out with your hands up!

324
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,396
We got the house surrounded.

325
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,393
Throw out your guns.
Bring the girl.

326
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,793
Fuck me!

327
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,759
Come on, let's go.

328
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,838
Come on, goddamn it!
They've got an army out there.

329
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,553
You've got thirty seconds.

330
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,955
They're shooting at us!

331
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,149
Mally?

332
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,233
Open fire!

333
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,512
SHERIFF:
Hold your fire!

334
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,435
Captain, they should've surrendered.

335
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,630
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about that passageway?

336
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,119
I'm your prisoner.
I was trying to escape.

337
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,873
What happened?
I heard shooting.

338
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,515
I damn near got cut to ribbons.

339
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,591
Somebody set me up!

340
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,392
Don't blame me.
It was your idea, calling the cops.

341
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,676
Did you shoot at those guys?

342
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,638
I didn't do jack shit!

343
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,233
Then why? What happened?

344
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,357
I don't know what happened.

Let's get out of here.

346
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,988
SHOCKLEY: I don't suppose there's
anybody in this town you could trust?

347
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,753
MALLY:
I don't know. I'm not sure.

348
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,470
SHOCKLEY: I guess in your line of work
you don't make many lifelong friends.

349
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,994
What about you?

350
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,708
Those were cops.
How many friends have you got?

351
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,552
Get your ass in gear.

352
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,556
Here.

353
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,113
Look normal.

354
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,237
MALLY:
I am normal.

355
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,471
- There's a cop car.
- Shut up.

356
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,398
- Do what I say and this won't go off.
- You got it!

357
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,914
SHOCKLEY:
Get in the back.

358
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,799
Now go.

359
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,431
Don't get nervous with that cannon.
I ain't no trouble.

360
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,674
SHOCKLEY: Just head right on out there
to the left.

361
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,032
We just left 50 of your buddies,
tried to blow me to hell.

362
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,918
They were nothing but trouble.

363
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,958
You two are them holed up
in that cathouse, ain't you?

364
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,235
Do you know about that?

365
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,391
Every cop in town knows about it.

366
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,517
Just what do you know?

367
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,990
Our dispatcher said
there was this hooker...

368
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,074
...and three men, armed and dangerous,
holed up in a cathouse.

369
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,949
Hell, half the units in this city
must have picked it up.

370
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,430
I don't care what bullshit
came over that radio.

371
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,717
There was just us two in that house,
and I'm a cop.

372
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,875
You think that piece of tin
proves anything?

373
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,196
You can get that out of
a box of Cracker Jacks.

374
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,231
It's real. You look at it!

375
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,554
The two fellas in the car said
you shot at them...

376
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,994
...put them in a hospital.

377
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,754
Why would a cop do that?

378
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,956
They shot at us, that's why.

379
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,428
That ain't their story.

380
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,717
They said you fled
the scene of an accident.

381
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,428
They tailed you
and you opened up at them.

382
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,437
Well, they're full of shit.

383
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,313

You just forget about that.

388
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,391
You're compounding your problem,

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,557
Come sundown, I turn in this car
and hang up the hat.

393
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,032

towards the border, understand?

394
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,188
I'll tell you what.

395
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,319

you've been taking.

00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,633
The people looking for her.
You know who they are?

401
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,559
Let's just say
that your story's true...

402
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,872
...about them dudes in the car
shooting at you first.

403
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,312
If them two are examples,
I'd say the folks hunting for her...

404
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,357
...have the initials M-O-B.

405
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,635

it was the Mob after us...

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,709
I'm not protecting anybody.
I didn't know.

500

Talk to me. I want to know
what it's like being a whore.

501
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,878
Actually, I always thought
it was rather like being a cop.

502
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,394
You did?

503
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,074
Yeah.

...then taking a kickback
from heroin dealers.

510

when you do bust a pusher...

511
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,191
...and skim the haul
when you've made the collar.

514
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,029
MALLY:
As I see it...

515
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,677
...the only difference between us,
is that when I quit work...

516
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,871
...I take a long hot bath...

517
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,594
...and I'm clean
as the day I was born.

518
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,233
But a cop...

519
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,471
...especially a flunkie like you...

520
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,400
...when sheriff whistles,
you squat.

521
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,471
And what he does to you
rots your brain.

522
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,114
No amount of water
can get you clean again.

523
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,711
You going to take that crap?

524
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,431
You were the one
that wanted her to talk.

525
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,876
I know you don't like women like me.

526
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,638
We're a bit aggressive.

527
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,233
We frighten you.

528
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,436
Because you've got
filth in your brain.

529
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,955
The only way
you'll ever clean it out...

530
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,838
...is to put a bullet through it.

531
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,111
Does your wife know you masturbate?

532
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,156
(DEPUTY YELLS)

533
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,114
You've had your chat.
Now drive!

534
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,629
Shockley?

535
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,235
Yeah?

536
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,189
What's going to happen at the border?

537
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,438
We'll pick up an escort
to take us to Phoenix.

538
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,035
Who?

539
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,514
Police.

540
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,997
Arizona police.

541
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,033
How do you know?

542
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,878
Because I asked for them.

543
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,795
Did you call the same person
you telephoned from the house?

544
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,276
Yeah.

545
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,753
When I saw you back in the culvert
you said you'd been set up.

546
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,270
It seemed that way at the time.

547
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,196
What's changed since then?

548
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,559
What are you trying to say?

549
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,832
Somebody's trying to kill me.

550
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,310
Since you're along,
you're a target too.

551
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,399
The car that blew up,
and the guys who shot at us...

552
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,834
...could've been the Mob.

553
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,873
But back at the house,
those were cops outside.

554
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,680
Somehow they got the wrong message.

555
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,237
Maybe it was a legitimate mistake.
Maybe not.

556
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,799
But if it wasn't...

557
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,355
...who would've given them
the wrong message?

558
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,399
How would I know?

559
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,835
Not my guys.

560
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,799
Not the guys on my own force,
for chrissake!

561
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,197
You're probably right.

562
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,668
But let's just say that
there's a chance you're wrong.

563
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,036
Just one chance in a thousand.

564
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,639
The state line's a pretty
lonely place to find out.

565
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,756
Hear what she said
about your own people?

566
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,230
You going to sit there
and take that shit?

567
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,317
How far is the state line?

568
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,232
About 10 miles.

569
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,155
Shockley?

570
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,674
I really do have a college degree.

571
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,076
DEPUTY: State line's just beyond
that next rise up there.

572
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,672
Good thing you're out of here.

573
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,831
I ever see you again,
you've had it.

574
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,869
Shockley?

575
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,592
I may be wrong.

576
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,468
But what if I'm right?

577
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,716
Pull over here.

578
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,030
What?

579
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,116
Pull over and stop!

580
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,196
The hell, you say!

581
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,277
DEPUTY:
Okay! Okay!

582
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,878
I'll leave your gun by the road.
You can pick it up later.

583
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,189
DEPUTY:
Damn bet I will!

584
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,351
You'll have some fast talking to do.

585
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,319
They'll wonder why you bailed out,
and I'll tell them.

586
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,915
You chose sides.

587
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,594
Got yourself a little nookie
and chose sides!

588
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,915
SHOCKLEY:
Shit!

589
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,229
Better get a move on.

590
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,552
If you're wrong,
I want to be there to explain...

591
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,598
...before that asshole
starts spouting off.

592
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,277
(MAN OVER RADIO)
<i>Red Fox One, this is Kingman relay.</i>

593
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,750
<i>Has Rabbit arrived yet?</i>

594
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,355
Rabbit approaching.

595
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,875
<i>Ten-four.</i>
<i>Will relay to Phoenix.</i>

596
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,190
How y'all doing?

597
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,278
If it's any consolation...

598
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,276
What?

599
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,675
Nothing.

600
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,879
Shut up.

601
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,349
Never saw a cop feeling sorry
for himself before.

602
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,238
Mind if I watch?

603
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,557
For 2 cents and a stick of gum
I'd kick the shit out of you.

604
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,195
Whatever gets you off, butch.

605
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,511
After I was through...

606
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,550
...where would I leave the $20?

607
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,509
I don't want your money.
I love you for your mind.

608
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,875
Sorry.

609
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,509
Just had to jog your thinking.

610
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,439
You're a loser.

611
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,669
I'm splitting.

612
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,911
You'd shoot a woman in the back?

613
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,071
How would that look on your record?

614
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,795
You'd never make it
alone out there.

615
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,309
With you I don't have a chance.

616
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,073
On my own, I do okay.

617
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,151
I saved you from that constable.

618
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,433
I wouldn't take any bows.

619
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,434
If not for me, you'd have let that
schmuck drive us into the guns.

620
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,438
There wouldn't be guns
if they weren't try to kill you.

621
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,035
It's both of us, you witless idiot!

622
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,077
Haven't you figured that out?

623
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,748
Why do you think
you drew this assignment?

624
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,349
Because I get the job done!

625
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,955
They don't want the job done!

626
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,236
They picked you because
you're a drunken bum.

627
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,193
And if they bump you off,
not a fucking soul...

628
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,311
...is going to give a rat's ass!

629
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,629
You're a nothing.

630
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,836
A nobody.

631
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,957
A faded number on a rusty badge.

632
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,909
You've been set up by your own
people to take the fall with me.

633
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,470
Wake up, for chrissake!

634
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,918
At least that way you'll know
where the bullets are coming from!

635
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,917
Watch out for the sidewinders.

636
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,116
MALLY:
What?

637
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,517
It's a type of rattlesnake
that comes out after dark.

638
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,159
Horseshit!

639
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,069
They're drawn by body heat.
You never know it till they hit you.

640
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,039
I'll leave in the morning.

641
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,394
I will!

642
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,234
I'll make it too. You'll see.

643
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,353
If we were in Vegas,
you'd be just going to work.

644
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,520
Go polish your badge, Shockley.

645
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,559
It's all you've got.

646
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,399
Miserable bitch!

647
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,076
Welcome to the ranks
of the disenchanted.

648
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,078
Shut up and go to sleep.

649
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,831
I'm a counter-puncher, Shockley.

650
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,758
If you can't last the 12 rounds
then stay out of the ring.

651
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,036
Shockley?

652
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,308
Who's DeLuca?

653
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,590
What?

654
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,670
Angelo DeLuca, as in the
State of Arizona vs. DeLuca.

655
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,875
Who is he?

656
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,311
Have you been sitting there all night?

657
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,911
Cut the mother-hen crap, will you?

658
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,833
You're supposed to be
a witness at this trial.

659
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,793
Now who the hell is he?

660
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,508
MALLY: Small time.
SHOCKLEY: Is he Mob?

661
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,553
Who knows?

662
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,718
Talk, for chrissake!

663
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,309
Hell, I guess he is.
So what?

664
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,236
A: The Mob's making book
you don't testify at the trial.

665
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,950
And B: Somebody on the Phoenix P.D.
Also doesn't want you testifying.

666
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,395
A plus B equals a tie-in...

667
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,716
...between the Mob
and the police force.

668
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,954
You sit on your ass all night
figuring that out?

669
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,599
Congratulations.

670
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,114
Now, who's DeLuca?

671
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,635
I only met the guy once! Jesus!

672
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,030
I'm no good without coffee.
Lay off!

673
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,157
The time you met him, what happened?

674
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,118
I don't want to talk about it.

675
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,555
Half my force is involved
and you won't talk.

676
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,596
You heard me.

677
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,671
- Who you protecting?
- Nobody.

678
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,713
Me! I'm protecting me!
So lay off!

679
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,154
From what? From me?

680
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,233
Have I tried to kill you?
Or jump your bones?

681
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,198
I'm not the enemy!

682
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,279
Hurray for Mr. Clean.

683
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,879
What did he do?

684
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,957
I don't want to talk about it!

685
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,715
You're the key.

686
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,275
You're the proof
and both sides know it.

687
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,714
Please.

688
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,548
DeLuca set me up with this guy.

689
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,030
Told me to be special nice to him.

690
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,389
What guy?

691
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,679
Someone on the force.

692
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,676
Phoenix P. D?

693
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,356
His name?

694
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,197
I didn't ask.

695
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,596
What happened?

696
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,830
I went to this hotel room...

697
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,433
...in Vegas.

698
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,790
There was this guy there.

699
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,475
He seemed like an okay guy.

700
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,070
I asked him how he wanted it.

701
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,478
He told me to take off my clothes...

702
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,233
...lie down on the bed...

703
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,232
...lie on my stomach.

704
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,119
Told me to open up my legs.

705
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,633
I couldn't see him.

706
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,359
He had this gun.

707
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,360
He took this gun with one hand...

708
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,596
...and he held it there.

709
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,558
I knew what he was doing
with his other hand.

710
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,833
And he told me...

711
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,275
...if I screamed,
he'd pull the trigger.

712
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,276
Describe him.

713
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,436
He was 55, 60.

714
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,156
Blue eyes, gray hair.
Very distinguished.

715
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,716
And he had this face...

716
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,834
...that looked like it was
made out of stone.

717
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,039
And his voice...

718
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,829
...sounded like it came
from the bottom of a tomb.

719
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,076
Blakelock.

720
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,719

721
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,356

722
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,236
What?

723
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,434
You stay there.

724
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,594
Oh, my God!

725
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,834
You wait here.

726
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,719
- Where you going?
- You just stay here.

727
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,110
All right, mother-jumpers!
This is a bust!

728
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,479
Everybody up against their bike.
Balls in your pockets.

729
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,190
Come on!

730
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,918
Don't do that, man! Don't!

731
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,839
Son of a bitch!

00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,677
SHOCKLEY: The next turkey who
tries that, I'll shoot him...

733
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,952
...stuff him and stick
an apple in his ass.

734
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,389

735
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,472

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,434
You? You?

737
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,596
Hey, man.

738
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,192
You can't do this without a warrant.

739
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,235
The man says I need a warrant.

740
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,989
The man don't know jack shit!

741
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,193
Anybody here know more
about the law here than me?

742
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,992
Any lawyers here?

743
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,317
Any lawyers want to tell me
why I don't need a warrant?

744
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,397
Why don't you get off our case?

745
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,111
You with the fucking hair.

746
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,349
You look smart.

747
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,918
Tell me why I'm entitled
to come in here anytime I please.

748
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,549
Reasonable what?

749
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,079
Reasonable suspicion.

750
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,914
Exactly!
Reasonable suspicion.

751
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,834
I can do as I please
if I have reasonable suspicion.

752
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,753
If I have suspicion
a felony's been committed...

753
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,878
...I can walk in here
anytime I feel like it.

754
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,395
Because I got this badge, this gun...

755
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,473
...and I got the love of Jesus
in my pretty green eyes.

756
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,318
He must be high on something.

757
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,118
He's just fucking crazy.

SHOCKLEY: I don't know what.
And personally I don't give a shit.

763
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,797
The main thing is,
I'll have to bust you all.

764
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,595
Of course, we do have a choice.
Wait a second. We have a choice.

765
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,675
If you get on those bikes and
get out in the next 30 seconds...

766
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,269
...I'll let you off with just a warning.

767
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,556
However, if you give me any shit...

768
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,028
...any shit at all...

769
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,236
...then there's going to be more cops.

770
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,957
More guns. More handcuffs.
More marijuana-sniffing dogs...

Hey, man!
This is our choppers, Charlie!

776
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,831

Why'd you do it?

Do what?

00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,394
The constable last night.
Why'd you kill him?

801
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,160
I didn't kill anybody.
That's Blakelock, you hear me?

802

It's who?

803
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,078
It's Commissioner Blakelock.

804
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,753
He's tied in with the Mob.

805
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,991
He's trying to nail me and the girl.

00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,758
The witness at that trial.
Gus Mally's not a guy, it's a girl.

And if she testifies,
Blakelock knows she'll torpedo him.

For chrissakes, that's nuts!

866
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,708
Will you write this down?

867
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,274
You can't!

868
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,357
Please.
Will you write this down?

869
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,357
All right, all right.
Go ahead.

870
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,395
I'm taking the 7th Street off-ramp...

871
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,710
...going down Central over Mesa...

872
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,712
...straight down Adams to City Hall.

873
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,148
<i>You got that?</i>

874
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,717
Seventh, Central, Adams, Mesa.
I got it. But, Ben...

875
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,672
Five minutes after I leave here...

876
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,911
...Blakelock's going to hear I'm coming.

877
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,752
He's going to try and stop me.

878
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,879
I want you to give him my route.
Tell him to clear the streets.

879
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,951
That way no innocent people get killed.

880
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,110
This is crazy.

881
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,112
<i>And give him this message:</i>

882
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,949
Tell him I know why
he picked me for the job.

883
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,479
Tell him he was wrong.

884
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,030
Tell him I'm coming
and I'll nail his ass to the wall.

885
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,269
You hear me?

886
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,953
For chrissakes!

887
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,829
He'll have every cop on the force there.
You can't get in there!

888
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,508
Thanks, partner.
My best to the family.

889
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,439
Jesus Christ!

890
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,314
CLERK: <i>Front desk.</i>
- This is 14-A.

891
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,193
You have anything like room service
around this joint?

892
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,032
<i>I can probably get you something.</i>

893
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,716
Maybe you could send your kid out
and pick up some steaks...

894
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,157
...fried chicken. Something like that.
Maybe a bottle of wine.

895
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,118
<i>Yes, sir. Anything else?</i>

896
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,113
Is there anything like a florist
around this neighborhood?

897
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,671
SHOCKLEY: When I was a kid growing up,
I used to hate cops.

898
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,914
Me and the other kids
in the neighborhood...

899
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,630
...we'd always get in trouble, fights.

900
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,188
Gang fights.

901
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,469
Always getting rousted by the cops.

902
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,313
I suppose if we had guns
like gangs do nowadays...

903
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,915
...I'd have shot every cop on sight.

904
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,756
Parents never seemed to care.

905
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,389
Teachers, they forgot how to care.

906
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,197
As you grow older, you begin
to realize what cops are all about.

907
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,118
They're just doing a job,
enforcing the law. Raising families.

908
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,599
If you break the law you get busted.
That's about all there is to it.

909
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,751
I learned to respect that.

910
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,716
I even began to realize...

911
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,475
...that the only people I knew
that stood for something were cops.

912
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,560
So when I got old enough,
I joined up.

913
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,755
I had this dream, boy.

914
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,519
I had this dream
of meeting the right woman...

915
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,994
...having kids.

916
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,273
Most of all...

917
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,630
...breaking that big case.

918
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,351
I could just see them pinning
captain bars on me and...

919
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,073
Well, the years went by, and
never did meet that right woman.

920
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,356
Seemed like other guys
were always breaking the big case.

921
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,034
After a while you get to the point
where you just...

922
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,999
...put in your 20
and wait for retirement.

923
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,431
Now I got the big case
and I'm picked to go down with it.

924
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,593
You don't have to.
Neither of us does.

925
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,115
Nobody's forcing us
to go back to Phoenix.

926
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,716
We could go to Canada or Mexico.
Anyplace!

927
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,479
Sure. And live like kings.

928
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,999
I've got some money.

929
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,468
I've got my checkbook.

930
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,915
$5000 back in Vegas.

931
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,991
And when that runs out?

932
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,232
Then let's take the money
and buy a pickup truck.

933
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,715
An old sedan,
or something unobtrusive.

934
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,077
We'll take back roads, turn ourselves
in to some precinct station.

935
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,753
Anything but City Hall!

936
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,911
We'll ask for protective custody.

937
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,115
Talk to the D.A.

938
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,669
That's exactly what I want you to do.

939
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,229
What about you?

940
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,072
Me? I'm going in.

941
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,230
Why?

942
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,076
We know why Blakelock picked me
for this job. I'll prove he's wrong.

943
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,391
Then I'm going with you.

944
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,671
You're not my prisoner.
You can go.

945
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,514
You get your money.
It's between me and Blakelock.

946
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,150
You said yourself you didn't
think the whole thing would work.

947
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,072
At least someone'll know I tried.

948
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,151
- Who, Blakelock?
- No, me.

949
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,559
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Area 2-1-2, please.

950
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,836
684-6114.

951
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,479
<i>Just a moment.</i>

952
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,432
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hi. Mom?

953
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,872
- It's me.
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

954
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,838
I'm okay. How are you?

955
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,069
I'm in...

956
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,355
...Wickenberg.

957
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,030
Wickenberg.

958
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,192
It's a small town halfway
between Vegas and Phoenix.

959
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,273
<i>I thought you had</i>
<i>a nice job you liked.</i>

960
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,079
I quit that job.

961
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,515
Who wants to be
a secretary all her life?

962
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,830
<i>That's what I've always said.</i>

963
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,275
<i>Things always happen for the best.</i>

964
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,876
Anyway, the big news is...

965
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,917
...I met this man.

966
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,598
He's really special.

967
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,588
You'd really like him.

968
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,671
<i>If you like him,</i>
<i>that's what counts.</i>

969
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,274
Shockley.

970
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,518
Ben Shockley.

971
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,233
Jesus! What difference does
it make what church he goes to?

972
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,950
We love each other
and we're going to be married.

973
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,435
We're going to...

974
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,990
...settle down in Arizona
and have kids.

975
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,276
<i>Where are you going to live?</i>

976
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,714
I don't know.

977
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,519
We hadn't really decided.
Probably...

978
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,115
...Northern Arizona somewhere.

979
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,510
Maybe up near the canyon.

980
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,439
It's supposed to be
really beautiful there...

981
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,430
...and you can still get land.

982
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,233
<i>When are you getting married?</i>

983
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,956
We've got business we have to
take care of in Phoenix first.

984
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,031
Then we're going to do it.

985
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,514
<i>What business is he in?</i>

986
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,352
I just wanted you to know.

987
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,989
Look, would you tell Dad?

988
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,071
<i>What was the young man 's name again?</i>

989
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,754
Shockley. Just like it sounds.

990
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,393
- I love you.
<i>- I love you too, dear.</i>

991
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,154
OPERATOR:
<i>What number, please?</i>

992
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,915
Give me Las Vegas. 283-8779.

993
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,551
Up near the canyon, huh?

994
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,750
<i>Bernie's Book.</i>

995
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,752
Bernie? Gus Mally.

996
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,270
Listen, what's the line on
that horse, Mally No Show?

997
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,836
100-to-1? Perfect.

998
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,237
I want $5000 worth, on the nose.

999
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,879
You know I'm good for it.

1000
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,637
Okay? She's going to be a winner.

1001
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,233
Let's go.

1002
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,275
SHOCKLEY:
Move on out.

1003
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,999
What the hell
you think you're doing?

1004
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,799
What the hell's it look like?

1005
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,471
What's wrong with you?
This is the bus.

1006
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,159
I don't give a damn.

1007
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,952
SHOCKLEY:
Get away from that lever.

1008
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,714
Get out of here.

1009
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,910
SHOCKLEY: Let's get the luggage
out of this thing.

1010
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,555
Sorry for this inconvenience...

1011
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,394
...but I'll have to ask you
to leave the bus.

1012
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,553
Please be sure to take your belongings.
Arrangements will be made...

1013
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,190
...for your continued journey
as quickly as possible.

1014
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,276
Well?

1015
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,430
Haul ass!

1016
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,038
(PHONE RINGS)

1017
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,876
You, shorty!

1018
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,509
And you, give me a hand
with this luggage.

1019
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,078
OLD LAD Y:
My, this is so exciting!

1020
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,311
Just like on the news!

1021
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,871
Court stands to recess.

1022
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,715
FEYDERSPIEL:
Ralph, ten minutes.

1023
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,030
JOSEPHSON: I don't know if you
remember me or not.

1024
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,236
My name is Josephson, I'm Metro squad...

1025
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,391
I'm busy now.
Can you see me later?

1026
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,473
Yes, sir. But you see,
this is about Shockley.

1027
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,837
He and I talked together
just a little while ago.

1028
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,069
You spoke with him?

1029
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,909
Yes, sir. He's coming in.
He gave me his entire route.

1030
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,436
He said some very strange things
about Commissioner Blakelock...

1031
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,551
...and I didn't know who to approach.

1032
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,349
You've done absolutely the right thing
coming to me about this.

1033
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,280
Why don't we go into my office
and talk there?

1034
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,069
There's some quarter-inch steel here.
Get this over by the bus.

1035
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,196
Here's what I'm looking for.

1036
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,836
What's this Josephson know?

1037
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,876
FEYDERSPIEL:
Nothing that can hurt us yet.

1038
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,596
Why would Shockley give us his route?

1039
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,718
I don't know.
I haven't had time to melt it down.

1040
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,155
It's a ruse. It's a ploy.

1041
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,039
He's trying to manipulate us
into thinking some...

1042
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,998
I think he's on the level.

1043
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,874
I'll call you.

1044
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,235
Do that, Feyderspiel.

1045
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,914
Before the whole bucket
blows up under our face.

1046
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,357
You get that trial postponed.

1047
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,591
Have a heart attack.
Perjure yourself.

1048
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,319
Shockley's got to be stopped.

1049
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,754
Stopped hard.

1050
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,035
SHOCKLEY:
Okay.

1051
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,079
So long, folks.

1052
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,269
Good luck.

1053
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,876
All set?

1054
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,276
Ready.

1055
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,158
Hijacked a what?

1056
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,279
BLAKELOCK: Wickenberg-Phoenix.
That's 150 miles of goddamn desert.

1057
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,636
It's 3 hours on that road.

1058
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,995
We could...

1059
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,195
...blast that bus to hell.

1060
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,637
Sitting duck, you know?

1061
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,710
Call Vegas.

1062
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,872
Have the boys do it.
Blow the shit out of it, I mean.

1063
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,433
I could make that call.

1064
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,875
But the boys don't
do that sort of job.

1065
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,519
It's a little high-profile.

1066
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,312
But they're with us, right?

1067
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,429
Yes, sir.

1068
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,116
But we're talking about
a large bus on a public highway.

1069
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,952
And that's big news.

1070
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,873
Our friends in Las Vegas
don't like...

1071
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,271
They're embarrassed by
that kind of coverage.

1072
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,870
Our boys, then. The cops,
deputy sheriffs, Highway Patrol.

1073
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,157
We've got heavy-duty weapons,
don't we? Bazookas?

1074
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,992
We have the assholes.

1075
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,549
Show some balls!
Blow them away, for chrissake!

1076
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,832
Sir, with all due respect,
this is a very well-traveled highway.

1077
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,038
We don't want blood and tennis rackets
all over the asphalt.

1078
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,076
Screw it!

1079
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,992
A few casualties.

1080
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,711
If there are casualties,
other than Shockley and the girl...

1081
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,235
...someone will be answerable.
You.

1082
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,591
I make the decisions.

1083
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,874
Now what is it?
Are there any other options?

1084
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,275
I suggest we let Shockley
drive right in.

1085
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,033
Now, we have his route.

1086
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,077
We then employ a two-phase plan.

1087
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,993
In phase one, we use his friend,
Josephson, to lay a trap.

1088
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,914
In phase two, we clear
the streets along his route...

1089
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,993
...deploy our men and create
an impassable barrier.

1090
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,952
A gauntlet, if you will.

1091
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,758
He won't have a chance.

1092
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,879
That would work, wouldn't it?

1093
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,356
I mean...

1094
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,876
...we could control
the media then too.

1095
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:41,075
We'd appear justified, getting him.
It'd be a feather in our caps.

1096
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,671
- Excellent thinking.
- Then that's our plan.

1097
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,551
Can you manage? Can you
arrange the thing with his friend?

1098
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,829
Josephson, sir?

1099
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,274
Yes, sir.

1100
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,756
I'll put it in the works right away.

1101
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,437
(BLAKELOCK OVER RADIO)
<i>I repeat to all units:</i>

1102
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,548
<i>Station yourselves as requested.</i>

1103
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,430
<i>Battalion Captains will be taking</i>
<i>their orders from this office only.</i>

1104
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,358
<i>Contingency nine-one.</i>

1105
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,552
We're doing this to one of our own?

1106
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,438
You heard Blakelock, didn't you?

1107
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,908
But it don't make sense.

1108
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,470
I mean, if this guy's
the mad-dog killer Blakelock says...

1109
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,188
...why would he supply us
with his route?

1110
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,196
What do you think they'll do to us?

1111
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,069
Whatever Blakelock tells them to.

1112
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,949
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
The Chief or the Mayor or...

1113
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,077
He's the Police Commissioner.

1114
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,276
He'll do whatever he wants to do.

1115
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,872
He can put an army on the streets
and nobody'd question it.

1116
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,111
You do want kids, don't you?

1117
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,314
Kids, a house, a car, swimming pool.
You name it.

1118
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,272
Someplace with trees.

1119
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,159
Someplace with neighbors
not too close by.

1120
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,710
With hills to walk in.

1121
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,634
Horses and a greenhouse, maybe.

1122
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,159
Maybe even a little
guesthouse out back.

1123
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,913
Maybe even a...

1124
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,835
What?

1125
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,628
Nothing.

1126
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,958
You don't even know
if I'm good in bed or not.

1127
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,870
I'll just take that on faith.

1128
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,429
What if he gets through?

1129
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,869
He can't get through.

1130
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,032
He's gotten this far, hasn't he?

1131
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,794
<i>Sir, how many units have you deployed?</i>

1132
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,513
Four dozen? Five dozen?

1133
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,354
And those marksmen
are the finest on the force.

1134
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,469
I know. But what happens if...

1135
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,113
I mean, there's going to be
hell to pay if something...

1136
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,759
...goes wrong.

1137
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,358
The only thing that can
go wrong is if your disciples...

1138
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,115
...decide they can't shoot down
one of their own officers.

1139
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,952
Jesus, they're cops.

1140
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,395
The bastards are paid to shoot,
not think.

1141
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,397
Then we have no problem.

1142
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,954
SHOCKLEY: This is where our
welcoming committee will be.

1143
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,194
Why can't we just keep going?

1144
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,351
Maybe they won't stop us.

1145
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,318
We could just keep going and going...

1146
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,118
Nag, nag, nag!

1147
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,709
What's that?

1148
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,868
SHOCKLEY:
Roadblock.

1149
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,230
You get ready to hit the deck now.

1150
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,639
MALLY:
They're letting us through.

1151
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,110
Don't want innocent people
to get killed.

1152
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,715
MALLY:
Who's that?

1153
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,317
Jesus! That's Josephson.

1154
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,273
What the hell you doing here?

1155
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,271
Jesus Christ!

1156
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,035
You don't have to do this.

1157
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,952
We've got a friend at City Hall.

1158
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,510
- Who?
- Feyderspiel.

1159
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,030
JOSEPHSON: He's the Assistant D.A.
On the DeLuca case.

1160
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,433
I told him about Blakelock.
He promised to help us.

1161
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,717
He promised to defend you
if you could prove your point.

1162
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,350
I don't trust anybody
connected with the DeLuca case.

1163
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,113
Damn it! Don't you hear me?

1164
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,476
The man is the Assistant D.A.

1165
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,870
The man prepared the whole case.

1166
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,597
Maybe he's the one with enough guts
to go up against Blakelock.

1167
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,398
And maybe they're in bed together.

1168
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,234
Maybe the whole thing's a smokescreen.

1169
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,993
JOSEPHSON:
Listen to me.

1170
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,277
I've talked to Feyderspiel.
He's okay, not like we thought.

1171
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,715
Besides, guy, you've got no choice.

1172
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,952
Blakelock's got half the
goddamn police force out there.

1173
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,390
Just waiting for
this elephant to roll in.

1174
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,436
SHOCKLEY:
Where?

1175
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,159
JOSEPHSON:
Seventh, Central...

1176
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,230
...Mesa...

1177
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,550
...Adams.
The whole route you gave me.

1178
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,394
The place is swarming with squad cars.

1179
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:01,474
Hell, even with this pig iron,
it's suicide.

1180
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,070
Please. Transfer to my car.

1181
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,237
Stay in the back.
Just stay down low.

1182
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,358
I'll smuggle you into City Hall.
The back door.

1183
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,229
Feyderspiel and I got it doped out.

1184
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,438
We'll take the service elevator.
He said keep your gun.

1185
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,597
If you think you're being crossed...

1186
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,196
...you can use him for a hostage
to get away again.

1187
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,437
For chrissakes! This man's laying
his life on the line for you!

1188
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,430
What do you think?

1189
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,990
I think it's worth a try.

1190
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,390
Maynard Josephson, meet Gus Mally.

1191
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,596
Hi, Gus.

1192
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,193
Let's go, partner.

1193
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,357
MALLY: Oh, my God!
SHOCKLEY: Get in the bus!

1194
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,349
MALLY:
Get in the bus!

1195
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,272
Son of a bitch!

1196
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,354
He's dead!

1197
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,711
The son of a bitches killed him!

1198
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,473
Blakelock and Feyderspiel.

1199
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,075
Goddamn, motherfucking...

1200
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,074
Stay down.

1201
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,715
We're going in.

1202
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,959
Keep glued to that floor.

1203
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,876
Commence firing!

1204
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,951
Unit 4, this is Unit 5.

1205
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,315
Stand by.

1206
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,994
We failed to stop him.
He's headed straight for you.

1207
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,390
Come here.
Drive this sucker.

1208
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,715
Get up.

1209
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,752
Drive this sucker.

1210
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,234
I don't know how!

1211
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,908
- Do what I tell you!
- Don't yell at me!

1212
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,959
Do what I tell you.

1213
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,479
Drive, please!

1214
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,629
Jesus Christ!

1215
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,512
MALLY:
Oh, my God! Look at this.

1216
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,679
Open fire!

1217
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,913
Just get down!

1218
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,599
Stay down!

1219
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,432
Watch out! Here he comes!

1220
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,355
Cease fire!

1221
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,192
Cease fire!

1222
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,314
I've got a witness here
for Courtroom "G."

1223
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,073
I gave orders!

1224
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,470
They were supposed to kill them!

1225
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,119
I gave orders!

1226
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,630
Shoot them!

1227
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,716
Shoot!

1228
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,870
Kill them!

1229
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:37,916
Shoot them!

1230
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,474
Kill them!

1231
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,314
SHOCKLEY:
Tell them.

1232
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,355
FEYDERSPIEL:
It was Blakelock!

1233
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,834
SHOCKLEY:
Tell them about Blakelock.

1234
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,832
Blakelock did the cover-up!

1235
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,429
SHOCKLEY: What cover-up?
FEYDERSPIEL: The DeLuca cover-up.

1236
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,437
He set you and the girl up!

1237
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,877
MALLY:
Please speak to me!

1238
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,277
You know I love you.

1239
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:20,795
Goddamn it!

1240
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,233
Ben Shockley, don't you die on me!

1241
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,592
Open those fucking eyes!

1242
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,552
Nag, nag, nag!

1243
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,074
SHOCKLEY:
Get me up.

1244
