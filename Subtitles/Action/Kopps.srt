1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
- Hello.
- Hello. Jacob.

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,300
- Camilla.
- Please sit down.

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Something to drink?
Wine perhaps?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,100
I'll just have some water.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,800
Excuse me.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,100
Since we don't know one another,
I've got some questions, if that's okay?

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes, sure...

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Do you watch a lot of TV?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,300
No more than normal.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,200
- Okay, what's normal for you?
- I don't know, a bit...

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,400
Do you have plants at home?

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,900
Right, next one. In the ad you said
you were humorous. Is that true?

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,400
Well, in my job
the environment is quite tough -

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,500
- so it's important to keep your
humour up through laughing a bit...

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
What do you mean?

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,100
That you... you laugh sometimes...

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
- Why do you have a moustache?
- Sorry?

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
Moustache?

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,300
It's something I'm comfortable with.
I think it's good looking.

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,400
Okay, that was everything.

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Sorry about all the questions, but
this isn't a natural way of meeting.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,700
It's alright.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Well, now that's done.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,800
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
- What are you going to have?
- I'll be honest with you...

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,100
- You're not my type.
- But we've just...

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes, I know, but you feel straight
away there isn't anything, you know.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,900
- I see...
- So, I may as well leave.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Okay? Bye.

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
Bye.

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,200
KOPS

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,900
What was I thinking of...

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
- Yes... how'd it go with that girl?
- Not so good.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
What the hell...?

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,600
What kind of bloody music is this?

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,100
- No, no...
- No, that's mine and that's yours...

37
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Has everyone bid?
Did you bid, Lasse?

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Lasse, did you bid?

39
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
- Three aces.
- Full house.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,500
Damn, Greta, that's the third time.
You're cheating!

41
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
- There's no cheating here.
- No, we never do.

42
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,500
- Then it's just pure luck.
- Luck? No, skill...

43
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,500
- Let's go!
- Shut up everyone!

44
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,000
- Get on the floor!
- Down, down!

45
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,100
- Let's go, let's go!
- Thirty seconds!

46
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Benny...!

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Benny!

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,300
It's lunch time.

49
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
- What are we having?
- Waffle hot dogs.

50
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,200
No mustard on mine, Agneta.

51
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Can I have
some grilled onions as well?

52
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
Lasse! Come on, say it!

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,700
- I love you.
- What? I didn't hear. What'd you say?

54
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,200
- I love you.
- You see, he can't say it.

55
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
- I just said it.
- Are you embarrassed? Just say it.

56
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,200
- What should he say?
- He should say, "l love you".

57
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,900
- To me?
- No, Agneta.

58
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,400
- What, you love Agneta?
- No, Lasse.

59
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,900
I just think we've gone beyond
that stage.

60
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,600
- What stage is that?
- Exactly.

61
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,900
- Suddenly everyone's against me...
- Admit you're no romantic. It's okay.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Exactly. And he's getting fat.
Feel here.

63
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,700
- Stop it...
- Say it, then. Say it...

64
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,800
- I love, I love you! Are you happy?
- No. You should say it with feeling.

65
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,700
- Jacob here. It's Jacob... Jacob.
- Hi Jacob. We have a 24-71.

66
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,800
Again? We're on our way.

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
Lasse, let's go. We've got a 24-71.

68
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,000
- What are we going to do now?.
- A coffee after lunch sounds good.

69
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,400
- What are you doing?
- Talking a bit.

70
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,300
Cut it out. Let's get him.

71
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,600
Okay... One... two... three...
Let's go!

72
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,200
Go about your business,
we've got this under control.

73
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,700
Hey, Dick... Yes...

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,300
Håkan, that shampoo in the shower,
is it anti-dandruff?. It's so foamy.

75
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,100
Yes, it's really creamy. Dog shampoo
has to be like that to maintain volume.

76
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,300
Hello... Right, everyone's here.

77
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,600
- Good morning, officers.
- Good morning, Folke.

78
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,100
- Are you all well?
- Yes, thanks.

79
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,500
Good... Right, Agneta.

80
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,200
Okay. At 08:30 they rang
from the hot-dog stand -

81
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
- there was some guy
in a cowboy hat...

82
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,100
- And cowboy boots.
- And cowboy boots.

83
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,400
...walking on the railway tracks.
When we got there he was gone.

84
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
Bun?

85
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,600
What is that cow doing out there?

86
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,700
Well... He's grazing, I think.

87
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,700
- Anything else?
- What's it called...

88
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,800
Agneta and I
want to talk about the patrol cars.

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,700
I know,
it's been really confusing lately.

90
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,100
- We should call them patrol cars.
- Patrol cars?

91
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,700
- That's what they're called.
- I'm not going round saying patrol car!

92
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,200
It's all wrong. There are
different police service vehicles.

93
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,200
There's trafic control cars,
investigation cars...

94
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Benny, come on... We've only got
two cars. Number one and two.

95
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,400
- It's not so hard to keep track.
- Right, right...

96
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,200
- Really good buns, by the way.
- I baked them.

97
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,100
- Really good.
- Thanks.

98
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Dick, no way, come on. Off... off!.

99
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,200
- Jesus, Jacob!
- I have to.

100
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,100
- What'd happen if you didn't?
- Nothing.

101
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,900
But if I didn't do it
I wouldn't stop thinking about it.

102
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,300
- Haven't you tried skipping it?
- Once. I couldn't stop thinking about it.

103
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,900
I had to do it twice the next day.
You know that. Why ask?

104
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,300
- I didn't ask, I just think it's strange.
- That's how it is.

105
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
Hello!

106
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Little squirt... God, no, no, no....
Hello! What do you want from me?

107
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,700
Every time I'm here,
you're after my arse. What you want?

108
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,400
- Who are you?
- Jenny.

109
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Right, you're that little mongrel
I fetch here sometimes.

110
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,000
- You're the mongrel!
- Cheeky, too? Now you're done for!

111
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
So, violence against a policeman?

112
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
That's at least a life sentence.

113
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Shit, 28 seconds...

114
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Come on... in the hole...

115
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Two, three, four, five, six...

116
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,700
- Hey, Benny. You okay?
- Hi, Mike.

117
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
- I'm fine.
- What you doing?

118
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,100
- Just some...
- Shit, you fag, you're knitting!

119
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
- My mother knits.
- Shut the fuck up.

120
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Shit, that sounds nuts.
"Fuck"? You sound like a total straight.

121
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,300
- Say "fock", gangsta style, like.
- I am...

122
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,100
Christ, what you doing here Mike?
Go in, eat food! Now!

123
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
- Hi, Benny.
- Hi, Ramzi.

124
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

125
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,900
- What you doing, knitting?
- It's going to be one of those...

126
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,600
What you knit? Police don't go knit.
Must help people.

127
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,700
My wife knits in home. Are you wife?

128
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,600
No, you know I'm a policeman.

129
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,700
- What a policeman. Bye, Benny!
- Bye.

130
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,600
I got your message...

131
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,700
...and yes, it's going
to be great meeting you, too.

132
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,600
I'll tell you what I'll be wearing
so you'll recognize me.

133
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll be wearing... blue...
light blue jeans -

134
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,200
- and a white striped top.

135
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,300
Or maybe a blue striped one,
I haven't decided yet.

136
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,300
But... how do you say...

137
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,300
I have dark hair and will have
a moustache... or, I have a moustache.

138
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,600
See you this evening and...
see you this evening.

139
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,900
Which one should I wear?

140
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,400
-That one.
-You like it... And this blue one?

141
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,100
- It doesn't go together? No?
- No...

142
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
This one, then.

143
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,600
Hello... Good you could come.

144
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,200
No problem.
I didn't have any plans.

145
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
- I have a date today.
- Today again?

146
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,400
- But this time it feels really good.
- I've heard that before.

147
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
- But...
- Hello, Jenny.

148
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,700
Listen... 28 year-old woman
seeks a cuddly guy.

149
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,300
She says she likes long walks
and cozy nights at home.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,800
- I see you're drinking white wine?
- Yes.

152
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
I'll also have that...

153
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,100
A glass of white.

154
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,100
My daughter thought I should
wear the white striped one.

155
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,400
- I see.
- What are you reading?

156
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,700
A book...

157
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,700
It feels a little strange meeting
like this... You know...

158
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
No... It's not so strange meeting...

159
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,500
We don't have to talk about it,
we can just talk.

160
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,300
What do you do otherwise, besides
long walks and cozy nights at home?

161
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,900
- Nothing else.
- Me neither. I do nothing.

162
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
You take snuff?.

163
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,900
No, I... I think it's cool
when girls take snuff.

164
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,000
- Do you?
- Yes... Can I...?

165
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,600
- You take snuff?.
- No, but I'll show you something.

166
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,500
- A magician?
- I'm a little nervous, but...

167
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,300
But I think it'll work.

168
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
No...

169
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
Jesus...

170
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,700
- That's disgusting!
- Oh, sorry.

171
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
Excuse me, can I have a napkin?

172
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,800
I've always done it, but it works
better since my mouth has grown.

173
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,500
- How clever!
- Thanks. Can you do it?

174
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,600
No, I can do this. Crazy...

175
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,400
I can do this as well
which is really funny.

176
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,700
You maybe... Be careful...

177
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,700
No. Almost...

178
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,700
- Hello... You're Jacob, right?
- Yes.

179
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm Lena.

180
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,700
 -What? Are you sure?
- Yes. We were meant to meet here.

181
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,500
You were going to be in jeans,
a striped shirt and with a moustache.

182
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,500
Yes, that seems right.

183
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,900
- We could maybe do it another time?
- Listen, I...

184
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,100
Take care.

185
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,700
- I'm really sorry.
- I didn't understand that it was...

186
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
...one of these...

187
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,500
You know what? I'm getting up early
tomorrow, so I'm going to go up and...

188
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,300
- Maybe we could meet another time?
- I'll be here tomorrow.

189
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

190
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,100
- Jacob.
- Jessica.

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,100
Good night.

192
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,500
- You fuck her?
- Cut it out, I'm a serious guy.

193
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Yes, but... I'm a serious...

194
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Fucking is serious. If I didn't have
Agneta, I'd show you how.

195
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,700
You know the secret of getting a
woman? A good carpet and curtains.

196
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,000
When they see that it signals
security. And they open up right away.

197
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,700
- Lasse, you're... A shaggy carpet?
- Yes, that's what it's about.

198
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,000
- Hi, Benny. Nice!
- Thanks.

199
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,100
What? Shaggy... just shaggy...

200
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,200
Hi, all... What's it called...
I'd like to...

201
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,900
...I've got some presents here, that...

202
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,000
It's nothing special,
I made them myself... Feels so silly.

203
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,300
- Let's see.
- Show us.

204
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
- Are they oven gloves?
- No, sweatbands.

205
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,100
- You made them yourself?.
- Nice.

206
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,100
There's a letter on them
for each name, so just...

207
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,000
Here you are, Jacob. Håkan.

208
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
- Thanks!
- Agneta...

209
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Try them on. You like them?

210
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,100
- Look, Lasse, you look good.
- You too.

211
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,800
I thought when we play bandy
sometime...

212
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Then we could be like a team.

213
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Good day, officers.
This is Jessica Lindblad.

214
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,600
- Central Bureau of National Police.
- HQ.

215
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,900
HQ... And she has something
important to tell you.

216
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
- You want to continue?
- Thanks.

217
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,900
Hello, everyone...

218
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,300
We've looked at statistics
from the whole country -

219
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,800
- and what's positive is that you don't
really have crime here -

220
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,200
- to motivate your activity.

221
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,600
As you know, even we are struggling
with a tough economy -

222
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,100
- and the result is that
we are obliged to make cuts...

223
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,400
To get straight to it, this station
will be closed within three months.

224
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,300
I have a programme of measures
you can look at...

225
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait a bit...

226
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,500
Will this mean
that we won't be policemen later?

227
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,800
No, there are other districts
in need of personnel.

228
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,500
- But why?
- lt'll be clear ifyou look at this.

229
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Christ, this can't be for real!
It can't be.

230
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,200
- Is there nothing we can do?
- All the uniforms...

231
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
...and patrol cars?
What are you going to do with them?

232
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Wait a bit, there must be
something we can do?

233
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,700
- Hi.
- Hi...

234
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,500
- Listen...
- Can I have a large whiskey?

235
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,700
-Why didn't you say anything? Why?
-What could I say?

236
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
- I thought it was nice meeting you.
- I also thought so, but what...

237
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,500
- Why are you closing the station?
- I'm not doing it.

238
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,700
- You know what this station means?
- Sorry, I'm just doing myjob...

239
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,300
You sit behind a desk making
decisions and you call that a job?!

240
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,700
You don't know...
you haven't been on the streets.

241
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,600
- Ofcourse I have.
- Well then, prove it.

242
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,000
- Please, can't you...
- You have to be fast to catch thieves.

243
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's play a game.
Raise your hand and I'll count to three.

244
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
The fastest one hits the other,
like this...

245
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,700
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, I really didn't mean to...

246
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Jacob, that was really uncalled for.

247
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,000
It's a game. You hold up your hand...

248
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,400
...Iike this, then you count to three
and hit... I don't know what happened.

249
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We have received a definitive decision
that the police station will be closed.

250
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,200
It has come as a suprise,
both to me... and to my colleagues.

251
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,200
And we...
You wanted to say something?

252
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,400
There's something
that people don't know.

253
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,800
We work according to an American
method called "Pre-Crime" -

254
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
- or PP, which means
to predict and prevent-

255
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,500
- crime before it...
and so creating a kind of relation to...

256
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,700
Have you taken any steps
against the closure?

257
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,700
We've put up a protest list
at the grocery store.

258
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,800
What is going to happen
to all the desks?

259
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,500
- Jacob, what is it?
- What is it?!

260
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
They're bloody right.
We're totally unnecessary!

261
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Fuckall happens here! Check
out all the crime everywhere else!

262
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,200
Why can't they share it
so we could get one little thief here?

263
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
I feel so worthless.
No girlfriend and soon jobless!

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Calm down, for Christ's sake!

265
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,600
Jacob...
I also think it's really hard...

266
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,300
Listen,
we'll have a waffle hot dog.

267
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I know every street, every corner.
I like you, Lasse, Jacob.

268
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,500
You are, for me anyway, like a family.
You can't just change that.

269
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,500
- Wha twill you and Lasse do?
- We can'tjust sell the house and go.

270
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,300
We'll have to stay...

271
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,100
Benny, do you think
I've got saggy tits?

272
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,800
No, what....?
I dunno, a little...

273
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,800
But it's not serious. It's not like
you go round thinking about it.

274
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,900
- Has Lasse said so?
- I just wondered.

275
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,200
What the hell? Agneta, wait...

276
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,300
Okay, what have we got here?

277
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,200
- Look...
- Benny, look here.

278
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,100
- What is it?
- Skid marks.

279
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll be damned...

280
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,200
- It's a worn down Michelin.
- Someone's probably hit it.

281
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,800
You think so?
I don't know, I think it feels...

282
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,100
...more professional in some way.

283
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,100
It's like a "drive-by" situation.

284
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Two metres from the edge...

285
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Parallel tracks...

286
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,800
Hello, this is Jesica.

287
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,700
Hello, Jessica, it's Jacob here.

288
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,200
I just wanted to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

289
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,000
I was wondering if you could call me?
You can call me anytime, I'm here...

290
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,400
I'm here anytime... not on Thursdays
'cause I work early on Fridays.

291
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,100
Whatever, you can call me...

292
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,400
Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

293
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,500
Rabbit! Rabbit, Dick.
Rabbit!

294
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,800
- Stop it!
- I want him to sit up like a rabbit.

295
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,600
Look... Rabbit! He'll do it soon.

296
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,400
- Stop it.
- Rabbit! Rabbit!

297
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,100
Hi, guys. Have you seen anything
strange in town?

298
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,300
- Strange?
- We had a hit and run on Östervägen.

299
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,900
The waste bin on the left
has been totally destroyed.

300
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,000
Shit, it looks like
some total psycho has...

301
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,600
You haven't seen anything?

302
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,600
Okay, I'll have to write a report.
Håkan, can you help with the computer?

303
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,200
I'm coming.

304
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,600
- Come on, Håkan.
- It's easy, just press the button.

305
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,400
Easy? There's loads of buttons here.
There's C-TROLL -

306
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,300
- and DELETE and HOME and...
Come on.

307
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,300
- Håkan.
- Take it easy.

308
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,100
- We're having coffee. What's the hurry?
- What's with you?

309
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,100
This is typical.
Just 'cause I dug up something.

310
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,900
It could be anything. It could
lead to... it could be a serious crime.

311
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,400
Come on, Håkan.

312
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,100
Lasse...

313
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,800
Are you...

314
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,400
- You thinking the same thing as me?
- Yes, probably.

315
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
- What are you thinking of?.
- Well, the same as you.

316
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,000
- What is that?
- Well, you know...

317
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,700
- Say it.
- No, you first.

318
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,300
Come on.

319
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,000
- Hello, Göran, how're things?
- Hi, guys. Fine...

320
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,200
- I hope that's empty?
- Yes, I'll put it away.

321
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,000
- Nice jacket. Nice with a hood and all.
- Yes, it's a nice jacket.

322
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,500
- You doing anything special now?.
- I'm going to sleep.

323
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,000
What would you say
if we gave you this?

324
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,600
- You giving me that?
- Yes, but you must do us a favour.

325
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
- What favour?
- Come with us to the car.

326
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,200
We'll discuss it in the car.
In the car...

327
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,900
You just need to go
to the grocery store.

328
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,000
Then you steal something
and come back.

329
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,200
- What should I steal?
- Anything, then run like hell.

330
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,400
- No, it's not... I don'twant to...
- You won't do it?

331
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,200
You won't do it?
Allright, let's talk business.

332
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
That's for me...

333
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,000
- Smells good, huh?
- Shall we drink it? No...

334
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,400
What you doing?! No, no!
Stop it! I'll do it, I'll do it...

335
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,100
- I'll do it for two bottles.
- What?!

336
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,700
- What?
- lf I get two bottles... two.

337
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,300
You get one bottle and
a new fishing rod. What do you say?

338
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,800
- Okay, we say so, that's fine...
- I like you...

339
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
I like you, too.

340
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,600
- Do you believe in this?
- He'll do it, don'tworry.

341
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,100
I don't mean him, I mean us.
What are we doing, we're policemen?

342
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,200
Are you just going to stand back and
watch while they close the station?

343
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,900
- We're just helping boost statistics.
- Statistics? We're accomplices.

344
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,300
- But we're handing the stuff back.
- Yes, but...

345
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,800
- Here, here!
- Is that it?

346
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,300
- Give me the bottle.
- If I see you with it, you're going in.

347
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,500
- This stays between us, got it?
- And my fishing rod, can I have it?

348
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,100
- You'll get it later
- Later!

349
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,700
- Later. Get going, now!
- You promised!

350
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
Get going.
You'll get it later.

351
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,100
- You see anyone?
- No.

352
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,800
Think, Benny, think...

353
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,100
Imagine they planned
to destroy the waste bin?

354
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,500
- Aren't you having a coffee?
- But then they wouldn't have skidded.

355
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,100
- It's an ordinary waste bin.
- Exactly, that's what's so...

356
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
There are skid marks, too...

357
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,900
Benny, Benny, look!

358
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,400
Hey, halt! Freeze!

359
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,500
Halt! Freeze!

360
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,000
- Shit!
- Did you see who itwas?

361
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,100
I couldn't see... Shit...

362
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
Vodka, 75cl...

363
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,100
Think, Benny, change angle...

364
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,800
- What if there's a link.
- A link?

365
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Between what happened yesterday
and the masked man?

366
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,100
Hello...

367
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,800
Everything okay?
It's really sad with the closure...

368
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
If we look at the list
we have 22 names -

369
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,200
- and the Åkesson family are coming
later and they're quite a few.

370
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,900
- Thanks...
- Are you going to barbecue?

371
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,600
- Have you seen anyone strange here.
- No, why?

372
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,200
No...? You've been burgled, Kent.
These are the stolen goods

373
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
- The perpetrator got away.
- Are you serious?

374
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,400
These things are terrible. You sure
you haven't seen the perpetrator?

375
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,200
No... I was in the bathroom...

376
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,900
- You should report it.
- It's not necessary, is it?

377
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,700
- I have my sausages back.
- But a report is very important, Kent.

378
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,800
But it's just a load
of paperwork and things...

379
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Listen, Kent. The law says
you have to make a report-

380
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,500
- otherwise we can report
you for an unfiled report.

381
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,600
Because you didn't report the report
you're bound to report-

382
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,800
- your report can be reported
because you didn't report it.

383
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,000
And then your report
can be reported by us...

384
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,000
You understand?

385
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,400
No... But I'll make a report,
I'll do it.

386
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,800
- Lasse, you're good at talking shit.
- Shit...

387
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
For people to see the truth
you have to lie a bit.

388
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,500
- We have a report, anyway.
- And there'll be more.

389
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,300
- Is there a problem with the lock?
- No.

390
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Nothing wrong with it.

391
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,300
SHOOT A COP

392
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,200
What the hell you doing?

393
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,400
SHOOT A GOOSE

394
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,800
- No, please!
- I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

395
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,300
No, please!

396
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,600
- One, two, three.
- What do, Mike, what do?

397
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,300
- You can do that.
- You can't do that.

398
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Benny, can you help with something?

399
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,200
You can move these three squares,
can'tyou?

400
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Pawns can move, what is it...?
Twice the first time and then once.

401
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,800
Can't do that.

402
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,400
He can only do this. Watch.
This, this...

403
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,800
- This, can do...
- No, not in this game. It's chess.

404
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,700
- Who said so?
- I don't know... My dad...

405
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,100
- He's joking with you, dad...
- Fucking shit game!

406
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,500
Hey, wait, wait...

407
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Shit, there it is again. There's
the grocery store, the waste bin...

408
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,300
- The masked man...
- Benny, are you feel well?

409
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,800
- Benny, are you feel well?
- What?

410
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,800
- Yes, sure.
- Are you sure you feel well?

411
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,800
- Okay. Bye, bye...
- Bye.

412
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,600
A number of strange things have
started happening in ourtown.

413
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,200
We've had reports for vandalisation,
theft, small arms fire...

414
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,200
I don't know how to interpret it.

415
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,400
That's what I've said all along,
there's some gang thing going on.

416
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,200
My calculations say they know about the
closure and have moved activity here.

417
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,600
- You see how serious this is?
- There could be a point to that.

418
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,200
Anyhow, I want you to keep your eyes
open and be careful out there.

419
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,600
- A gang...
- Hang on, these are just theories.

420
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,900
For instance the masked man we
saw. He looks like a regular drunk.

421
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,500
I don't think it's a gang at all.

422
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,600
Hi, Göran. I need to talk to you.

423
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Get against the car. Come on.

424
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,100
- Spread them. Got anything on you?
- It's okay, Benny.

425
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,400
Get in, Göran.

426
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,800
- Are you nervous?
- Yes...

427
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,600
Why are you nervous?

428
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,900
There was a burglary at the
grocery store. You know about it?

429
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,900
- A packet of sausages...
- That's because... the fishing rod.

430
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,700
- What fishing rod?
- The fishing rod when I... Oh, shit...

431
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Now I've gone and done it again...

432
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,400
- You want us to skewer your balls?
- Come on, Göran.

433
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,700
- Come on, tell us. Göran!
- No, it's...

434
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,000
Haven't you ever barbecued?
You have to prepare it well.

435
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,900
That's fine,
you'll burn down the whole stand.

436
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,500
Yes...

437
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,900
That's good.

438
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,300
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Nothing.

439
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,300
The bin was burning
and we tried to put it out.

440
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,300
Stop it. We've spoken to Göran,
so cut it out! What are you up to?

441
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,400
We're doing it for your sakes too.
We just want to keep the station.

442
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
- Why didn't you say anything?
- We wanted to boost statistics.

443
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,800
- What you think we want?
- We wanted to surprise you.

444
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,200
- Don't you trust us? Does Folke know?.
- No.

445
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
It's catching here...

446
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,000
Boost statistics by stealing sausages?
You can't do anything right, Lasse!

447
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
God, it's burning!

448
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,200
If we're going to boost statistics, go
for it. What's this shitty little fire?!

449
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,300
- Sorry, but now you know.
- It's really burning.

450
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,800
- Why you burning Janne's stand?
- We wanted to burn something...

451
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,700
Call the fire department,
there're gas canisters in there!

452
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,500
- Gas canisters?
- Shit!

453
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,600
- Did it explode?
- I don't know, I didn't hear...

454
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,900
Shit...!
Where're we going to eat lunch now?.

455
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,600
Please respect the exclusion zone.
Thank you. Thanks.

456
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,500
- It's sad, Janne.
- Yes.

457
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
- You know who could have done it?
- What do you mean?

458
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
- It looks professional. Any enemies?
- Not as far as I know.

459
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,700
- Any debts?
- I owe my neighbour 150 crowns.

460
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,300
But she wouldn't do this.

461
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,300
Search...

462
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,500
It looks professional. It wouldn't
surprise me if the mafia were behind it.

463
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,400
Hello!
Hello... could I ask some questions?

464
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,900
Wait a bit... Out.

465
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,100
Damn, Agneta,
now the press is here.

466
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,100
- Agneta... I found something here.
- What is it?

467
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,300
I don't know,
it looks like a detonator or something.

468
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,100
Take it in for analysis.
Make sure you get a photo first.

469
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,900
But that's my waffle iron!

470
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,700
These days,
things like that can look like anything.

471
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,300
Listen: "We've never seen anything
like it. From idyll to inferno in days."

472
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,700
"According to the police it's a gang.
'l agree', says Fredriksson."

473
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,300
- The first page.
- Lucky Fredriksson is so dumb.

474
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,300
- It's bloody good for us.
- It's really good...

475
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,300
Benny, what the hell are you doing?

476
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,900
Well, according to my calculations
I should have ended up more there...

477
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,300
Shit Benny,
you drive like a fucking cocksucker!

478
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,300
- Shall we get him?
- Let's get him.

479
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,600
I see you're all very busy...

480
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,100
As you can see we have a new visit
from Jessica Lindblad.

481
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,100
Strange things have occurred here
and I'd like to talk to you about it.

482
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,200
Individually, if possible.

483
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

484
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,000
Don't think about what you saw with
Benny, it was just to raise morale.

485
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,300
It's fine...

486
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,900
I tried calling you,
but you haven't called back.

487
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,500
Why haven't you?

488
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,300
You've had no crime here for 10 years.
Can you explain recent events?

489
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,100
- It's coincidence.
- Coincidence.

490
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,400
We work a little differently.
We work with an American method -

491
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,700
- called "Pre-Crime".
We're a step ahead.

492
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,900
It affects the whole of society.
Crime is on the increase.

493
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,300
- Coincidence?
- No, a gang.

494
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,800
- It could be anything. The PKK...
- What makes you think so?

495
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,200
They knew the station
was shutting down and moved in.

496
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,700
With no police they can
just steal and shoot or whatever.

497
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,000
It's because we have bad resources.
We need more police.

498
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,700
- We have bad resources here.
- I'd like to see more police.

499
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,300
You haven't caught the perpetrators.
Can you explain why?

500
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,100
I grabbed hold of one once,
but he got away.

501
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,900
- It's been quite close.
- Close in whatway?

502
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,600
- There've been chases with shots fired.
- Shots? That's not in my papers.

503
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,600
There's been wild shooting here.
It hasn't been fun.

504
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,500
It's been really hot here.

505
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,300
I've almost been hit
in both my hands and feet.

506
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,700
- Where did the shooting occur?
- To the north.

507
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,100
- Good, we can take a look tomorrow.
- Yes, sure...

508
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,700
Sure... ofcourse.

509
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,600
Of course. I can maybe
come by and pick you up...

510
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,300
No, I think we'll meet up here.

511
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,900
It's one of those recording watches.
So I can remember things...

512
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,800
I see...

513
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,400
I recorded some of the shooting.
Want to hear?

514
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,500
Thanks

515
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,800
Hey, Jessica...

516
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,700
- Have you seen Dick?
- Yes.

517
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,400
- It's...
- Yes, he's really cute.

518
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,900
Wait a bit...

519
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:10,200
I really want to apologise for what
happened last. I really didn't mean to.

520
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,200
It's a game, you have to
hold up your hand... I was drunk.

521
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,000
I shouldn't blame it on that, but...
that's what I'm doing...

522
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
Okay.

523
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,200
Hello, I'm Jessica Lindblad from the...

524
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,600
I know, I know...
The rumour circulates...

525
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,900
-They're really nice, all of them.
-They're nice. We play poker together.

526
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,600
-Wonderful people. Fantastic.
-You've had some theft here.

527
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,300
- Has police collaboration been good?
- Really nice collaboration.

528
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,100
You see that door there?
They put it in.

529
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,700
Look at the fan... They did it.

530
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,800
I meet Jacob most... when
he walks here with his night stick.

531
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,600
Does he do that often? Walk here
with his night stick...? Why?

532
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,100
His daughter is playing overthere.
Jenny is the one lying on Max.

533
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,700
- She's a little rowdy, just like dad!
- Benny doesn't like mustard.

534
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,000
And Agneta, she's too much.
One day she wants grilled onions -

535
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,100
- and the next day
she doesn't want grilled onions!

536
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,000
She says she gets gas
if she has too much onion.

537
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,200
- I won 300 off Benny lastweek.
- But, I took home 500.

538
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,000
- Buy some vegetables?
- No, it's fine.

539
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,800
- Halfprice?
- No, thanks.

540
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,400
- Can you play poker?
- No, but I'd like a bun ifl may?

541
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,800
- That's super! Where'd you buy it?
- I was given it.

542
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
- Really super.
- Thanks a lot.

543
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,500
- This is fine.
- Okay.

544
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,700
That's good.

545
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,400
Very good.

546
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,300
- Right. That's enough.
- Watch out.

547
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,700
-We shouldn't exaggerate this.
-We said there was shooting.

548
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,300
- It's enough.
- Put in two shots.

549
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,600
- That's good. That's enough.
- Fucking shit...

550
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,700
This is Patrol Car One.
It is 09:12 -

551
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,300
- and we're heading
to the hot-dog stand for inspection.

552
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,900
- Good. There are buns here forlater.
- Okay, understood. Over and out.

553
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,100
Buy some sugarfor...

554
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,200
So, what else do you do?

555
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,800
-What do you mean?
-Yes, what do you mean?

556
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,300
- Did I speakto you?
- Butyou're so incredibly unclear.

557
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,200
Who let you out your cage? Unclear?
Coming from you?

558
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,900
Says he! He's... he knows nothing.
He can't even say he loves me!

559
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,000
It's true! What does he look like?
What's this pork here?

560
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,600
His belly looks like a stack ofpancakes.
Is it a spare tire if we get a flat?

561
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,700
Says she with the sagging tits...
They look incredible.

562
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,100
Like slack cones just hanging there,
looking straight down...

563
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:06,000
Listen... Jessica, come into the
shower with me and you'll see. Perfect.

564
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,900
- This is Janne's stand.
- Before it was blown up.

565
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,700
- Howare you, Janne?
- Well, one tries...

566
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,900
Benny,
could I get my waffle iron back?

567
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,200
Unfortunately it could take a while.
It's evidence, so...

568
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,500
Why don't you get a pizza oven
with the insurance money?

569
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,500
I'll stick to hot dogs.
That's what I know best.

570
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,700
- You want a hot dog?
- I'm fine.

571
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,200
Anyone know howt his happened?

572
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,300
According to my calculations,
the shot must have come from there.

573
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,000
Why blow up Janne's stand
with a grenade launcher?

574
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Diversionary tactic. They blowup
the stand at the same time as they -

575
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,200
- plan something somewhere else.
Die Hard 3.

576
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,900
Right. Okay...

577
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,600
This is where the shooting took place.

578
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,300
You can see for yourself
here on the trunks.

579
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,900
What happened, more precisely?

580
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,600
Well, Lasse and I stood over here.
I think...

581
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,300
- Benny and Agneta stood here.
- Yes, I stood here.

582
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,900
- I stood here.
-Yes, that's it.

583
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,800
- And then?
- Then the others stood over there.

584
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,900
- And how many were there?
- I'm not so sure of that, but...

585
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,300
- There were four or five of them.
- A few more.

586
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,600
- There were more like about ten.
- Ten?

587
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,200
One thing I don't get. If you stood here
and shot there and they shot back-

588
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,000
- then how come there are
bullet holes there... and there?

589
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,100
I can answer that.

590
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,600
We gave those guys a real show.

591
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,800
It wasn't really like that,
but... almost.

592
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,600
You don't say.

593
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,300
- Thanks for today.
- Goodbye.

594
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,900
Let me ask you something...

595
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,800
What the hell you doing? You think
you're a super cop, you just talk shit!

596
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,100
What shit? It's meant to look real.

597
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,000
You call that real?!
You want to keep the station?

598
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,300
- That's exactly what I want.
- Shut up, she's coming!

599
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,200
- Have a good day.
- Same to you. Goodbye.

600
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,400
I don't understand.
What's up with him?

601
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,900
- You also think I exaggerated?
- ltwas maybe a bit much.

602
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,200
For once I'm ready
to agree with Agneta.

603
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,800
- For once? Whaty ou mean "for once"?
- I'm ready to agree...

604
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,300
- I heard that, but what do you mean?
- I mean I agree...

605
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
For once, but...

606
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,700
Wait...
There's one thing I must make clear.

607
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,500
Good. What's going on here?

608
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,500
Benny's a good cop, but he exaggerates
sometimes. He's not really like that.

609
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,700
- You think I'm stupid?
- No, not at all...

610
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,600
We also think what's happening here
is weird.

611
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,300
It's nice that you're here, anyway...

612
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,800
I thought... I was thinking...

613
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,700
Every thing that's happening here
is quite new for us, too.

614
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,600
- We're working. We're investigating.
- Okay...

615
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,900
Then I also wondered
if you wanted to go bowling?

616
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,200
- Bowling... if you feel like it.
- What?

617
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,100
No, I don't really know. See you.

618
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,000
- Hey...
- Yes?

619
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,900
- I'll come with.
- Okay.

620
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,500
- I'll just put some shoes on.
- They have bowling shoes there.

621
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,700
- I can't go bare foot.
- No, of course.

622
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,900
You're up.

623
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,600
What's it...? I thought the first
time we met we had -

624
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,500
- you know, a good contact.
You smiled and things.

625
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,300
- Can't you smile when we're bowling?
- Okay.

626
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,700
I know a funny story. You want
to hear it? It's a thighslapper.

627
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,600
Okay, there's a farmer
that lives by the church up here.

628
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:44,100
He has some sheep that he goes out
with sometimes. Just goes out with.

629
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,500
Anyway, one day
one ofthe sheep disappeared.

630
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,500
Then when the priest
arrived there to...

631
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,700
Actually, you can't...

632
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,600
You have to be from here to get it. It
has to do with how the priest looks...

633
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,300
How are you?
How are you...?

634
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,700
Shit, the lane must be faulty. Did
you see, it was almost a strike?

635
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,300
- How's your hand?
- No problem. Let's continue...

636
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,500
- Does it hurt?
- No problem,we can go on...

637
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,200
- That doesn't look good.
- It's fine.

638
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,300
- Are you sure?
- Sure... It's yourturn.

639
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,900
Will it be long before it's healed?

640
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,900
No, but keep it on for a few weeks
and it'll soon be fine.

641
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,200
Thanks.

642
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,000
- How is it?
- It's just a sprain.

643
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,900
Thanks for waiting,
it wasn't necessary.

644
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,600
- I mean it was nice of you, but...
- No problem.

645
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,500
- I'm just going to...
- I'll help you. It's fine.

646
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,400
It was really strange,
the lane must have been faulty.

647
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,700
'Cause I slipped like that...

648
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,700
- And so we won.
- Good.

649
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,800
Thanks for this evening, it was nice.
It was fun.

650
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
- Good. You think so?
- Not that, but it was fun...

651
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,500
You'll have to practice.
Haven't really got the hang of it.

652
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,000
Well, good night. Sleep well.
Oh, sorry. Sorry...

653
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,400
I forgot as well.

654
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,200
- Sleep well.
- You too.

655
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,300
Listen...

656
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,500
I just wanted to say that...

657
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,100
I don't think it's especially fun
coming here and closing your station.

658
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,700
I really don't enjoy doing it
and I want you to know that.

659
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Really, I understand...
You're just trying to do your job.

660
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,100
I know that I was a little short
with you and things...

661
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,800
But you have to be... I don't know
how else to tackle the situation.

662
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,900
- lf I don't keep it up somehow.
- I really understand.

663
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,700
- I hope you can sleep now.
- Yes...

664
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

665
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,300
- See you.
- Yes. Sleep well.

666
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,400
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

667
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,500
Up! Rabbit! Rabbit!

668
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,200
Rabbit! Hello?

669
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,100
- Hello, is that the police?
- For a while, anyway.

670
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,400
I'm at the lodge and I've kidnapped
a child. I want a million crowns.

671
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,400
Hello?

672
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,100
Hello?

673
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,100
Hello, this is Håkan.

674
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,700
I got a call from a man who says
he's kidnapped a child at the lodge.

675
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
He sounded really angry.

676
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,600
It would be good
if you could go there pretty fast.

677
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,200
If anyone's listening, keep it quiet
as there could be weapons involved.

678
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,800
But you others in patrol car one and
two, you must go straight away.

679
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,500
We're there in three minutes.
Over and out.

680
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,100
Thanks. Rabbit!

681
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,600
- I'll be staying on, I'm not finished.
- Really?

682
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,100
- No, there are some things...
- Hello.

683
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,200
I was with Dick doing "rabbit"
and the phone rang...

684
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,600
- Get to the point, Håkan.
- I'll tell you on the way. Come on!

685
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,400
- You see anything?
- Not a damn.

686
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,900
- What's up?
- Let me take care ofit.

687
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,200
We're willing to co-operate,
but we want to see the child first.

688
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,900
- Agneta, you know about this?
- No.

689
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,200
We're willing to co-operate,
but we want to see the child first.

690
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,500
- You know who it is?
- No.

691
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,700
- How many are there?
- Don't know.

692
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,300
I want a million,
or it'll get fucked up!

693
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,700
Benny, give me that.

694
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,100
Okay, but we need time
to get the money.

695
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,400
And we want an assurance
that nothing will happen to the child.

696
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,900
- Fuck you, there's no assurance here!
- Fuck you, there's no assurance here!

697
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,600
- Fucking pigs, I'll blow you away!
- Fucking pigs, I'll blow you away!

698
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,600
- That's enough, idiot, you sound...
- That enough, idiots!

699
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,000
- You recognise him?
- Idiot, don't say that!

700
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,900
- We're going in, we're going in!
- We're going in, fucking pigs!

701
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,300
I want a million,
or it'll get fucked up!

702
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:29,100
He seems deranged. How fast
can we get a special unit here?

703
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,600
- What do you think, Håkan?
- I don't know.

704
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,400
- No idea.
- Contact Råberga now!

705
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,500
- Who do I call? Anders?
- Holmblad.

706
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Hello?
This is Högboträsk police station.

707
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,600
This is Håkan
from Högboträsk police station.

708
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,400
- We can't wait. Jacob, back me up.
- No, Benny, wait!

709
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,600
It's okay, I'm going in...

710
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,200
- Benny, come back!
- It's okay! I'm cool!

711
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,400
- What do we do now?.
- Come here. Stand there.

712
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,200
Benny, look at him. He's
a fucking wimp. He's giving it away.

713
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,100
It's not working. He's nervous. We
should have gotten someone else...

714
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,800
Keep quiet, we don't have time. Grab
me. Put the gun here. Put it here.

715
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,600
- Hey, let me check it out...
- Mike, stop it, not now...

716
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,300
- Okay, put it on the table.
- I want myvodka...

717
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,400
Göran, do what I say.
Mike! Come here. Okay, take it easy.

718
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, we're coming out!

719
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,400
I'm exchanging myself for the child!
I'm exchanging myself for the child!

720
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,200
Run! The situation is under control!

721
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,900
I repeat. The situation is under
control. We're negotiating. Stay calm!

722
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,400
- How are you?
- It was really heavy in there...

723
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,300
Wait, the boy is shocked,
I'll take care of him.

724
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,000
- Any others beside Benny and Göran?
- No. Göran is blowing it...

725
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,200
Under control? What's he doing?
How's he going to get out ofthis?

726
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,800
- I was bad, man...
- Go home to dad.

727
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,200
- No, I want to see some action...
- Go home to dad!

728
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
- Håkan, are they coming?
- Yes.

729
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,400
- Who?
- Special forces.

730
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,300
- What for?
- They're going to... I called Holmberg.

731
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,600
- Jacob, what you doing?
- What the hell are you up to?

732
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,400
What have we here?

733
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,400
- Why didn'tyou say anything?
- I thought about what you said.

734
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,500
I know I exaggerated in the forest.
I've fixed something more believable.

735
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,800
- This'll work easy... No?
- Believable?

736
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,300
- It's under control.
- Control?

737
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,800
The special forces are on the way,
what about them?

738
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,700
- Any contact?
- Yes, the perpetrator is deranged...

739
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,500
Really, who the hell isn't?
Thanks, we'll take over here.

740
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:12,200
Delta formation, now!
First group! Reinholm, Alp!

741
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,600
- Johnsson, Hay!
-What a lot ofpolice...

742
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,500
Second group! Fredriksson, Åkesson,
Petterson! Down overthere!

743
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,700
Should there be so many, Folke?

744
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,600
Feucht, Djupan, Lindqvist!
Stay back!

745
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,200
What the hell were you thinking
of now?. You must have a plan!

746
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,700
I'm thinking...

747
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,300
Closer, thanks!

748
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,000
That's good! Maintain positions!

749
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,100
- You kidnapped a kid, now what?!
- lt was just Mike!

750
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,800
- I didn't know they'd all come.
- What difference if it's Mike!

751
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,900
- You have a plan, you know nothing...
- I have a plan! You and Lasse didn't!

752
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,800
- We had great plan!
- The hot dog stand?!

753
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,500
That was too much,
but the rest was great.

754
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:13,400
- Stop fucking shouting!
- Who the fuck is shouting?

755
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,400
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

756
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,800
What the fuck are you doing?!
Get them to stop!

757
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:43,700
A case of vodka
and two fishing rods for this!

758
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,900
Get them to stop! Terminate!

759
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,600
- Cease firing! Cease firing.
- What the hell are you doing you idiot!

760
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:58,000
I've got one of my policemen in there!
You open fire on my policemen again -

761
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,600
- and I'll kill you! Understood?!

762
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,700
Everyone await orders.
No weapons to be discharged!

763
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,800
Listen, take it easy. It can get like
this when you are under stress.

764
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,400
-Yes, but right now it's difficult.
-Yes, I understand.

765
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,900
- What's your name?
- My name is Gunnar.

766
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:37,100
I'm Håkan... Yes, I know,
I understand. I really do know.

767
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,700
But there is another side to it as well.
You're the leader of a SWAT team -

768
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:46,800
- you fill your vest,
not only literally...

769
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
...you are talented...

770
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,700
You know,
I think something's missing here.

771
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,100
A hug is missing.

772
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,800
Take is easy,
we're coming outthe house!

773
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,400
I repeat, we're coming outthe house!

774
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:20,300
We are now out of the house!

775
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,000
Stand by, everyone... Stand by.

776
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,800
Hi, Benny...

777
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,600
Hi, Benny...

778
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Shit, cool vests.
Hi, we're colleagues, it's fine...

779
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,200
Okay, to the cars. Let's go, let's go...

780
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,200
Fuck it, fucking special force pricks!

781
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:45,300
I should have had my fishing rod,
and I should have had vodka, too...

782
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,400
Now it's gone to hell... shit...
I should have had one vodka.

783
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,700
Then the fishing rod,
tell him I haven't got it yet!

784
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,300
- Help me shift gear.
- My hand! Take it easy, it hurts!

785
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
Fourth gear!

786
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,700
Shit, you see that? Fucking cool!
-Watch out!

787
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,700
- What you doing?!
- It's a car chase.

788
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,700
- Car chase? No one's chasing us!
- I'm going forthe right!

789
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,600
- Where'd you get your licence?
- I'm Benny the cop.

790
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
What the fuck you doing?!

791
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,600
Take it easy!

792
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,700
Take it easy!

793
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,100
- What's up with your hair?
- Nothing.

794
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,900
- Nothing? You're fucking...
- Stop it!

795
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,100
- Have you got a wig?
- What? No way.

796
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,200
- Damnit, Jacob, don't tell anyone.
- No.

797
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,200
Don't tell anyone.
No one will like me...

798
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,000
-Yes...
- No. I don't know any thing...

799
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,800
I don't want to be a policeman
anymore. I can't do it, I'm useless.

800
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,400
Can't fucking
even drive a car properly.

801
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,200
I'm just a fucking bald,
miserable wimp...

802
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,400
Come on, everyone likes you. It's
just not the time to discuss it now.

803
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,000
Look at you!
Take you hair and let's go.

804
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,400
- Where's my hair?
- There.

805
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,200
Don't say anything. Wait a bit...

806
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,900
Just fucking forget it.

807
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,400
Benny, I have to.

808
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,800
Jacob, wait a bit. Jacob...

809
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
- Jacob, wait a bit.
- What the hell?

810
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,600
Damn... It feels like
I got some shit with my belly.

811
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,800
- I have to shit.
- You crazy?

812
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,800
Wait, I have to. I can't help it.

813
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,500
We're being chased
and you want to shit?! You nuts?

814
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,800
Wait. If I don't do it now,
I'll shit on us both while running.

815
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,200
- Fuck!
- I have to!

816
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,400
Shit, then!

817
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,600
- Where're the keys?
- In the car.

818
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,000
Fuck, in the car...

819
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,300
Help a little, damnit!

820
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,400
Lift me up.

821
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,100
- Anything happening?
- It's so fucking quiet.

822
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,800
- Can't you sing?
- Cut it out. Never!

823
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,200
Come on, sing. Please.

824
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,100
... your eyes... on mine...

825
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,000
- And the moon...
- God in heaven...

826
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,500
Okay, into the forest everyone.
Move, move!

827
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,800
Calmly and carefully!

828
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,000
-You got any paper?
-You nuts?

829
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,700
- Can I use your bandage?
- Use your hair instead.

830
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,700
Whatever. Here... come on!

831
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:28,200
Stretch a little. Fuck, I can't reach.
You're on the cheek... I want the arse.

832
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,100
Shit, fucking ant...

833
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,000
Police! Don't move!

834
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,500
I don't really know what to say...

835
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,600
The station will be closed,
as you already know.

836
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,100
I can't do anything
about that decision.

837
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,800
I've concluded my report
on the events in this town.

838
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,100
Can I ask...

839
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,200
- Is everything included in...
- Yes, everything has been noted.

840
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,400
- Our names...?
- You've already asked.

841
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,000
Will we be put away forthis?

842
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,100
That's what we'll do with that...

843
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,200
I wish you all the best with everything
you do, whatever it is.

844
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,800
Goodbye.

845
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,700
We just tried to boost statistics.

846
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,200
- Nice of you.
- Pleasure, no problem.

847
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,200
There's still some Kiwi cake
in the kitchen if anyone wants it.

848
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,800
Good, Dick, give them hell!
Christ, come on...!

849
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,600
Look at it positively,
we have each other. Huh?

850
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,700
- Benny?
- What? I don't know...

851
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,000
Agneta?

852
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,100
- Lasse, come on!
- What?

853
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,400
Well...

854
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,700
I have an idea. It may sound stupid,
but I've been thinking it over.

855
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,600
It's good, it's actually damn good.

856
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,800
I think we should...

857
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,300
- No...!
- That's damn good!

858
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
THREE MONTHS LATER

859
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,800
Pizza Police.

860
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:42,000
They're on their way.
Five minutes, ten at the most.

861
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,600
- Only 60, they had no change.
- There are a lot today...

862
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:53,400
- You have to knead it well...
- You can! Even my dad knows this!

863
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,000
These four have to go,
to someone called Pyk Jonsson.

864
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,000
- What's the address?
- Hang on.

865
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,900
I've got a Die Hard, a Scarface
and three Rambo with extra cheese.

866
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:07,200
- It's on the way.
- Loads of Rambos today. Incredible.

867
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,400
- Lasse, lay off the cheese!
- Just checking it's fresh.

868
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,200
- Göran, dough!
- More dough!

869
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,100
- ...and a Scarface.
- This American Psycho...?

870
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,000
- Does anyone ever order it?
- Hardly ever.

871
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,300
- Is it the name or is it...?
- Hi...

872
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,700
Hi.

873
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,000
- What are you doing here?
- I was just passing by.

874
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,500
I work for the health authorities now
and I'm here to close this pizzeria.

875
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,400
- Tragic!
- Very...

876
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,900
- I'm kidding.
- Oh...

877
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,200
- You want a pizza?
- I don't dare.

878
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:59,500
I know exactly which one you want.
I'll give you a Jacob Special.

879
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,100
Okay...

880
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,700
- With extra cheese.
- Okay, I'll give it a try.

881
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Bye.

882
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,700
Benny, wake up damnit!

883
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
