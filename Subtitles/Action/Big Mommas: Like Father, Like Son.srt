00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,587
I'm going to hide you.

351
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,880
Hide?

352
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,510
I mean, come on. How you gonna
hide a swag as big as this?

353
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,097
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

354
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,816
I'm gonna need a shrink after this, you realize that?

355
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,776
You didn't seem to mind when you was little and

356
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,111
I caught you trying on your mother's...

357
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,237
Shh!

358
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,865
You promised never to bring that
up. I was putting on a play.

359
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,199
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) Lord, Lord!

360
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,202
You a difficult child, Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

361
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,037
Who are you talking about?

362
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,164
(IN NORMAL VOICE) My great-niece.

363
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,540
And you better start sounding like her

364
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,624
before you scare someone.

365
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,168
Oh, right. (CHUCKLES)

366
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,669
In that case, how's this?

367
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,838
(SINGING IN LOW VOICE) Swing low, sweet...

368
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,464
(SQUEALING)

369
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,800
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Holy mother of...

370
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,846
Yeah. Yeah, right there. Now remember that feeling.

371
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,601
Fine! If I gotta be a chick, can I at least be a cute one?

372
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,437
Next time I'll buy my own damn clothes!

373
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,398
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) And pull down that skirt!

374
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,442
I can see straight to the Promised Land.

375
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,444
It's pulled down!

376
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,782
After a while, you realize it's just not worth the fight.

377
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,327
I wasn't even talking to you.

378
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,787
Nosy and all in my business!

379
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,581
Wait up!

380
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,213
(WOMAN SINGING) You think you might
have a chance I don't think so

381
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,591
You telling me to be nice I don't think so

382
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,761
You wanna get in my pants I don't think so

383
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,471
(TRENT GRUNTING)

384
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,312
I don't think so

385
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,563
I don't understand

386
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,316
how we're gonna find a 4-inch
flash drive in 3-inch heels.

387
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,151
Canetti had a buddy who works here.

388
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,821
We start by finding out who that
is, and what they know.

389
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,823
Canetti.

390
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,742
Canetti, yeah.

391
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,203
Canetti said something to me right before he died.

392
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,538
He looked at me and he said...

393
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
What'd he say?

394
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,834
"It's in the music."

395
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,671
Yeah. You know, something like that.

396
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,340
And I thought he recognized my talent,
knew who the Prodi-G was.

397
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,841
"It's in the music"? Yeah.

398
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,969
Doesn't make sense,

399
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,513
just like everything else that comes out of your mouth.

400
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,307
What? I'm gonna tell you what don't make sense.

401
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,270
How they gonna let two fat ladies
go poking around this joint.

402
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,064
They have an opening for a house mother.

403
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,941
(IN GIRLISH VOICE) Say what?

404
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,444
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) Park your tush.

405
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,072
Tuck it! Right over there.

406
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,283
Hi, girl. Hi. Hi.

407
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,868
Hi.

408
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,627
She's expecting me. I's running a little late.

409
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,379
GAIL: Come in!

410
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,633
May I help you?

411
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,261
Honey, it's me who's gonna help you,

412
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,264
and those poor, house motherless girls you got

413
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,266
just waiting for a positive role model.

414
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,603
Hattie Mae Pierce at your service,
but you can call me Big Momma.

415
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,442
Oh, yes. You e-mailed your résumé
for the house mother position.

416
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,444
Very qualified, but I think...

417
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,487
Well, thank you!

418
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,407
I will watch over those girls like they were my own.

419
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,242
But, Miss...

420
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,829
Big Momma, we haven't scheduled
any interviews, let alone...

421
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,831
(WHIMPERING)

422
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,751
Look at what those children did to me!

423
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,754
Performance art, my ass!

424
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,630
Beverly, what on earth?

425
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,801
Double-ply? A public school can afford double-ply

426
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,595
and I got to bring in my own Sweet'N Low?

427
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,848
Child, nobody deserves to be treated like that.

428
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,850
That's not the half!

429
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
Damn!

430
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,316
Child, you should quit while you
can still do a comb over.

431
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,070
No, Beverly, you promised us two weeks' notice.

432
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,407
You know, every day you don't demand
respect, you die just a little.

433
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,118
You die a little.

434
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,373
You know, she's right. Nothing's worth
living with those demon spawn!

435
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,541
"No child left behind."

436
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,336
Well, you watch me. I quit!

437
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,803
Can you start today?

438
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,139
Me? Oh, thank you! Sure!

439
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,599
Now, we don't pay very much.

440
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,393
Oh, don't worry about that.

441
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,228
Shoot, I grew up so poor,

442
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,146
we used to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken

443
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,731
and lick other people's fingers.

444
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,650
Because we couldn't afford the chicken.

445
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,820
And you know, all the grease from
the chicken, we were like...

446
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,865
You know, there is one tiny little issue.

447
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,867
What's that?

448
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,246
Hey. What up?

449
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,043
Miss Gail, this is my great-niece,

450
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,170
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

451
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,672
Hello. Hey.

452
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,092
So many girls! I feel like I'm at a Baskin-Robbins.

453
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,052
A festival of flavors!

454
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,182
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean, um, it's so diverse here.

455
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,978
Ah, yes. Well, we do pride ourselves on diversity.

456
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,983
So tell me, Charmaine, do you think
that you're a good fit for GGSA?

457
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,695
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm. I like to read.

458
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,157
And, uh, I like to, uh,

459
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,658
play music.

460
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,494
And I like salad.

461
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,582
Sweet, delicious, fresh fruit salad.

462
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,919
She's had a stressful few days.

463
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,131
She's only with me because of some family problems.

464
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,717
Mmm-hmm. My parents don't support my art.

465
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,135
They think it's a waste of time.

466
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,097
Oh, dear, that is awful. Well, you
have come to the right place.

467
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,308
And my stepfather's always working.

468
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,268
He has an important job in the government.

469
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,145
Which he uses to spy on me.

470
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,939
Ever told the truth, wouldn't have to.

471
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,029
Charmaine, you can audit classes
until your transcripts get here,

472
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,822
but I'm afraid, since it's the end of the year,

473
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,407
we don't have a roommate for you.

474
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,284
Oh, any ol' girl will do.

475
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,244
Oh, no. We don't want to put you out.

476
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,747
Charmaine'll just stay with her Big Momma.

477
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,667
But my shrink in juvie said I'd do better
with a role model my own age.

478
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,503
You'll be on the same floor as your peers.

479
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,837
Before you know it, you'll be bosom buddies.

480
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,590
(GASPS) Charmaine likes the sound of that!

481
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,433
GAIL: Welcome to your new home.

482
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,644
I'll just show you to your room.

483
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,354
Some of the girls have gone to dinner,

484
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,980
so you'll just see them there.

485
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,023
Okay.

486
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,483
Oh, there's Mia! Mia.

487
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,152
(GASPS) Damn!

488
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,115
Mia, this is your new house mother, Big Momma,

489
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,701
and this is her niece, Charmaine, your new classmate.

490
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,786
Hi.

491
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,121
Mia is a very promising young actress.

492
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,459
Oh, I'm okay. I mean, I can do light
comedy, like Sandra Bullock.

493
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,670
Well, you know, before the Oscar.

494
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,713
But I really need to work on expanding my range,

495
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,340
in the way that Kate Winslet does.

496
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,051
And Mrs. Orth from Movement says that
I need to listen to my inner voice,

497
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,553
but there's just so many of them,

498
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,390
and the loudest one's always screaming,
"Delanté's pulling away!"

499
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,891
My God! Delanté's pulling away.

500
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,353
I think I should go now.

501
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,938
Girl, you need a hug!

502
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,484
She gets a little emotional. Who the hell is Delanté?

503
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,820
Delanté is the boyfriend.

504
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,196
Oh.

505
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,659
Gail, maybe we should freshen up before dinner.

506
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,580
All this transition is a bit much for Charmaine.

507
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,748
She should probably rest her eyes

508
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,585
or become unconscious for a moment or two.

509
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,838
I totally understand. Your room
is at the end of the hall.

510
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,634
Well, look at the wallpaper! It's so nice!

511
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,681
Look. There's a ballerina on the bed.

512
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,766
I'm Jasmine.

513
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,895
And here's the 411 you probably
didn't get on your tour.

514
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,814
I call the shots around here.

515
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,940
So, if you two stay out of the way,

516
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,567
we shouldn't have any problems.

517
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,818
Okay?

518
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,656
Now you listen to me, Tinker Bell.

519
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,743
Big Momma don't take orders from nobody.

520
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,494
Nobody.

521
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,332
We'll see about that.

522
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,379

Calm down. Tell Big Momma what happened.

1109
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,861
We bought hair dye at Walgreens

1110
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,030
and the directions were in Spanish.

1111
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,531

He has got to love you for all the
stuff you can't buy in no store.

And if he don't,

1120
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,135
then don't change yourself, change your man.

01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,554
So, you got, like, a boyfriend or anything?

1233
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,097
No way.

1234
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:58,268
I'm beginning to think the guy I'm
looking for doesn't really exist.

1235
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,602
How about you?

1236
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,146
Oh, no, girl.

1237
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,773
The guy for me definitely does not exist.

1238
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,278
You know what? I think I got somebody
I could hook you up with, girl.

1239
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,738
Really? Yep.

1240
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,364
Who? He's my cousin.

1241
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,951
His name is Trent. Hottie. Buff. Right?

1242
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,455
He's our age. Plus, he's like a hip-hop lyrical miracle.

1243
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,248
You've probably seen him perform at the Promenade.

1244
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,458
He goes by the name of...

1245
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,251
The Prodi-G? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, yeah!

1246
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,544
(GIRLISHLY) Yeah, yeah!

1247
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:26,212
Thinks he's all that and then some?

1248
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,839
Talks about himself in the third person

1249
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:31,217
and thinks that every girl on the planet is after him?

1250
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,303
No offense, Charmaine,

1251
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,930
but your cousin is the last kind
of guy I'd ever hook up with.

1252
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,766
(GIGGLES)

1253
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,933
(GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY)

1254
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,019
Ew, the Prodi-G.

1255
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,025
So, uh,

1256
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,195
what is your type?

1257
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,322
He's artistic.

1258
01:05:52,656 --> 01:05:56,117
Sensitive. Interested in people besides himself.

1259
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,996
And he likes long,

1260
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,041
sweet, slow, lingering kisses.

1261
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,252
Damn.

1262
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,171
Damn!

1263
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,590
What? Are you making fun of me?

1264
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:14,260
Oh, no, girl. No, I'm saying that's exactly Trent.

1265
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,305
Sure, he can be all puffed up on the outside,

1266
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,473
but once you get to know him,

1267
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,891
I'm saying, he's a real sweetheart.

1268
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,436
I mean, you guys should, like, be a couple!

1269
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,397
He was thinking about going
to the Showcase tomorrow.

1270
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,774
Maybe you guys can hook up,
you know, after the dance.

1271
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,442
Tomorrow night.

1272
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,111
I don't know. Can I meet him before?

1273
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,905
(CHUCKLING) No! It's tomorrow night.

1274
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,075
Well, how about tonight, then?

1275
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,620
Oh, he'll be there.

1276
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,414
Good.

1277
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,920
MALCOLM: Just Kurtis Kool.

1278
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,797
(SIGHS) Let me see.

1279
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,757
What is wrong with you? Your life's in danger

1280
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,426
and what did you do? You go shopping.

1281
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:57,011
Look, shopping is a very big deal for girls.

1282
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,098
It's like their sports. If they ain't
doing it, they're talking about it.

1283
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,517
Comparing stats, tracking sales.

1284
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,810
It's like a fantasy league, you know?

1285
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,688
So help me, Trent, if you're
falling for that Haley girl...

1286
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,315
(STAMMERING) I'm not going for Haley. I mean... No.

1287
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,608
She's not my type.

1288
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,776
Good.

1289
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,491
Okay, so, why don't we just go
down there and intercept it?

1290
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,202
MALCOLM: Not yet. Surveillance is a waiting game.

1291
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,371
We can't do anything that could blow our cover.

1292
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,540
Besides, if Mia is spinning us,

1293
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,834
let's just hope that if it is the music box,

1294
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,919
that the flash drive's still inside it.

1295
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,629
Oh, okay.

1296
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,967
(SIGHS) So we just wait here.

1297
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,636
(HUMMING)

1298
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,018
Wait a minute. Is that the Tempts?

1299
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,562
Not too old school for you?

1300
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,148
No, actually, I was thinking about
sampling it for my mix tape.

1301
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,941
Can you sing it?

1302
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,068
I'd rather hum.

1303
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,156
I mean, but if you sing it, I can catch a
vibe and I can have a dope mix tape

1304
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,409
with some old-school jams on
there. Then we can like...

1305
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,994
All right.

1306
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,164

1307
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,709

1309
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:14,589
And I'm so fly But I get it from my fam

1310
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,591
And we in the place and we on a case

1311
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,010
Vibin' out to an old-school jam

1312
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,429
(LAUGHS) I like that.

1313
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,224
I like how you put the little new
school with the old school.

1314
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,017
I could feel that.

1315
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:29,604
I could jam to that. I could, you
know, do this little thing I do.

1316
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,189
Now, what's that?

1317
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,358
A little something I used to do back in the day

1318
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,442
called the Cleveland Shuffle.

1319
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,277
Oh, no, I need that. Come on.

1320
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,487
Well, it's two to the right.

1321
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,613
Okay.

1322
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,241
Two to the left. Now freak with it.

1323
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,702
Freak with it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1324
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,039
Kick. Now you get your spin on. Right?

1325
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,958
Right? Bring it back.

1326
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,085
(EXCLAIMS) Then you freak with it.

1327
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,045
Freak with it. That's right.

1328
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:56,798
And your arms got to be in a little T. rex position.

1329
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,633
Okay. So a little something...

1330
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,801
Now freak with it.

1331
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,302
So it's like the Soulja Boy, right?

1332
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:04,681
No, Soulja Boy, that's a little hop thing.

1333
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,683
I know what you're talking about,
but that's a little hop thing.

1334
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,434
This is... This is more like this?

1335
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,687
This is Tempts. When them boys was...

1336
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,480
I like that. You know, "Oooh!"

1337
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,065
You know, that kind of thing.

1338
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,484
That's why I like doing this move.

1339
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,903
'Cause it's not that complicated.

01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,535
Wait, what's up?

1342
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,288
There are the girls. All right.

1343
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,040
Chirkoff must have gotten to Kurtis Kool

1344
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,251
and Kurtis Kool got the girls to steal the music box.

1345
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,627
I can't believe that.

1346
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,672
Look, Trent. Get back in that dress, all right?

1347
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,840
I'm gonna check it out.

1348
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:39,966
Okay.

1351
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,367
Come on You're outta sight

1352
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,164
You got to give me just what I need

1353
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,627
And a sweet little something that
brings a man to his knees

1354

I like it easy I like it nice and slow

1355

Boo. Oh!

1357
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,054
Wow, a security guard with stalkers.

1358
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,473
I'm a curious woman.

1359
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
Why don't you come and throw
back some juice with me?

1360
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,811
Let me satisfy that curiosity.

1361
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,026
Well, all right. A little juice.

1362
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,278
This way? Mmm-hmm.

1363
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,334
(MAN SINGING) I know, lately

1364

Oh, okay. Thank you.

Trent?

1368
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,688
What's up? How you doing?

1369
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:23,236
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. These poetry
readings always run long.

1370
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,739
You do spoken word?

1371
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,074
Yeah.

1372
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,954
And I like slow, lingering kisses.

1373
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,124
You know, it's weird that you would say that.

1374
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,918
Yeah, 'cause you feel the same way, too, right?

1375
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,838
No, it's just weird that you would say that.

1376
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:50,138
Right, right. Because rap don't allow
me to get my sensitivities out.

1377
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,391
And I got a lot of sensitivities

1378
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,644
I like to get out. As a man, it's like...

1379
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,355
They're deep. It's like an ocean inside me.

01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,316
At the poetry jam, uh,

1381
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,485
we get all our sensitivities out,
you know what I'm saying?

1382
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,320
And we be snapping...

1383
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,613
(SIGHING) Okay.

1384
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,408
And it's like... It's, uh...

1385
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,161
You know, I'm really sorry all Charmaine's
coaching had to go to waste,

1386

but I think that I'm just going to go.

No, no, no, wait, just stay. Stay.

1388

(STAMMERS) Look.

01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:22,170
Charmaine told me you were a beautiful, great girl.

1390
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,840

This isn't who I am. This is...

1394
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,980
Okay, then, who are you?

1395
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,194
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

1396
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,654
I'm still trying to figure that out.

01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:54,452

Yes. Yes, we can.

01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,093
Now don't go putting me on no pedestal.
You know it might break.

1404
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,722
What you talking about, girl?
I like a woman with a little

1405
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,641
funk in her trunk!

1406
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:21,145
And some shrimp in the backyard. That's a woman!

1407
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,023
(LAUGHS) Well, you know I like me
a man with a dangerous side.

1408
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,902
Something tells me that Kurtis Kool is not just a man

1409
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,612
with keys and a Taser, huh?

1410
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:30,738
(LAUGHING)

1411
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,657
And you're ticklish!

1412
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:39,163
Well, I'm into some illegalities at the moment.

1413
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,915
Oh? Well, what kind?

1414
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,001
Well, just typical BS, you know.

1415
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,754
Middleman stuff.

1416
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,799
Holding something hot.

1417
01:13:51,134 --> 01:13:52,635
(WHISPERING) That's "stolen."

1418
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,596
Who you holding it for?

1419
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,140
What are you, the FBI?

1420
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,185
No! Ain't no FBI!

1421
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,104
You wearing a wire?

1422
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,438
What? No!

1423
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,690
I'm going to find the wire!

1424
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,775
Can you hear this? No...

1425
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,071
Now that's funny, 'cause I know I ain't no FBI.

1426
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,614
This I know.

1427
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,533
(CHUCKLING)

1428
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,869
(SIGHING) Oh.

1429
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,872
You're so beautiful.

1430
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,583
So much I like you.

1431
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,251
You know,

1432
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,755
you're my high priestess of delight.

1433
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,258
No, no... Kurtis Kool!

1434
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:34,218
I just want to bite you! Kurtis!

1435
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
You got

1436
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,683
Motownopoly. Let's play.

1437
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,727
Yeah.

1438
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,812
I got a better game than that.

1439
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,318
(HALEY LAUGHING)

1440
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,448
TRENT: So, look, I should get back.

1441
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,117
Really? Why?

1442
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,412
I guess I got a little time.

1443
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,623
Damn! Damn!

1444
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,876
Yo! It's Trent!

1445
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,420
Yo, you got the producer guy's number?

1446
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:11,339
Yo, call him and tell him we found our boy.

1447
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:12,882
What's he doing?

1448
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,137
Yeah. Yeah, we found our boy!

1449
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,805
(ENGINE STARTING)

1450
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,607
Trent! Yo!

1451
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,278
Whoa! Rembrandt. Wow.

1452
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,031
Yeah. This is my crew.

1453
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,532
This is Rembrandt and Scratch.

1454
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,659
Hey.

1455
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,160
How you doing? How you doing?

1456
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:43,287
Yo, you got your step-pop to sign the contract yet?

1457
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,872
Yeah, man, I'm on it.

1458
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,290
Come on, I want to take you somewhere.

1459
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,042
Okay.

1460
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,086
See you guys later. See you guys.

1461
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,170
All right.

1462
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,380
Yeah, you do that!

1463
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,298
'Cause we got somebody we want you to meet.

1464
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,133
Yeah, I'll holler. Okay.

1465
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,718
Yeah, yeah! Tomorrow, Trent!

1466
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,555
Scratch and Rembrandt, they're like,
I don't know, one's tall, one's short.

1467
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,516
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I noticed that.

1468
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:06,519
We found him.

1469
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,981
CHIRKOFF: Just stay with him. See
if he leads you to the father.

1470
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,232
Okay.

1471
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,490
Let the games begin.

1472
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,995
You know, these girls of mine are driving me up a wall.

1473
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,580
You know Jasmine Lee and Isabelle Parada?

1474
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,000
No, refresh my memory.

1475
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,835
Left foot, red.

1476
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,966
They gave you a bag about an hour ago.

1477
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,302
Right foot, yellow.

1478
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:47,101
Oh! That Jasmine and Isabelle.

1479
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,979
(GRUNTS) Sorry, Big Momma.

1480
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,316
You know, those girls could be in a
lot of trouble. And so could you.

1481
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,902
So who you holding that bag for?

1482
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,113
Someone outside the school?

1483
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,365
You really want to see that bag?

1484
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:03,743
Damn!

1485
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,121
Right hand, blue.

1486
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,081
Are you...

1487
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,292
Is it blue?

1488
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,419
Mmm-hmm. Right hand, blue.

1489
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,135
Come to papa.

1490
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,070
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1491
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,072
KURTIS: Left hand, green!

1492
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,699
Oh, well...

1493
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,827
Looks like we're all out of green. Game over.

1494
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,039
No, no, no. I got your green.

1495
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,709
(GRUNTS)

1496
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,670
Okay. Go ahead. Reach for the stars, baby.

1497
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,130
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, hell, no!

1498
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,466
What's wrong with your voice?

1499
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,260
You heard me. Get your ass up.

1500
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,598
Sister, you a brother?

1501
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,811
Not again.

1502
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,814
You touch me again, I'll knock you into next Sunday.

1503
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,025
Hand over the bag. Hand over the bag, now!

1504
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,531
Every time I try to meet somebody,
it's ding-a-ling-a-ling!

1505
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,116
Be quiet! All right?

1506
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,702
I'm undercover. FBI. Now give me the damn bag.

1507
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,830
Wow. (EXCLAIMS IMPATIENTLY)

1508
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,673
What the hell?

1509
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,309
What the hell is a grown man
doing with a damn rooster?

1510
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:55,146
(SIGHS) The girls stole it from St. Ignatius.

1511
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,731
The boys' school? They're the Gamecocks.

1512
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,151
They were gonna give it back after the Showcase.

1513
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,237
(CLUCKING)

1514
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,448
You want to finish the game?

1515
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,744
Come on.

1516
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,996
Where are we going?

1517
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,664
You'll see. Okay.

1518
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,216
Wow.

1519
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,760
It's my home away from home.

1520
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,470
This is nice.

1521
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,597
Tomorrow night's the Showcase

1522
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,183
and it's my best shot at getting
a scholarship for composition.

1523
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,685
Without a scholarship, I'm out.

1524
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,563
Everyone is gonna be there, you know?

1525
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,024
Juilliard, Berklee, Peabody and Oberlin.

1526
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:43,235
All right, look. Okay. So, I see
a beautiful woman right now.

1527
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,112
I see a dope piano.

1528
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,615
And nobody's playing it.

1529
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,201
You want me to play?

1530
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,369
Yeah.

1531
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,454
Right now.

1532
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,539
All right, I guess I gotta play it.

1533
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,875
No, no, don't touch my piano.

1534
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,086
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1535

See? It's not totally there yet.

1540
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,735
I don't know, something's missing.

1541
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,112
No, it's not missing nothing. It's tight.

1542
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,573
You just got to feel it, you know what I mean?

1543
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,451
You got to, like, speed it up a little bit.

1544
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:33,994
Speed it up? Yeah.

1545

on the first date, but...

You're gonna go up a little higher.

01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:18,774
Haley, it's gonna be okay.

1930
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,984
Shut your mouth!

1931
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,070
You just gonna hurt these innocent children?

1932
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,447
Give me the flash drive.

1933
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:25,781
What if I say no?

1934
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,575
I'm pretty good with this gun.

1935
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:29,660
My late husband Othar taught me how to use it

1936
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,038
in case of a home invasion.

1937
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:39,712
Give him the gun, or I shoot the kids.

1938
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,388
Now,

1939
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:52,016
the flash drive.

1940
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,733
Very good, Agent Turner.

1941
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:04,070
It took me a while to figure out. Then I remember.

1942
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,156
You're the master of disguise.

1943
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:16,582
Take off the fat suit. I want to check you for weapons.

1944
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:25,508
Look, don't shoot the kids, all right?

1945
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,385
He don't remember what he saw.

1946
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,304
Kill them.

1947
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,099
And this time, no witnesses.

1948
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,309
My pleasure. Hey, Trent.

1949
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,852
CHIRKOFF: I'm checking the flash drive.

1950
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:40,356
I'm sorry. I was wrong to think we could pull this off.

1951
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,816
This is my fault.

1952
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,026
No. You was just trying to protect me.

1953
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,446
I lied to you and everything. I'm sorry, Dad.

1954
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:52,118
All right, this family hour has to
end. I'm going to throw up.

1955
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:54,829
Hey, whoa. Just let me say one last thing to my boy.

1956
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,709
You know, I'll go to my grave
wishing we could have done

1957
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,211
that Cleveland Shuffle together.

1958
01:45:02,295 --> 01:45:04,046
Remember? Mmm.

1959
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,756
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

1960
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,551
Killer step. If I just had one more chance.

1961
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,261
Remember, it'd be two to the right,

1962
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:11,679
(GRUNTING IN RHYTHM)

1963
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,722
two to the left.

1964
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,767
BOTH: Now freak with it, freak with
it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1965
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:24,692
Enough! No more mistakes.

1966
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,653
I never leave a witness.

1967
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:30,656
Wait.

1968
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,951
(GROANING)

1969
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,998

1971
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:42,960
AGENT: FBI!

1973
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,383
You saved my boy. Thank you, man.

1974
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,261
Just protecting the next generation of hip-hop.

1975
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,268
Haley, hi.

1976
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:01,020
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1977
01:46:01,354 --> 01:46:02,396
I knew she was a narc.

1978
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,190
Hey, he's not a narc, he's a fed.

1979
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:05,691
Same thing. You're a boy.

Really? Yeah.

1995
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:13,008
You know, I realize there's no rush to greatness.

1996
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,594
I mean, you only get one chance to be the new guy.

1997
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:18,931
Spoken like a real man.

1998

2016
01:48:00,765 --> 01:48:03,225
Okay. You don't want her busting
