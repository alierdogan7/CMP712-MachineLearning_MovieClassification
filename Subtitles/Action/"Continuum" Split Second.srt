00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:02,805
<i>Previously on Continuum...</i>

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:04,774
I'm not sure that you've got
what it takes.

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:06,743
I'm a really hard worker
with some fresh ideas,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,877
I won't let you down.

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,746
Why all of this?

6
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,682
Leaving home so suddenly,
giving up your work?

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,916
I have to make my own way
for myself.

8
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:16,452
It's not for you, or Roland
or anyone.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,154
I wanna protect my future.

10
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,089
Here are the new companies
I want you to invest in.

11
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,892
I'm looking for situations
that are win-win.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,593
What can I do for you
agent Gardiner?

13
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:28,164
- Kiera Cameron.
- Agent Cameron is with Section 6.

14
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,765
I saw you...

15
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:32,267
I saw you survive
the explosion and fireball

16
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,535
and then vanish.

17
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,137
You can't do this,
not to me!

18
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:36,471
If you can't be with
the person you chose to...

19
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,074
[Grunting]

20
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,810
I spent the last couple of weeks
in a prison hospital recovering.

21
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,945
- Recovering from what?
- Sonya.

22
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:10,246
I think the term
"fighting machine"

23
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,081
has become something
of a cliché

24
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,949
in the development of
the enhanced soldier,

25
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:15,384
but what we've
accomplished here

26
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,018
is nothing short
of extraordinary.

27
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,987
Very impressive.

28
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,457
I speak for the entire corporation,
job well done.

29
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,726
However we've had to make
our funding decision

30
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,430
based on factors beyond
performance metrics.

31
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,565
It's too damn expensive.

32
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,186
We're cutting our losses,

33
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,628
the program's being terminated
effective immediately.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,904
What does that mean?

35
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,839
What happens to these
soldiers?

36
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,340
Well we can't leave
anything operational

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,878
once we've shut down,
way too risky.

38
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,548
Terminate means terminate.

39
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,015
I've got two CPS officers
in the lobby

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,718
I just need to call them.

41
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:55,288
That won't be necessary.

42
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:59,125
I can take care of it.

43
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:01,394
Very good.

44
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:09,100
Everything okay, doc?

45
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,537
How's the CMR adjustment?

46
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:13,505
Quite the upgrade.

47
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:17,810
Civilian version is already
in the works.

48
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:21,011
I don't need any tech to tell me
you're upset about something.

49
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,379
You would be right.

50
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:26,050
Well maybe I can ease
your mind over dinner later?

51
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,553
It's gonna be difficult
for me.

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,755
I understand.

53
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:35,092
Well, maybe when
the project's finished...

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,093
What I mean is I hope when...

55
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,495
I hope when the program
is over,

56
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:41,030
that we're not also.

57
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,936
What's that?

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,131
You okay?

59
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:23,037
<i>2077, my time, my city,</i>

Sync and corrected by dr. jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

71
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,756
You shot him...
didn't you?

72
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,025
You shot Travis.

73
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,730
What if Garza sees this?

74
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:30,166
I would certainly appreciate
your discretion.

75
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,235
You have it...
but now what?

76
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:34,737
She wants to bust
Travis out.

77
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:37,139
Let me worry about that.

78
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,415
- Alec...
- What?

79
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,984
Now's not the time okay,
I'm gonna be late.

80
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,418
What are you doing here
anyways?

81
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:52,187
I just wanted to see
where you work,

82
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:55,791
- I was in the neighbourhood...
- You're checking up on me.

83
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,659
Look, you don't have to
worry about me, okay?

84
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm fine.

85
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:00,361
All right.

86
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,029
You don't have to do this.

87
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,699
What, the job? Actually I do.

88
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,834
I mean, I'm broke and frankly I
need to look at all my options.

89
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,703
Well good, that...
that's why I'm here,

90
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,772
to talk about your options.

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,307
Go on.

92
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:14,842
I know you don't have
all the answers

93
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,844
you're looking for right now.

94
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,213
But if you don't follow
the path of destiny

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,416
that shapes the future
as I know it,

96
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,784
the world won't end up
as it did in my time.

97
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,754
Is that necessarily
a bad thing?

98
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,556
I wanna go home.

99
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,426
I wanna get back to my family

100
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:34,878
and the only way I'm
gonna be able to do that

101
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,354
is if things stay on track.

102
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:38,231
Kiera... when you tried
to stop that bombing,

103
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,865
did you know that you were
possibly throwing away a chance

104
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,134
of getting home?

105
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:44,337
- I didn't have a choice!
- Yes, you did.

106
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,905
Choose to let hundreds of
innocent people die?

107
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,174
Don't be so naïve!

108
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,942
These decisions are going to
keep coming up.

109
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,344
At a certain point you're
gonna have to choose

110
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:53,911
between protecting the future
for your unborn family

111
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,413
or protecting the future for
yourself and those of us

112
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,984
who are alive now.

113
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:01,286
I gotta go okay,
I'm gonna be late.

114
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,155
I'll call you later.

115
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,625
Sorry.

116
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,933
Lois, you wanted to see me?

117
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,169
Operations tells me

118
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,770
you're still working the
mayor's assassination,

119
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,237
I thought we were
done with that.

120
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,672
Yeah, the police got
their guy.

121
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,240
So what's left to talk about?

122
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,841
Kiera Cameron.

123
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,470
I know that you asked
me to stay away...

124
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,944
She's vouched for.

125
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,079
Escher, remember?

126
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,681
The CEO of a corporation
giving orders

127
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,383
to our intelligence services?

128
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,817
That just doesn't add up.

129
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,386
My superior vouches for him,

130
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:39,021
for all we know
Pyron is Section 6.

131
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,289
Cameron is a cipher.

132
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,357
This Section 6,
a federal security branch,

133
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:45,227
doesn't really seem to exist.

134
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:50,398
Yeah, it is a puzzle
by any measure.

135
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,000
What's your gut telling you?

136
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,903
Cameron is connected to the
Liber8 organization somehow,

137
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,405
I'm sure of it.

138
00:06:57,472 --> 00:07:00,875
She may be the key to stopping
them before the next attack.

139
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:03,177
You're not gonna let
this go, are you?

140
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,212
No.

141
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,549
Okay, I'll make
some arrangements,

142
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,185
put you in the crosshairs.

143
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:15,089
Liber8, Section 6, the bombing,
assassination...

144
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,424
Kiera Cameron.

145
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:19,726
You keep it under wraps
for now, no paper trail.

146
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:22,128
Of course.
Thank you.

147
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:25,031
And Gardiner...

148
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,667
don't embarrass me
or this office.

149
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,508
Sonya seems to be taking
her sweet time.

150
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:39,711
With what?

151
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,314
Busting Travis out.

152
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:44,883
I'm with you.

153
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,018
I just don't think
she's telling us everything.

154
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:50,955
Look, we both know that Sonya
would never let anything

155
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,256
happen to Travis.

156
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:55,425
She's just... following
Kagame's orders.

157
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,795
You know what?
Kagame's dead!

158
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:02,332
Yes... Kagame is dead
but he lives on in us.

159
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,768
And if he were here,

160
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,769
he's say leave no
comrade behind.

161
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:09,072
He would, but he'd also say
think before you act.

162
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,975
So when do we stop thinking
and start acting?

163
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,343
I've already initiated
a plan.

164
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,712
You won't need to lift
a finger.

165
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,691
Look, I know who you are,
I'm not interested, okay.

166
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,393
You know who I am?

167
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,428
The whole world knows
who you are.

168
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,063
A terrorist?

169
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,132
That's gonna change.

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,766
The truth about what was
going on in that building

171
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,036
you and Kagame brought down,
it's already filtering out.

172
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,104
The truth?

173
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:46,674
Some are calling you a hero
for killing those bastards.

174
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,110
I didn't kill anybody.

175
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,782
The White Guard,
Bulgakov.

176
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,052
Ukrainian nationalists
dying for their beloved Kiev.

177
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,254
- Sound familiar?
- It's just a book.

178
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:03,623
Okay?

179
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,958
We could protect you.

180
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,426
I already have protection.

181
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:09,829
Your movement is growing,

182
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,699
my soldiers there are prepared
to offer guardianship

183
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,201
until the day we can
all leave here together

184
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,536
to face the same enemy.

185
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:19,638
We can mobilize hundreds
more behind you,

186
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,607
it could get pretty messy
in here, Mr. Randol.

187
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,609
I think you're right
about that.

188
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,815
Stay away.

189
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,624
That wasn't necessary.

190
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,292
Just because you got your
own little fan club in here

191
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,161
doesn't mean you're safe.

192
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,863
Stay close to me until
I get us out of here.

193
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,765
- When's that gonna be?
- Soon.

194
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,667
I've already made contact.

195
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,502
Yeah, it better be soon.

196
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,737
I go on trial in a few weeks,

197
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,244
I think we know how
that'll turn out.

198
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:58,207
No, there won't be
any trial.

199
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,042
You have a destiny
to fulfill.

200
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,810
My destiny is dead.

201
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,346
They'll have to find
another way.

202
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:07,083
No, this is how it's supposed
to play out.

203
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,288
Was I not clear?

204
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,489
Time you went to school,
boy.

205
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:25,219
[Fighting noises]

206
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:48,254
[buzzing sounds]

207
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,272
Hey coach, you want
to see us?

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,841
Thanks guys.

209
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:03,313
Our friend Travis Berta
killed 6 members

210
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,581
of the Arian Nation
in prison today.

211
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,916
Worse things could happen.

212
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,118
I don't disagree but
it's still a problem.

213
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,253
Warden wants him transferred
out immediately

214
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,856
before a full-scale
riot erupts.

215
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,859
It's probably a good idea.

216
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:17,584
The further we keep Travis and
Julian Randol from each other, the better.

217
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,229
We still need to take every
precaution during the transfer.

218
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,732
Travis is unpredictable and far
more dangerous than you realize.

219
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,701
Are you offering your
services, agent Cameron?

220
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,634
I am.

221
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:30,604
Well I expected as much.

222
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:32,874
Ah, excellent timing.

223
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,508
Agent Gardiner has
been reassigned

224
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,612
to the Liber8 task-force
as our official liaison.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,742
Regardless of the hiccups
that our joint operations

226
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,474
have experienced as of late,

227
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:46,019
we're ready to provide
any support that we can.

228
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,354
Well, thank you for that.

229
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,356
I'm sure all of us can agree
that we could always use

230
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:52,125
another ally in the war
against terrorism.

231
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:54,627
Now, Travis Berta is
a high value member

232
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,963
so I expect Liber8 to make
a move of some kind.

233
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:59,465
Now with all due respect, I'm
not sure that agent Cameron's

234
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,901
considered all the
variables in this case.

235
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:04,169
I don't know, maybe
she has and she's uh...

236
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,671
counting on them.

237
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,440
I'd be surprised if you could
find someone who understands

238
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,809
them better, agent Gardiner...

239
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,744
and I have a plan that will
keep any of your concerns

240
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,212
at a minimum.

241
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,382
You stay out of my way and
we all get what we want.

242
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,750
I look forward to that.

243
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,852
Excuse me...

244
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,255
No love lost, huh?

245
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,525
That guy needs a serious
attitude adjustment.

246
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:30,161
Easy, that is a shortcut
to an early retirement.

247
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,349
He's gonna be looking for
anything to call you out on.

248
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:33,831
Oh, I'm sure of it.

249
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,300
You're setting yourself up for
trouble if it goes sideways.

250
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,201
I know.

251
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,339
Hey, how about we hear
about this plan?

252
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:45,609
It's uh... it's gonna play out
something like this.

253
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,413
Sadler... do you have any idea

254
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,515
why all of the network
passwords aren't working?

255
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh yeah, sorry... I forgot to
tell you about that.

256
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:56,319
I had to flash the
router with an open WRT

257
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,187
in order to put up
a new firewall.

258
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,922
Why did you do that?

259
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,924
Well, um... actually
you'll be happy to know

260
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:02,992
that I recalibrated the network

261
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,193
so that 46 percent
of the customers

262
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,595
can now use the automated
checkout system.

263
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:08,030
That'll save on labour
costs by 15 percent

264
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,531
and decrease
customer wait times

265
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,899
by a minute and 30
seconds on average.

266
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,234
Is that right?

267
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,469
Yeah, and you don't have
to do sales reports anymore,

268
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,137
it's all automated now.

269
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,373
- No sales reports?
- Nope, poof, gone!

270
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,740
Straight to head office.

271
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:21,509
In fact, the efficiency
of the system as a whole

272
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:25,546
has nearly tripled, it's
256 percent to be exact.

273
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:29,183
Okay... Sadler, here's what's
gonna happen.

274
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,551
First, you're gonna get me
a coffee.

275
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:33,387
Then you're gonna undo
all this mumbo jumbo,

276
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,389
none of this was even approved
by head office.

277
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,823
This'll save the
company money...

278
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,593
Look, I know what it's like
to be young and ambitious

279
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,628
and think you have the
answers to everything,

280
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,662
but you can't go messing with
the system just because

281
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,098
you think you have a better
way of doing things.

282
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:46,031
But I'm telling you...

283
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:47,825
No look, I'm telling
you to reset the network

284
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,603
to the way that it was and do
the job that I hired you to do.

285
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,671
I can un-hire you just
as easily.

286
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,075
Oh, and that coffee?
Make it black.

287
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:06,385
[Sighs]
Incredible.

288
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,020
What do you want?

289
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,222
You know who I am?

290
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,357
Right... well believe it
or not I know a little bit

291
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,326
about who you are as well.

292
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:17,629
Maybe even more than
you know about yourself.

293
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,532
Look, if Kiera sent you here
to talk me into whatever...

294
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:24,335
Kiera didn't send me.

295
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:27,939
You know I had a job like
this once, way back...

296
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,674
or is that way forward?

297
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:32,576
Mopping floors
and cleaning toilets.

298
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:36,079
Good, honest work my
father called it.

299
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:39,516
I hated that job but I guess
it did teach me something.

300
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,518
And what's that?

301
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,720
Well first off, money
and power doesn't mean

302
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:45,956
your shit doesn't stink.

303
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,489
More importantly,

304
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:52,595
the only thing separating me and
the future I wanted was will.

305
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:55,798
I had the talent
and the ambition,

306
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:58,367
all I needed was a chance.

307
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,603
The problem is, of course,
you're rarely given that chance,

308
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:03,137
more often than not
you've gotta take it.

309
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,575
So one day, on my
knees cleaning up

310
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:11,345
where some idiot had missed
with his piss, I did.

311
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,881
Then what did you do?

312
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,348
I quit.

313
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,385
I scratched and clawed
and willed myself

314
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,987
into my own business.

315
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:27,227
I put all that hard work
into Kellog Incorporated.

316
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,464
And here you are today...
you've come a long way.

317
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,701
That's one way to put it.

318
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,702
Look, what does any of this
have to do with me?

319
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,436
Oh, I don't know...

320
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,238
let's just say that
both of our futures

321
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:44,010
rely on your own will.

322
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,846
All you have to do is
look down and realize

323
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:53,319
that you're on your knees too.

324
00:15:53,386 --> 00:16:01,386
The only difference is
you're a genius.

325
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,430
Anyway... listen, I'm uh...

326
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,232
I'm looking to set up
a new venture,

327
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,599
cutting edge stuff.

328
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,234
Also looking for
talented visionaries

329
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,369
to do visionary work.

330
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,105
You know, mold the future,
all that jazz.

331
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:19,644
Hey, money is no object.

332
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,080
Uh... are you being taken care
of, sir?

333
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,649
Why yes, thank you.

334
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,817
Alec here is taking
very good care of me,

335
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,753
he knows his stuff!

336
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,322
You know something, I'd
be careful if I were you.

337
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,024
'Cause someone might just uh,

338
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:38,162
just come along
and poach him away.

339
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:39,829
Wonderful.

340
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,532
Uh... have a good day, sir.

341
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,233
Alec, when you're done
with this customer

342
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,169
can you drop by my office?

343
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:49,572
My printer's jammed.

344
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,976
Printer jams, how novel.

345
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,211
You know there's no paper
in the future?

346
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,547
Or should I say no future
in paper.

347
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:07,756
Drop by for a chat unless
you've made up your mind.

348
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,592
Incredible.

349
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:24,405
[Clears throat]

350
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:27,374
Um... I just got word
from our prison connection.

351
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,710
They're dead, all of them.

352
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,245
- It's not a problem.
- How can you even say that?

353
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:35,782
- If Garza finds out who's behind this...
- Listen,

354
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,483
Do you honestly think any
of those Neanderthals

355
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,854
ever stood a chance
against Travis?

356
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,255
You planned this?

357
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,424
Killing Travis would
be a nice solution,

358
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,025
but we don't need him dead

359
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,461
so much as we need
him out of the way

360
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,130
and as far away from
Thaseus as possible.

361
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,911
I should've known you were
behind this circus.

362
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,580
I'll take that as a compliment.

363
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,414
You would.

364
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:42,483
Listen Travis.
I'll cut you a deal...

365
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,985
You tell me where I can
find Sonya and the others

366
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,087
and I'll put you out of
your misery quickly,

367
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:50,157
save you the trouble of
the long incarceration.

368
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:54,027
And miss all the fun?

369
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:55,962
It seems like you two
are getting along.

370
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,765
Seeing her makes me homesick.

371
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,067
Your new home's a four by
four cell, Travis.

372
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,335
No fear, this one.

373
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,137
Tell me something
I don't know.

374
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,707
Why don't you take shotgun, I'll
sit back here with Mr. Happy.

375
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:16,755
You look good in orange.

376
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,253
Hey Simon.

377
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,089
Think about behaving yourself

378
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,557
so I don't have to come over
there and keep you in line, huh?

379
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,028
- Please do.
- Oh that can be arranged.

380
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,097
Ready?

381
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,531
Let's get this show
on the road.

382
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,204
Convoy's pulling out.

383
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,973
Nothing like a nice drive
through the countryside.

384
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,942
The day is young.

385
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,878
I guess being a pessimist is part
of your job description, huh?

386
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:52,648
Well, I'm rarely disappointed
so that's a bonus.

387
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,058
It's not too late for you,
protector.

388
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:06,061
Join the fight, make this world
a better place.

389
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,495
What do you think
I'm doing?

390
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:09,731
I think you're fighting
for the wrong side,

391
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,935
you just don't know it yet.

392
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,703
Doesn't it ever bother you?

393
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,172
Oh yeah, it's starting
to bother me now.

394
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,607
I'm talking about the
inequality in the system.

395
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:22,209
Bankers and corporate
CEOs raking in fortunes

396
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:25,246
while the rest of us
fight just to survive

397
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:28,415
and take care of
the ones we love.

398
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,950
I guess I'm just used to it.

399
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,019
That's your problem
right there.

400
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:35,522
You're the reason these thieves
get away with it,

401
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,558
they need your complacency,
your unwillingness to fight,

402
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,861
to challenge the rules,
to tear down walls...

403
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,062
Blow up a building?

404
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,964
If that's what it
takes to prevent us

405
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:49,235
from becoming slaves, yes.

406
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,505
It's like I said,
no strings attached.

407
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,639
You're the brains,
I'm the money.

408
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,341
The lab?

409
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,977
It's yours to run,
hire some help if you like.

410
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,245
I don't need any help.

411
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:01,814
Even better.

412
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,581
Kiera will probably
appreciate the privacy.

413
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:06,185
Look, this has nothing
to do with her.

414
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,220
Okay.
Understood.

415
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:10,754
Look, I've seen what
you can do alone

416
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:13,724
so I really don't think we'll
have much of a problem.

417
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:18,262
Please... can I offer
you a coffee,

418
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,364
tea, soda, beer?

419
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:23,868
Soda please.

420
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,902
You seem pretty sure this
is a sound investment.

421
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,639
Yeah, an investment when you
know the payoff is not a risk,

422
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:30,841
it's a sure thing.

423
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,275
There are no sure things.

424
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,845
Well then I'm happy with
getting as close as I can.

425
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,083
Where are we?

426
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,550
It's all routine.

427
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,688
They'll come for me.

428
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:50,326
You know how all this
plays out, Cameron.

429
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,694
She hasn't told you,
has she?

430
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:53,863
[Laughing]

431
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,865
How does she do it?

432
00:21:55,932 --> 00:22:00,568
It must suck to be you,
always two steps behind her,

433
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:04,239
almost like she can see things
before they happen.

434
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,677
Hey, can I ask you something

435
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,812
that might sound
a little bit weird?

436
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:14,882
I'm a time traveler, kid...
weird is my specialty.

437
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:17,885
What am I like in 2077,
like old me...

438
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:19,019
what's my deal?

439
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,188
Straight to the point,
I like that.

440
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,424
What did Kiera tell you?

441
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,093
Nothing.

442
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,197
Here's the deal, kid.

443
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:36,735
In 2077, you are
in today's terms...

444
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:43,776
Zuckerberg, Jobs, Buffett
and Gates all rolled into one.

445
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:44,877
Rich...

446
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,178
No, no, no... beyond rich,
epic wealth.

447
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,680
No, you don't understand, what am
I like as a person?

448
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,117
Uh... as a person?

449
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,919
Who gives a shit!

450
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:59,057
You're loaded, powerful,
like a... like a king.

451
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:04,094
I just really need to know, am I
a good person or am I a bad person?

452
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:07,798
Well it's not like we hung
out, you know.

453
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:11,001
Okay, I guess it depends
on your point of view.

454
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:15,039
Personally, I admire someone
who could work the system,

455
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:18,608
influence the masses,
execute a vision.

456
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:22,512
It's not for everyone but...

457
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,248
where are you going with this?

458
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,584
What if you're here
for a reason,

459
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:31,020
what if you coming back in time
wasn't an accident?

460
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,089
- You're talking about fate.
- No, I'm talking about design.

461
00:23:34,157 --> 00:23:37,726
I'm talking about me.

462
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:42,397
Yeah, I put some of
the pieces together.

463
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:45,434
That we were sent back
by you.

464
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:48,170
So why did I send you back
here to help me?

465
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:55,610
Well that's obvious, to...
to change the future.

466
00:23:55,678 --> 00:24:01,449
Your destiny is not to become
Santech CEO Alec Sadler,

467
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:06,520
it's bigger.

468
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:10,191
How do I know I can
trust you?

469
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:13,660
Well, I have been accused
of many things...

470
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,029
You know what, I'd better
get back to work.

471
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:18,832
Hey, kid...

472
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,801
Alec...

473
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:30,276
Here's some free advice,
detective...

474
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,446
cash in that shitty pension,
turn in that badge,

475
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,355
buy that motorcycle you've
always dreamed about

476
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:37,250
and a shitload of guns.

477
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:38,683
You're gonna wanna be prepared

478
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,553
for the changes
that are coming.

479
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,156
They really did a number
on you in prison,

480
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:46,158
we should be taking you
to the psych ward!

481
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,627
Yeah, I guess that's
where time travelers

482
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:52,231
would fit in best, huh?

483
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:53,698
Time travelers?

484
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,635
Time travelers,
we're all time travelers.

485
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:00,471
Brother, you have no idea
who the delusional one

486
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,573
in this relationship is.

487
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:06,610
I can tell you it's not me
and it's definitely not her,

488
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:11,181
so you do the math.

489
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,650
I don't know why you
don't just tell him,

490
00:25:13,717 --> 00:25:16,053
we've already changed
the future.

491
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,557
You're never going back to what
you left behind, Cameron.

492
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:24,827
Why don't you just tell him?

493
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:28,230
Or maybe you just don't care
about him enough...

494
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,232
Tell him, Cameron!

495
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,635
Tell him, Cameron!

496
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,371
Come on...

497
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,012
[Laughing]

498
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:48,416
Oh, my God!

499
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Here we go!

500
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:54,889
[gunfire]

501
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:55,690
It's an ambush!

502
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:57,292
<i>We're under attack!</i>

503
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,927
[gunfire]

504
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,062
<i>Move! Move! Move!!</i>

505
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,299
Convoy's been hit,
returning fire.

506
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,967
<i>Two officers down!</i>

507
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:07,767
[gunfire]

508
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:08,702
<i>Move! Move! Move!!</i>

509
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,638
[gunfire]

510
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,410
[gunfire]

511
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:19,445
Move it!

512
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,481
Go! Go!

513
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:22,948
Right side!

514
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:28,020
[gunfire]

515
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:40,298
[gunfire]

516
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,866
It's a diversion!
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

517
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,734
It's a diversion,

518
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,801
<i>we've been set up!</i>

519
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,070
<i>Warn the second team!</i>

520
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,672
The signal's down,
I'm trying to reestablish.

521
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,643
Just forget that, warn Carlos.

522
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,378
Carlos, come in.

523
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,681
I guess no news is good news,

524
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,915
that decoy must've worked.

525
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,151
Decoy?

526
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:03,819
Radio Betty, get an update.

527
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:07,690
Hey Betty, this is Carlos...
you read me?

528
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:08,991
- Anything?
- Nothing.

529
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,426
Carlos?

00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:18,900

00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,852
[gunfire]

532
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,020
Grab the wheel!

533
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,189
What did I tell you?

534
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:35,827
Decoy huh?

535
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:37,829
I think you'd better fasten
your seatbelt.

536
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:41,400
You're in for one
hell of a ride!

537
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,436
Simon?
Simon?

538
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:44,670
Is he okay?

539
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:47,206
Let's see you get out
of this one, Protector!

540
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:50,443
Hang on, Carlos!

541
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,110
Here we go, stay with them.

542
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:55,879
They want us off the road!
Son of a bitch!

543
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,650
Dillon, Dillon!

544
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:00,885
We're under attack,
we need backup!

545
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,421
- Where are they?
- Dillon!

546
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,623
Where are they?

547
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:07,157
Damn it!

548
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,592
What the hell is going on?!

549
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:10,494
Hold on!

550
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,999
- Hang on!
- Kiera you okay?

551
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:20,471
Kiera?!

552
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:23,573
Carlos, what's going on
back there?

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,480
What the hell?!

561
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,452
Nice try!

562
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,054
Oh shit!
Oh shit!

563
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,854
Oh, God!

564
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,931
Hang on back there!

565
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,080
Okay, we bought ourselves
a little time!

566
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,555
[fighting grunts]

567
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:28,290
Carlos?

568
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:29,658
Carlos?!

569
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:35,396
[fighting grunts]

570
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,298
Carlos!

[fighting grunts]

572
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:49,802
- Carlos, you all right?
- Yeah, I got it covered!

573
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:56,950
Ahh!

574
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,918
Go to sleep.

575
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:00,420
Nighty night.

576
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,626
- What about now?
- Yeah, it's handled.

577
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:09,295
Nicely done. What do we do now?

578
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:12,131
I'll get on the radio, see if I
can find out what's going on.

579
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:13,499
Good plan.

580
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,701
Betty! It's Carlos, you there?

581
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,439
Inspector!

582
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,243
Yeah.

583
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:27,044
Carlos radioed in,
they were ambushed.

584
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:28,513
One dead guard,

585
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,682
they're driving blind on country
roads, waiting for backup.

586
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,484
Okay, well let's get
them some.

587
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,452
Redirect the decoy convoy
to their last known position

588
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,021
and send in air support
to cover the area.

589
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,661
How the hell did Liber8
get wind of this?

590
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:46,530
You think we have someone
inside feeding intel to Liber8?

591
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,065
Well, I wouldn't rule
it out.

592
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:54,771
Where's that backup?

593
00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:56,238
It should be here any
minute now.

594
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,508
How did they know where
we were, Carlos?

595
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,543
There's only one reasonable
answer to that question...

596
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,479
A mole inside the VPD.

597
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,215
Either way, we can't risk
calling in for backup again.

598
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:18,860
Looks like the air support
finally arrived.

599
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,629
Who the hell are these guys?

600
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,033
What are they doing?

601
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,201
[gunfire]

602
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:28,969
Oh shit...
Hold on!

603
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:30,338
Get out of here, go!

604
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:44,718
God Damnit, Carlos!
We're sitting ducks!

605
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,919
GPS puts them in this area,

606
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:50,223
our units are 10 minutes away.

607
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,826
Don't you say a word.

608
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:55,127
I don't really need to,
do I?

609
00:32:58,064 --> 00:32:59,765
You and I know there's
only two versions of this

610
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,066
that make any sense,

611
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:04,236
so you need to decide.

612
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:09,107
Do you have a problem
inside this department

613
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:13,411
or do you need to take a
closer look at Kiera Cameron?

614
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,213
She might not make it
out of this alive.

615
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,382
From what I've seen,

616
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,784
making it out alive
is her specialty.

617
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:21,118
Any sign of them,
are they gone?

618
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:24,889
I don't know where they are,
I can't see them.

619
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,190
We need cover!

620
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,902
Right there! That tunnel, go!

621
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:39,336
Hold on!

622
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,083
- Shit!
- Get out of here, go!

623
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:57,221
- Go!
- Hold on!

624
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:58,855
There we go!

625
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:05,428
Our friends are back.

626
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:08,564
What do we do now?

627
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,807
I have no idea.

628
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,837
- Oh shit...
- Oh God...

629
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,338
Kiera!

630
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,350
That clearly wasn't meant
for us.

631
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,020
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

632
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,355
Right there, there it is!

633
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,928
Come on! That was no accident!

634
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,763
These two are fighting
over us?

635
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:50,033
Two factions,
Travis is the prize.

636
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,935
Ready? Now!

637
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:59,208
[gunfire]

638
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:00,343
Come out!

639
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,077
If we stay here, we're dead!

640
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,379
What are our options?

641
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:07,616
We're gonna make
a run for it.

642
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:12,120
We're gonna be ripped
to shreds!

643
00:35:12,188 --> 00:35:13,689
Stay as close to me
as you can.

644
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,924
- What are you, crazy?
- Now!

645
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:32,840
[gunfire]

646
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:44,852
Are you okay?

647
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,420
Yeah, I don't know how
but yeah.

648
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:54,827
[gunfire]

649
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,100
[gunfire]

650
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:26,857
Nice work, Inspector.

651
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,496
Shit...

652
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,344
Problems?

653
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,779
Uh... you could say that.

654
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:42,848
I've lost contact
with our team.

655
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:44,015
What are you talking about?

656
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,746
The last transmission
said they were engaged

657
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:46,842
then a helicopter showed up.

658
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,953
Can you play it back
for me?

659
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,663
Where's Garza?

660
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,098
Oh, no.

661
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,168
The guns...

662
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,570
She took Travis' serum too.

663
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:13,910
This one has the latest
intel processor

664
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:16,078
and a terabyte of
hard drive storage.

665
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,980
Uh, I was told I need
to get a lot of rams.

666
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:19,715
Yes, this one has 8 gigabytes
or ram.

667
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:20,916
<i>Dad, Dad!</i>

668
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:22,284
What's bigger, a gigabyte
or a terabyte?

669
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:23,619
<i>Dad, Dad!</i>

670
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:24,653
Uh... a terabyte is one
thousand gigabytes.

671
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,821
Okay, I want a terabyte
of rams.

672
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:27,990
You can't have a terabyte of...

673
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:33,128
see, the way a computer's
memory works is that...

674
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:35,497
You gonna get that?

675
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:45,407
You know, this is uh...
this is where things start

676
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,909
to get a little murky
for me, agent Cameron.

677
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,176
You and Fonnegra,

678
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:53,013
apparently out of
ammunition at this point,

679
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,715
are able to escape
the focused crossfire.

680
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:57,151
Obviously.

681
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,119
And yet you couldn't make
out any identifying features

682
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,055
of either group, nothing.

683
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:02,289
She already told you,

684
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:03,657
the first group had all
the signs of Liber8...

685
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:05,391
they were bold but reckless.

686
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:06,892
The second group...

687
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,562
it was like a military strike,
they were precise.

688
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:12,198
What matters here is
that both groups

689
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:15,168
were apparently going
for the same thing.

690
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:17,002
You know what astounds me
Inspector Dillon?

691
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:19,172
Is that these two were put in
charge in the first place,

692
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,005
especially considering
that we're not even sure

693
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:24,076
where agent Cameron's
alliances really lie.

694
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:27,379
Hey... that is enough.

695
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:28,680
You know Gardiner,

696
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:29,614
I really don't care who gave
you the authority

697
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,216
to be a part of
this operation,

698
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:32,484
what I will not...
Inspector...

699
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:34,819
What I will not stand
for is you questioning

700
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:38,389
the loyalty of my officers!

701
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:41,525
Regardless of what
happened out there today,

702
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:43,727
the buck stops with me.

703
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:47,030
I didn't see the threat.

704
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,699
Is that right?

705
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,201
It was the right call.

706
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:53,936
Now I will file the report and
I will take the heat for it.

707
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,272
Yeah, I expect that
you will.

708
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,508
We're done.

709
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,151
Putting Travis Berta into an
unprotected decoy vehicle

710
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,685
is pretty cunning,

711
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:11,987
I'll give you that.

712
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:13,422
Go to hell.

713
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,128
Cameron...

714
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,966
We both know that you're
not what you seem

715
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,535
and I got a pretty good
feeling those answers

716
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:33,174
are gonna reveal themselves as
long as someone is watching.

717
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:34,642
I have work to do.

718
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,512
Oh, springing Travis
wasn't enough?

719
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:47,854
[cell phone buzzing]

720
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,957
It's Garza.

721
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,225
Yes?

722
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:56,695
<i>Sonya... you were right.</i>

723
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,632
You don't have much time.

724
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,274
Keep moving.

725
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,079
What's that?

726
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,638
You okay?

727
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,173
What was in that syringe?

728
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,840
Something to keep
you moving.

729
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:53,648
[gunfire]

730
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,684
We don't have much time.

731
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,222
Come on!

732
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,569
We can't assume
anything's normal

733
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,558
if there's a spy in
the department.

734
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,393
Yeah, I know.

735
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:07,862
We need to add another layer
of secrecy.

736
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,496
That's gonna get weird.

737
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,398
Going to get weird?

738
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:14,468
Could it be weirder
than time travel stories?

739
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:17,504
Yeah, that was...
pretty out there.

740
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:18,253
Yeah.

741
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:22,468
You know, what's strange was
how Travis decided he wanted

742
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:25,237
to lump you into his
crazy delusions.

743
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:29,116
Crazy is crazy.

744
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:31,017
Yeah...

745
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:34,654
Since you're in the
mood for out there ideas,

746
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:36,056
here's one I'd like
to run by you.

747
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:37,791
Shoot.

748
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,860
Our department spy, the mole,

749
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,728
knows just enough
to screw us over,

750
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:46,899
make us look bad and
undermine our goals...

751
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:51,603
like they want us
out of the way.

752
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,140
I'm listening.

753
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,241
What if it's Gardiner?

754
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:09,208
♪

755
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:14,024
A toast!

756
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:18,829
A toast to fear...

757
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:23,200
Fear infects the minds
of our opponents.

758
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:26,270
Fear slows them down

759
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:31,607
and opens the door to
self-doubt and inaction.

760
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,843
You see without their fear,

761
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:37,246
our bravery would
be meaningless.

762
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:40,850
You can't fear failure
because in doing so,

763
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:44,719
you are inviting failure.

764
00:42:44,787 --> 00:42:47,889
I think it was T.S. Eliot
who said

765
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:51,526
only those who will
risk going too far

766
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:59,333
can possibly find out how
far one can go.

767
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,837
Let's do this.
