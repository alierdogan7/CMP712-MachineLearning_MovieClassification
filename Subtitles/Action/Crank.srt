Yeah, yeah. Don't know where he is,
but you're gonna tell me where he is,

into the fucking toilet!

00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,740
We're gonna discuss this shit
in a civilised manner.

110
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:20,581
Chevy, I believe you had a question
or some point you were trying to make.

111
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:25,024
- Where's Verona?
- I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

112
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,144

Don't try to fucking!

- (Orlando) Easy, easy.

114
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:35,661
Easy. All right? Look, clearly
you're operating under false pretences.

115
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,580
Ricky Verona and myself
did not pull the Anselmo job.

116
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,227
In fact, Ricky Verona
fucked me on the Anselmo job.

117
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:45,141
In fact, Ricky Verona
still owes me $7500.

118
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:48,105
- Not how I heard it.
- That's the way it is.

119
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,543
I don't know where Ricky Verona is,
cos if I knew where he was,

120
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,825
I'd probably be there right now
beating the Gucci off his ass.

121
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,898
All right.

122
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:01,660
(Orlando) All right.
That's what I'm talking about.

123

124
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:13,545

125
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,141
Just get me some coke, OK?
You got any coke?

126
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,742
- So now you're just gonna insult me?
- Come on! I don't have time!

127
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,427
Just give me something.

128
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:26,021
- I'm really dying here.
- I can see that.

129
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,496
You don't understand.
I'm really fucking dying.

130
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,226
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?

131
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,298
That's right.

132
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:39,347
Well?

133
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:43,102
- What?
- The shit ain't free, nigger.

134
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,658
That's enough.

135
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:02,820
What, you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man.

136
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,784
Oh, God.

137
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,983
Chevy...

138
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,106
- Oh, what the?
- Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good.

139
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,178
That's good, right?

140
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:19,101
Why you looking for Verona
anyway, man?

141
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,821
Some Chinese assholes
hired him to kill me.

142
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:26,216
So this is about the Don Kim situation.

143
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:29,060
- What do you know about it?
- You pulled the trigger.

144
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,456
Course I pulled the trigger.

145
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,459

147
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:43,016
- This shit ain't working.
- I beg your pardon?

148

- What?
- Agh!

152
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,946
- Oh, shit!
- Asshole!

153
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:03,622

Fucking believe me.

Whatever. I'll be waiting for you.
You ain't gonna make it, though.

- Driver, pull over.

167
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,185
- Fuck! Great.
- (sirens wail)

168
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,906
Carlito? That's some fucking funny shit,

169
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:16,024
cos me and Carlito,
we're boys now, we're tight.

170
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,304
You haven't been tight since
your brother fucked you.

171
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:23,824
That's snappy. But I did you
pretty good, though. You could admit it.

172
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:27,104
- We'll see.
- (police) Pull over.

173
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,826
- You know what the best part is?
- (bleeping)

174
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,296
Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

175
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:39,866
- Dr Miles.
- What took you so long?

176
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:42,017
Sorry, Chevy. I just got the message.

177
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,143
Forget it. Listen, I'm dying.

178
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:47,424
I've been poisoned with some kind
of Chinese synthetic shit.

179
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,340
- What?
- You've gotta fucking do something.

180
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,543
What are your symptoms?

181
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:54,538
I'm slowing down, caught in a tar pit.

182
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,743
- Blurred vision?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,704
- Dizzy?
- Sure.

184
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,177
- Any pain in your chest?
- Not really. I'm feeling pretty good.

185
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,064
- What are you doing?
- In a mall, cops chasing me.

186
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:18,536
The flow of adrenaline's
what's keeping you alive.

187
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:22,415
- I'm having trouble hearing you, Doc.
- You gotta keep moving, Chevy.

188
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,262
Explain.

189
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:32,138
If I'm right, they gave you the
Beijing Cocktail. It's very nasty shit.

190
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:38,141
Works on the adrenal gland,
blocks the receptors.

191
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:45,703
The only thing you can do is to keep
the flow of adrenaline constant.

192
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,064
- Meaning if you stop, you die.
- Hang on.

193
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:58,465
Jesus. What?
Are you there? Are you OK?

194
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:03,416
- What'd you say, Doc?
- If you stop, you die.

195
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:11,020
That's what I'm trying to do,
keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

196
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,978
Chev, are you there? Chevy?

197
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:20,936
Every time I slow down,
it's... like my brain starts to rust.

198
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,780
- Have you taken anything?
- Couple of grams of coke.

199
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:27,655
I'll be in LA in about an hour.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.

200
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:30,898
But do not stop moving.
Keep yourself pumped up.

201
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,905
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo, yo!

202
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:44,104
- Go.
- Where we go?

203
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,178
Just drive.

204
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,227
- Make a right.
- Where do you wanna go, man?

205
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,423
Right.

206
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,658
(siren wails)

207
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,856
- Oh, shit.
- A right. Make a right.

208
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,538
Crank the music up.

209
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:21,825
(# "Achy Breaky Heart"
by Jarrett and Long)

210
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,943
Crank it!

211
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:29,457
# Don't tell my heart
My achy break heart

212
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:33,256
- # I just don't think he'd understand
- (heart beats slowly)

213
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:37,101
# And if you tell my heart
My achy break heart

214
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,985
# It might blow up and kill this man

215
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,742
# Whoo-ooh!

216
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,576
Pull over, pull over.

217
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,903
Thanks, mate. Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in one minute!

218
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,182
(taxi driver) OK, cowboy.

219
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,378
Hiya, mate.

220
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,378
You move, you die.

221
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,378
(ringing tone)

222
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,056
Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called...

223
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,580
Fuck!

224
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:58,417
Where do you wanna go, man?

225
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:00,498
Beverly Hills.

226
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,296
(Spanish rap music)

227
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,183
- Chevy.
- Hey, boss.

228
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,542
Something urgent's come up.

229
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:05,176
So I've heard. Word travels fast.

230
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:08,304
Listen, Carlito, I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

231
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,742
No, not much.

232
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,466
You've gotta find an antidote
or something.

233
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:18,782
- What's the matter?
- The shit they gave you.

234
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,462
Chinese shit. There is no antidote.

235
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:26,859
- What, that's it?
- Honestly, you should be dead already.

236
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,744
It's a miracle.

237
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:31,421
- A miracle?
- We give that shit to horses.

238
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,977
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

239
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,258
What do you expect me to do, hm?

240
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:42,498
You're gonna find that punk Verona
and his whole fucking crew

241
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:46,262
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

242
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:49,020
What is this?

243
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:53,498
- What, are you boys now or something?
- Verona?

244
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,101
That's a small-time punk.

245
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,462
That's not to say
there isn't an opportunity.

246
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,536
Opportunity?

247
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,380
Everyone knows
the love I have for you, Chev.

248
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:07,746
Maybe this makes up for the Don Kim
heat which was perhaps ill-advised.

249
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,341
Ill-advised?

250
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,658
The heat from Hong Kong has been
much more than we anticipated.

251
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,738
That's outstanding, Carlito.

252
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:19,217
Glad to know that my death
can be of some fucking use to you.

253
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:22,583
- Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

254
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:27,024
I don't know if you'd noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day, brother!

255
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:36,020
Yah. I'm outta here.

256
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,742
Ah! You're not getting in my cab wet.

257
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,863
I gave you $200
to wait for three minutes.

258
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,939
You're not getting in my car! No way!

259
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,943
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not getting in your cab.

260
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,936
Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda!

261
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,422
I'm American! Get off me!

262
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,778
(phone rings)

263
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,862
- Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's been delayed.

264
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,336
- Shit.
- No, no, it' all right. Relax.

265
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,418
Don't relax. Listen to me.

266
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:44,385
That shit they gave you
is cutting off your adrenaline.

267
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:49,336
Excitement, fear, danger, it causes
your body to manufacture ephedrine.

268
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:50,826
Huh?

269
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:53,944
- They've introduced an inhibitor.
- Fuck's sake!

270
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:59,181
Your only chance is to increase the
ephedrine to force out the inhibitors.

271
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,986
Get to the emergency room,
get some epinephrine.

272
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,980
It's an artificial adrenaline.
It comes in 10-milligram syringes.

273
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,103
It gets potent, so don't overdo it.

274
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:10,143
Probably a fifth of an injection'll do.

275
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:13,264
Chevy? Did you get that?

276
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,141
- Did you get that, Chevy?
- Epi-something, yeah.

277
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:20,663
- Nephrine, man.
- OK, OK, OK, I've got it.

278
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:24,422
- I'll call you when I get there.
- (bleeping)

279
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,498
- Yeah.
- Chev.

280
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:30,506
Yeah? What is it?

281
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:33,263
- Hello?
- (bleeping)

282
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,656
- Come on!
- (phone rings)

283
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:42,296
- Chev.
- Yes. Fuck.

284
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:46,175
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

285
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,225
- Interesting. The Prince.
- Yeah. I was getting a taco.

286
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,185
He just walked right in two minutes ago.

287
00:22:56,227 --> 00:23:00,379
- Where are you now?
- Across the street. Where are you?

288
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,140
I'm there. Meet me on 7th.

289
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,658
(grunts)

290
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:10,738
One more.

291
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,937
Huh?

292
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,018
Is he in there now?

293
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,262
Did anyone go in with him?

294
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:36,098
Right, wait here.

295
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,658
(yelps)

296
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,498
(yelps)

297
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:36,020
Shit! Agh!

298
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,462
How'd you like that one, tough guy?

299
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:41,778
How freakin' awesome
was that, huh? Huh?

300
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:51,097
Well, well, well. Feel like talking
to me? Where's your fucking brother?

301
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:54,497
Doing your mother
like a fucking whore, you bitch.

302
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:59,138
Nice. Wonder how many steaks
I could carve out of you.

303
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,787
You're dying, motherfucker.

304
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,737
# I was born to run
I was born to dream

305
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,660
# The craziest boy you ever seen

306
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,863
# I gotta do it my way

307
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:16,698
# Or no way at all...

308
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:19,420
(gun clicks)

309
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,304
# I'm even on my knees

310
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:26,302
# Making love to whoever I please
I gotta do it my way...

311
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:29,618
You wanna dance with me,
motherfucker? Huh?

312
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,821
- I'm gonna fuck you up.
- (grunting)

313
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,023
Come on.

314
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:37,621
# Tried to tie me down

315
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:40,619
# I was such a clown

316
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:50,704
Jesus. Nothing's easy.

317
00:25:53,747 --> 00:25:55,897
Wanna hold hands?

318
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:11,816
Don't stop it. Here we go.

319
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:18,060
- Hey, talk to me, bro.
- Hey, Ricky. What about sucking me off?

320
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:22,425
You in the mood? Will you let me
lick your ass or something?

321
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:26,705
Who is this? Chelios?
Is this fucking Chelios?

322
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:30,336
That' right, bro.
I've got your brother' cellphone.

323
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:32,816
I can tell you have it all figured out.

324
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:37,935
Looks like you should have cut me up
when you had the chance.

325
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:41,341
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, Ricky.

326
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:44,897
You experiencing
a little 20-20 hindsight?

327
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,137
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

328
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:51,698
I kind of like that shit you put in me.
You gonna give me some more?

329
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:56,224
- Oh, I'm... I'm gonna...
- Oh, I know, I know.

330
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,298
What's this?

331
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:05,659
A necklace.
You guys really are faggots, aren't you?

332
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,977
You motherfucker.
Fucking motherfucker!

333
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:13,744
My grandfather gave that medallion
to my father and then he... You fuck!

334

Fuck you, man. You take that thing
and you shove it up your ass.

335
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:21,705
No, thanks. You know,
I believe I'll hang onto it.

Looks like you'll have to
come find me after all.

504
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:05,143
You're so stressed out.
Do you want some pot or something?

505
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,343
Yeah! No!

506
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,145
(she hums)

507
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,183
Ready! What's the matter?

508
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,064
- I burned my hand.
- Oh, my God.

509
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,707
- Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it.
- I wanna see.

510
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:17,061
- Hey!
- (screams)

511
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,217
What the?

512
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:21,104
I'm sorry.

513
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:25,465
- That was completely uncalled for.
- Can we just?

514
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:27,538
Fine.

515
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:40,816
- I parked out the back.
- Oh.

516
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,580
- Darn. That... thing.
- What thing?

517
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,818
The waffle thing. I gotta turn it off.

518
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:57,938
(phone rings)

519
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:03,536
Hello.

520
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:06,298
Hello.

521
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:14,056
(Eve) All right. Very funny.

522
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,704
God, I hate that.

523
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:22,657
- Whoo!
- Trying to burn the building down?

524
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,179
- Oh! My keys.
- Oh, sorry, honey.

525
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,905
Nice one.

526
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:37,659
(Eve mutters)

527
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,697
I swear to God, Chev.

528
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:47,702
I don't know where you are these days,
but it's not working for you.

529
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:52,705
Ah, my hand cream.
That's where you were.

530
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:04,184
Chev, can I have some help here?

531
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,897
Where is your car?

532
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:13,217
My car? Actually, I took a cab.

533
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:15,298
A c?

534
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:25,938
(hearts beat)

535
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:02,938
- This isn't gonna be...
- (hiccups)

536
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:05,746
This isn't gonna be easy, as they say.

537
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,897
(hiccups)

538
00:45:07,987 --> 00:45:11,297
Oh, fuck. All right. Here it is.

539
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,264
Sorry.

540
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:17,301
(hiccups)

541
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:22,905
You know I told you I was a video game
programmer? Well, that was a lie.

542
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,978
Actually, uh...

543
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:29,179
I kill people.

544
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:35,183
Professional hit man. Freelance for
a major West Coast crime syndicate.

545
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,543
Last night was a job like
a hundred others, nothing special.

546
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:44,423
The Triads from Hong Kong had been
moving in on the local drug cartels.

547
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:49,103
My target was the number one man
in Los Angeles, Don Kim.

548
00:45:57,067 --> 00:46:00,776
Well? What are you waiting for?

549
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:05,299
Then this insane idea comes in
through the back of my head

550
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,855
like a.45 slug at close range.

551
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,338
Congratulations.

552
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:17,422
- Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

553
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:23,180
They want you dead,
so sooner or later it's gonna happen,

554
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:25,258
but I'm not doing it.

555
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,576
I see.

556
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:33,582
Instead you're gonna do something
for me. Get out of town, disappear.

557
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,977
I don't care where you go,
I don't care what you do,

558
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,627
so long as you're invisible
for 48 hours.

559
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:42,267
That's all I ask.

560
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:44,338
48 hours?

561
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:49,586
Or if you prefer,
we'll do it the other way,

562
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:53,342
the way where I go to work
and you meet Buddha.

563
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:10,465
See, I... I quit.

564
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:12,936
I quit the business for you.

565
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:17,947
- For me?
- Yeah.

566
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,018
I figured I'd tell you everything.

567
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:24,419
If you understand, we'd get on a plane
together, never come back.

568
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:27,419
Pretty crazy, huh?

569
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:29,896
You are so weird.

570
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,938
So are we going on a trip?

571
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:38,055
Well... I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me.

572
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:39,977
(hiccups)

573
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:43,344
- Eve, Eve, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

574
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:47,215
Chinese poison? Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?

575
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:51,300
If you're gonna break up with me,
at least you can tell me the truth.

576
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:54,106
(distant) Chev? Chev?

577
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,378
What's the matter with you?

578
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,465
- Wait a minute. Do you trust me?
- No.

579
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,344
Make love to me.

580
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:07,064
- What?
- I think it'll help.

581
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:09,707
Help what? Are you kidding? Get off me.

582
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,859
- Take your clothes off.
- No!

583
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:15,302
Get off me! No!

584
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:19,016
- You wanna be more spontaneous.
- You're insane!

585
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,940
You're like an adrenaline junkie
with no soul.

586
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,463
- Save me, Eve. Save my life.
- Stop it!

587
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:31,096
I'm sorry.

588
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:34,065
Oh, my God. Are you OK? Are you OK?

589
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,658
Oh.

590
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:40,300
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No.

591
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,378
No! No!

592
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,819
Get off!

593
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:49,015
Get off!

594
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:04,265
You filthy animal.
Take me right now in front of everyone.

595
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,859
That's it. Ugh. Ah!

596
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:11,257
Come on. Do it!
What are you waiting for?

597
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,905
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on!

598
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:15,820
I'm trying. Shush, Eve.

599
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:19,217
- Oh, God. Now you can't get it up?
- Shush, shush.

600
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:21,298
Come on. Come on! Get it up!

601
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:23,537
I'll fucking get it up! Jesus!

602
00:49:30,827 --> 00:49:33,182
- Goddamn it, Chev.
- Shut up! Fuck!

603
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:37,101
(screaming)

604
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:48,177
I'm alive! I'm alive!

605
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,861
Verona, you motherfucker!

606
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:54,938
All right! Yes!

607
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,336
Wow! Oh!

608
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:01,187
- (phone rings)
- Oh, my God!

609
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:05,021
Oh! Yes! Chev!

610
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,746
- Yeah.
- What are you doing? Huh?

611
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:09,977
- Yeah.
- I've got Verona.

612
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:13,059
- Kaylo?
- I've got Verona, man.

613
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,700
- What?
- No shit? Where are you?

614
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:21,666
- Don Kim' shirt factory. I'm upstairs.
- What's the matter with you?

615
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:25,217
- Fifth and Alameda?
- Who's at Fifth and Alameda?

616
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:28,504
You don't let that motherfucker
out of your sight. You hear me?

617
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:31,260
- I'll be there in ten minutes. Got it?
- Yeah, Chev.

618
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,258
Out.

619
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,144
Honey, I gotta go.

620
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,544
I'll call you!

621
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:42,222
Oh, God. What are you looking at?

622
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:57,976
Hey, man. What's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

623
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:00,945
No, no. Just step on it, all right?

624
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:05,418
You're not gonna die in my cab,
crackhead. I got something for you.

625
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:09,257
(sinister laughter)

626
00:51:10,107 --> 00:51:13,463
You take this Haitian shit, crackhead.
This is some hardcore shit.

627
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:16,345
It's made from plant shit.

628
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:21,857
Hey, what are you laughing at?

629
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:26,145
Look at this. You see that?
That's what a man look like, crackhead.

630
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:29,537
That's power. Now look at you.

631
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,858
What the...

632
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,298
(echoing laughter)

633
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:47,738
Yeah?

634
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,618
Tastes like ass.

635
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:56,500
Well, that's right, devil. You wait.

636
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,385
- (groans)
- Shut the fuck up!

637
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,456
Say goodbye.

638
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,663
- No!
- Get the fuck open!

639
00:52:24,747 --> 00:52:26,260
No!

640
00:52:32,747 --> 00:52:35,307
Oop, there it is.

641
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:37,378
Fuck him.

642
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,498
We're here.

643
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:54,018
- What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.

644
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,858
That'll be 5.35.

645
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,138
So are you, man.

646
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:10,458
Have a nice day, devil.

647
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:17,378
This is fucked.

648
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,218
Where's he going?

649
00:53:25,347 --> 00:53:27,497
Yeah, OK.

650
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:31,865
How the fuck you gonna call me
talking shit? I don't know where he at.

651
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:33,938
I ain't baby-sitting the motherfucker.

652
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:36,495
Fucking call me talking shit. Shit.

653
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:41,899
I'm doing my job. I'm doing my shit.

654
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:47,456
I'm out here just chilling,
doing what I do, on the rooftop...

655
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:51,904
Whoa, Chevy, Chevy. What's up, dog?
Everything all right? You chilling?

656
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:54,740
- What a fucking coincidence.
- What you talking about?

657
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,740
- You waiting for a bus?
- I thought a helicopter'd pick me up.

658
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,624
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

659
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:02,823
- You working for the Chinese?
- Chinese?

660
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,898
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.

661
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:08,138
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?
- Uh...

662
00:54:08,227 --> 00:54:11,264
- OK, ding. Time's up.
- What d'you mean, ding?

663
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:13,144
What d'you mean, ding? Ah!

664
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:15,218
(thuds)

665
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,296
(Chev) Where is that motherfucker?

666
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:23,378
Chev.

667
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:29,737
- What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

668
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:31,624
You mean like this?

669
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:38,218
Now you tell me where that
little toerag motherfucker is. Verona.

670
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:40,980
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

671
00:54:42,387 --> 00:54:44,105
What?

672
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:47,497
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.

673
00:54:47,587 --> 00:54:51,216
- Carlito?
- You've totally lost your shit, dog.

674
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:56,062
You're all over TV, destroying property,
making unauthorised hits.

675
00:54:56,147 --> 00:55:00,663
You're causing the organisation
a great deal of embarrassment.

676
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,386
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?

677
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,186
Don't worry about Verona.
We'll take care of him.

678
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:10,624
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice, dark, quiet place

679
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,096
and... just die.

680
00:55:20,027 --> 00:55:26,375
Just die. What, do you think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

681
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,945
- Maybe you're right.
- We all gotta die sometime, right?

682
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:39,461
Yeah.

683
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:42,061
We all gotta die sometime.

684
00:55:42,147 --> 00:55:45,025
(Chev) So I'll just die.

685
00:55:49,147 --> 00:55:50,865
What the?

686
00:55:55,747 --> 00:55:58,136
(gunfire)

687
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,424
(Eve screams)

688
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:20,625
Oh, my fucking arm!
You miserable motherfucker!

689
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:23,096
- Oh!
- Jesus! Eve, move!

690
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:30,661
(he continues shouting)

691
00:56:39,227 --> 00:56:42,139
- Asshole. What d'you want?
- Don't talk to him like that!

692
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,457
My boyfriend kills people.

693
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:45,821
Nice.

694
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:47,898
(continues shouting)

695
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:27,662
(gunfire)

696
00:58:13,387 --> 00:58:15,776
I had to see
if you were telling the truth.

697
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:20,740
Come on.

698
00:58:21,987 --> 00:58:23,659
No, wait!

699
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,458
Now come on.

700
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:34,984
Oh, God! Ooh!

701
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:40,784
Oh, damn it.
I forgot to take my birth-control pills.

702
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:43,017
- What?
- Yeah.

703
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:44,699
- Where are the keys?
- Chev.

704
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,096
- Eve, the keys.
- Here. Ow.

705
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:53,783
- (Chev) Come on, come on.
- My stuff!

706
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:57,101
All my stuff!

707
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:26,740
- You weren't lying.
- Welcome to my life.

708
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:32,222
No. I mean,
that you would give it all up for me.

709
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,295
Yeah.

710
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,986
- And the other part?
- The poison? Yeah, that's true too.

711
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:42,786
Then that means...

712
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:44,698
Pretty much.

713
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,937
- How can we stop it?
- Adrenaline slows it down.

714
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:58,615
- So when were in Chinatown?
- Yeah, sorry.

715
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:05,785
- Eve, what are you doing?
- This'll get you going.

716
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,859
- What?
- Come on. Finish what you started.

717
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:10,539
Oh, boy.

718
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:16,295
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

719
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,497
- You like that?
- Stay down!

720
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,862
Motherfucker!

721
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:33,583
Oh! Jesus! Oh, yeah, that's it, baby!
Just a little more.

722
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:40,345
Stay down, Eve.

723
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:51,103
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big.

724
01:00:52,707 --> 01:00:54,823
Oh, my God.

725
01:00:58,107 --> 01:01:00,098
Just a touch...

726
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:03,185
What's the matter?

727
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:08,182
So you can fall asleep
like you always do? I don't think so.

728
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:09,939
Jesus fuck!

729
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,697
Are they really?

730
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:55,381
They're dead.

731
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,578
How can you do that?

732
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,266
- I told you, baby. I quit.
- (phone rings)

733
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:03,896
Yeah.

734
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:07,138
Chev, I've been trying
to get hold of you for half an hour.

735
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,822
- Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office. Can you make it here?

736
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:13,296
Sure. Why not?

737
01:02:16,187 --> 01:02:22,456
Chocolate, what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Food's Market for $254?

738
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:23,900
Snacks.

739
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:35,984
I owe you again, Doc.

740
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:38,740
Chevy, you're my best customer.

741
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:44,179
- What is this stuff?
- Synthetic ephedrine.

742
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:46,735
Delivered with some saline.

743
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:48,624
Feels sort of good.

744
01:02:48,707 --> 01:02:54,896
I got a little meth in there too, so
that's the endorphins you're feeling.

745
01:02:56,787 --> 01:02:59,745
Wait a minute. What, so I'm not better?

746
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:04,105
Fuck, no, you're not better.
You're in such shit shape it's stunning.

747
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:10,660
I can't believe your heart's beating.
Should be in a fucking medical journal.

748
01:03:15,627 --> 01:03:17,424
So what are you gonna do?

749
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:20,544
This solution is acting
as a competing inhibitor.

750
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:23,425
It's pushing the poison
out of your receptors

751
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:25,304
and replacing it with a chemical.

752
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:28,220
- But this is a temporary fix.
- Then what?

753
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:30,980
You're fucked.

754
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:37,344
Uh, I can put you on life support, Chev,
and string this out for a few days.

755
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:41,215
But you're gonna go into a coma
at some point and...

756
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:43,696
Does she know?

757
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:52,184
Why don't you let me load you up
and you can go out in a beautiful dream?

758
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:55,498
Dream.

759
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,858
Can I do that for you?

760
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:04,460
No, no, no.

761
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:06,742
That's not what I want.

762
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:09,261
What do you want?

763
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,338
One hour.

764
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,181
I want one hour.

765
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:27,176
I don't fucking believe it.

766
01:04:29,747 --> 01:04:34,298
So the wild rampage that began at 9am
in West Los Angeles continues,

767
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:38,175
the mysterious suspect still at large.

768
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:41,498
Maybe we should have given him
more of that Chinese shit.

769
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,578
Oh, you think?

770
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,061
(phone rings)

771
01:04:48,147 --> 01:04:49,944
Dude, it's him.

772
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:52,746
- (gunfire on video game)
- Turn this thing off.

773
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:55,819
- What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douchebag.

774
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:58,785
Thought you might be interested
in a little deal.

775
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:02,701
- You a dealer? That what you are now?
- Don't you worry about what I am.

776
01:05:02,787 --> 01:05:04,937
Listen, I want the antidote.

777
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,985
Oh. Oh, the antidote.

778
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:11,821
- That' right. The antidote.
- What are you prepared to give me?

779
01:05:11,907 --> 01:05:16,378
The jewellery I got off that faggot
brother of yours, fucking cocksucker?

780
01:05:16,467 --> 01:05:19,937
- Hm.
- Don't pop a blood vessel, you penis.

781
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,302
- All right.
- You like that deal, do you?

782
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:25,618
- Whatever.
- I'll be at the Lint in 20 minutes.

783
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:27,504
- You know the spot?
- I know it.

784
01:05:27,587 --> 01:05:31,421
Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing
to some whore for a fucking hand job.

785
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:35,420
Look, I said I'll fucking be!
If you don't fucking be there!

786
01:05:35,507 --> 01:05:37,941
- See you later, sunshine.
- Turn that shit off!

787
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,222
Goddamn it. Fuck.

788
01:05:45,427 --> 01:05:50,342
Yo, it's Verona. You're not gonna
believe this call I just got.

789
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:07,862
- (Chev) lt' gonna be all right, baby.
- (Eve) But you said...

790
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:12,498
(Chev) I know. Things have changed.
There' an antidote.

791
01:06:12,587 --> 01:06:16,580
Gonna make a deal for it,
but I've gotta go alone.

792
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:19,261
- (Eve) I'm scared.
- Of course.

793
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,695
(Chev) You'll be safe now,
and I'll be back.

794
01:06:23,907 --> 01:06:25,704
Promise?

795
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:27,980
I promise.

796
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,621
(heart beats)

797
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:05,177
(heart beats faster)

798
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:27,378
What's happening, bro?

799
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:52,423
- (woman' voice) Where did I go wrong?
- Did you fucking just say something?

800
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:54,975
It's like talking to the wall.

801
01:07:56,987 --> 01:07:57,976
Mum?

802
01:07:58,067 --> 01:08:00,820
I'm amazed you remember
you have a mother.

803
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:03,705
Mum, please,
I haven't got time for this.

804
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:07,143
- (Orlando) You got no time, period.
- Orlando?

805
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:10,344
You're a persistent motherfucker,
Chev Chelios.

806
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:13,897
- They pop you and you keep getting up.
- I'm the Terminator.

807
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:17,900
(Verona) You was, maybe,
but there's a new gun in town.

808
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:22,936
I don't get it. Why didn't you just cut
me up alive when you had the chance?

809
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:25,257
Too easy, motherfucker. Look at you.

810
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:28,623
Bipolar, sadomasochistic tendencies.

811
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:31,699
(Chev) Adrenaline junkie.
Addicted to violence.

812
01:08:31,787 --> 01:08:36,224
Carving up a guy like that while he
screams in his own blood and excrement

813
01:08:36,307 --> 01:08:40,585
would be like a gift, a warrior's death.

814
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,703
Hell, you'd probably get off on it.

815
01:08:42,787 --> 01:08:44,778
What the hell are you, anyway?

816
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:51,742
- I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Well, better late than never.

817
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:56,662
- You know you're gonna die up there?
- Yeah, maybe.

818
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:58,703
But I'm taking you with me.

819
01:09:01,947 --> 01:09:03,938
Some pills, Doc.

820
01:09:18,827 --> 01:09:22,024
- Chelios.
- Hello, girls.

821
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:31,538
Hold up.

822
01:09:32,307 --> 01:09:34,298
Give me the piece.

823
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:55,735
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?

824
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:59,581
Chelios.
What a fucking nightmare you are.

825
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,864
- No shit.
- Why don't you sit down?

826
01:10:04,147 --> 01:10:06,786
Wait a minute. You pat him down again.

827
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:09,335
I know he's carrying something.

828
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:15,063
Let me see that.

829
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:22,144
- Fuck.
- It's clever. Is this an insulin pump?

830
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:25,503
- Basically.
- What the fuck is insulin, man?

831
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:29,187
- Ephedrine, right?
- Yeah.

832
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:32,416
Very resourceful.

833
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:38,420
- Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's little bitch.

834
01:10:38,507 --> 01:10:42,500
We'll see what kind of a bitch you are
when Carlito hires you and you take it.

835
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:44,100
(Carlito) That's enough.

836
01:10:44,187 --> 01:10:47,975
You'll throw him a reach-around to show
him what a good little bitch you are.

837
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:51,821
I'm nobody's little bitch!
You fucking hear me?

838
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:53,898
And he'll pay me when I tell him to pay.

839
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,660
I said that's enough! Now sit down!

840
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:04,140
It's been a long fucking day.

841
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,742
But in the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.

842
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:11,137
Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you,

843
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,582
and Hong Kong
gets a goat to take the fall.

844
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:15,146
(goat bleats)

845
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:19,220
Please understand, Chev,
it's truly nothing personal.

846
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,423
You speak for yourself.

847
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,225
(blows kiss)

848
01:11:23,307 --> 01:11:26,856
That what I think it is?

849
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:29,177
It's the Chinese shit.

850
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,622
Hold him down.

851
01:11:33,547 --> 01:11:36,664
Not so fast, motherfucker.

852
01:11:37,787 --> 01:11:39,982
What does this guy think he's doing?

853
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,985
Whatever, psycho.

854
01:11:46,627 --> 01:11:50,176
I'm afraid the Houdini act
is over, my friend.

855
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:53,186
(trigger clicks)

856
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,495
Boosh.

857
01:11:57,827 --> 01:12:00,057
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Shut up.

858
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:02,945
So this is how it is.

859
01:12:04,747 --> 01:12:07,181
It's Don Kim. He's supposed to be dead.

860
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,541
Presto.

861
01:12:29,107 --> 01:12:30,222
Go, go, go, go!

862
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:33,458
Police have moved to surround
the downtown Hotel Lint,

863
01:12:33,547 --> 01:12:36,186
where the madman
behind today's mayhem

864
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:40,260
is believed to be holed up
and making a desperate last stand.

865
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,941
Officials have confirmed gunfire
on the sundeck.

866
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:47,737
Our news chopper will be bringing
live coverage from above the hotel.

867
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:52,981
This coverage is live and uncensored,
so if you have small children present,

868
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:55,376
you may wanna have them
leave the room.

869
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:09,336
Get me out of here now!

870
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:20,183
- I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
- Too late.

871
01:13:26,147 --> 01:13:28,297
Look out!

872
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,423
Thanks, boss.

873
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,179
Get us outta here now! Let's go!

874
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:58,417
Present from Kaylo...

875
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:09,496
- Now what? Now you say shit!
- Where the fuck were you?

876
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:13,100
Who's the bitch now?

877
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,221
You fly, motherfucker!

878
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:25,978
Motherfucking fly!

879
01:15:54,147 --> 01:15:55,341
(chuckles)

880
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:13,096
You're dead!

881
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:16,338
Oh, my God.

882
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:31,140
You're dead! You're dead, motherfucker!

883
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:02,784
Told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!

884
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,459
(neck cracks)

885
01:17:21,547 --> 01:17:23,538
(ringing tone)

886
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:27,699
Hey, this is Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.

887
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:32,065
Leave a message. Unless you're trying to
sell something, cos I'm not interested.

888
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,457
If you're not, then just...
Oh, wait. Time' up.

889
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:37,936
- (bleeps)
- Hey, doll.

890
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:43,463
Looks like I let you down again.

891
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:50,897
Seems like all my life
I've just been going, going, going...

892
01:17:50,987 --> 01:17:56,380
I wish I'd taken more time to stop
and smell the roses, so to speak.

893
01:17:57,587 --> 01:18:00,659
But I guess it's too late for that now.

894
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:07,656
You're the greatest, baby.

895
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:11,535
# If only you believe
like I believe, baby

896
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:13,618
# Like I believe

897
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,857
# We'd get by

898
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:18,017
# If only you believe

899
01:18:29,307 --> 01:18:31,582
(heart beats slowly)

900
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:36,937
