He loves me not.

1248
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:56,509
He loves me.

1249
01:56:58,429 --> 01:56:59,637
MR. FREEZE:
Not!

1250
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,099
Surprise.

1251
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,268
I'm your new cellmate.

1252
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:11,149
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1253
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:14,652
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1254
01:57:18,616 --> 01:57:21,951
Winter has come at last.

Alfred.

1257
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:08,539
Are you...?

1258
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:13,336
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1259
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,880
And quite well, it seems!

1260
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,465
Thanks to you, son.

1261
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:19,842
Thanks to you all.

1262
01:58:20,094 --> 01:58:21,678
Well done, Bruce.

1263
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:24,097
You too. Well done.

1264
01:58:25,516 --> 01:58:27,016
I got one question.

1265
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:31,020
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1266
01:58:31,188 --> 01:58:33,523
It's the first time I fell
and you weren't there.

1267
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,525
I figured you could handle it.

1268
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:40,405
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1269
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:46,536
Excuse me. I'm the one
who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1270
01:58:46,704 --> 01:58:48,037
Yeah, that was me.

1271
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,707
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1272
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:53,209
You are going back to school.

1273
01:58:53,377 --> 01:58:55,044
You'll never win this argument.

1274
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:01,384
Partners?

1275
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:18,443
Partners.

1276
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,073
We're going to need a bigger cave.
