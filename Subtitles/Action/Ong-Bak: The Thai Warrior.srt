1
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,800
Up! Up!

2
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,800
Hurry!

3
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't push!

4
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
Hurry!

5
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,800
Up the tree, quickly!

6
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,800
Pull him down quickly, quickly!

7
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Catch the flag.

8
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,800
Wait.

9
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,800
Don't let him get down

10
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,800
Hurry!

11
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,800
Careful!

12
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,800
Calm down! The winner this year...

13
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,800
is Ai Bak Tim

14
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Sawadee everyone...

15
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
from Ban Nong Pradoo.

16
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
We are gathering for good merit at this festival,

17
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,900
to give robes to the monks, and Ong Bak,

18
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,900
who is the protective icon for the well-being of our village.

19
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
This festival...

20
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
is to remind us that...

21
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
in 7 days we will be...

22
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,200
celebrating Ong Bak.

23
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
The last time...

24
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,800
being 24 years ago.

25
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
This means...

26
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,800
all prosperity will return to us once more.

27
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,800
Where is the amulet?

28
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
It's not good.

29
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
There is a little damage -

30
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Not quite perfect.

31
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
200,000 baht for this is not cheap.

32
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,800
Why don't you want to sell it?

33
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Ow! How much do you want?

34
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Don. I'm not selling.

35
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Ow! Why do you change your mind?

36
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
I came a long way from Bangkok just for this.

37
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
I've never given you any promise...

38
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
to sell it to you.

39
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
I want to give this to my son, Bak Hum Lae,

40
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,800
the day he's ordained here as a monk, for Ong Bak.

41
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Call me whenever you want to sell it.

42
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
No, no. I don't have a telephone.

43
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I'll give you my address,

44
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
so whenever you want to sell,

45
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,800
you can write to me.

46
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Is this good enough, grandma?

47
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
I made it for Ai Tim for his ordination.

48
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
It's good.

49
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Where did Ai Tim come from,

50
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
and how come he grew up in the temple?

51
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
He's now a man.

52
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Ai Tim is an ophan.

53
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
He was left at the temple by someone...

54
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
when he was a baby.

55
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Pra Kroo (the Abbot) took pity on him,

56
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,800
and adopted him.

57
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
And everyone says...

58
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,800
he has grown up well under Ong Bak.

59
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hitting the earth!

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Crocodile whipping tail!

61
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Confronting elephant!

62
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hanuman (Monkey) giving ring.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The threatening fight.

64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The rear kick.

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Both elbows attacking...

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
followed with high knee.

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Raising the army.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Getting high strength.

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Cutting through the enemy.

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Avoiding danger.

71
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Putting your head down.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Knight throwing an axe.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Wave smashing the shore.

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,900
Meet friend, join friend.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Knight catching monkeys.

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,900
Breaking the joins.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Snake chasing lizard.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Cliff shaking.

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sticky water.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Throwing the spear.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Breaking the sword.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Raising the body.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
Horse replacing bird.

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll teach you all these styles...

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,900
but I forbid you to use them for money.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you understand, Bak Tim?

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I understand, Pra Kroo.

88
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,900
Good.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He has gone.

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,900
You said you understood. Really?

91
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There is a story that...

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Pra Kroo learnt this boxing...

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
from the ancient books.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Then Pra Kroo wanted a challenge.

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He went into the boxing ring for money...

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,900
and he hit his opponent to death.

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He felt very guilty,

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so he became a monk.

99
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,900
Thai boxing is very dangerous.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,900
I don't want you to use it, unless
it is absolutely necessary.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,900
Understand?

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,900
Or are you still not clear?

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come, fight with me.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ai Bak, here.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
Uncle!
Come on!

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,900
Who is there? What are you doing?

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
Hurry!

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Bak Don...

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,900
is the one that cut off the head of Ong Bak.

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He took all the donation money too, Pra Kroo.

111
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,900
Bak Don! Evil son!

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If Pra Ong Bak has no head,

113
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
our village will be faced with disaster.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Calm down, calm down!

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We must try to get Ong Bak's head back...

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to our village before the ceremony day.

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,900
Where can we find it, Pra Kroo ?

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I will bring Ong Bak back here myself.

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Who knows where Bak Don is?

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The hopes of the people of Ban Nong Pradoo Sukon...

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is in your hands.

122
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
In this tube is a holy herbal medicine.

123
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My teacher told me...

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
it belonged to Kroo Dum.

125
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,900
Keep it with you.

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,900
This is the address of Bak Don,

127
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and this is a letter to Bak Hum Lae.

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,900
Tim, you must return with Ong Bak...

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,900
to our village.

130
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,900
This is the money for your journey.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
All my hopes are with you.

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,900
My mum gave me this ring before she died.

133
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Warn, please look after grandma.

134
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,900
We've all contributed together...

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,900
for the fares.

136
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,900
He's losing.

137
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey! What bike you using to race?

138
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why did you lose so easily like this?

139
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hey! Why are you speaking that way?

140
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Win or lose is normal in any bet.

141
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It isn't fair to blame me.

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why did you use a woman to race with me?

143
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why not?
What's wrong with being a woman?

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Ow! You dare race against me!

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You cow!

146
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you rode as fast as your mouth, you'd probably win!

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,900
Hey! Hey!

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hey! Why don't you pay me in cash?

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You bet me with drugs, didn't you?

150
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,900
You told me it was OK to use drugs instead of cash.

151
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,900
OK

152
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
I'll give you only 10,000,

153
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
after deducting the 10,000 you own me.

154
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
I pay you interest every month,

155
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
and the loan is not yet due.

156
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Can't you give me all the money now?

157
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Do you want it or not?

158
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,000
OK . Better than nothing.

159
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Hey! Give me all of that.

160
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
What!

161
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,000
Give me!

162
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
You've already got my money.

163
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Can't you give a few tablets to my friends?

164
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
You can find this drug anywhere -

165
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
you don't have to take mine.

166
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Better not to use my drugs.

167
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,100
They're too strong.
Your friends may go into shock.

168
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Believe me.

169
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,000
Huh?

170
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,000
Son of a bitch!

171
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Eh! You're back at last. My money!

172
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Give me my share quickly. Quickly!

173
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Ai Keng caught me.

174
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,100
He knew we bet with fake drugs.
He took all the money back

175
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
What? Don't tease me -

176
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
not funny at all.

177
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Muey, look at my face.

178
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,600
Do you think I kicked myself?

179
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Damn!

180
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Oy! Why are you poking me?
I'm still in pain.

181
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh well. How come you got caught?

182
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Forget it!

183
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,600
Do you have 200 baht?

184
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
What! Lost all my share and still asking me for my money?

185
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Listen! Muey.

186
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
When I won, you took the money.

187
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Now I've lost, so you must share the loss too.

188
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Ow! You're stupid to get caught,

189
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
and lose the money in your hands.

190
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
So I'm stupid and you're clever!

191
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Ai Keng give me only 3 days.

192
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,100
If I don't pay back his loan he'll hit me. Hit me!

193
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,000
Ai Hum Lae?

194
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Is it really you, Ai Hum Lae?

195
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Hi.

196
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,600
Er... Muay, is he your friend? Your friend?

197
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,100
How could he be my friend?

198
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
He is calling you, isn't he?

199
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Do you know him?
Yeah!

200
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Remember me? I'm Bak Tim
from Ban Nong Pradoo.

201
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Hey! Fool! I don't know you.

202
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Fool! Understand! I've just told you
I don't know you!

203
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,100
But I know you, Ai Hum Lae

204
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Hum Lae, Hum what!

205
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
What a stupid name! Hum Lae!

206
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Bad luck! I warn you...you're fool

207
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Ow! No need to lie! Ai Hum Lae... Oops

208
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Sorry! Slip of my tongue.

209
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Mind your own business.

210
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Get out of my sight! Out!

211
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
OK. You said you were from... Ban? Which?

212
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Ban Nong Pradoo.

213
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,000
That's it. Ban Nong Pradoo.

214
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
OK, I'm leaving.

215
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
So you're both from Ban Nong Pradoo.
Can have a good chat!

216
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Very funny! You've made your point!

217
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Go! Go away, but give me the money first.

218
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,000
Here! For your medicine.

219
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm going now, Ai Hum Lae

220
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Listen, peasant!
You should return to your hometown.

221
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,000
Go!

222
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Ai Ham Lae, I have to give you a letter.

223
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,000
I told you I don't know you! Get out!

224
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
This is my place.

225
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Don't be angry with me.
Close the door.

226
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Don't let mosquitos in.

227
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm in a bad mood and depressed

228
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,000
Ai Hum Lae.

229
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,000
Our villagers are in serious trouble...

230
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
because Bak Don stole the head of Ong Bak

231
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
The Chief sent me here to see you,

232
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
so you can help me to find Ong Bak

233
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
I have Bak Don's address.

234
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
No need to talk yet,
and put your things down here

235
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
You're better have a wash first.

236
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Go, go now.

237
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Here, here is the washroom.

238
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Go in.

239
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,600
I don't have any other clothing.

240
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
Don't worry I'll give you my towel.
Go in, go.

241
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,100
I'll turn on the light for you.

242
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Soap is on your left,
toothbrush on your right.

243
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Mind the slippery floor.

244
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,000
Hello! Muay!

245
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll meet you at the stadium -

246
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,000
the boxing stadium. OK.

247
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Do you still accept the bet?

248
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Do I have time?

249
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes.

250
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Here! All of them!

251
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,000
Do you have the amulet?

252
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
The chief changed his mind and didn't want to sell, Boss.

253
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,100
But I have the head of Ong Bak, Boss.

254
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
This is the most holy thing in the village...

255
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,000
that they all worship, and the most valuable.

256
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,100
This broken head -

257
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
why did you bring it to me?

258
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I'm not interested. Take it away!

259
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,100
My head is hurting enough without...

260
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,000
you spoiling my mood.

261
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,600
Today, Captain seems to have little to please him.

262
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Look at your fighter, Pearl Harbour.

263
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,600
I think he's losing to Arun, my fighter,
with his Kami Kaze technique.

264
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,000
Defeat's certain!

265
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I don't have the money yet -
still trying to get some.

266
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm not asking for money,
I can find that myself.

267
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Now you're selling drugs too!

268
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Yes.

269
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,600
My fighter will win the next competition.

270
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,100
If you think you will win,
then why not increase your bet.

271
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Any sum you like, ha ha!

272
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
You need not preach to me,

273
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
you don't really understand me.

274
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Just because of one stinking male...

275
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
you turn yourself into this low-life.

276
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Muay! You're not my mum!

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Because we've no parents,
you've become this bad.

278
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Yes, a bad person like me,
who has brought you up until now.

279
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,700
From now on, a good person like you
should leave me alone.

280
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,100
Yes, tell me whenever you want it.

281
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Strike, strike.

282
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Knock out.

283
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,100
Get up and hit back.

284
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,100
Yesss...

285
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
The next one is coming.

286
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Tell me if you still want to bet.

287
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,100
(laughs)

288
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
The winner is ... Pearl Harbour.

289
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Damn!

290
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,100
Pearl Habour is the Number One.

291
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Two wins two minutes.
Two wins two minutes.

292
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Where are all my things?

293
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
What?

294
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
My money bag, where is it?

295
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I don't know, I didn't take it.

296
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,100
Him.

297
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Two and one...

298
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Oh! A fresh challenger.

299
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Taking bets now, taking bets now.

300
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Aw... How come that peasant is in the fighting ring?

301
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,100
Yeh... Ai Tim is surely dead.

302
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
I'll give you 10 to 1.

303
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
But you'd better not dare to bet.

304
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,100
OK. I'll bet one million,
if you'll dare to accept it.

305
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I accept.

306
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm not here to box. I want the money.

307
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,100
Calm down, I'll give you the money later.
Start!

308
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
We have a new champion tonight.

309
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
What's your name?

310
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Tim from Ban Nong Pradoo.

311
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,100
Tim Pradoo Prew!

312
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,100
Prize for the winner!

313
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I don't want it.
I only want my money bag, there.

314
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
What an idiot!

315
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Hey! Hey! Why don't you take the prize
money? Why are you so stupid?

316
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Tell me if you want to fight again.

317
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
You have the skill to win.

318
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I can see lots of money, lots and lots.

319
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
You ask me to fight for money.

320
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Ai Hum Lae -

321
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
why did you steal the villagers' money
to play gambling?

322
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
For the investment...

323
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,100
to get enough money to help you find Ong Bak.

324
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
You really want to help me?
Yes.

325
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
This is Don's address.
Could you take me there?

326
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Keep it. I'll take you there later.

327
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Now could you give me some money.

328
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Give me, for the investment.

329
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
When I make a profit, I will pay you back,

330
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
and I'll go anywhere you want.

331
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,100
Absolutely sure!

332
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Go! Go away! Damn you!

333
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Peasant! Can't talk to you, stupid!

334
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Huh! Where will he sleep tonight?

335
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
I don't care! Or he can sleep with you!

336
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,100
You're crazy!

337
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
What shall I do? Ai Keng will kill me.

338
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Muay! Take these drugs to sell in Yai Lao's den.

339
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
When we have enough money,
I will pay you back.

340
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm sure to earn money.
I know this place well.

341
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
After the last one,
you still haven't learnt anything.

342
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I told you before,
I don't want to sell drugs.

343
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
You must help me out.
I don't want to be hit again.

344
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
OK?

345
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Yeah. Yeah... I will try,
but it'll have to be tomorrow.

346
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,100
OK, now I feel much better.

347
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You don't have to look so happy.

348
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,200
From the takings,
you'll get 30, but I'll get 70.

349
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Muay! 50/50.

350
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,700
70/30.

351
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,200
50/50.

352
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
70/30.

353
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
The money you asked for starting your business in Bangkok

354
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I don't have it...

355
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
because we had a very dry season,

356
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
and Ong Bak's head was stolen by Ai Don.

357
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Dad wishes that you will help Bak Tim
to find and return Ong Bak to us...

358
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
and save us from disaster.

359
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,100
What nonsense!

360
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,100
Warn! The pool is dry. Where are
we going to find drinking water?

361
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,100
I pray to have Ong Bak back with us soon, please.

362
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,100
Ai Rung, are you alone?

363
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,100
Ai Piew, are you betting?

364
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Brother I'm here.

365
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Damn Ai Yod.
Where have you been for months?

366
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I had to see my friends.

367
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
You are fully aware that I'm short of staff.

368
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
You assist me first, hurry.

369
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Not now, I have to meet a friend.

370
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Don't make an excuse, you help me now.

371
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Not today, some other day.

372
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
No, now, quickly!

373
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Take it.

374
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,200
Go away, you deal cards badly.

375
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Put down your bets now.

376
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,200
At your age you should stay at home,
looking after your children

377
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
What are you looking at? Get out!

378
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Go to that desk...

379
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
and change your hair colour too.

380
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,200
The colour that suits me,
and you have to copy.

381
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
Put down your bets, to lose, to lose.

382
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Betting and losing is not my fault.

383
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Turn the cards.
19 and 19 both hands.

384
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Pay yje money.

385
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,200
More bets down, bet, bet.

386
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Here's mine.

387
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Do you have money?

388
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Here it is - 3,000 real money.

389
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
You want to play? You will lose...

390
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
all your money and your belongings.

391
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,300
I bet 200.
OK, 200.

392
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,200
No card swapping.

393
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,200
Oh! 18 points.

394
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,800
Pay the money.
Wait... mine is 19. Pay me!

395
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,200
This is 400.

396
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Ai has only 6 points, 1 card.
Mine is 9.

397
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,800
8 points 3 cards.
9 points.

398
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
What sort of cards are these?

399
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,200
She's lucky.

400
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,300
It's luck, good luck.
9 points.

401
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
8 points again.
9 points again.

402
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,200
Damn cards, take it.

403
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
8 points again.

404
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Got you, pay!

405
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Damn! 8 points again.
9 to beat you.

406
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
These cards are impossible.

407
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,300
I must check if she is cheating.

408
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
She got all 9 points for 15 games.
Took most of my money.

409
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,200
Why do you pay her?

410
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I want to see if you will get 9 again.

411
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,200
You're cheating me, bitch!

412
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,200
I know I got 8 without turning the cards.

413
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Points? If 9...

414
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm certain that you cheat.

415
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Look! Loser! She got 4 points.

416
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
I don't believe it.

417
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,300
I'm sure that she concealed some cards.
I want to search her.

418
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Wait... Calm down!

419
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
You should search her.

420
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Hey! Do you hide some cards?

421
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
No, I don't.
Let's see.

422
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
There are none, I told you.

423
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Any hidden in your bag?

424
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Let me check her myself.

425
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Don't trouble yourself.

426
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Come here.
OK you can go.

427
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
You've got to search her everywhere.

428
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
All done, everywhere.
You can go, go now.

429
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Don't come back here again, bitch!

430
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Winning every game like that
is bad for my place.

431
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Let's continue, we can beat these people.

432
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
No point to win, they're all broke.
Broke! Broke!

433
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
She won all their money, nothing left.

434
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,800
Don't you have a go at me.

435
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,300
Total 8,000, I give your 3,000 back .

436
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Why is it only 3,000?

437
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
You won't need so much anyway.

438
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
What? No profit for me at all.

439
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Er... You take this money first.

440
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Don't spend too much.

441
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Give me another 1,000.

442
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
3,000 is enough for you.

443
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
This will merely cover my college fees.

444
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Hey! Seem to have a lot of money.

445
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,200
That guy is here

446
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Lend me your money.

447
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
This is my money.
Er... I'll pay you back.

448
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Will pay you back.

449
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Hi! I was on my way to pay you,
but you beat me to it. Here!

450
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
That is my money.

451
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,200
What?

452
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
8,000 - I'll give you the rest later.

453
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Don't look at me so menacingly.

454
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm not bothered too much about the rest of the money.

455
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,200
but when you two try to cheat me,
I can't forget!

456
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,200
Hold him! Beat him!
No, I won't fight you.

457
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,200
Ai Tim!   Ai Tim!

458
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,200
I won't fight, I won't fight.
Help! Help!

459
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
You cheated me, here!

460
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
You want trouble?

461
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,200
Here's some!

462
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,200
Will be seeing you!

463
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I have to thank you, Ai Tim.

464
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,200
And I will help you to find Ong Bak

465
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Could you fight one more time?

466
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
Wait... Listen to me first.

467
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
You saw just a minute ago, they beat me.

468
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
If I don't pay them, they will kill me.

469
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Could you help me?

470
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
One last fight for me.

471
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
OK. It doesn't matter anyway.
Stupid peasant!

472
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,200
Stupid village, stupid villagers!
Relying on only one boxer...

473
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
to find and return Ong Bak
to their village. Are you crazy?

474
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,300
If Ong Bak is so powerful,
why let a thief cut his head off?

475
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,200
It's only made from pieces of stone and earth.

476
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Box me! Why box me?

477
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
You are from the same village.
Don't kill each other.

478
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
He boxed me!

479
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,200
Never mind that! There! The people
you want to kill are over there!

480
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,800
Ai Peng! Haven't you had enough?

481
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,300
You want a kick to send you to sleep?.

482
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,300
Umm... You have too many.

483
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,200
Ai Yod. You know very well what to do.

484
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,200
Muay. You know what to do.

485
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,200
Use your individual skills.

486
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Don't leave me.

487
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
After them!

488
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,200
Follow them,
I'll go to block the other way.

489
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
You!  I'm going!

490
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,200
Get out, get out!

491
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,300
Oh! How can he pass?

492
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,300
Ooh! Is my bum still OK?
I don't know how I crossed them?

493
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Let me borrow the chopper quick.

494
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,300
Come near me and I will slaughter you.

495
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,300
Knives! Knives!
Big ones, small ones for sale.

496
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,300
'Chilli Powder'

497
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,300
Get him! Kill him!

498
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Ai Tim! Help me!

499
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
I won't help.
You have to fight them yourself.

500
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Ai Don! Yes, I know his address.
I'll take you.

501
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,300
Ai Tim! I know where Ai Don is.

502
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,300
Who's next!

503
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I used to see Ai Don hanging
around here, selling drugs.

504
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Ask Muay, if you don't believe me...

505
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,300
But today...

506
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,300
That boy is here, Boss.

507
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Bring him here to fight until the stakes are high,

508
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
then I will get rid of him.

509
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,300
Depends on how brave you are to take a bet?

510
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,300
You are a maniac!

511
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
What's the matter, Yod?

512
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Ai Big Bear is challenging Ai Tim to a fight.

513
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,300
Come on! I'll fight you!
I'll teach you Thai boxing! Come on!

514
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Have you seen Bak Don?

515
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
No, but I've seen a Thai man being beaten.

516
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,300
You are a coward.

517
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,300
Are you going to help him?
Without help he'll die.

518
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,300
Ai Tim!

519
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,000
If I knew you were like this,
I wouldn't have helped you find Ong Bak

520
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Huh! You can do that later.
But now you must help him first.

521
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,500
Lay down your stakes!
Lay down your stakes now!

522
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,400
Lay down your stakes ... quickly.

523
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
I'll give you 2 to 1, want to bet?

524
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
OK. Put me down for three million.

525
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,400
Attacking Enemy.

526
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,400
Hanuman (monkey) crosses the city.

527
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,500
If my man wins,
I want to collect the money.

528
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,000
OK, I know!

529
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Thanks.

530
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,500
Ai Tim! Ai Tim! The best!!!

531
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,400
I think you've had enough. No chance
to win your money back today.

532
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Well done! Well done! The best!

533
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Muay, give me that.
No. Half then.

534
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,400
I don't have to.
Trust me.

535
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Do you have any real contenders?

536
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Yes, but do you dare??

537
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,400
Oh! No problem.

538
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,400
Retreat!  Mother of God!

539
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,600
Too much for you? Give up?

540
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,100
Ay! Let go of me!

541
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Ay! Let me go!

542
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,600
You've disappointed me.

543
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:33,100
Good! The best! I told you, Muay,
to bet on him. We're rich! Rich!!

544
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Muay! Pick up the coins!

545
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,100
Enough for today!
You won't get your money back.

546
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,900
Ai Tim! You are so good, we have
a great opportunity to get rich.

547
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
Brilliant!

548
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,900
Ai Don!

549
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Follow them!

550
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,700
Get them!

551
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,700
Quick! Let's go!

552
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,700
Ai Don!

553
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,700
Follow them.

554
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
This week I have to see customers.

555
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
I want you to get things ready.

556
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Tell me first if there is a problem.

557
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Yes Boss.

558
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,900
I want you to report everything.

559
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,900
Ai Hum Lae!
Where will we find Ai Bak Don?

560
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
You eat your food first. Eat!

561
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Don't worry.

562
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,800
I'll find him! At the rice mill,
everyone know him well.

563
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Eat!

564
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Muay! Tomorrow you'll go with me.

565
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,800
May be some chance to get money.

566
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
I can't. Exams tomorrow.

567
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Exams! I've never seen you attend class.

568
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,700
How can you pass? Do you have
something special with the teacher?

569
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,800
What!
A joke, a joke.

570
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,700
You're a good student, you're clever.
Eat...

571
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,800
Thanks a lot for helping me to find Ong Bak.

572
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,700
Don't thank me.

573
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,800
Ai Yod, you own me 3 months rent.

574
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
What are you going to do?

575
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,800
Er... Give me 3 days.

576
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
I'll pay you. This time for sure.

577
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
You said 'sure' too many times already.

578
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I want money today -
otherwise you must move out.

579
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,800
Will you accept this ring instead?

580
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
OK

581
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,800
You must pay the rent within 7 days.

582
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
If you have no money again,

583
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,700
I'll kick you out, understand?

584
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,800
Son, I want you to return home with Bak Tim.

585
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
Don't worry if you don't have enough money.

586
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,800
I don't mind if you don't want to become a monk.

587
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,800
I only want you to visit us.

588
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,700
I miss you, son.

589
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,700
What's the matter! Am I not
as good as your ex-husband?

590
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,700
You spoil my mood.

591
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,100
Don!

592
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,700
I don't want to sell drugs any more.

593
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,700
Why?

594
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
I want to stop.

595
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,300
You want to stop?

596
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,700
Really want to stop?
Come here!

597
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,800
You think you can stop that easily.

598
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,700
You think you can but you can't.

599
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
Who?

600
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,800
Huh! Ai Don.

601
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,800
Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek, Pi Ngek.

602
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,000
Where is Ong Bak?
I don't know.

603
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,900
You brought it here!
I don't know.

604
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Ai Tim.

605
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,800
Get away.

606
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,800
Pi Ngek!

607
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,800
Get out quickly, Don.

608
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,800
Go, Go.

609
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,000
Call an ambulance for Room 212.
She's dying. Urgent!

610
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,800
Ai Tim! Come here quickly in a Tuk Tuk.

611
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,800
Hurry up.

612
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,800
You're dead.

613
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,800
Keep following me!

614
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,800
Come! You're dead.

615
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,800
Huh! Ai Tim.

616
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,800
Ai Tim! Brake! Brake! Brake quickly!

617
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,800
Oh Bhudda! Oh!

618
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
Spread them out.

619
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,800
Oh! Damn!

620
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,800
Get out!

621
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,000
You're dead.

622
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Remember! You must search every
square metre. Don't miss anything.

623
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,800
Most important, you must not
allow any strangers in. Understand?

624
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,800
Damn them! They keep chasing after me.

625
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,900
Get in.

626
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,900
Today the Police and
National Heritage have found...

627
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
lots of Buddha statues and relics
on the Chao Praya river's bank

628
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
This finding of invaluable objects
is very significant.

629
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,900
Because every piece is a national treasure.

630
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,100
National Heritage is making a catalogue
for protective conservation.

631
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,900
We will report any developments to this story.

632
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I told you not to cause trouble.

633
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,900
I didn't. They are looking for Ong Bak.

634
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,900
What's Ong Bak?

635
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
The head of the Buddha Statue that I brought to you.

636
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Why does this man cause me so much trouble?

637
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I lost my betting money,

638
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and all my relics collection...

639
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,100
because of one peasant.

640
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,900
I'm sorry I can't save her.

641
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,900
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek. Pi Ngek!

642
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Pi Ngek don't leave me.

643
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,900
Who's she?

644
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Muay's big sister.

645
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,900
You cann't leave me.
I have nobody.

646
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,900
Muay, Muay.

647
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,900
Ngek asked me to give this to you...

648
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
'For Muay College Fees'

649
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,900
I don't want it, don't want it

650
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I want you. I have nobody else.

651
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,900
You can't leave. I've no one else.

652
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Don't be so sad, Muay.

653
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,900
Birth and death are part of life.

654
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I won't leave you.

655
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,000
What's this? What?

656
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Where are you taking me?

657
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,900
Let's go, go quickly.
Go, go!

658
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Do you know who I am?

659
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,900
How dare you attack my property!

660
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't know. It's between Ai Tim and Ai Don.

661
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,900
True! I don't know.

662
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,900
I know that you are looking for this Head.

663
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,900
Do you really want it?

664
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,900
If you want it. I've a game for you to play.

665
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I saw Ong Bak with my own eyes.

666
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
If you accept to fight for him,

667
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,900
he will give you Ong Bak and release Muay.

668
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,900
What are you going to do?
Tell me.

669
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,900
I will do anything...

670
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
to bring back Ong Bak to Ban Nong Pradoo.

671
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,900
I'll sacrify even with my life.

672
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,900
Why do you call me to leave the frontier?

673
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,900
To warn you to stay away from political
issues and I want you to make a bet.

674
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Oho.You want to revenge that
country boxer to death!

675
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,900
How much you want to bet? Your call.

676
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,600
You don't call the shots anymore!

677
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,900
On the East corner is a Thai Boxer.
He's new to us .

678
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,900
The Burmese Boxer is on the West
corner. He's one of the best.

679
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:26,900
Now the fight has begun.
(Voice of the commentator continues)

680
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,700
Ai Tim!  Ai Tim! Are you OK?
Enough.

681
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,000
Hey! If you want Ong Bak, follow me.

682
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,200
You're crooks too. Tim lost
the fight so I could win the bet.

683
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Huh! This is Pra.

684
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,200
It's just the head of some worthless
statue that you're trying to get.

685
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,800
I'm not interested in the head,
I just want you to box for me.

686
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:58,200
Don't dare challenge me because
I can make you live or die.

687
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,200
Damn you! You betray us.

688
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,200
Ai Tim lost the fight for you,
why don't you return the head to him?

689
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,800
Son of a bitch!

690
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,800
Calm down.
Finish them after I've gone.

691
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,700
You got hurt but I got the money.
Remember that I ordered this.

692
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,800
Get rid of them.
I can't help if they don't listen.

693
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,700
Huh! Kill them!

694
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,200
Pi Yod!

695
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,200
Damn! I told him not to make a noise.

696
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Hey! Do it quickly!
Police may be here soon.

697
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,800
Hey! Go there.

698
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,800
Where is Ong Bak?

699
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,800
Hey! I go with you.
No, I can't let anyone die for Ong Bak.

700
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,800
Except me, only me.

701
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,800
Ai Tim, Ai Tim.

702
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,200
Let me help you.

703
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,500
I don't want to be like this.
I apologise to you.

704
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,800
Let me do one good deed
for Ban Nong Pradoo.

705
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,700
At least... Let me start the bike for you.

706
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:28,200
I, Bak Hum Lae, from Ban Nong Pradoo.

707
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:45,000
Don told me there is a secret cave
behind the next mountain.

708
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Still not dead!

709
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,800
You want Ong Bak! You have to
exchange it with your life.

710
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,300
We're cutting the biggest head.

711
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,100
Ai Tim!  Ai Tim.....Ai Ti...

712
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,300
Ai Ham Lae!  Are you OK?

713
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:47,300
