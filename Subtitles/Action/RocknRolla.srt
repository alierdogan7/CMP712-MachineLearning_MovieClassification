<i>People ask a question.</i>

2
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,814
<i>What's a RocknRolla?</i>

3
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,682
<i>And I tell them it's not about drums,
drugs and hospital drips</i>.

4
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,348
<i>Oh, no.</i>

5
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,188
<i>There's more there than that, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,031
<i>We all like a bit of the good life.</i>

7
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,666
<i>Some, the money.</i>

8
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,665
<i>Some, the drugs.</i>

9
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:57,569
<i>Others the sex game,
the glamour or the fame</i>.

10
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:02,144
<i>But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different.</i>

11
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,711
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,318
<i>Because a real RocknRolla
wants the fucking lot.</i>

13
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,789
<i>My name's Archy,
formerly known as Archibald.</i>

14
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,222
<i>I work for a man called Lenny Cole.</i>

15
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:55,455
<i>And Lenny Cole has the keys
to the back door of this booming city.</i>

16
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,192
<i>Let me give you an example
of how Lenny works his magic.</i>

17
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,631
<i>Two years ago,
this property cost 1 million pounds.</i>

18
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,036
Today, it costs 5 million.

19
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,300
How did this happen?

20
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,377
Attractive tax opportunities
for foreign investment...

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,709
...restrictive building consent
and massive hedge-fund bonuses.

22
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,906
London, my good man...

23
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,211
...is fast becoming the financial
and cultural capital of the world.

24
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,184
ARCHY:
<i>London is on the rise.</i>

25
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:22,791
<i>Property value has gone one way: up.</i>

26
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,827
<i>And this has left the natives struggling
to keep a foothold in the property ladder.</i>

27
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,759
I can't teach you how to skin a cat...

28
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,924
...but I can tell you a lot
about the money in bricks and mortar.

29
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,467
Like he said, it's going one way.

30
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,127
You need to see a lawyer.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,973
We do need to see a lawyer.

32
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,633
Well, it looks like a great deal.

33
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,404
These are the plans.

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,606
It'll cost 10,
and it'll be worth 20 with planning.

35
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:49,047
But, first, you gotta give
the Councillor a drink.

36
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,017
LAWYER [ON PHONE] : <i>Same deal as before.
I'll tell them they've got the planning.</i>

37
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,985
<i>Thank you, Councillor.</i>

38
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,120
You'll get the planning.

39
00:02:56,292 --> 00:03:00,092
Take care of the Councillor,
and it'll move like shit through a goose.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,288
We need help.

Bet he moves fast
and likes bricks and mortar.

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,603
LENNY: I do move fast,
and I love bricks and mortar.

45
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,240
Property's always a safe bet...

46
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:15,536
...but you gotta know what you're doing,
this ain't soft money.

criminal records...</i>

48

50
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,651
<i>...London's money-loaning

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,280
Come on, give me your hand.

his black magic wand.</i>

55
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,331
I can't get you the planning.

56
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,698
Sorry, boys, can't get the planning.

57
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,429
ARCHY:
<i>Oh, isn't that an unpleasant surprise.</i>

58
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,402
<i>Because they don't wanna owe Lenny.</i>

59
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,973
He can't get the planning.

60
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,632
<i>That's right, sweetheart.</i>

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,868
Can't get the planning?

62
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,512
<i>You've been fucked.</i>

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
What do you mean
you can't get the fucking planning?

64
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,773
You owe me.

65
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,682
Right, I get the building,
you lose your share...

66
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,323
...and I'm still out of pocket
two large ones.

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,220
Find it.

68
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,528
ARCHY: <i>They know they'll have to pay Lenny
before the month is out.</i>

69
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:11,326
<i>Because Mr. Cole has ways of making life
very, very uncomfortable.</i>

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,729
We better find it.

71
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,700
<i>What they don't know
is that Lenny controls the councilors...</i>

72
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,271
<i>...the judges and the lawyers.</i>

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,568
<i>No planning permission will be given
until Lenny wants it.</i>

74
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,473
<i>And now that he owns the building,
he wants the permission.</i>

75
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,511
Hello, Councillor?

76
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,573
Yeah.

77
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,918
Yeah, I hear you got that car
you wanted.

78
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,582
You're very generous, Len.

79
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,190
Right, now, sort that planning out,
will you?

80
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,218
-Sorted, Lenny.
-Good.

81
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,964
What's wrong with you, Archy?

82
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,603
Was that not a bit strong, Len?

83
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:52,198
They come from the same place as you.
You're gonna clean them out.

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,865
The same place as me?

85
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,375
Do I look like a fucking immigrant?

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,207
No one gave me a leg up.

87
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,340
They need a little bit of fear,
otherwise, they'll come up against me.

88
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,249
They need a little lesson, don't they?

89
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,879
<i>And that is an example
of how Lenny works.</i>

90
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,363

91
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:20,627
<i>He's hit the big time...</i>

92
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:24,671
<i>...because a new Russian billionaire
desires Lenny's property contacts.</i>

93
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,708
<i>He wants planning permission
where the law won't allow.</i>

94
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,276
Lenny Cole is here.

95
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,140
<i>Lenny will come through...</i>

96
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,442
<i>...but he will rape that Russian
for every ruble he can get.</i>

97
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,879
Nice to see you, Uri.

98
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:38,748
Good. Come and take a seat.

99
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:42,883
Excuse me if I am hasty,
but I have a busy day.

100
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,027
-Oh, that's all right.
-Sit.

101
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:50,831
I can see we are very much alike,
you and I, Lenny.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,434
We like to get things done.

103
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,837
What's it going to cost me?

104
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,969
First, let me make it clear exactly
how we can help you benefit from this deal.

105
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,339
Without me,
you'd be waiting five to 10 years...

106
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:06,414
...before you got permission
to erect your arena.

107
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,846
Secondly, with British law
as it so stands--

108
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,213
Lenny, how much?

109
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,390
Seven million euros.

110
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:26,195
I expect the guarantee that I have consent
within six months and no red tape.

111
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,666
Oh, you got it.

112
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:28,997
Consider it done.

113
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,502
-Drink?
-Yeah.

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,344
That's a nice painting, Uri.

115
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,813
It's got depth, you know.

116
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,452
That picture has brought me nothing
but luck, Lenny.

117
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,644
It's my lucky picture.

118
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,449
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

119
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:48,983
You like?

120
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,750
Yeah.

121
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:53,195
Take it for a while.

122
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,659
Maybe it will give you luck.

123
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,664
Oh, no, Uri, I-- You know, I couldn't.

124
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,268
We are partners now, I insist.

125
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,836
I will get it sent around to your house.

126
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,372
You can give it back to me
when our deal's finalized.

127
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,668
Hm?

128
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,411
Well, I thought you lot drank vodka.

129
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,879
Whiskey is the new vodka.

130

You're not joining me?

131
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,582

just give me the bottle.

Well, I tell you what, this Communism
didn't slow him down, did it?

I'll tell you what, Arch.

-Oh, bollocks.

There's no school like the old school,

That's why he come to me.

00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,580
Yeah, got it.

You think you should have lent him
your lucky picture?

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,554
Don't spoil it,
we need him at the moment.

156
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,228
I want that consent.

01:37:08,038 --> 01:37:11,235
Look at this, Dave.
Don't you look the part.

1512
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:15,139
Show us your guns, Uncle Arch.
I told the boys all about it.

1513
01:37:15,312 --> 01:37:18,247
Don't be cheeky. Get in the car.

1514
01:37:20,517 --> 01:37:21,711
Give us your money.

1515
01:37:21,885 --> 01:37:24,479
Give us that, in the car.

1516
01:37:33,664 --> 01:37:35,154
Be good boys...

1517
01:37:36,033 --> 01:37:38,831
...because you never know
who's watching.

1518
01:37:45,709 --> 01:37:48,610
So who we got in there, then?
Anyone I know?

1519
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,142
Anyone famous?

1520
01:37:57,254 --> 01:37:59,347
Handsome Bob.

1521
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:03,726
Mumbles, One Two.

1522
01:38:05,295 --> 01:38:09,061
I bet you could operate
a nice gas shower.

1523
01:38:09,233 --> 01:38:11,929
I could see you
with a couple of S's on your collar.

1524
01:38:12,102 --> 01:38:17,005
-Stiff goose in your step.
-Shut it, or you will get hurt.

1525
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:20,533
That, Roman and Mickey,
is the famous Archy slap.

1526
01:38:22,412 --> 01:38:24,277
You shut it.

1527
01:38:24,448 --> 01:38:28,475
Or I'll do you myself,
you poisonous little toad.

1528
01:38:28,852 --> 01:38:32,788
Don't hurt me, Arch. I'm only little.

1529
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,487
Get out.

1530
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:39,527
-Roll them out.
-Daddy.

1531
01:38:40,731 --> 01:38:43,131
Nice wheels.

1532
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,731
Sorry about the painting.

1533
01:38:46,904 --> 01:38:49,998
I needed the cash
for a bit of the old dusty show biz.

1534
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:51,631
So it's gone now.

1535
01:38:51,809 --> 01:38:54,607
Lost to the world
of degenerate, stoned no-hopers.

1536
01:38:54,778 --> 01:38:57,269
Never to be seen again
by the eye of a clean soul.

1537
01:38:59,716 --> 01:39:04,119
What are you, boy, if you are not poison?

1538
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,755
Your dad couldn't even bear
to look at you.

1539
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,130
So no wonder he fucked off
and left me to pick up the pieces.

1540
01:39:14,965 --> 01:39:17,331
But that wasn't enough for you.

1541
01:39:17,501 --> 01:39:20,561
You had to push your mom
into a bottle of pills...

1542
01:39:20,737 --> 01:39:22,602
...and a house full of nutters.

1543
01:39:22,773 --> 01:39:27,836
And all she got there
was a hot bath and a cold razor.

1544
01:39:28,412 --> 01:39:29,936
Why?

1545
01:39:31,415 --> 01:39:34,782
Because you're poison, John, that's why.

1546
01:39:37,254 --> 01:39:38,721
What can I say?

1547
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:42,052
I'm a junkie, crackhead, no-gooder.

1548
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:45,024
You should never have wasted
your money on that school.

1549
01:39:45,195 --> 01:39:46,492
Archy, get him out of here.

1550
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:49,862
I've had enough of him.

1551
01:39:50,033 --> 01:39:52,797
I don't trust myself. Use someone else.

1552
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:57,732
It's a gathering. I love a gathering.

1553
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:01,571
Look. It's Mumbles, One Two.

1554
01:40:02,212 --> 01:40:06,444
Handsome Bob, all the old faces today.

1555
01:40:06,617 --> 01:40:09,677
And it was all going so well.

1556
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:11,910
Except for Archy.

1557
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,818
Had to ruin the day.

1558
01:40:17,694 --> 01:40:19,787
I was gonna tell him
a story about you, Daddy.

1559
01:40:21,164 --> 01:40:24,099
I thought I'd tell him the story
about how you grassed him up.

was it now, Daddy?

1564
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:39,104

it should've been higher.

1565
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,615
-Danny, come here.
JOHNNY: You're only 6 feet away.

1566
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:43,047
Come here.

1567
01:40:45,088 --> 01:40:48,353

1568
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:50,720

01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:11,212
The address is in my jacket.

1575
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:13,815
I wouldn't mess you around, Archy,
it's in my jacket.

1576
01:41:22,492 --> 01:41:24,255
What does it say?

1577
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:36,035
You want to know what it says, Len?

1578
01:41:38,642 --> 01:41:43,909
Funny thing about the law,
it can be quite flexible.

1579
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,911
Because every time an informer...

1580
01:41:47,084 --> 01:41:50,884
...finds himself in front of a judge,
a secret letter--

1581
01:41:51,054 --> 01:41:55,047
--stands witness
as to the cooperation and efficiency--

1582
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:56,590
ARCHY:
<i>--of that informer.</i>

1583
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,196
And if that informer
provides adequate information...

1584
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:05,063
...then that dog of dogs
is magically released.

1585
01:42:05,235 --> 01:42:07,863
A sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.

1586
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:09,767
And it comes with a very good alibi.

1587
01:42:10,674 --> 01:42:13,507
Now, you give us the names
of the people you want put down...

1588
01:42:13,677 --> 01:42:15,577
...and we'll get them the long sentences.

You can appear to reduce those terms
through your contacts.

We'll make you look like a fucking
guardian angel to the underworld.

Trusted throughout.

1592
01:42:25,088 --> 01:42:27,955
The only evidence
that will ever remain of this deal...

1593
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:30,093
...comes in the form
of a very exclusive...

1594
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:33,093
...and hard-to-come-by legal document
called a secret dept.

1595
01:42:33,263 --> 01:42:37,131
As in deposition or handlers sheet.

1596
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:40,499
Of course, the informer
always uses a false name.

1597
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:42,103
What name do you like?

1598
01:42:42,272 --> 01:42:43,569
-Johnny?
-Tommy?

Nothing's gonna happen

They'd have to carry
