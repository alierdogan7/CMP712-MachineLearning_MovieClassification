1
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,500
Hey, Jerry.

2
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,800
You might want to check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

3
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,300
Look like some type of UFO
and it's heading this way.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,900
How many times do i
have to tell you this.

5
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
UFOs don't exist and we
are never gonna see...

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,200
Wow. It's energy
signature is massive.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Holy Jesus, what do we do?
No one ever told us what to do.

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
The only reason I took this job is
cause you don't have to do anything.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Jerry, Stop it! We
calculate its impact point.

10
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,900
Looks like.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
Modesto, California.

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,900
Supenova: this is Red
Dwarf. We actually have one.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,900
Code Nimoy.
I repeat Code Nimoy.

14
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,200
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

15
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,600
Hurry, turn on the TV.
Turn it on now.

16
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,300
...and some early morning
fog giving way to sunny skies.

17
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
75' F.

18
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,400
A perfect day to stop by the old folk
garden craft show down at the fair grounds,

19
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,800
or a perfect day to
marry Susan Murphy.

20
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
I love you baby.

21
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,700
I love you too.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,500
And good morning Modesto...

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>Channel 172</i>

24
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,800
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Thanks, mom.

26
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah, my little girl.

27
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
¡Daddyi!

28
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,900
Now i want you to know that even
though i'm about to give you away...

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,100
I'll always be here
to take care of you.

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Don't cry cause then you're gonna
make me cry and this leaves me a mess.

31
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,500
I can't help me oh.
I can't.

32
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,800
Hello, everyone. Attention attention.
Wedding starts in 30 minutes.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,800
My beautiful daughter in law.

34
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,700
- Hi, mama Dietl.
- It's like a fairy tale.

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,900
The weatherman and
the weatherman's wife.

36
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,900
- Oh, romantic.
- Ah, I know.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Just think... This time
tomorrow I'm gonna be in Paris,

38
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,500
and some day, we won't just be honeymo-
oning there. Derek will become an anchor,

39
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,100
or a foreign correspondant and
we'll travel all over the world.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,100
Oh, honey, my
fingers are crossed.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,300
One thumb is shorter than the
other. It runs in the family.

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
- Derek doesn't have that.
- It skips a generation.

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Your kids are gonna have it.

44
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,400
Wow. You look beautiful!

45
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,400
So do you... I mean,
handsome. I mean...

46
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Sorry, I'm just
a little frazzled.

47
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,600
I just spent way too
much time with our parents.

48
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,900
Don't worry, ok?

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
We'll be alone soon.
Just us.

50
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Hmmm... eating cheese
and baguettes at the Sun.

51
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Feeding each other
chocolate crepes.

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,100
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just that...

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,500
There's been a
slight change of plans.

54
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
We are not going to Paris.

55
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,100
What?

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Why not?

57
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,100
Because we are going
somewhere better.

58
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,500
Better than Paris?

59
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
- Oh, yeah.
- Where?

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,700
- Tahiti?
- Nope!

61
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Fresno.

62
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Fresno!

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,100
Fresno?

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,500
In what universe is... Fresno,
better than Paris, Derek?

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
In the...

66
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,500
I got an audition to become channel
23's new evening anchor universe.

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,300
I got the call from
the general manager.

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,900
He wants me to come
inmediately. Isn't that great?

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Derek.

70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,600
That's...

71
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,500
amazing!

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,400
It's amazing. Fresno is like
the top 50 markets, isn't it?

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Actually it's 55th. But
we are on our way, babe.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
Now look about Paris...

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,700
Oh, it's ok... It's fine.
As long as we are together,

76
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Fresno is the most romantic
city in the whole world.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm so proud of you.

78
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Of us...
Not just of me.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,700
I mean, of course, but we are a
team now. You are so proud of us.

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,900
Now get out of here. It's bad
luck to see me in my dress.

81
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh, come on! You know I
don't believe in that stuff.

82
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
I'll be waiting
for you at the altar.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
The handsome news ancho
in the tux, alright?

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,900
<i>I love you.
There, I said it.</i>

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,300
I love you too.

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Susan!

87
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Where could she be?

88
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,200
Susan!

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Where are you?

90
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Susan. Where've you been?

91
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,400
I think I just go
hit by a meteroid.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Oh, Susan... Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

93
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
My goodness, look at
you. You're all filthy.

94
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Thank God I have wet wipes.

95
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,700
You are... glowing.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Thank you.

97
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,200
No, no Susan, you're like,
really glowing. You're green.

98
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
Oh, no!

99
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,000
Derek.

100
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
No.

101
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,100
What's going on?
What's happening here?

102
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,000
You are all shrinking!

103
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
- Na-ha, you are growing.
- Well, make it stop.

104
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Get me the goverment!

105
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
This is impossible.

106
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
No. This can't be happening.

107
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Wait, wait, everybody.
It's OK.

108
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Have some champagne while
we're figuring this out.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,700
Thumbs! Thumbs!

110
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,000
Derek help me!

111
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Here comes the bride.

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, Carl. It's
her wedding day.

113
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,900
Derek!
Derek!

114
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Hurts. Damm it.

115
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
<i>Hold your fire</i>

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
What's been happening to me?

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Don't panic, don't worry.
Whatever you don, don't drop...

118
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,300
Derek!

119
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,600
<i>Sorry sir</i>

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Who are you people?

121
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
What are you doing?

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,700
Stop it.

123
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Be careful!

124
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Get your hands off me.
Don't you know who I am?

125
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,000
Please. Just leave me alone!

126
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,700
Move it, move it!
Let's go, move it!

127
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Derek!

128
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,000
<i>Let's get this
baby on the bus.</i>

129
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Honey, can you hit the snooze?

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,300
Baby why you set the alarm?

131
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
We are on honeymoon.

132
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,100
Hello?

133
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,300
What's going on?

134
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,900
Hello?

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,100
Quiet. She can hear us.

136
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,300
Hello?

137
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,800
Is there someone in there?

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,100
Could you please
tell me where I am?

139
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,600
What was that?

140
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,900
Hello.

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Eeeewwww!

142
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,900
Would you stop.

143
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,300
Be careful.

144
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Please.
Madam stop...

145
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,400
doing...

146
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,900
that...

147
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,500
Whatever mad
scientist made you,

148
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,800
he really went all out.

149
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,300
You can... talk.

150
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Hi there!

151
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
Argg, my back!

152
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Just kidding.
I don't have a back.

153
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Forgive him, but as you
can see he has no brain.

154
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
Turns out you don't need one.

155
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Totally overated.
As a matter of fact...

156
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,500
I don't even...

157
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100
I forgot how to breath.
I forgot how to breath.

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Help me Dr Cockroach. Help!

159
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
Suck in Bob.

160
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Thanks Doc.
You are a lifesaver.

161
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,500
Wow, look at you. I know
what you are thinking.

162
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,800
First day in prison, you wanna take
out the toughest guy in the yard.

163
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,700
Well, I'd like
to see you try...

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Gosh. What?!
She is speechless.

165
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,600
She?

166
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,100
Yes Bob. We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

167
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,000
No way.
It's a boy.

168
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
Look at his boobies.

169
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,700
- We need to have a talk.
- Gentlemen,

170
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm afraid we are not making
a very good first impression.

171
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,700
At least I'm talking. First new monster
in years we are gonna get like a wolfman,

172
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,100
or mummy, just, you know
somebody to play cards with.

173
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,600
Might we ask
your name, Madam?

174
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,800
Susan.

175
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,200
No, no, no. We mean
like your monster name.

176
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Like what do people scream
when they see you coming?

177
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,100
You know... like:
" Look out. Here comes... "

178
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Susan.

179
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Really?

180
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Suuuusan.

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
I just scared myself.
That is scary.

182
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes! Eat time.

183
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,100
That is repulsive.

184
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Oh, I love slipper!

185
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,300
Oh please God, please
tell me this isn't real.

186
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Please tell me I just had a
nervous breakdown at the wedding,

187
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,400
and now I'm at a mental
hospital and I'm on medication,

188
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,700
and it's giving
me hallucinations.

189
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,900
Don't scare InsectoSaur. He is gonna
pee himself and then we all be in trouble.

190
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,300
Everyone run at the door? There's got
to be a door here. Where is the door?

191
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,800
It's ok, buddy.
Don't worry about it.

192
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Who is a handsome bug?
You like it when I rub your tummy?

193
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Please, somebody.
I don't belong here. Let me out.

194
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Hey, hey. That
is not a good idea.

195
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Let me out!

196
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,200
Monsters. Get
back in your cells.

197
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Oh, thank goodness.
A real person.

198
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,100
You are a real person, right?

199
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Not one of those half-person
half-machine... you know?

200
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
Whatever you
call those things?

201
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,200
- A Cyborg?
- Oh, no!

202
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,500
You are a cyborg?

203
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,300
Madam, I assure you,
I am not a cyborg.

204
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
My name is General
W.R.Monguer.

205
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,100
I'm in charge of this facility. Now
follow me. It's time for your orientation.

206
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
In 1950 it was decided
that Jane and Joe

207
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,400
public can not handle
the truth about monsters,

208
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,900
and should focus in more
important things like paying taxes.

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,900
So the goverment convinced the world
Monsters were stuff of myth and legend,

210
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,000
and the locked them away
in this here facility.

211
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,100
But I'm not a monster.

212
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm just a regular person.

213
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm not a danger to
anyone or anything.

214
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Don't let her get me!

215
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,600
Sorry.

216
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
- How long will I be here?
- Indefinitely.

217
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,500
- Can I contact my parents?
- No.

218
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,500
- Derek?
- Negative

219
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,700
- Do they know where I am?
- No, and they never will.

220
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,700
This place is X file.

221
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,500
Wrapped in a cover-up and
deepfried in a paranoid conspiracy.

222
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,700
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

223
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,200
7, 8...

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,400
899, 1000...

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
I did ten sets.

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Ah, Susan.

227
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,600
You wouldn't happen to
have any uranium on you?

228
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Just need a smidge.

229
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Rescend Dr. Cockrach toybox
privileges inmediately,

230
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,900
We just had the prison's
phycologist redecorate your cell.

231
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
Try to keep you all calm.

232
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,200
But I don't want a poster.

233
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
I want a real kitty,
hanging from a real tree.

234
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,600
I wanna go home.

235
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, come on, please don't cry.
Makes my knees hurt.

236
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Don't think of
this as a prison.

237
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,200
Think of it as hotel you'll never leave
because it's locked from the otherside.

238
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Oh, and one other thing.

239
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,700
The goverment has changed
your name to Ginormica.

240
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,300
<i>Begin re-animation sequence.</i>

241
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Who dares to wake me?

242
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,100
<i>Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the omega quadrant.</i>

243
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
The Omega quadrant?

244
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
Lame.

245
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,600
<i>The trajectory of the Quantonium
meteor has been traced to sector 72-4.</i>

246
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,900
<i>A planet locally
known as Earth.</i>

247
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,100
What a miserable
looking mudball.

248
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Send a robot probe.

249
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme predujice.

250
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,200
I want it all!

251
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Every last drop.

252
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>Yes, Gallahxar.</i>

253
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Nothing can stand
in my way now.

254
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't rush me, Katie.
I'm just... not ready.

255
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,200
Oh, relax, Cuthbert.
it's just like dancing.

256
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Al Lee.

257
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Katie,

258
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,300
I have a gymnastic's meet
tomorrow, so maybe I...

259
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,500
Did you open the haf?

260
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
Thank goodness.
It's the police.

261
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,000
We weren't doing
anything officer.

262
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah. Nothing at all.

263
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Why did I even let
you talk me into this.

264
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,200
Maybe we should
get out of here.

265
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,500
Or maybe we should
go check it out.

266
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Katie are you nuts?

267
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Wait. Don't
leave me alone.

268
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,900
My ankle.

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
I think it's broken.

270
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Katie.

271
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,100
This is the worst date ever.

272
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Katie I'm freaking.

273
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,500
It was first spotted
at midnight last night,

274
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,100
by a couple in
romantic embrace.

275
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,500
No one knows what it
is or where it came from.

276
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,100
All branches of the military
were inmediately move on.

277
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,300
- What is that?
- OK

278
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,500
I have just received word that
the president of the US has arrived,

279
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
and will attempt to
make first contact.

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I must approach it alone.

281
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
This is all about
peaceful communication.

282
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes, Sir Mr. President.

283
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,800
Perimeter stable. Got a
vis on Papa Bear, all clear.

284
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,500
Commander.
Do something violent.

285
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,400
You heard the president.
Light them up.

286
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,200
Problem down here. Call in air
support. Call in air support.

287
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,600
Call in... hmmm.
Call in a full retreat.

288
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Full retreat, full
retreat. All troops.

289
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,500
Papa Bear is on the move.

290
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,500
No, wait

291
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,900
So that's how
you wanna play it?

292
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Eat lead alien.

293
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
- Evidently they eat lead.
- Get him on the chopper.

294
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm brave. I'm a
brave president.

295
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
...own approved goverment.

296
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,400
This right here has only
have about two weeks left.

297
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,200
If that think walks into a populated
area there will be a major catastrophe.

298
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,400
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone.

299
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
If we transport the
US to a safer planet...

300
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,000
I say we give this alien a green card
and make him proud to be an American.

301
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,700
Sir thy times like this when I stop
and ask myself: What would Oprah do?

302
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,500
Hang it all.
What's the point?

303
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,700
It's a disaster.

304
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,600
- Stop sir.
- Don't do it Stop, no!

305
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
That button lauches all
of our nuclear missiles.

306
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Well then, which
button gets me a latte?

307
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,400
Ahh... That would
be the other one, Sir.

308
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,500
What idiot
designed this thing?

309
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,400
<i>You did, Sir.</i>

310
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,900
Fair enough.
Wilson, fire somebody.

311
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,400
Listen up!

312
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not going to go down in history
as the president who was in his office

313
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,300
when the world came to an end. So somebody
think of something and think of it fast.

314
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,100
That's a good Capu-ccio.

315
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,600
<i>Mr. President.</i>

316
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,800
Not only do I have an
idea but I have a plan

317
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
Now conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

318
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,500
and we all know
nukes ain't an option.

319
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,600
- Sure they are. Press..
- No, no, no the button, wait!

320
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President.
These are dark times.

321
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,500
The odds are against us.

322
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
We need a Hail Mary pass.
We need raw power. We need...

323
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,200
<b>Monsters.</b>

324
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Monsters!
Of course...

325
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
It's so simple.

326
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,700
I... I'm not following you.

327
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,300
Over the last 50 years I
have captured monsters on the

328
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,300
rampage and locked them up
in a secret prison facility.

329
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,300
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

330
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,900
Is he referring
to area fifty...

331
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,800
Mr. President, say
hello to Insecta-Saur.

332
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,400
Miss Ronson please.

333
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,700
Nuclear radiation, turned
him from a small grub,

334
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,500
into a 350 foot tall monster,
that attacked Tokyo.

335
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,400
Here we have " The Missing Link ".

336
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,200
A 20.000 years
old frozen fishman,

337
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,700
who was spot out
by scientists.

338
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,900
He escaped... Went on a rampage
in his old watering hall.

339
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,400
This handsome fellow
is Dr. Cockroach Ph. D.

340
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,800
The most brilliant
man in the world.

341
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,600
He invented a scientific
machine that would give humans,

342
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,800
the cockroache's
ability to survive.

343
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,600
Unfortunately there
was a side effect.

344
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,000
Now, we call this thing BOB.

345
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Could someone get
her out of here?

346
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,200
Thank you.

347
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,600
A genetically altered tomato
was combined with a chemically,

348
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,500
altered ranch-flavor dessert
topping at a snack food plant.

349
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,700
The resulting goo gained consciousness and
became an indistructible gelatinous mass.

350
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,200
And our latest
addition, Ginormica.

351
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,900
General, continue.

352
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Her entire body radiates with pure energy
giving her enormous strength and size.

353
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Sir, these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot.

354
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Don't we already have
an Alien problem, General.

355
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,200
I don't think we need
a monster problem too.

356
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,300
You got a better idea nerd?

357
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,300
Ok. Stay where you are.

358
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,400
General, I propose we go forward with
your monsters vs aliens idea. Thank you.

359
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
<i>Go fish.</i>

360
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Do... you... have... any...

361
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
three's?

362
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Yes, I do. How are you doing this?
You are the luckiest guy I know.

363
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,300
Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

364
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
What the...?
Hey.

365
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,200
They called me crazy,

366
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,100
but I'll show them.
I'll show them all.

367
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,300
Dr, I'd prefer you didn't
do your mad scientist,

368
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
laugh while I'm hooked
up to this machine.

369
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,700
You're right Insecto.

370
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,100
You've been letting that crack
experiment on you for over a month.

371
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm not a crack.
I'm a mad scientist.

372
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,600
There's a difference.

373
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,000
Guys. What choice do I have?

374
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,900
If he can make me normal or
even 6'8", I can get out of here.

375
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,000
Get back to the life,
I'm supposed to have.

376
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,400
- I mean, I should be...
- Let me guess: Fresno?

377
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,900
Well, Fresno is
just a steppin stone.

378
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,000
Next stop: Milwaukee, and then
New York and then someday hopefully...

379
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Yeah, we know: Paris.

380
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Throw the switch, Dr.
But don't do the laugh.

381
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,300
Now, you'll feel a
slight pinch in the brain.

382
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Sorry.

383
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Susan!
Yuuhuu!

384
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Am I small again?

385
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm afraid not my dear.

386
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,200
In fact,

387
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,100
You may actually have
grown a couple of feet.

388
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,600
It's ok, Doc. We'll
try again tomorrow.

389
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
You really don't
get it. Do you?

390
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,600
No monster has ever
gotten out of here.

391
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,500
That's not true.
The invisible man did.

392
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,200
No he didn't. We just told you
that so you wouldn't get upset.

393
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,300
He died of a heart
attack 25 years ago.

394
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,800
Nooo!

395
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,100
Yeah.

396
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,600
In that very chair.

397
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,700
He still there?

398
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
You see what I'm saying? Nobody is
leaving, nobody is ever getting out.

399
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>Good news, monsters.
You are getting out.</i>

400
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,000
Until today.

401
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,500
So let me get this
straigh Monguer.

402
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,200
You want us to
fight an alien robot,

403
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,800
And in exchange, the president of the US
has authorized me to grant you your freedom.

404
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Ah! I can't believe it!

405
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Soon I'll be back in
Derek's arms or him in mine.

406
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,900
I can't wait for Spring Break
back at Cocoa Beach just...

407
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,100
freaking everybody out.

408
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,600
And I'll go back to my lab and
finally finish my experiments.

409
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,700
No, no.
That's me, Bob.

410
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Then I'll be a...
really giant lady.

411
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,200
That's Susan, Bob.

412
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Fine, then I'll go back to
Modesto and be with Derek.

413
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
Yeay... that is
still Susan, Bob.

414
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,000
I think I at least deserve
a chance to be with Derek.

415
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
All right. Let's go.

416
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Everybody move in an orderly
fashion. This is an emergency.

417
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,400
We are evacuating the city. Exact
change is appreciated, but not necessary.

418
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Let's move out!

419
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
This is San Francisco!
This ins't far from my home.

420
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,900
Feel the wind on your
antennas. Isn't this wonderful?

421
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,100
I haven't been outside in 50
years. It's amazing out here.

422
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,200
It's a little hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

423
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
That'd be great to know that,
it'd be a very convinient truth.

424
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Now, that'a a robot!

425
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,300
It's huge.

426
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,500
Try not to damage it too much, Monsters.
I may want to bring it back to the farm.

427
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,000
No, no, wait. You didn't say
anything about it being huge.

428
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Wait.
No, don't leave.

429
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,200
I think he sees us.

430
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,500
Hello, hey!
How are you doing?

431
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,200
Welcome. We are
here to destroy you.

432
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
I can't fight that
thing. I can't even...

433
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I... I'm hyperventilating.

434
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Does anybody have
a giant paper bag?

435
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
Relax.

436
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Old Link got this
under control.

437
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,500
Hide in the city Susan,
you'll be safe there.

438
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,600
But stay away from the
Tenderloin. Gets a little daze.

439
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,600
Finally, some action. I'm gonna
turn that oversized tin can into a...

440
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,000
...really dented oversize tin can.

441
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,500
OK. Does anybody have
a 20 on Insect-a-Saur's?

442
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,000
Wow, would you look
at the size of that?

443
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,400
I got it, you guys I got...

444
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,700
Don't worry, I won't let go.
I'm wearing it down...

445
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
He's slowing down.

446
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Get to the city, Link. I'll catch
up with you as soon as I can.

447
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,100
Or maybe... You'll
have to catch up with me.

448
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,200
No! No!

449
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,100
OK, ok I got this.

450
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
Yeap. That hurt.

451
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,100
Get in.
I have a plan.

452
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,800
Hot dogs!

453
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,600
All right, Link. I'm going to
pull up alongside it. You get

454
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,200
up in there, get into its
central processing unit and...

455
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Hey, guys.
Catch me!

456
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,300
Let's go, let's
go, keep it moving.

457
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Hey, no honking.

458
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,600
Excuse me, moving out.

459
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
on your right...
no control.

460
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,200
Oh, no.

461
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,600
OK. It's gonna be OK.

462
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,000
Look, I'm gonna get you out
of there. Hold on a second.

463
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,600
You have to get off
the bridge before...

464
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
Help!

465
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
No, no, no!

466
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,600
Get away from me!

467
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,200
Coming through.
Watch it.

468
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,200
Hey, furrball.
Where've you been?

469
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah, I know. Papa is
a little out of shape.

470
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Excuse me, he is trying to kill me.
Why is he doing that, why...?

471
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,500
Wow.

472
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,000
Wow!
You are doing great!

473
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
I'm doing everything!

474
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down.

475
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,300
A deflector shield.
Typical.

476
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,000
You can't crush a cockroach.

477
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Right, right, right.
Here we go.

478
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,900
Insect-a-Saurus.

479
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,900
Insect-a-Saurus.

480
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,000
- BOB!
- What?

481
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Help me!

482
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,500
Sorry, I was just staring
at this bird over there.

483
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,800
We have to get these
people off the bridge.

484
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,500
Got it.

485
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,400
No, Bob.
Move the conveyors.

486
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, yes, you're right.
My bad

487
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,800
Go, go go, go.

488
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,800
Link!

489
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh, I don't feel good.

490
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,700
Ok. Susan, you can do this.

491
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,300
All right. Let's
take this thing down.

492
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,500
Retreival has failed.

493
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,500
Don't get upset.
It happens to everyone.

494
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:03,000
That lower life form. Thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?

495
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,700
Send another probe at once!

496
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,100
Quantonium can not
be retrieved via robot.

497
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,100
Carbon-based life form, locally
known as Susan is now too strong.

498
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,100
Oh, you think because you
are all big and strong...

499
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,500
...and you can destroy my robot probe that
you're gonna send me running and hiding?

500
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,900
My days of running
and hiding are over.

501
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Computer, set the course to Earth.
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself.

502
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,900
Even if I need to rip it out
of her body one cell at a time.

503
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,400
Be careful.
It's hot.

504
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,600
3 weeks ago, if you
would've asked me to defeat

505
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,400
a giant alien robot, I
would've said: No, can't do.

506
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,600
But I did it! Me! I'm so buzzing.
I mean, did you see how strong I was?

507
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,200
There probably isn't a jar
in this world I can't open.

508
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
You were possitively
heroic my Dear.

509
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,500
I specially loved how you saved
all those people on the bridge.

510
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,700
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

511
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

512
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Poor Link. After all that tough
talk you were out a monster by a girl.

513
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,700
No wonder why
you are drepressed.

514
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,500
Hey, I'm not
depressed. I'm tired.

515
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Why are you tired?
You didn't do anything.

516
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,600
Well, I haven't been sleeping
well, alright? I get sleepne-apness.

517
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,700
Apne... apnea...
Whatever. It's not fun.

518
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,400
So Link is a little rusty.
I mean, sleep deprived.

519
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,600
You'll be back to your old
self in no time. And so will I.

520
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,800
What happened to the "There isn't a
jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

521
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,600
Wait. Did you find a jar you
can't open? What was in it?

522
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,100
Was it pickles in it? Where's
the gigant jar of pickles?

523
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,800
What my associate is
trying to say is that

524
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:06,300
we all think the new
Susan is the cat's me-wow.

525
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,300
I'm sorry.

526
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,600
Thanks you guys.
That is so sweet.

527
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,000
But I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

528
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,700
So tell me exactly how this normal life
thing works with you being giant and all.

529
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm not gonna be
a giant forever.

530
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Derek won't rest, until
we find a cure for my...

531
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,900
...condition.
We're a team.

532
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,000
We can all do with a Derek. Perhaps
some day we can make his acquaintance.

533
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,700
Really?

534
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
You guys want meet Derek?

535
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
First stop: Modesto.

536
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,200
Ginormica. I called your family
to let them know you coming home.

537
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,100
Now I also called the Modesto
PD, told them not to shoot at you.

538
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,300
Thanks, General.

539
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Ok, remember. These people aren't
used to seeing anything like...

540
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,400
You, or you... or you...

541
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:27,200
So just be... you know, cool.
Just be, you know? Follow my lead.

542
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:39,000
Stop. That was an accident!
Don't destroy anything.

543
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,100
Susan?

544
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,400
Susie?

545
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,200
Mom? Daddy?

546
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,900
Did they experiment on you?

547
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
No, mom.
I'm fine.

548
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,600
It's ok.
They are with me.

549
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,300
These are my new friends.

550
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,100
Oh, Derek.
I missed you so much.

551
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,900
Think of that. We'd
be together again.

552
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,900
Just let hope i will not go again
to prison. I love you. I love this man.

553
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
No, BOB.
That's my mother.

554
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,700
You're sofocating her!

555
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,200
Honey.
Are you allright?

556
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,700
I taste ham.

557
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,600
Sorry, mom.
He is just a hugger.

558
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,500
Where's Derek?

559
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,900
He is at work, swetie.

560
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,100
You know, how he
is about his career.

561
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,600
Well, we are not gonna
celebrate without him.

562
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Susan. What do I do with
all your little friends?

563
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,300
Just put out some snacks.
They'll eat anything.

564
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,100
Oh, ambrosia!

565
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,800
How is it going?

566
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,900
Impressive girlfriend.

567
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,700
Way to cut up XXX Insecto.

568
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,900
Who wants to go for
a swimm with The Link?

569
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,200
Hi, I'm Benzoate
Ostylezene Bicarbonate.

570
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,100
Or you can call me BOB.
Whichever is easier.

571
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Do I come on too strong?
I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty.

572
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,800
I've been in prison my whole life.
Why I mentioned prison?

573
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,400
Oh, I didn't mean to
scare you. I'm just gonna go.

574
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,400
Ah, I feel so stupid.

575
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Everyone just stay calm. Whatever
you do, do not provoke them.

576
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,200
Anyone cares for atomic gin fizz?
It's got quite a...

577
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,600
Kick.

578
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,200
Clorine, clorine.
Clorine in my eyes.

579
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,200
Everyone, run for your lives!

580
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,800
What are they
running away from?

581
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,200
...that's hilarious, Jim.

582
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,800
That's exactly the kind down home country
humor I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

583
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,000
This is Derek Dietl. Signing
off for the very last time.

584
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Good night... Modesto!

585
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,300
<i>Channel 172</i>

586
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
<i>And... Cut!</i>

587
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,300
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

588
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,100
Oh, my goodness!

589
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,300
Wait, wait, wa... it!

590
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,900
Oh, Derek!

591
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,600
You wouldn't believe my last 3
weeks. Just wouldn't believe it.

592
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,400
Thinking about you was the
only thing that kept me sane.

593
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,300
Can't breath!

594
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,800
Oh, my gosh.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry

595
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,300
Oh my god.
Is that better?

596
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
OK. OK.

597
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm just still can of getting
used to my new strength.

598
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,600
Wow, you really are big.

599
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still
the same girl you fell in love with.

600
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,200
Except you... Did just destroyed
the Golden Gate bridge.

601
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,100
Well, that was the only way I
was gonna stop that giant robot.

602
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,500
Did you ever think I could
do something like that?

603
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,800
No, I didn't.

604
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,500
I can honestly say that it never ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever ever occurred to me.

605
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
I know this is
a little weird...

606
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,700
Ok, it's a lot weird.
But we'll figure it out.

607
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,600
I know that together we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

608
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,300
Susan, try to look at
this from my perspective.

609
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,800
I have an audience that
depends on me for news,

610
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,000
weather, sports and
heartwarming fluff pieces.

611
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,500
So you expect me to put
all that on hold while

612
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,900
you try to undo this
thing that happened to you?

613
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,500
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

614
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,700
Yes.

615
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,500
That's exactly what I expect.

616
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,500
What about the life that we always
talked about? Don't you still want that?

617
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,500
Of course.
I just...

618
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,100
Don't see how I can
have that with your.

619
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,200
Derek please...

620
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Don't do this.

621
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,400
You have to face facts Susan.

622
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,700
And don't crush me for saying
this, but I'm not looking to get

623
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,300
married and spend the rest of
my life in someone else's shadow.

624
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,500
And you're casting
a pretty big shadow.

625
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm sorry.

626
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,100
It's over.

627
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,800
Good luck Susan.

628
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,800
<i>Leaving Modesto
Come Again</i>

629
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,000
Wow, what a shindig!

630
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,400
Your parents really
know how to throw it down.

631
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,300
That was a... great party. One of the best
I've been to, since I got out of prison.

632
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,100
I must have been at
a different party,

633
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,800
cause that's not how I
interpreted it at all.

634
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,500
I don't think your
parents liked me,

635
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,300
and I think that Jello
gave me a fake phone number.

636
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, at least the
garbage was free and...

637
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,400
Who are we kidding?

638
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,400
We could save every city
on the planet and they'd

639
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,500
still treat us the same way
they've always treated us.

640
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,300
Like monsters.

641
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,600
Right, monsters.

642
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Anyway.
How... How is Derek?

643
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,000
Derek... is a selfish jerk.

644
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,900
- No!
- Yes!

645
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,400
All that talk about "us",

646
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,000
I'm so proud of "us".
"Us just got a job in Fresno.

647
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,000
It was no "us".
It was only Derek.

648
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,100
Why did I have to get hit
by a meteor to see that?

649
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,700
Idiot!

650
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,100
Why did I ever think life with
Derek would be so great anyway.

651
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,900
I mean, look at all the
stuff I've done without him.

652
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,200
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

653
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,100
And that was amazing.

654
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,600
Meeting you guys.
Amazing.

655
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,800
Dr. Cockroach. You can
crawl up walls and...

656
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,800
build a supercomputer out of a pizza box,
two cans of hair spray and..

657
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,300
And a paper clip.

658
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,300
Amazing!

659
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,400
And you, you hardly need an
introduction. You are the Missing Link!

660
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
You personally carried 250
coeds off Cocoa Beach and

661
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
still have the strength
to fight the national guard.

662
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,900
And the Coast Guard,
and also the Life Guard.

663
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,800
Amazing.

664
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,300
Bob, who else could fall from unimaginable
heights and end up without a single scratch?

665
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Link?

666
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,400
You!

667
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,800
Amazing!

668
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,400
Point Insecto. Susan,
don't shortchange yourself.

669
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, I'm not gonna shortchange
myself... ever again.

670
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,600
Susan!

671
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,000
Way to go Insecto!

672
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,600
Insecto look out!

673
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,800
Insect-a-Saurus.
Nooo!

674
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,800
It's gonna be alright.
Look at me.

675
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,400
Don't you close those eyes.

676
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,700
Don't you dare
close those eyes.

677
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,900
You can't...

678
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,200
Mom?

679
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,300
You must be terrified.

680
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,900
You wake up in a strange
place, wearing strange clothes.

681
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:28,200
Imprisioned by a strange being,
floating on a strange hovering device.

682
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,400
Strange. Isn't it?

683
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,400
Hardly,

684
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
it's not the first time.

685
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,000
Wow. You really get around.

686
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,100
To the extraction chamber.

687
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Look, what is that
you want from me?

688
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,300
You have stolen what
is rightfully mine.

689
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,300
I didn't steal
anything from you.

690
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,300
Your enormous grotesque
body, contains Quantonium.

691
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,300
The most powerful
substance in the universe.

692
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,200
Did you really think you
could keep it from me?

693
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,400
That's, what this is
all about? You destroyed

694
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,500
San Francisco. You terrified
millions of people...

695
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,700
You killed my friend,
just to get to me?

696
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,900
Silence.

697
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,700
Your voice is
grinding on my ear nobs.

698
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,600
It's a shame you won't be around to
see what the power of Quantonium can do,

699
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,800
in the tentacles of someone
who knows how to use it.

700
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,500
I know how to use it.
Just...

701
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Don't bother. That force
field is impenetrable...

702
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,000
What the flagnog!

703
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,700
Ha! That should
stop your puny...

704
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,000
Computer. Close door hangar 2.

705
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Close door hangar 3.

706
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,400
Close the 4.

707
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,100
Close them all!

708
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,800
Computer.
Begin extraction.

709
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:38,000
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

710
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,700
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

711
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,300
Your planet, perhaps?

712
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,200
You keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet.

713
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,900
If you wanted to stop me, you should've
done it when you possessed the Quantonium.

714
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,500
Now you are nothing.

715
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,300
There innocent people down
there, who didn't do anything.

716
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,600
There were innocent people on my
home planet, before it was destroyed.

717
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,300
Look, I'm sorry your
planet was destroyed.

718
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,800
Oh, don't be. I'm the
one who destroyed it.

719
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,900
Confused?

720
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:16,100
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

721
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,700
Computer... initialize
cloning machine.

722
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,800
<i>Yes Gallahxar</i>

723
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,300
Many zentons ago,
when I was but a squid

724
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,600
I found out my parents were...

725
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,400
No child should ever
have to endure that.

726
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,300
So I went on the
road, with a giant...

727
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,500
And soon thereafter
was married.

728
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,900
Things were going well,
until she wanted to...

729
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,500
and then I was all: "no way" and she
was all: "yes way" and I was like...

730
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,000
But I've told you
too much already.

731
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,300
Let the birth of my
new planet now called,

732
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,800
<b>Gallahxar's Planet begin!</b>

733
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,800
<i>Once again, an UFO
has landed in America.</i>

734
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,200
<i>The only country UFOs
ever seem to land in.</i>

735
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:45,600
<i>Excuse me... What's
that handsome? Okey-dokey.</i>

736
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:52,700
<i>We now take you live to a transmission
from the alien's spacecraft.</i>

737
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
<i>Humans of Earth</i>

738
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,500
<i>I have come in peace.
You need not fear me.</i>

739
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,200
<i>I mean you no harm.</i>

740
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,300
<i>However, it's important to note most of
you will not survive the next 24 hours.</i>

741
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,700
<i>Though those of you who do survive,
will be in slave and experimented.</i>

742
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,200
<i>You shouldn't take any of this
personally, it's just business.</i>

743
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,400
<i>So, just to recap:</i>

744
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,100
<i>I come in peace. I mean you
no harm and you all will die.</i>

745
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,700
<i>Gallahxar's out.</i>

746
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:37,100
Ok. Boys, set the terror level at code
brown cause I need to change my pants.

747
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,900
What are we gonna do now Doc?

748
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,300
I don't know.

749
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,400
I'll tell you what
we are gonna do.

750
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,400
We are not gonna let
Insecto die in vain.

751
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:07,100
We are gonna get up there, find Susan
and we're gonna take that alien down.

752
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,800
Alright gentlemen. You
got enough juice in those

753
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,100
jetpacks to get up there, but
not enough to make it home.

754
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,200
I'll come get ya if I can.
If I don't, it means I'm death.

755
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,700
Or late.

756
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,100
I've been your guardian
for close to 50 years.

757
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,900
That's no longer the case.

758
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,700
For what it's worth.

759
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,100
That's rude.
What do we do?

760
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:39,400
No, Bob, that's not rude.
That's a sign of respect.

761
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,600
General, it's targeting us.

762
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,600
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

763
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,200
Steady, steady.

764
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,900
Hard right, hard right.
Hard right!

765
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,100
Can't shake it.
I can't shake it.

766
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,900
Hang on to your socks.
We are going for a ride.

767
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,700
That's why I always wear
a parachute, Lieutenant.

768
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,500
You can let go of
me now Lieutenant.

769
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:10,600
- Who are you signaling? Here.
- Hey, zip it.

770
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,900
Hail, Gallahxar.

771
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,100
No, no, not all
of you. You, there.

772
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,100
How do I do this?

773
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,100
Three back. No, no, no.
That guy, next to you.

774
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,700
The one I'm pointing at.

775
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,700
You the one...
You clon. Yes, good.

776
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,600
Take the prisoner
to the incinerator.

777
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,100
She is useless to us now.

778
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,200
- Hail, Gallahxar.
- Hail me.

779
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,000
Ginormica ain't so...

780
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,700
Ginormic any more.

781
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,300
How are we supposed to get to her?
There's too many of them.

782
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,900
It's impossible.

783
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,600
I may not have a brain,
gentlemen. But I have an idea.

784
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,900
This is not gonna work.

785
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,200
Halt!

786
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,500
I...

787
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:49,000
Gallahxar, command you to hand
over the prisoner this instant.

788
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,800
Clearly you are
defective beyond repair.

789
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,100
Guards, take this defective
clon to the incinerator.

790
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Well, what are you
waiting for? You and you!

791
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,500
What, seriously?

792
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:09,000
Yes. Take the prisoner and the
defective clon to the incinerator.

793
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Ah, of course, Sir.

794
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,500
And here's the security pass,
just in case.

795
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,500
- Would you like a gun?
- Yes I would.

796
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,100
Hey, guys, look.

797
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,000
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

798
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,500
Don't mention it. We monsters
got to stick together.

799
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,500
But I'm not a monster
anymore. I'm just... me.

800
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:41,000
My dear, no matter what
your size, you'll always be...

801
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,700
Nothing, but a filthy
carbon based lifeform.

802
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,600
Hail, Gallahxar.

803
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
These disguises are the bomb!

804
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,100
That's it.
Follow me.

805
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,100
The only way to save the...
- Hail Gallaxhar. - Hail Gallahxar.

806
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,500
The only way to save... - Hail Gallaxhar.
- Hail Gallahxar.

807
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,500
The only way to save the earth, is to
blow up this ship before the invasion.

808
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,400
Hail Gallaxhar.

809
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,800
Hail Gallahxar. Before
the invasion starts.

810
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,400
- So, how are we gonna do this?
- We need to find the main power core.

811
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Excuse me, could you direct
usr to the main power core?

812
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,400
Gladly, it's right there.
Above the extraction chamber.

813
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,600
Thank you very much.
Hail Gallaxhar

814
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,400
- Watch out!
- Wow, look out brainless.

815
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,900
Give me that thing.

816
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,200
Weapon like this, needs to be in
the hands of somebody responsable.

817
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,600
What?

818
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,800
Hail, Galaxar?

819
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,400
<i>- Monsters
- Monsters.</i>

820
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,200
Monsters?

821
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,200
Attention. All aliens,
destroy all monsters.

822
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,800
You want some of this?

823
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,400
You wanna hurt my friend.
You'll have to go through me.

824
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,300
Oh, yeah.

825
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,800
Looks like we made it.

826
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,200
- OMG.
- Good morning, intruder.

827
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,200
<i>You'll never figure
out my color code.</i>

828
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,200
A hexadecimal colorcode system.
This won't be, but a moment.

829
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,900
Red, green, blue, yellow, orange, baby
blue, purple, pink, brown, mocca, avocado...

830
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
Doc, come on! Dance.

831
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,600
<i>Your bustied tired dance moves are
no match for my security protocols.</i>

832
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,200
We can't hold them
off much longer.

833
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,800
One thing you don't
know about me, my dear.

834
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:55,400
My... Ph. D... is in... dance.

835
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,800
<i>Security protocol breached</i>

836
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,900
<i>Ship has been set
to self-destruct</i>

837
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:07,700
<i>Total annihilation
in T minus 6 minutes</i>

838
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,500
<i>- What? Launch the invasion then.
- Invasion no longer possible.</i>

839
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:19,100
Oh, Space? Divert the Quantonium to
the bridge and prepare my escape capsule.

840
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,800
Look at that. They're all
running scared. Monsters win.

841
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,100
I don't think that's
why they're running.

842
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,600
<i>Ship will self desturct
in T minus 5 minutes</i>

843
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,900
Hail Gallahxar.

844
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,100
We are not gonna make it.

845
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,900
Hang on.

846
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,200
That's no use.
It won't budge.

847
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,600
If I was still Ginormica,
I could do this.

848
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,200
Susan. Get out of here while
you still got the chance.

849
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,600
No, don't say that.
I'm not leaving you guys.

850
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:34,100
Yes you are. Wonder if with Monguer.
He is outside the ship, waiting for you.

851
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,600
Go, while there's still time.

852
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,500
<i>Ship will self destruct
in T minus 4 minutes</i>

853
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,500
Don't you worry about us, Susan. You finally
have the chance to get your old life back.

854
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,900
I don't want my old life back.

855
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
They think they stopped me?
They stopped nothing!

856
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,500
<i>Female carbon based lifeform
or "Susan" not contained</i>

857
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,800
Attention robot probes.
Crash the earthling.

858
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,700
<i>Robot bay has been destroyed</i>

859
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,400
Fire phaseoid's cannon.

860
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,000
Are you crazy?
You could've killed me!

861
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,900
Then we understand each other.

862
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,500
Now, open the doors
and let my friends go.

863
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,000
Or what?

864
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,400
You don't actually think you
are a match for me, do you?

865
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,800
<i>Quantonium has been
successfully diverted to bridge</i>

866
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,100
<i>Escape capsule,
ready for transport</i>

867
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:44,000
Like I told you before. You should've
defeated me when you had the Quantonium.

868
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,100
Have fun exploding.

869
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,600
Now, open the doors!

870
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,100
Even if I wanted to I couldn't.

871
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,500
That's what happens when you
set the ship to self-destruct.

872
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,300
Now we're all gonna die.

873
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,600
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

874
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,500
Susan...

875
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
I wouldn't be so sure.

876
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,600
And the name is Ginormica.

877
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,900
<i>Annihilation in
T minus 1 minute</i>

878
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,400
- It's been an honor knowing you, Doc.
- The feeling is mutual, my friend.

879
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,200
I'll see you guys
tomorrow. For lunch.

880
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,300
- That's right, Bob.
- There'll be candy, cake, balloons.

881
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,500
Cake and balloons for lunch?

882
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,900
It's got to be the best
day ever. I love you guys.

883
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,600
<i>Total annihilation

884
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,600
Where's Monguer?

885
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,100
He's supposed to be here.

886
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:55,200
He said the only reason he
wouldn't be here is if he was dead.

887
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,900
Or late.

888
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,700
Insect-a-Saurus.
You're alive!

889
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,500
And you're a butterfly.

890
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:21,800
8, 7, 6, 5, 4

891
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,600
<i>- 3, 2, 1
- Come on, come on.</i>

892
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,900
<i>Hmm, nothing happened.
Maybe my count...</i>

893
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,600
Oh, great.

894
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,300
Oh, boy!

895
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,100
Susie?

896
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,700
- Daddy!
- Oh, Susan.

897
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:16,300
Ever since you were a
baby I knew that some day,

898
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,600
you would, you know, save the Earth
from an invasion from outer space.

899
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,700
Thank you, but it
wasn't just me, mom.

900
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,800
Excuse me. Hello. Coming
through. How are you?

901
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,200
Susan!

902
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,600
Derek?

903
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,900
Baby, I thought long and hard
about what happened between us.

904
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,400
And I want you to
know, I forgive you.

905
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,200
You forgive me?

906
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,900
Of course. It wasn't your
fault you got hit by a

907
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,600
meteor and ruined everything.
And you know what?

908
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,900
I say maybe you
didn't ruin everything.

909
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:52,000
I just got a call from New York.
They offered me network.

910
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,200
All I have to do is get an
exclusive interview from you.

911
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,500
Really?

912
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,300
Yeah, I get my dream job
and you get your dream guy.

913
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,000
It's a win-win for team Dietl.

914
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:08,100
Derek, that's amazing.

915
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,600
Is the camera rolling?

916
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,800
Absolutely...

917
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,300
Good. Because I wouldn't want
your fans out there to miss this.

918
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,600
This is Susan Murhpy saying...

919
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,500
Goood byeee Derek!

920
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,000
Bob, could you...?

921
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,400
Derek, you are a selfish
jerk. And guess what?

922
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:40,300
I've met someone else.
She's lime green.

923
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,400
She has 14 little chunks of
pineapple inside of her.

924
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,600
And she is everything,
I deserve in life.

925
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,300
I'm happy now, Derek,
without you. It's over.

926
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,800
Monsters!

927
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,500
I'm so proud of you I could cry, if
I hadn't lost my tear in the war.

928
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,700
But not crying, will have to wait.
The world needs you again.

929
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,200
What is it, General?

930
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,400
Seems a snail fell into
a French nuclear reactorl

931
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:15,900
As we speak, Scargetua is
slowly making its way to Paris.

932
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:19,100
Well, I've always
wanted to go to Paris.

933
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,800
Now, who's with me?

934
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,100
What do you say
Butter-Fly-Sauros?

935
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
We're in.

936
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,800
- I'm in!
- Count me in, too.

937
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,600
Aurvoir, sweetie.
Have a safe flight.

938
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,700
Yeah.
And hang on.

939
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,700
Goodbye, Derek.
Good luck getting over me.

940
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,500
Ahh, Bob. It's me,
he's never gonna get over.

941
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,600
Wait, wait, wait.
You were dating Derek too?

942
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,900
That two-timing jerk!
