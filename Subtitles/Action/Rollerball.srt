<i>The first team</i>

39

- <i>... Jonathan E.</i>
- Go on! Go on!

43
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,760
Watch him!

44
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:50,896
<i>Jonathan E holds the ball aloft.</i>
<i>You must hold it in plain view at all times.</i>

45
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:54,862
- Pick 'em up, pick 'em up!
- I got it, I got it.

46
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,653
On your right!

47
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:03,201
<i>Jonathan moves in behind</i>

48
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,376
<i>Jonathan moves up the track</i>
<i>and up onto the side.</i>

49
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,465
<i>Here comes Sanchez.</i>
<i>Sanchez grabs Jonathan...</i>

50
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:13,431
<i>... but off the rail comes Moonpie</i>
<i>and takes out four Madrid men.</i>

51
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,018
<i>The old swooper Moonpie...</i>

52
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:20,018
<i>... came right off the top of the rail</i>
<i>and took out four Madrid men.</i>

53
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:25,159
<i>The remaining Madrid skaters</i>
<i>defend the front of the goal.</i>

54
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,663
<i>Jonathan still has the ball.</i>

55
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,791
<i>Moving in, he'll try to shoot.</i>
<i>He does! Jonathan!</i>

56
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,793
<i>He shoots, and it's just wide.</i>

57
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,085
Regroup!

58
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,375
<i>The Houston team will have to regroup.</i>

59
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,640
<i>Injured on the play is Belmonte</i>
<i>and he's helped off the track for Madrid.</i>

60
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:43,386
<i>First period, no score, as we get set</i>
<i>for the firing of the second ball.</i>

61
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,652
<i>Oh, and he misses</i>
<i>and it hits the bike of Carter.</i>

62
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,829
<i>Knocks Carter down.</i>

63
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:59,416
Gimme a hand. Move out!

64
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:17,942
<i>Jonathan is there. It is handed off.</i>
<i>The pass is complete to Jonathan.</i>

65
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,318
<i>(chanting)</i>

66
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,086
<i>He skates by and knocks him down dead!</i>

67
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,377
Did you see that?

68
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:33,426
<i>That should be a penalty.</i>
<i>The official looking over.</i>

69
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,761
<i>Moonpie skates by as if nothing happened.</i>

70
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,469
Keep up!

71
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:40,687
- Moon, on your left, on your left.
- Right, right!

72
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,307
- Take him out!
- I got him.

73
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,782
Break it up, break it up!

74
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,821
Go, Jonathan, go!

75
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,662
<i>Can he give Houston</i>
<i>the first goal of the game?</i>

76
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,166
- <i>He shoots, he scores!</i>
- Yeah!

77
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,050
<i>And at the end of the first period...</i>

78
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:03,926
<i>... Jonathan's goal gives Houston</i>
<i>a 1-0 lead over Madrid.</i>

79
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:10,394
(announcer #2) <i>Scored by Jonathan E!</i>
<i>The time - first period, 12 minutes.</i>

81
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,075
(RD) <i>The ball is fired</i>
<i>for the start of the second period.</i>

82
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,077
<i>Madrid, trailing by one goal...</i>

83
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:23,410
<i>... try to go on offence to tie the score.</i>

84
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,631
Go, Madrid!

85
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:33,428
- Here, latch on, latch on.
- I'm with you.

86
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:35,552
Come on, Madrid, come on!

87
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:39,140
<i>He skates up in front.</i>
<i>Gonzales still has it for Madrid.</i>

88
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,269
<i>Hands off again, this time to Bodeus.</i>

89
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:44,988
<i>Bodeus, on offence for the Madrid team.</i>

90
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,945
<i>Here's the Houston defence.</i>

91
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,365
<i>It's a shot. It's low!</i>
<i>And back down to the track goes Bodeus.</i>

92
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,538
<i>He's not injured,</i>
<i>but his scoring attempt failed.</i>

93
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,876
<i>And the score is still 1-0 in favour of Houston.</i>

94
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,584
<i>The ball is fired again.</i>
<i>Madrid is pressing now.</i>

95
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:00,802
<i>Putting the pressure on.</i>

96
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:03,555
Move it! Come on, move!

97
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:07,896
Hold on. Come on, let's move it!

98
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,395
We got it now.

99
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,523
Hold on, hold on.

100
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,532
Watch it. Keep an eye out!

<i>(fast handclapping)</i>

102
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,246
<i>Coming in now, Sanchez.</i>

103
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,416
<i>Moving to his left and right.</i>

104
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:24,085
<i>Has a full head of steam, still on offence...</i>

105
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,302
<i>... trying to tie the score.</i>
<i>Sanchez moves around the bike...</i>

106
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,719
<i>... takes a long looping shot. He scores!</i>

107
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:32,342
<i>Sanchez scores for Madrid</i>
<i>and ties the game...</i>

108

<i>Second period.</i>

110

<i>The ball is in play again,</i>
<i>and scooped up this time by Aston!</i>

111
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,283
Three minutes. Get off!

112
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,909
- <i>(klaxon)</i>
- <i>Madrid penalty.</i>

113

<i>(klaxon)</i>

Are you satisfied, Madrid?
What game are you guys playing?

117
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:15,955
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Relax, you'll be all right.

118

<i>The crowd's going wild...</i>

Skate! Skate! Come on, goddammit, skate!

121

Houston! Houston! Houston!

122
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,822
<i>They all go down, a pile-up on the track.</i>

123
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,616
<i>The ball rolls free,</i>

Come on, move out!

127
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,554
How is it, Jonathan?

128
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,715
- Give me a towel, will you, Bull?
- Sure.

129
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,263
<i>(coughs)</i>

130

Three-minute penalty!

134
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,510
Don't give me any of that. Off the track!

135
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,364
Group up.

136
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:40,831
<i>Jumping over the Madrid defence,</i>
<i>gets up in front of the goal...</i>

137
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,830
<i>... and he jams it in for the score!</i>

138
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:46,372
<i>Jonathan jams it in and scores...</i>

139
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,345
<i>... to give Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.</i>

140

<i>Houston with the ball again.</i>

- <i>Here in the third...</i>
- It's a bike!

142
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:59,359

<i>Jonathan E has it.</i>
<i>Jonathan coming in low...</i>

<i>... with a great manoeuvre.</i>
<i>He shoots, he scores!</i>

145
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,672
I love this game, Moonpie.

146
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,047
- I love it.
- Yeah!

147
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,761
Jonathan! Jonathan!

148
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,478
Two games left.
Guess who we're playing first.

149
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:30,858
Tokyo. Ha-ha! Who'd have thought
they'd make it to the play-off?

150
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,827
They're good.
They've got the old Samurai spirit.

151
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, but they're all about this tall.

152
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,960
Two or three little things make one big thing.

153
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,171
They're liable to climb all over you
and eat your lunch!

154
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,797
I can't get on a man-to-man basis
with a pygmy or an Oriental.

155
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,722
I don't know what it is.

156
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:57,654
You were fine tonight, all of you.

157
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,896
Mean...

158
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,157
...sharp!
- Thank you.

159
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:05,372
- You fellas did well again.
- Thank you, Mr Bartholomew.

160
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,336
And you, you rolled, you really rolled.

161
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,458
Yeah.

162
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,041
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?

163
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,467
No, we just give lessons to the other team!

164
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,390
<i>(clapping)</i>

165
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,846
How are you, Jonathan?

166
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:22,430
I'm, uh, feeling mean, Mr Bartholomew.
It's good to see you.

167
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,521
Jonathan E, that's the name.

168
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,902
Houston players come and go,
but the champion...

169
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,362
...plays on.

170
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,328
Hear, hear!

171
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:37,955
The Energy Corporation has a hard time
figuring out ways to pay the champion.

172
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,663
We can't think up any more rewards for him.

173
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,008
You'd like us to have that problem with you?

174
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:44,134
Yes, sir!

175
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:47,844
You're like Jonathan,
you play with abandon...

176
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:50,815
...but this is Jonathan's season.

177
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:53,851
Every season seems to be
Jonathan's season...

178
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:57,239
...but this year we've got you
on Multivision...

179
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,610
...a special show all about you.

180
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:02,617
No player ever had that before.

181
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,536
The whole world will be watching
because this is your year.

182
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,298
<i>(cheering)</i>

183
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,630
You got it, babe!

184
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,892
- So, two games left.
- That's right, Mr Bartholomew.

185
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,061
New York in the final!

186
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:23,985
The team seems healthy...

187
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,070
...the champion says he feels mean.

188
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,869
No problems here.

189
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:32,039
That's right!

190
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,001
What is this, fruit juice?

191
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:38,252
Very healthy, Mr Bartholomew. Very healthy.

192
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:49,355
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.

193
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,187
It's a bad habit you've got there.

194
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:57,068
You know what that habit
will make you dream, Moonpie?

195
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,744
You'll dream you're an executive.

196
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,214
You'll have your hands on all the controls...

197
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,125
...and you'll wear a grey suit,
and you'll make decisions.

198
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,136
But you know what, Moonpie?

199
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:12,183
You know what those executives
dream about...

200
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,518
...out there behind their desks?

201
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,982
They dream they're great rollerballers.

202
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,861
They dream they're Jonathan.
They have muscles.

203
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,614
- They bash in faces.
- <i>(all)</i> Yeah!

204
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,578
Are we ready to go?
Can't keep these boys here all night.

205
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,660
Jonathan...

206
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,039
...come and see me, tomorrow.

207
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,802
Good night, Mr Bartholomew.

208
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,638
- Ssh! Quiet, quiet.
- This is a great team.

209
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,812
A great city.

210
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,226
Great stuff out there tonight.

211
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,402
<i>(cheering)</i>

212
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,140
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

213
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:20,364
<i>(crowd chants)</i>
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

214
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:23,995
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

215
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:26,581
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

216
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:35,889
<i>(screaming)</i>

217
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,056
<i>(crowd chants)</i>
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

218
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:43,401
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

219
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:49,536
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

220
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,362
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

221
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,282
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

222
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,973
- Good morning.
- How are you?

223
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,343
- Brutal game last night.
- Thank you.

224
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,980
- So it's Tokyo in the semifinals?
- That's right.

225
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,406
Continue to hold the calls, all right?

226
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,523
Come in, Jonathan.

227
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,410
Keep silence with me
for a minute, won't you?

228
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,580
<i>(chiming)</i>

229
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,670
It's important to have a place
to think things out.

230
00:20:56,806 --> 00:21:01,435
You have your ranch.
I know you take a lot of pleasure in it.

231
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:03,557
I, uh, cut my finger.

232
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:06,148
I'm sorry. Here.

233
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,197
You've had an amazing career, Jonathan.

234
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,498
You know how proud we are
of the Houston team...

235
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:18,747
...and what we think of you... at Energy.

236
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:22,884
But now there are executives
who want you out.

237
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,554
Sir?

238
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:27,434
You've had 10 years in this game, Jonathan...

239
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,600
...Ionger than anyone ever.

240
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,271
Retire... How can I do that?

241
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,774
On your special programme.

242
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:38,904
There are some who feel that
this programme should now be used to...

243
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,076
...announce your retirement.

244
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,830
Who wants that?

245
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:46,079
When this special was first planned
by us here at Energy...

246
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:48,455
...we saw it as a good thing...

247
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,879
...but now the Executive Directorate
wants a change.

248
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:55,715
The programme is scheduled,
the whole world is waiting for it...

249
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:59,388
...so this does seem the perfect time.

250
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:02,269
The, um, team...

251
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,443
They, uh, they depend on me.

252
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,575
Jonathan, let's think this through together.

253
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,574
You know how the game serves us.

254
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,622
It has a definite social purpose.

255
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:17,882
Nations are bankrupt, gone.

256
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:21,507
None of that tribal warfare any more.

257
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:25,432
Even the corporate wars
are a thing of the past.

258
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:27,978
Yeah, well, I know that. It's just...

259
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:31,228
So now we have the majors
and their executives.

260
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:34,234
Transport, food, communication...

261
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:37,489
...housing, luxury, energy.

262
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:42,074
A few of us making decisions
on a global basis...

263
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,671
...for the common good.

264
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:47,001
The team is a unit.
It plays with certain rhythms.

265
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:49,841
So does an executive team, Jonathan.

266
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:52,727
Now everyone has all the comforts...

267
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:54,263
...you know that.

268
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:56,970
No poverty, no sickness.

269
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,779
No needs and many luxuries...

270
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:03,986
...which you enjoy just as if
you were in the executive class.

271
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:07,453
Corporate society takes care of everything.

272
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,958
And all it asks of anyone...

273
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,372
...all it has ever asked of anyone ever...

274
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:16,426
...is not to interfere
with management decisions.

275
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:20,422
I, uh... I don't mean to resist.

276
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,351
I'm just trying to understand.

277
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:27,107
This is for your own benefit.
You must know that, Jonathan.

278
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:29,858
All decisions concerning you are.

279
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,617
Well, I, uh...

280
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,703
I lost Ella.

281
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,039
The Corporation took my wife away...

282
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,420
...because an executive wanted her.
- I won't review all that.

283
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:44,301
That was before I took over.
I had nothing to do with it.

284
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:48,213
From what I hear
your wife wanted to leave herself.

285
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,851
So, now, you're going to retire.

286
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,270
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

287
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,860
Stupid game, after all.

288
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:01,775
Awful game.
You ought to be glad to be out of it.

289
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,831
I don't, uh...

290
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:11,414
I don't know, Mr Bartholomew.
I just don't... know.

291
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,756
I realise you had nothing to do
with Ella leaving me.

292
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,844
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...

293
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,681
I... You're right.

294
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:23,057
I mean, uh, I ought to do...

295
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:26,239
I ought to be perfectly happy
to do what you say.

296
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,651
Take your time. Take a few days.

297
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:34,288
You've just come through a game.
You're tired.

298
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:38,411
Go to your ranch, but... think about it.

299
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:41,339
And understand it.

300
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:44,302
Do understand it.

301
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,297
Because I don't understand your resistance.

302
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,095
And I don't think anyone else will either.

303
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,630
- Was your flight OK?
- Is Clete here?

304
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,852
- He's in the training room.
- I'll go say hello.

305
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:15,647
Jonathan?

306
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,394
Look what I got for breakfast.

307
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:22,481
It's a notice from the Corporation.

308
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:24,493
What's it say?

309
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:29,332
Oh, that I should, uh, get out of here.
You know, go away, vanish.

310
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:33,508
That kind of thing.
You know anything about that?

311
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,217
Yeah, I kinda heard something about it.

312
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,640
You knew it was coming.

313
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:45,610
We've been together six months.

314
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:50,152
Didn't you even wanna say goodbye?

315
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:53,911
We'll talk about it later, OK?

316
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,080
You didn't, did you?

317
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,834
Hm?

318
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,800
You didn't even want me here
when you got back.

319
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:03,634
I gotta go see Cletus.

320
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:05,969
What do you want me to do in the meantime?

321
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:07,724
I want you to take it easy.

322
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:09,476
Uh...

323
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,983
I want you to go in and, uh,
fix us something to eat.

324
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,947
Clete's come a long way
and, uh, I'm hungry...

325
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:19,031
...all right?

326
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:27,201
Jonathan?

327
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,964
I'm glad you're all right.

328
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,726
Huh! Huh! Huh!

329
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,477
<i>(punches bag)</i>

330
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,234
Huh!

331
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,282
Come on. All right, come on.

332
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,204
<i>(pats bag)</i>

333
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,372
Come on.

334
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,296
- I ain't tired enough.
- Yeah!

335
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,193
Huh!

336
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,777
Huh! It caught you, didn't it, baby?

337
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,036
- Two games running?
- What?

338
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,702
You did that the last two games.
Shoulder forward left.

339
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,127
You're standing on your left skate.

340
00:28:26,258 --> 00:28:29,960
You do that in Tokyo,
they'll take your arm home for lunch.

341
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:32,137
You with me?

342
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:36,064
OK, you practise that for me a little, huh?

343
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,684
All right.

344
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,190
<i>(laughs)</i>

345
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,448
<i>(Cletus)</i> Hell, I forget
which corporation is which.

346
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:51,039
Any ass knows that fire's energy.

347
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:54,462
Who wrote the music?

348
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:56,631
Where does the music come from?

349
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,797
Huh...

350
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:02,266
- OK if I have one of these?
- Go on, have a holiday.

351
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:16,997
I forget what corporation's
running what city.

352
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,672
Chicago's still the Food City...

353
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:26,877
...but what about Indianapolis?
Whatever happened to that town?

354
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:29,054
Whatever happened to Mackie?

355
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,522
Everything was much simpler
when I was a kid.

356
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,687
We still had three nations.

357
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:38,270
That was before the corporate wars,
even before rollerball.

358
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:41,527
Before everything. Do you believe in kids?

359
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,366
I remember someone telling me about...

360
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:47,369
...the National Football League
and the World Cup.

361
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,338
- Where are you going?
- Indianapolis.

362
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:56,724
What do you know about that stuff, Clete?

363
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,889
I mean...

364
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,268
...you know, how the Corporations
got started, about the corporate wars.

365
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:05,852
They were nasty... Phew!

366
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,028
Well, nobody talks about that.

367
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:11,029
- Well... except for friends.
- Yeah... <i>(laughs)</i>

368
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:14,283
I remember your rookie year.

369
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,999
You were mean and tight.

370
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:19,169
The best player I ever coached.

371
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:23,086
Nobody could lay a hand on you
that year. Remember?

372
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,096
Yeah. Uh...

373
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,264
Look, I gotta ask you something.

374
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:29,933
That figures. Go ahead, I'm listening.

375
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,106
Well, there's something
going on with the game.

376
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:39,233
I don't know what it is.
I don't think I'm supposed to know.

377
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,364
What's that?

378
00:30:41,498 --> 00:30:43,741
They want me to quit.

379
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:55,301
Why... would they want you to do that?

380
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,475
I don't know.

381
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,437
That's what I'd like you to find out.

382
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,733
Well, I'll try.

383
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:06,696
I hear just about everything going on
in the game, one way or another.

384
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:11,040
That's what I mean. I can't think of
another executive who'd tell me a thing.

385
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,378
Like I say, I...

386
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:19,759
I'll try.

387
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:21,965
But I don't think there's much I...

388
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,220
Look, uh, no troubles for either of us, Clete.

389
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:27,394
Just... find out what you can.

390
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,072
Trust me, Jonathan. You know you can.

391
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:33,194
Sure.

392
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,032
Well, sit down.

393
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,245
Well, yeah.

394
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:08,788
Thanks, boys.

395
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:12,456
Good show, Johnny.

396
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,343
That's the Houston stride.

397
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:22,478
You boys wanna make this team,
play for Houston, you'll have to learn it.

398
00:32:22,605 --> 00:32:26,687
We, uh, pride ourselves
on being a power team.

399
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,192
- That's right.
- We're power, we're mean.

400
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,862
And that doesn't mean to say...

401
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,830
...we like to have you
hanging back there on a rail...

402
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:39,003
...in a fist fight, just fighting in section A,
when you should be in section B.

403
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:42,416
I'm coming up to score
and you ain't in the right section...

404
00:32:42,551 --> 00:32:45,588
...it won't do us no good.
- That's right.

405
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:47,965
Who's the, uh, two new catchers here?

406
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,177
Right, uh, give me that ball.

407
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,941
Don't, uh...

408
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,991
...stick your hand in that gutter too quick.

409
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:01,573
Wait till this ball comes down on the track.

410
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,786
Don't get too anxious.
That thing'll take your arm off.

411
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,413
Now the bikers.

412
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,586
A biker...

413
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:14,630
...might sacrifice
a little three-minute penalty...

414
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,841
...run over the top of a skater...

415
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,056
Uh-huh. Whoo!

416
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,857
...if he feels that he's skating a little too good.

417
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:24,435
So, we have a few methods
here in Houston. There's hundreds.

418
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:28,701
One, of course, is to use this shield here.
Use your pads. Use what you got.

419
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,615
Drive that arm in there,
keep your feet forward.

420
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:35,118
Hit, move, you get away from the wreck.
Always keep your feet here.

421
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:37,959
Don't come across in here.
You get all twisted.

422
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,876
Or if a biker's sitting up nice and high -
a lot of guys like to ride high...

423
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:44,801
...drag one off in midair. I hurt you, Blue?

424
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,141
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.

425
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,650
Now a... third method, and the one
perfected by a little friend of mine...

426
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:53,569
...the swoop.

427
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:56,782
Whoo! The swooper, that's me!

428
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,865
Hang up on the rail,
use all the speed of the track...

429
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,287
...come down and drop-kick a biker.

430
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,246
Say... Excuse me...

431
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:11,003
...you're, uh... you're not paying
a whole lot of attention, are you?

432
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,678
What's this dude's name?

433
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,646
That's our new speedball from Manila.

434
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,730
Yeah, you know. That's Toughie.

435
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,651
Come on up, Tough.

436
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:26,239
- Oh, he's a big honker.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

437
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,406
Say, why don't, uh...

438
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,369
...you do me and the boys a favour?

439
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,540
Since you know all there is to know,
we'd sure appreciate it.

440
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,044
Why not give us a demonstration?
Show us how you made that big rep.

441
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,967
Just skate around and, uh,
just... take me out, huh?

442
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:47,513
Go get him, Toughie.

443
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,604
Now...

444
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,568
...eyes, use 'em.

445
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,823
Don't lock your eyes in one spot.
This game isn't all in the muscle.

446
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,155
Use your head.

447
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,080
Lock your eyes on the target and keep...

448
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:02,244
<i>(laughter)</i>

449
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:06,837
Ears. Now, they're real important, too.

450
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,169

# <i>Tchaikovsky "The Sleeping Beauty"</i>

452
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:23,408
Mm, if there's anything I love,
it's luxury centres.

453
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,666
And when I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.

454
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,169
- A secretary.
- What for?

455
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,543
Are you planning on becoming an executive?

456
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,349
Oh, I just need one. About this tall. Hee-hee!

457
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:38,885
Yeah?

458
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,017
Why don't you give it a rest?

459
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:50,613
Hello.

460
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:54,494
- Can I help you, please?
- Yeah. I, uh, tried to order some books...

461
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:57,792
...and they said I had to appear
at the centre personally.

462
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:02,086
That's right, this is our circulation unit.
Make your choice here or by catalogue.

463
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,088
There must be some mistake.
The books you've ordered are classified...

464
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:08,681
...and have been transcribed and summarised.

465
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,306
Who summarises them?

466
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,978
I suppose the computers summarise them.

467
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,943
- What do you need books for?
- I just want to study up on some things.

468
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:21,073
You could go to the computer centre
where the real librarians transcribe them.

469
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:25,038
But we have all the edited versions here.
Anything I think you'd want.

470
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:27,162
Well, let's see, then.

471
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:30,668
This is not a library
and you're really not a librarian?

472
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:34,054
I'm only a clerk, that's right.
I'm sorry about it, really.

473
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:38,846
The books are really in computer banks
being summarised? Where is that?

474
00:36:38,981 --> 00:36:41,058
There's a computer bank in Washington.

475
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:43,981
The biggest is in Geneva.
That's a nice place to visit.

476
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:46,190
I guess that's where all the books are now.

477
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:47,321
Thank you.

478
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:52,782
Ah, it's not that exactly.

479
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,377
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?

480
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,255
I mean, anything you wanna know,
you could hire a corporate teacher.

481
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,756
You could call somebody up,
use your privilege card.

482
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:05,265
I can't. That's just it.

483
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:10,276
I think there's something going on.
Somebody's pushing me.

484
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,526
Who? Bartholomew?

485
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:18,535
You're Jonathan E. Everybody knows you.
You've got everything.

486
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:24,255
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.

487
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,131
Yeah. I don't know.

488
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,179
Well, I do know. We're living good.
You know we are.

Is it all right?

492
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,763
That's the uniform of the house.

493
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:38,702
I'm Daphne.

494
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,705
Yeah. That figures.

495
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,550
It's all right.

496
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,596
Here. Wear these, too.

497
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:01,778
No penalties. Limited substitutions.
You can handle it!

498
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:03,866
You can beat Tokyo!

499
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,569
All we gotta do is change our tactics.

500
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:10,327
There've always been rule changes.
Now, look, you know that!

501
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:14,047
It gets more people to watch the game,
that's all there is to it.

502
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:16,847
You all signed contracts
to finish out the season...

503
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,215
...no matter what the alterations in the game.

504
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,804
- Now, every last one of you signed.
- See, <i>now</i> we all signed a contract.

505
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,811
It doesn't matter!
There's no way we're gonna lose...

506
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,400
...no matter how they change the game.

507
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:30,524
That's right.

508
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,575
All it means is a change of strategy.
We knock out their bikers early.

509
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,115
We take care of their skaters.
Don't try to score...

510
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:38,663
...and the game's yours.

511
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,878
Now, watch yourselves out there.
They're playing the same rules we are.

512
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,224
It's gonna be rough.
But it's still basically the same game.

513
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,593
And the team with the power wins.

514
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:51,473
That's easy to say, man!

515
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,530
Hey, Rusty.

516
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:03,573
Hey, wait... Wait a minute.

517
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:05,250
Hey, Rusty, come on.

518
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:09,625
Listen, uh, you were talking
about them contracts.

519
00:42:09,758 --> 00:42:13,508
How come everyone else is being asked
to play with the no-penalty rule...

520
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,131
...and, uh, they're pressuring me to quit?

521
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:18,684
I don't know.

522
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,399
But can't you do what you're told?

523
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,570
For your own good, get out.

524
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,325
I, uh...

525
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:33,163
I don't want to leave the guys to play
Tokyo with the rules breaking down.

526
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,164
Jonathan, it doesn't matter what you want!

527
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:42,462
You think about that.

528
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:55,398
(man) <i>These we did in slow motion</i>
<i>to show the impact of your blows...</i>

529
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,862
<i>... on opposing players.</i>

530
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,738
<i>Yeah, fine.</i>

531
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,245
We want you to approve the sequences.

532
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:05,043
<i>It's, uh... It's all fine with me. Uh...</i>

533
00:43:06,258 --> 00:43:07,254
<i>Anything.</i>

534
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,552
I really... don't see why I'm needed here.

535
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:13,885
<i>Well, the Energy people</i>
<i>want you to be satisfied.</i>

536
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:16,594
<i>There, now. Isn't that a marvellous shot?</i>

537
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:20,148
Sure.

538
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,696
<i>I'm a stat freak myself. Isn't that perverse?</i>

539
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,074
Have you got anything I can take?

540
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:30,456
Just, uh, just take one, huh?

541
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:32,995
Statistics, huh?

542
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,046
<i>Yes, the greatest number of points</i>
<i>scored in a single game, 18.</i>

543
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:41,723
<i>The highest velocity of a ball when</i>
<i>actually fielded by a skater, 120mph.</i>

544
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:43,050
<i>Most deaths...</i>

545
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,264
- <i>(feedback)</i>
- <i>Uh, please...</i>

546
00:43:45,398 --> 00:43:46,727
<i>... don't do that.</i>

547
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,852
Ah.

548
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:53,033
Most deaths, <i>9</i>. Rome versus Pittsburgh,
December last year.

549
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,070
The greatest number of players...

550
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:59,038
...put out of action
by a single player in a single game...

551
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,580
<i>... 13.</i>

552
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:03,549
<i>A world record,</i> courtesy of your dear self.

553
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,631
<i>There have been studies</i>
<i>of stat freaks in rollerball.</i>

554
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:10,597
<i>Some go to the track, but they never</i>
<i>take their eyes off the big board.</i>

555
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:11,723
What's this?

556
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:14,690
<i>I've always wondered if a rollerball player...</i>

557
00:44:14,816 --> 00:44:16,893
<i>... sees himself as a class apart.</i>

558
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:18,856
"Hello."

559
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,030
"Pause."

560
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,953
"I'm Jonathan E. Smile."

561
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,786
"I would like..." This, uh, this for me?

562
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:32,628
<i>Very astute. Yes.</i>

563
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:35,133
<i>It's your retirement announcement.</i>

564
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,426
<i>Your special is already scheduled</i>
<i>and announced all over the world.</i>

565
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:42,267
<i>You're supposed to read this</i>
<i>as part of the programme.</i>

566
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:44,688
What sort of pill did you give me?

567
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,691
Pure aphrodisiac, Daph. Enjoy yourself, dear.

568
00:44:47,823 --> 00:44:50,031
(Daphne)
<i>Can't we finish up here and go home?</i>

569
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:53,117
You are being recorded.

570
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,657
- Feeling woozy?
- <i>Just try to read the announcement.</i>

571
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,834
I'm all right.

572
00:44:59,257 --> 00:45:01,630
Why don't you... read...

573
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,757
...the...

574
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:04,928
Oh, yeah, you want that, do you?

575
00:45:05,057 --> 00:45:07,097
<i>You are making things difficult.</i>

576
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:10,597
How many, uh, how many assignments
you been on, Daph?

577
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,898
Oh, you're good at what you're good at...

578
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,070
...so you must have been around some.

579
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,036
A lot of girls have stayed with me.
You know that.

580
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:22,203
Never seemed to mind.

581
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:24,750
But odd thoughts...

582
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:27,251
...I've had about you, Daph. Odd thoughts.

583
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,671
Wondered if you'd been briefed on me.

584
00:45:29,802 --> 00:45:31,261
<i>I'll ask you to read...</i>

585
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:35,303
Yeah, a lot of things occur to me, Daph.
A lot of things occur to you?

586
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,723
You look terrible.

587
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,900
You do look terrible.

588
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,779
Come on.

589
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,698
<i>(soundtrack)</i>

590
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,117
You shouldn't take anything
offered to you just like that.

591
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,043
What was in it?

592
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:58,253
Nothing to hurt you.
You're too trusting. Ever think of that?

593
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:00,426
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

594
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:23,170
Hook 'em deep now!

595
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:39,111
They're good boys, but they're a bit rough.

596
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:42,654
Thank you.

597
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:52,456
As you know, the Tokyo game is coming up.

598
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,837
And you will remember that the Tokyo team...

599
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,305
...uses various karate and Hapkido techniques.

600
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:01,806
We will review these techniques...

601
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:05,390
...with special attention
to the use of death blows.

602
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:07,602
- Same lecture every year!
- <i>(laughter)</i>

603
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:11,524
There are certain body areas...

604
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:14,864
...that the skilled opponents
will endeavour to strike.

605
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,412
What we got for our skilled opponents
is the Houston fist-in-the-face technique!

606
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:20,542
<i>(laughter)</i>

607
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:23,373
Especially in a game with no penalties and...

608
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,008
You gotta get mad, all right? Play hard.
It don't matter if they're all tiny little men.

609
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:32,188
Especially in a game with no penalties
and limited substitutions.

610
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:34,355
Get mad and fly!

611
00:47:35,027 --> 00:47:36,023
Please...

612
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:38,818
There are certain body areas
that I know about, too.

613
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:41,442
What we gotta do is hit those guys
in the ganglia.

614
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:42,492
Where?

615
00:47:42,621 --> 00:47:46,122
In the ganglia. That's a mess of nerves
right here under the ear.

616
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:50,298
You gotta drive the jawbone up in that
mess of nerves, and it rings a bell.

617
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:51,588
<i>(laughter)</i>

618
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:53,759
You must understand...

619
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:58,137
...the Tokyo team
has a very eccentric playing style.

620
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:01,972
And no penalties! If I go down,
I know my team is with me, right?

621
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:02,689
Please.

622
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:04,099
Brute speed!

623
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:07,737
Familiarise yourself with
the basic fighting-art techniques.

624
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:10,276
Nobody's gonna take us, rules or no rules.

625
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:11,112
Go on.

626
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:13,324
This is the Houston team!

627
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,330
- Rules or no rules.
- We fight for each other.

628
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:18,836
<i>(chant)</i> Houston! Houston!
Houston! Houston!

They're really quite beautiful,
in a wild kind of way.

638
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,699
I can almost smell the lions.

639
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:38,156
Don't be silly. They're made in Detroit.

640
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,783
Yes, they're android. They're all programmed.

641
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,412
That's right,
the whole game is played by robots.

642
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:45,542
They look like men, and they bleed!

643
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,178
Not so loud. They'll hear you.

644
00:49:48,306 --> 00:49:49,635
<i>(laughs)</i>

645
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:54,894
It'll ensure stability, expansion and
high profits for the planetary enterprise.

646
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:59,154
- What do you think about that?
- You make it sound absolutely romantic.

647
00:49:59,572 --> 00:50:02,610
Oh, he's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

648
00:50:02,744 --> 00:50:06,743
I know, but he's so intelligent.
I'm practically living on bright pills.

649
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:12,424
Hey, here he is.

650
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,837
Hey, Johnny boy! Hey, kid!

651
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,721
Come on, let's hear it. Come on!

652
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:43,041
Give me a hand.
I got too much to handle here.

653
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:45,219
Behave yourself.

654
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,421
Hello, Mackie.

655
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:13,097
Well, how have you been?

656
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:17,007
You know it's your night tonight, Jonathan.

657
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:19,815
You having a good time?

658
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:22,475
I'm glad you're here.

659
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,937
I'm here with an executive.

660
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:30,744
He asked all about you.

661
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,749
Wanted to know if I enjoyed you.

662
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,116
Hey, Rockie, hey, give her your hand.

663
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:57,532
- It's getting heavy.
- It's too much.

664
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:02,076
- Well, what about the new game?
- I haven't heard much about it.

665
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:04,881
The rule changes
were announced a week ago.

666
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:07,843
- Who changed them?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

667
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:10,342
Look, rules or no rules,
it's still the same game.

668
00:52:10,473 --> 00:52:14,555
- I'm looking forward to the programme.
- When you see that screen replay...

669
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:16,313
Excuse me.

670
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,232
- Did you hear about Evans?
- What?

671
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:19,403
He's out. Gone.

672
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,573
No kidding!

673
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,577
The old man?

674
00:53:23,705 --> 00:53:25,533
Who got him?

675
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:26,782
What?

676
00:53:26,918 --> 00:53:28,959
I said, who got him?

677
00:53:29,088 --> 00:53:31,129
The crocodile.

678
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,523
- You like poetry?
- Mm-hmm.

679
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:47,731
Let's go upstairs. I got a poem for you.

00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:13,062
<i>Tonight Multivision trains its cameras</i>
<i>on the amazing career of Jonathan E.</i>

684
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:14,987
<i>In those years...</i>

685
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:18,615
<i>... that Houston began to mould itself</i>
<i>into a world championship team...</i>

686
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:21,949
- <i>... the attacking style of Jonathan E...</i>
- Jonathan, you're on, come on!

687
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:25,085
<i>... has always been the team's strongest asset.</i>

688
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:28,713
<i>Yes, the game seems invented for him.</i>

689
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:38,978
<i>(audience cheers)</i>

690
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:51,324
<i>(brakes screech)</i>

691
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,406
<i>(cheering)</i>

692
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,294
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

693
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:30,003
(crowd chants) <i>Jonathan! Jonathan!</i>

694
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:32,764
<i>Jonathan! Jonathan!</i>

695
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,666
(crowd chants) <i>Houston! Houston Houston!</i>

696
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:18,710
<i>Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!</i>

697
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,626
<i>(applause)</i>

698
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:13,454
Look, I talked to everybody I could.

699
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:17,833
And, uh, there is something going on.
Yeah, you're right about that.

700
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:21,087
But nobody will talk about it, I mean nobody!

701
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:24,472
It's hard finding anything out, Jonathan,
you know that.

702
00:57:24,601 --> 00:57:29,063
Hell, nobody even knows the names
of the men on the directorate any more.

703
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:37,532
Look, I'm sorry.

704
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:44,120
- They want you out. You know that?
- Yeah.

705
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:47,288
But do you know who they are?

706
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:49,669
- Bartholomew, I guess.
- Mm-mm.

707
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:51,845
Above Bartholomew.

708
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,765
It's the Executive Directorate.

709
00:57:54,895 --> 00:57:58,266
- Why would they worry about me?
- Well, they do.

710
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,447
They're even after the old man because
he didn't get your retirement announced.

711
00:58:02,573 --> 00:58:05,694
How come they put
the programme on without it?

712
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:09,910
I think they had to.
They didn't want to. It's very tricky.

713
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:15,671
Jonathan, there's one thing
you ought to know.

714
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:21,171
Look, nobody's said it, but I'm sure of it.

715
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:22,305
Hm?

716
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:28,356
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.

717
00:58:28,945 --> 00:58:30,985
All the way to the top, they are.

718
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:46,923
What are they afraid of me for?

719
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:07,709
Oh, no, don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.

720
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,745
Let's see 'em then!

721
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,256
<i>(crowd roars)</i>

722
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:08,121
Mr Bartholomew would like to see you now.

723
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:09,456
He's in the study.

724
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:37,004
Come on, hurry up, over there!

725
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:50,601
You know I've always considered
your situation, Jonathan...

726
01:00:50,736 --> 01:00:52,979
...and your needs.

727
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:55,738
Now you have to consider mine...

728
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:59,286
...and ours.
- I'm considering it, Mr Bartholomew.

729
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:02,502
No player is greater than the game itself.

730
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:05,329
It's a significant game in a number of ways.

731
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:09,252
The... velocities of the ball,
the awful physics of the track.

732
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:13,720
And in the middle of it all, men,
playing by an odd set of rules.

733
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:17,805
It's not a game a man is supposed
to grow strong in, Jonathan.

734
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:19,984
You appreciate that, don't you?

735
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:22,153
More and more, Mr Bartholomew.

736
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:23,908
<i>(laughter)</i>

737
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,080
Shoot that statue!

738
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,880
That's the one! Shoot that!

739
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,630
Hey, the tree!

740
01:01:37,597 --> 01:01:39,637
You must take good advice.

741
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:43,719
You're not to play against Tokyo.
You're not to play again.

742
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:47,896
- I want some concessions.
- Concessions?

743
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:52,408
Believe me, I'd be happy to talk a deal,
Jonathan. I love deals.

744
01:01:52,535 --> 01:01:55,871
But this situation is much, much simpler.

745
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:59,370
This Multivision event tonight
was very embarrassing.

746
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:01,747
For me and for others.

747
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,758
Yeah.

748
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:09,265
It might be I won't ever find out
why I've been asked to leave the game...

749
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:13,637
...but I do know I can get
some concessions, and I want 'em.

750
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:24,781
You missed!

751
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:31,534
I wanna see Ella, my wife.
Arrange it so I can see her again.

752
01:02:31,669 --> 01:02:33,413
That's not easy, Jonathan.

753
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:35,373
I want other concessions, too,
Mr Bartholomew.

754
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:49,478
Oh! Oh-ho! Look at that!

755
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:51,846
<i>(laughter and chatter)</i>

756
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:05,734
I've never seen anything like that
in my life! That's incredible!

757
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:09,281
That's terrific.

758
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:10,744
Look at all the flames!

759
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:12,915
Specifically, you're bargaining...

760
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:16,164
...for the right to stay in
a horrible social spectacle.

761
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:20,461
It has its purposes.
You've served those purposes brilliantly.

762
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:23,003
Why argue when you can quit?

763
01:03:23,138 --> 01:03:27,005
And you say you want to know
why decisions are made.

764
01:03:27,351 --> 01:03:29,308
Your future comfort is assured.

765
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:31,345
You don't need to know.

766
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,691
Why argue about decisions you're not
powerful enough to make for yourself?

767
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:45,278
Energy will treat you well, you know that.

768
01:03:53,961 --> 01:03:58,623
If the rule changes stay the same,
Mr Bartholomew...

769
01:03:58,757 --> 01:04:00,916
...I'm playing with my team.

770
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,088
Too late. The rule change
is scheduled and announced.

771
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:06,759
There's no going back. You've seen to that.

772
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:08,171
I'll see you in Tokyo.

773
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,433
You could be made to quit!
You could be forced!

774
01:04:12,563 --> 01:04:13,891
You can't make me quit!

775
01:04:15,983 --> 01:04:17,727
Don't tell me I can't.

776
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,402
Don't ever say that! I can!

777
01:04:19,528 --> 01:04:23,443
- (crowd chants) <i>Jonathan! Jonathan!</i>
- You can be stopped!

You could have killed someone!

784
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:57,060
- It's all going too fast. I'm not packed...
- Forget it, you're not going, Daph.

785
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:59,683
Those bags are ready.
Here. Take this extra hat.

786
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:00,733
Sir...

787
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:03,151
...I've had a call. I have to go over to Energy.

788
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:06,152
- You're not going to Tokyo?
- What do you mean I'm not going?

789
01:05:06,284 --> 01:05:07,909
I hope this isn't inconvenient.

790
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:11,910
No, no, it's no... no problem.

791
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:15,039
I'm supposed to go with you.

792
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:18,000
Well, what's that mean?

793
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:23,750
Who, uh, who told you
you're supposed to go with me? Hm?

794
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:25,925
Nobody told me.

795
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:32,006
Listen, Jonathan,
I really wanna go with you. I do really.

796
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:33,887
You'll need me.

797
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,594
Get yourself another assignment,
will you, Daph?

798
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,483
Everybody's an assignment.
Life's an assignment.

799
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:40,605
Get going.

800
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:48,692
You'd better do as you're told, Jonathan.
That's all I have to say.

801
01:05:49,828 --> 01:05:51,868
Are you threatening me?

802
01:05:52,664 --> 01:05:54,906
Don't be here when I come back.

803
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:57,118
You won't be back, Johnny boy...

804
01:05:58,378 --> 01:06:01,830
Don't try to frighten me, Daphne,
you don't know how.

805
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:02,961
Look...

806
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:07,880
...you go tell them people that
I'm going to Tokyo and you're not, huh?

807
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:10,053
You tell 'em that.

808
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:11,340
Ciao.

809
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:13,100
Oh!

01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,446
Keller.

811
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:39,294
Make sure my gear gets to the track in Tokyo.

812
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,994
I'm gonna travel with the team this trip.

813
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,622
You, uh, call transportation and tell 'em.

814
01:06:44,759 --> 01:06:46,586
Yes, sir.

815
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,024

What chance does Houston have
of defeating Tokyo tonight?

820
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:22,163
Well, uh, both teams have fine players,
and, uh, different styles.

821
01:07:22,297 --> 01:07:23,839
What do you say, Moonpie?

822
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:26,456
Yeah, yeah, but it's not
an even match, see...

823
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:30,293
...because the Tokyo team
has all these little short guys.

What about the rule changes?

827
01:07:40,774 --> 01:07:44,772
Well, at Houston, uh,
we kinda play a wide-open system.

828
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:48,354
Will you comment on a game
where the rules are always changing?

829
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:51,941
The game's always had rule changes.
They don't affect the good teams.

830
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:55,280
You're a great new player.
What's the secret of your success?

831
01:07:55,414 --> 01:07:57,869
Oh, it's no secret, I just imitate him...

832
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,621
...and, uh, plastic surgery keeps me beautiful.

833
01:08:00,752 --> 01:08:04,335
There are rumours that the last game
of the season will be played...

834
01:08:04,465 --> 01:08:06,790
...without time limits. Uh, any comments?

835
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:10,427
I don't think it'll come to that.
It's still a game.

836
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:13,127
There are also other rumours.
Some say you retired.

837
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:14,640
Here I am.

Thank you.

01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:36,690
A simple problem,
yet I know it is difficult for you.

995
01:25:36,822 --> 01:25:39,028
Your team-mate has no family
we can contact...

996
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:43,736
...and permission is required now
before, uh, before consummating matters.

997
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:51,041
So, he's, uh, technically dead?

998
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:53,246
Yes, unfortunately.

999
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,832
His heart and lungs will function,
but his brain is, uh...

1000
01:25:56,967 --> 01:25:58,960
It has expired.

1001
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:01,764
From the first minutes we had him,
it was hopeless.

1002
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:06,136
- I believe this was explained to you.
- He's warm.

1003
01:26:06,269 --> 01:26:10,480
Yes. But if you will, please,
you must sign a release form.

1004
01:26:10,606 --> 01:26:11,721
It is required.

1005
01:26:13,901 --> 01:26:15,941
Does he, uh...

1006
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:21,947
Does he dream?

1007
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:25,944
No, there is no brain wave at all,
no sort of consciousness.

1008
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,867
Just a deep coma, a vegetable.

1009
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,206
No dreams, nothing.

1010
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:34,543
But even a...

1011
01:26:36,466 --> 01:26:38,791
...a plant, uh, feels something.

1012
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,718
Who can say? Please.

1013
01:26:40,845 --> 01:26:42,885
It, uh...

1014
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,556
...senses life. I mean, it, um...

1015
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:50,935
...turns towards the sun.

1016
01:26:52,107 --> 01:26:54,099
It's alive, isn't it?

1017
01:26:54,234 --> 01:26:55,562

You, uh...

1019
01:26:59,823 --> 01:27:01,862
You just leave him the way he is.

01:28:49,058 --> 01:28:53,139
<i>In my opinion we are confronted here</i>
<i>with something of a situation.</i>

1029
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,890
<i>Otherwise I would not have presumed</i>
<i>to take up your time.</i>

1030
01:28:58,777 --> 01:29:02,477
<i>Once again it concerns</i>
<i>the case of Jonathan E.</i>

1031
01:29:04,032 --> 01:29:08,160
<i>We know we don't want anything</i>
<i>extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.</i>

1032
01:29:08,286 --> 01:29:10,326
<i>We've already agreed on that.</i>

1033
01:29:11,331 --> 01:29:13,787
<i>No accidents, nothing unnatural.</i>

1034
01:29:14,876 --> 01:29:19,503
<i>The game was created to demonstrate</i>
<i>the futility of individual effort.</i>

1035
01:29:20,632 --> 01:29:22,874
<i>Let the game do its work.</i>

1036
01:29:23,802 --> 01:29:27,218
<i>If the Energy Corporation</i>
<i>has done all it can...</i>

1037
01:29:27,347 --> 01:29:31,677
<i>... and if a champion defeats the meaning</i>
<i>for which the game was designed...</i>

1038
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:34,431
<i>... then he must lose.</i>

1039
01:29:36,106 --> 01:29:38,644
<i>I hope you agree with my reasoning.</i>

1040
01:29:59,838 --> 01:30:02,508
<i>Thank you all.</i>

1041
01:30:58,356 --> 01:31:00,396
Will you follow me, please?

1042
01:31:37,312 --> 01:31:41,642
Hello! Hello! Yes, it is!

1043
01:31:41,775 --> 01:31:44,978
The famous Jonathan E. Oh, hard to believe!

1044
01:31:45,112 --> 01:31:47,021
Ah, sorry things are in a mess.

1045
01:31:47,155 --> 01:31:50,821
The rollerball champion. Hah, wonderful.

1046
01:31:50,951 --> 01:31:53,442
Not many people come to see us, you know.

1047
01:31:53,579 --> 01:31:56,496
We're not easy to talk to, Zero and I.

1048
01:31:56,623 --> 01:31:59,660
We're a little confused again here today.

1049
01:32:00,753 --> 01:32:02,792
This is embarrassing.

1050
01:32:04,006 --> 01:32:06,413
It's embarrassing to misplace things.

1051
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:08,590
You've misplaced some data?

1052
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,636
Mm, the whole of the 13th century.

1053
01:32:14,308 --> 01:32:18,092
Misplaced the computers,
several conventional computers.

1054
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:20,055
We can't find them.

1055
01:32:20,564 --> 01:32:24,183
We're always moving things around,
getting organised...

1056
01:32:25,611 --> 01:32:29,525
...my assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.

1057
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:33,198
Zero, he's the world's file cabinet.

1058
01:32:33,327 --> 01:32:37,539
Yes, pity. The poor old 13th century.

1059
01:32:41,127 --> 01:32:44,460
Well, come along now.
You want to get started, don't you?

1060
01:32:44,589 --> 01:32:46,628
Yes, sir.

1061
01:32:47,633 --> 01:32:49,673
- Ooh!
- Hm?

1062
01:32:53,848 --> 01:32:55,841
This way.

1063
01:32:55,975 --> 01:32:57,932
Now...

1064
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:00,552
...we've lost those computers...

1065
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:03,144
...with all of the 13th century in them.

1066
01:33:03,274 --> 01:33:07,983
Not much in the century,
just Dante, and a few corrupt popes.

1067
01:33:08,112 --> 01:33:11,813
But it's so distracting and annoying.

1068
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:15,069
You've unlimited restrictions here,
of course...

1069
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:19,414
...but, uh, you'll have to come
so... so many times.

1070
01:33:19,874 --> 01:33:22,116
It all takes such... such effort.

1071
01:33:22,252 --> 01:33:24,541
Do the, uh, executives still come here?

1072
01:33:24,671 --> 01:33:26,710
Oh, they used to, some of them.

1073
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,291
- What about the books?
- Books, books? They're all changed.

1074
01:33:30,427 --> 01:33:33,131
All transcribed. All information is here.

1075
01:33:33,263 --> 01:33:35,302
We've Zero, of course.

1076
01:33:35,473 --> 01:33:38,558
He's the central brain, the world's brain.

1077
01:33:38,935 --> 01:33:41,605
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.

1078
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,428
He's liquid, you see.

1079
01:33:43,565 --> 01:33:46,234
His... waters touch...

1080
01:33:46,693 --> 01:33:48,733
...all knowledge.

1081
01:33:52,324 --> 01:33:56,535
Everything we ask has become so,
ah, so complicated now.

1082
01:33:56,662 --> 01:33:58,286
Each thing we ask...

1083
01:33:58,413 --> 01:34:01,829
This morning we wanted to know
something about the 13th century.

1084
01:34:01,959 --> 01:34:04,663
He flows out into all our storage systems.

1085
01:34:04,795 --> 01:34:07,998
He considers everything. He's become so...

1086
01:34:08,674 --> 01:34:10,713
...ambiguous now...

1087
01:34:10,843 --> 01:34:13,927
...as if he knows... nothing at all.

1088
01:34:14,054 --> 01:34:16,972
Um, could you tell me something
about the corporate wars?

1089
01:34:17,099 --> 01:34:20,634
Wars, wars?
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here.

1090
01:34:20,769 --> 01:34:23,640
Punic War, Prussian War,
Peloponnesian War.

1091
01:34:23,772 --> 01:34:27,521
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.
One doesn't recall them in sequence...

1092
01:34:27,651 --> 01:34:29,977
...but, uh, corporate wars?

1093
01:34:30,112 --> 01:34:34,904
Hm. Well, Zero will or can,
I'm sure, tell you anything.

1094
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:47,537
A memory pool, you see.

1095
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:54,090
He's supposed to tell us where things are,
and what they might possibly mean.

1096
01:34:56,138 --> 01:34:58,594
Look, Zero. A visitor.

1097
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:02,678
Jonathan E, the rollerball champion.

1098
01:35:03,896 --> 01:35:06,981
You've filed away a lot of data on him.

1099
01:35:07,275 --> 01:35:09,314
Do you remember?

1100
01:35:10,695 --> 01:35:13,696
- Does it answer you?
- Oh, yes, it speaks.

1101
01:35:13,823 --> 01:35:15,863
It finds things...

1102
01:35:16,492 --> 01:35:18,532
...and loses them...

1103
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:21,414
...and confuses itself.

1104
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:27,410
Ask anything, he'll find it for you,
section and lot...

1105
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:30,252
...won't you, Zero?

1106
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,711
Well, all right, uh, I'd like, uh...

1107
01:35:35,136 --> 01:35:39,051
I'd like, uh, some information
about corporate decisions...

1108
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:41,554
How they're made and who makes them.

1109
01:35:46,356 --> 01:35:47,981
Zero...

1110
01:35:48,733 --> 01:35:50,726
...you heard the question.

1111
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:52,900
- Answer him.
- <i>(beep)</i>

1112
01:35:53,905 --> 01:35:55,364
<i>Negative.</i>

1113
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:58,859
You don't have to give him
a full political briefing.

1114
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,116
Answer.

1115
01:36:01,246 --> 01:36:02,575
<i>Negative.</i>

1116
01:36:02,706 --> 01:36:04,745
This is Jonathan E.

1117
01:36:05,417 --> 01:36:07,457
He has to know.

1118
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:10,209
Make it simple.

1119
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:12,627
Answer.

1120
01:36:12,758 --> 01:36:15,878
<i>Corporate decisions are made</i>
<i>by corporate executives.</i>

1121
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:19,462
- <i>Corporate executives make...</i>
- We have the answers. We do have them.

1122
01:36:19,598 --> 01:36:22,469
- <i>Knowledge converts to power.</i>
- We're the waters of history.

1123
01:36:22,601 --> 01:36:24,594
<i>Energy equals genius.</i>

1124
01:36:24,728 --> 01:36:26,804
- <i>Power is knowledge.</i>
- I don't want to bully you.

1125
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:28,978
<i>Genius is energy.</i>

1126
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:33,563
- <i>Corporate entities control elements...</i>
- You have to answer!

1127
01:36:33,696 --> 01:36:36,613
<i>... of economic life, technology, capital...</i>

1128
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:40,406
<i>... labour, and markets.</i>
<i>Corporate decisions are made by...</i>

1129
01:36:40,536 --> 01:36:43,027
- You have to, Zero!
- <i>... corporate executives...</i>

1130
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:44,741
<i>The 13th century...</i>

1131
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:49,085
- <i>Negative, negative, negative...</i>
- It's so... embarrassing!

1132
01:36:49,211 --> 01:36:51,881
<i>Negative, negative, negative...</i>

1133
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,497
<i>... negative, negative, negative, negative.</i>

# <i>Albinoni-Giazotto "Adagio"</i>

1135
01:37:25,582 --> 01:37:27,491
Hello, Johnny.

1136
01:37:27,917 --> 01:37:29,957
How are you, Ella?

1137
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:33,379
Nervous.

1138
01:37:35,884 --> 01:37:37,923
How are you?

1139
01:37:43,475 --> 01:37:46,345
I'm, uh... I'm all right, I guess.

1140
01:37:50,982 --> 01:37:52,560
What are you doing?

1141
01:37:52,692 --> 01:37:54,732
Oh, looking at you.

1142
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,569
Counting your scars.

1143
01:38:00,325 --> 01:38:02,994
Seeing how you've changed.

1144
01:38:03,286 --> 01:38:05,326
Oh, you mean, that's, uh...

1145
01:38:05,455 --> 01:38:08,990
That's how I've changed, huh?
Just a little more beat-up.

1146
01:38:09,126 --> 01:38:11,165
Oh, no!

1147
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,793
You're just not...

1148
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:17,380
Yeah, well.

1149
01:38:18,427 --> 01:38:20,466
Come on.

1150
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:35,768
You, uh, want a drink or something?

1151
01:38:35,903 --> 01:38:37,942
No, thank you.

1152
01:38:38,447 --> 01:38:40,605
You have a lovely place.

1153
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:43,742
Oh, thank you. Well, I've seen your house.

1154
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,659
You have?

1155
01:38:48,582 --> 01:38:51,038
Yeah, uh, when we, uh...

1156
01:38:51,794 --> 01:38:55,163
...played in Rome, I, uh, stood a block away...

1157
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:57,337
...and, uh...

1158
01:38:58,134 --> 01:39:01,218
...watched your front gate
for a couple of hours.

1159
01:39:04,265 --> 01:39:06,934
<i>(clears throat)</i> I was just, uh...

1160
01:39:09,437 --> 01:39:12,722
...standing there... wondering, uh...

1161
01:39:13,941 --> 01:39:16,397
...what your furniture looked like...

1162
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:19,279
...what you said to each other
in the mornings.

1163
01:39:21,157 --> 01:39:23,944
Yeah. What's he like? Uh...

1164
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:26,318
What's he do, this, uh...

1165
01:39:27,413 --> 01:39:29,904
- Oh, he's a city engineer.
- Ah!

1166
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:32,784
We have a... jet-copter...

1167
01:39:32,919 --> 01:39:34,746
...a son...

1168
01:39:34,879 --> 01:39:37,916
...two cats and a place in the Alps.

1169
01:39:39,634 --> 01:39:42,339
Well, you don't really want to hear all of this.

1170
01:39:43,429 --> 01:39:45,552
A son, huh?

1171
01:39:45,682 --> 01:39:47,306
Yes.

1172
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:53,269
We have a lot of friends.

1173
01:39:53,773 --> 01:39:57,142
And he has a lover.
We have furniture a lot like yours.

1174
01:39:58,862 --> 01:40:01,946
Same taste in furniture. How about that?

1175
01:40:06,453 --> 01:40:08,576
You know, Johnny...

1176
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:11,374
...all they want is a kind of incidental control...

1177
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,955
...over just a part of our lives.

1178
01:40:14,085 --> 01:40:16,956
They have control
economically and politically...

1179
01:40:17,089 --> 01:40:19,330
...but they also provide. You know they do.

1180
01:40:19,466 --> 01:40:21,506
Provide, huh?

1181
01:40:25,973 --> 01:40:28,890
They were responsible for taking you away...

1182
01:40:29,017 --> 01:40:31,224
...and I started to hate 'em.

1183
01:40:31,353 --> 01:40:33,393
But they weren't.

1184
01:40:34,147 --> 01:40:36,187
It was the game, Johnny.

1185
01:40:42,823 --> 01:40:44,401
I mean...

1186
01:40:44,533 --> 01:40:46,989
...it was so important to you.

1187
01:40:51,081 --> 01:40:53,323
It was as if I wasn't even there.

1188
01:40:57,379 --> 01:41:00,250
The play, there was nothing else.

1189
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,050
I'm sorry.

1190
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:11,268
You know I wanted you here.

1191
01:41:11,435 --> 01:41:13,891
Well, I mean...

1192
01:41:14,355 --> 01:41:17,439
...this might sound all wrong, but, um...

1193
01:41:19,193 --> 01:41:21,862
Well, I was just trying to...

1194
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:24,778
...remember myself then.

1195
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:29,493
Yeah.

1196
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:33,499
Maybe it was, uh...

1197
01:41:35,293 --> 01:41:37,962
...Iove I wanted to try to remember.

1198

I want to talk to you about.

Yeah.

1200

I've been thinking, Ella...

...thinking a lot.

1204
01:42:19,838 --> 01:42:23,123
...had a choice a long time ago between...

1205
01:42:23,258 --> 01:42:25,416
...well, having all them nice things...

1206
01:42:25,552 --> 01:42:28,387
...or, uh... freedom.

1207
01:42:29,181 --> 01:42:31,220
Of course, they, uh...

1208
01:42:32,017 --> 01:42:34,056
...chose comfort.

1209
01:42:34,227 --> 01:42:36,469
<i>(Ella)</i> But comfort is freedom.

1210
01:42:36,772 --> 01:42:39,014
It always has been.

1211
01:42:39,149 --> 01:42:43,562
The whole history of civilisation is
the struggle against poverty and need.

1212
01:42:43,695 --> 01:42:47,396
No! No, that... that's not it.
That's never been it.

1217

1218
01:43:03,716 --> 01:43:05,755

- Yes.

Did they tell you to stay
if, uh... if I did quit?

1231

Are you my big reward?

1232
