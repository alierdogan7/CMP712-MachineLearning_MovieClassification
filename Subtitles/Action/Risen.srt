1
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,668
Roman, huh?

2
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,730
That's a Tribune's ring?

3
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:55,157
Yes.

4
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,600
Have you come far?

5
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,899
Now! Cmon!

6
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,999
Cmon!

7
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,864
Thirty years the Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar
has ruled the wasteland of Judea and its people.

8
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,848
Barabbas! Barabbas!

9
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,098
As Tribune to Prefect Ponpiu Pilate,

10
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,900
my task is to keep order in a city
that is distinct in unrest.

11
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:48,700
The Jews pray to their single God, Yahweh,
for the arrival of the mystical Messiah.

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,524
As their religious leader,
the Sanhedrin try to keep an uneasy peace.

13
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:58,112
But each day creates more zealous
to challenge the rule of Rome,

14
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:02,700
and bring freedom.
Instead, we bring them death.

15
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,650
Kill them all!

16
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,379
Position! Throw!

17
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,296
Hold this line!

18
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,150
Tribune!

19
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,750
We have Barabbas!

20
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,619
Bring him!

21
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,873
I know how this ends.

22
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,398
Then tell Yahweh's you are coming,
courtesy of Mars.

23
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,450
It must pain you to know that
the one true God, chooses us over you.

24
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,450
But not today, he didn't.

25
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,050
But when the Messiah comes,
Rome will be nothing!

26
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,648
Until then...

27
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,550
Tribune, Pilate summons you! 

28
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,982
I'm yet sticky with filth.
No matter, there's more trouble.

29
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Come on! Come on!

30
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,200
Did you win?

31
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,500
I was told to hurry.

32
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,079
In truth, you're well dressed for this job.

33
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:46,784
Whats happened?
Passover!

34
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:51,028
Every hot headed and holy fool
in Judea was here stirring havoc.

35
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Some mystic, one of the following vibe making
waves to the Sanhedrin decided to put him down. 

36
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,100
He sent a rather mob here,
screaming for his blood,

37
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,950
because he claims to be their Messiah.

38
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,450
I had to crucify him.

39
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,300
Don't give me that look!
I've had enough already.

40
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,350
I had a situation Tribune,
something that you don't seem to understand.

41
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,750
Soon the Emperor arrives here,
and he expects to find, order.

42
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,850
Order!

43
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,900
What does he want of me, Prefect?

44
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,900
Take control out there and finish things.

45
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:47,050
This is gone long enough.

46
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,550
And do this Nazarene a small mercy.

47
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,550
Break his legs.

48
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,500
Clavius, meet your new aide.

49
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,100
Lucius Ticonius Enius.
His father's a friend.

50
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,714
It's an honor, Tribune.

51
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,386
What sky is this?
Lost out the sunshine.

52
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Woh! Easy.

53
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Poseidon is unhappy.

54
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,355
Some God is.

55
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,200
I hate it when they scream, I hate it.

56
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
It could last for days up there.

57
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,200
Get back now!

58
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,700
Centurion, how goes this?

59
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,904
It's a strange day, Tribune.
It was just a tremor.

60
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,698
Not that. Too much dark in here.

61
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,250
But this King...something's wrong.
The mob feel it.

62
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,650
Light a few.
Show him the rod.

63
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,600
The Nazarene, is he dead now? 

64
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,850
After only six hours.

65
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,150
It can't be! Has he spoken?

66
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,100
Has he spoken?
Just before the tremor.

67
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,650
He said, 'it's finished'.

68
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,350
See that it is.

69
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,912
Finally.

70
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,743
Won't be long now.

71
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,804
It's the Nazarene's mother.

72
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:52,275
Hold!

73
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,658
Use the pulley.

74
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,050
Get that woman's to shut up!

75
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,550
Keep her quiet!

76
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Feel unlucky today?

77
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,266
This man was innocent.

78
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,231
Still yourself now.

79
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,949
Go on! And tell the Prefect is done.

80
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,210
Disperse! It's over!

81
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,856
Go on home!

82
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:03,703
Move! Leave now! Leave!

83
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,200
That's it! Let it go. That's it, let it go.
You're free now.

84
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,250
Breathe!

85
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,339
That's it, let it go.

86
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,345
Take the pliers!

87
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,950
Never killed a king before.

88
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,300
Where is it!

89
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,720
Tribune, I come from Pilate.
Please read this.

90
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,466
You are Arimathea?
I am.

91
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,500
Your own family tomb.

92
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,300
What's he to you?

93
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,750
The Sabbath is almost here.
I only need two hours.

94
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,700
Please.

95
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,448
He's yours.

96
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,700
Nicodemus hurry!

97
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,850
Mary!

98
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,539
Leave him.

99
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,362
Sir?

100
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,369
Go find your centurion.
These will bury him.

101
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,700
Please Tribune.

102
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,550
Gently! Gently!

103
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,500
Come, Clavius, soak this day away.

104
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
Fill his cup. Keep it filled.

105
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,000
What do you desire?
A meal, a massage, a girl?

106
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,900
Just this.
You're young...

107
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,200
a night's rest, you will do it all again.

108
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,450
Your service is valued, Tribune.

109
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,500
I rely on it.

110
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,862
So, ask pardon if today I seemed heft.

111
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,810
Don't matter.

112
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,941
Is the Nazarene entombed?

113
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:49,800
I pushed the stone against it myself.
It was huge stone.

114
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:53,063
Many a lives.
Transpired with him.

115
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:57,059
It's a strange case.
I've never seen a death so wished for.

116
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:01,123
Even by Him!
As if he wanted to be sacrificed.

117
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:05,206
They are fanatics.
Yahweh deranges them.

118
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,034
Yes, no other Gods.
None left.

119
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,400
I myself pray only to Minerva.

120
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,950
For wisdom. You?

121
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,550
Mars.
Of course.

122
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,100
Let's hope of of them hears us.

123
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:24,698
I could use the help.

124
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,000
One does what he knows.
I wish the man you were.

125
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:34,600
Spare me.
It's your bath too.

126
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,850
Your ambition is noticed.

127
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,350
Where do you hope it would lead?

128
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,200
Rome.

129
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,848
And?

130
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,110
Position, Power.
Which brings?

131
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:55,448
Wealth.

132
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,846
A big family, someday a place in the country.

133
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,002
Where will you find...

134
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,850
An end of a trail.

135
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,100
A day without death.

136
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,700
Peace.

137
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,028
All that for peace?

138
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,900
Is there no other way?

139
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,563
Well, I'm to bed.

140
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:28,110
Tomorrow promises further punishments.

141
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,800
The Nazarene...did you find him different?

142
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,400
I found him dead.

143
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
So you did.

144
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,559
Peace, Tribune. Have a good night.
Good night.

145
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,300
A coin for the ferryman.

146
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,950
Journey well, Gaius Elius.

147
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,777
Legion forward!

148
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,677
Legion 10!

149
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Tribune, Pilate summoned you.

150
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,650
Ave, Prefect!

151
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,400
I smell of meat. A feast?

152
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,200
Funeral.

153
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,500
There's your solution!
Burn them in public.

154
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,670
God forbids cremation.

155
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:32,898
He also forbids labor on Sabbaths.
And, yet, here you are

156
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,150
Tribune.

157
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,550
Why to Ardeth?
To crucify Nazareth.

158
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,129
Why?

159
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:43,252
His business is unfinished.
The man is dead, Caiaphas.

160
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:48,598
His followers are in hiding.
He is no longer a threat to you monopoly on piety.

161
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,950
But still a threat, don't you think?

162
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,900
While alive, that deceiver said
HE would rise again after three days.

163
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,900
He foretold.

164
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,848
We request that the sarcophagus be sealed

165
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,700
so that his disciples don't come
at night and steal the body.

166
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,250
Not to say then HE has arisen from the dead.

167
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,900
That would cause more unrest in the city,
than all these blasphemies combined.  

168
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,550
You have your own guards, secure yourself.
My words exactly!

169
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,950
To which I reply we need a Roman seal.

170
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,777
This should appear as the
impartial will of the Prefect.

171
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,648
And not yours.

172
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,200
We only see what Caesar sees.

173
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,800
Peace in Jerusalem.
Peace in Judea.

174
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,150
What you'll lose, if this body vanishes.

175
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,650
Hence why summon me.
Just see to it.

176
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,150
Satisfy yourself.

177
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,874
Seal it. Seal.

178
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,350
No one touches those seals until sunset tomorrow.
Understood?

179
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,950
Then tell the priests.

180
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,400
Where's your centurion? He's not himself, Sir.
Not since yesterday.

181
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,700
Is that what pains you?
No, Sir, no.

182
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,650
It's just, we'd have a night off.

183
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,447
I'll have rations sent.

184
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,905
You are Sanhedrin, too?

185
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,298
Yes.

186
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,500
Thy brothers despise you,
yet you mourn Him.

187
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,900
He was very special.

188
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,946
A king?

189
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:47,706
You test me, Tribune?

190
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,450
What was His name, the Nazarene?

191
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,943
He was called Yeshua.

192
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,460
Move!

193
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,688
He forgot. You know he did.

194
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,915
If he had sent food,
he would have told.

195
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,100
He is an Officer.

196
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:50,800
If we forget, can you phantom the pieces!?

197
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,400
I was saving it for supper, but...

198
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,950
Oh! You absolute champion!

199
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,150
I thought we lost the lot.

200
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Tribune, Pilate summons you.

201
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,950
He is gone!

202
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,543
The Nazarene? Of course the Nazarene!

203
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:53,362
His tomb, his stone empty!
Who brought the news? The guards?

204
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:56,298
Your guards are missing.
Some simpleton reported it!

205
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,282
Who did you put on the detail?

206
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:01,098
I want them to be found and
lashed to death, preferably!

207
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,198
Let me investigate.

208
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,650
That would be helpful before Caiaphas and
his pack of raving Jews show up here.

209
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,700
Too late.

210
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
Tribune.

211
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,650
Shall we dispense with the lies?

212
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,399
The guards have told me.
They came to you!?

213
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:23,250
Seeking sanctuary.
They know the penalty for sleeping on duty.

214
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,100
What happened?
Exactly what I predicted.

215
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,300
The Heretic disciples came
in the night and stole the body.

216
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,531
Already they're proclaiming,
He has arisen from the dead!

217
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:36,500
And the people believe it?
The weak, will.

218
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,250
Others want to.
So we must announce the theft.

219
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,593
Will they believe you?

220
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:47,348
They'll believe the guards
if they kill themselves.

221
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,950
It never ends!
Proclaim it.

222
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:52,150
Before this blossoms.

223
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,650
It's not enough!

224
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,500
Without a corpse to prove him dead,
we have a potential Messiah.

225
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,938
I want no doubt.
Tiberius cannot arrive to unrest!

226
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,648
We must find a body!

227
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,835
Will you help?
Of course, but proclaim it.

228
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,661
My confidence in you is misplaced, Tribune.

229
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:19,998
Perhaps you prefer a post in hell.

230
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,117
You will track each and
everyone of these disciples,

231
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,698
but more importantly you will
find this cursed body of Yeshua!

232
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,609
Before it rots.

233
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,123
Bring me Arimateean

234
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,249
You! Get me Arimateean.

235
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,846
As if they burst!

236
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,900
Tribune, see this!

237
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,790
Where has he gone?
You tell me.

238
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,750
The body was it embalmed?

239
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,794
We had no time.
We just wrapped in myrrh and aloe.

240
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,325
This is what you see. Sweat and herbs.
Bring it!

241
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,338
I want nothing touched here.
Post a watch.

242
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,257
Control was enters and leaves Jerusalem.

243
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,999
Arrest anyone who claims Nazarene lives.
And find out where they heard it.

244
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,001
Yes, Tribune.

245
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:36,317
And comb the city for bodies,
dead in the last week.

246
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,848
Examine for each marks of crucified.

247
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,750
Dig them up?

248
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
Everyone!

249
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,888
And bring Him to me personally.

250
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,700
Tribune, I said in private.

251
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,350
Where's your fellow?

252
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,600
He doesn't wish to speak.

253
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,300
Truly?

254
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,104
He had problems about the Nazarene's theft.

255
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:38,414
He is afraid, as am I.
You should be.

256
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,100
You disgrace me.

257
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,350
Sleeping on firsts-pen is death.

258
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,700
But the Prefect has spared you.

259
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
Both can return to the barracks.

260
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,950
Unpunished?
If you bear us honestly of what happened.

261
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,350
I was attacked in the night
while I was sleeping

262
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,750
by the Nazarene rabid disciples.

263
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,650
They stole his body.
And now they're he had risen.  

264
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,650
Rabid? How many Attache?

265
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
8, 10...I don't know for sure.
All armed?

266
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:18,500
Yes.

267
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,350
You saw all this while sleeping?
No, I...we...

268
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:28,085
We woke as they were cutting the rope.

269
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,811
Cutting the rope?
Yes.

270
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,500
Then they rolled over the stone.

271
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,350
Took his body and ran.
While you watched?

272
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,550
Yes, but we were held at spear point.

273
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Soldier?

274
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,389
Have you been told to say these things? Hmm?

275
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,150
You were drinking that night.
No.

276
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,531
No? No.

277
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,069
What else is a lie?

278
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,949
Open the doors!

279
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,901
Stolen? So they claim.

280
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,198
Well...so what?

281
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,925
They are really in fear,
he rose from death.

282
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,963
Hmm, uh...perhaps a Messiah.

283
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:49,250
Anyways, I ahh...
Arrest him!

284
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,800
Turn him!

285
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,000
How old is this one? 
At least a week.

286
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,200
These? The thieves he died with.

287
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,200
Put down.

288
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,202
In two days they will be unrecognizable.

289
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:12,844
Wait till you see combat.

290
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:31,727
No.

291
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,478
The hand's missing.
See the hole in the other?

292
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,219
Not him.
Legs are broken.

293
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:40,176
That's why we need your eyes, Tribune.

294
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:42,742
This grave here is very hasty and shallow.

295
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:56,572
Well? We've questioned 11,

296
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:58,116
you should examine.

297
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,650
One I suspect could be a disciple.

298
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,100
Excuse me, Tribune.
Take some chicory.

299
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,950
Each time, your stomach runs to these things.

300
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,450
Bring them in, one by one.
Sir.

301
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,850
Who took the body?
I don't know.

302
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,600
They are saying, you are an honest man.

303
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
And a follower of Yeshua.

304
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,150
Truth will not be fatal today.

305
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,200
I was moved by what,
He said and what He taught.

306
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,406
I felt He didn't deserve such a death.

307
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,702
They ripped up a tomb to steal a corpse...

308
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:50,658
and promote a lie that threatens
Rome and the Sanhedrin.

309
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,835
It was not Yeshua's followers.

310
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:55,150
Not the true ones.

311
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,900
They were heart broken.

312
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,750
So you are saying, he has risen?

313
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,150
To lead Israel against us.

314
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,084
The Messiah.

315
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:13,433
Do you believe that?

316
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,250
If he had lived,

317
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,850
I think Yeshua would
embrace you as a brother.

318
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,800
Even if you eschew him.

319
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,300
Leave us.

320
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,745
I wish I had the means.
But I'm forced to break you.

321
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,650
One thing has been withheld from you, Tribune.

322
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:55,100
I confess, you asked if he was the king?

323
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,450
I'll return his crown.

324
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,100
Sit.

325
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,050
Why do you tremble?

326
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
You are a Roman.

327
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,900
You were heard shouting,
'Yeshua yet lives!'

328
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,950
Joyously, says the report.

329
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,550
Why, you didn't obviously see him.
I heard on the street!

330
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,300
From the passers-by?
No, I heard Him.

331
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,126
Yeshua?
Two days ago.

332
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,212
I know voices.

333
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,650
I hear them.
I have no doubt.

334
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,950
Were you a follower of Nazarene, Miriam?

335
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,600
Or just a follower of a follower?

336
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,350
He loved me.

337
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,100
An old woman...he lifted me up.

338
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,850
Lifted you?

339
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,100
If you knew, you would understand.

340
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:19,050
Stop saying people lifted from the dead.

341
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,650
Come.

342
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,550
Don't you wish to know what he said?
Of course.

343
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,250
You are seeds already cursed.

344
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
You are too late.

345
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,256
Next one truly, Tribune.
Next one, I believe!

346
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:25,987
I pray not to you thee, today Mars,
but to the Hebrew God, Yahweh.

347
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:26,989
Hear me?

348
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,270
Take back you defend and save these people

349
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:32,648
and relinquish them to me.

350
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,748
If you do this with clear recognizable signs,

351
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,282
I vow to erect temples for you.
And initiate games in your honor.

352
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,550
You know what I seek?

353
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:55,482
Yes.

354
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,100
So who told you the crucified
Nazarene was alive?

355
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,700
A friend...

356
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,300
of a friend.

357
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,100
A friend of Yeshua.
Perhaps a disciple?

358
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,700
Whatever you say,
make it the truth.

359
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,300
This friend said he was told...

360
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,850
that the sighting was stolen by two women.

361
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,850
They went to the tomb before dawn that morning.
And found it empty.

362
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,100
And later met Yeshua on the road.

363
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,350
Alive.

364
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,650
Their names?

365
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,050
One way of another,
we will have our answer.

366
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,350
I know only one.

367
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
It's one of the woman stead...

368
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
Mary Magdalena.

369
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:10,167
Last time she was spotted was
the morning the body was stolen.

370
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,448
Early! Not seen since.

371
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,050
That's all I have, Tribune.

372
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:18,148
Where does it work? Work?
She is off a street.

373
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,200
You are bringing no one to identify her?
Who? Who would that be?

374
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,350
Who among you knows the woman Mary Magdalen?

375
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,407
They out-fled us.
So we had to withdraw.

376
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,198
A fighting retreat.

377
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,300
Some dozens of us were dragged
and caught up in the hills.

378
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,000
Down in the valley that night
I heard them screaming.

379
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:55,165
I looked up.

380
00:40:55,167 --> 00:41:00,060
To see them stacked up on their rooftops.

381
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,700
So you could have watched,
that is why you are offered no quarter.

382
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,348
Is that her?

383
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,389
No.

384
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,749
That's her!

385
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,278
Halt!

386
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,950
There she is!

387
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,650
Hmm?
Ah, um.

388
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,950
Shouldn't be alone, Mary.

389
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,750
Why did you run from us?

390
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,750
Instinct.

391
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,750
I had seen you before.

392
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,600
My older life?

393
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,197
Yeshua's death you were there beside His mother.

394
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,145
Were you the woman beside His tomb?

395
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,500
If you know what's happened there...

396
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,150
Who cares who sees.
Enlighten me, then.

397
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,800
It's beyond us...

398
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,950
Spare me the riddles and zed babbles.

399
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,600
Where did you take Yeshua?

400
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,557
He is right here.
Is he a convent?

401
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,874
A Sprite? Where light begins somewhere?

402
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,522
Open your heart and see.
I see delusion.

403
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:45,812
To keep a crusade alive.

404
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,878
I could have what I want from you.
But you do like that.

405
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,377
It doesn't matter.

406
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,888
Ah! A martyr.
No!

407
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,848
Then give me the others and
I shall grant you, your freedom.

408
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,600
I'm already free.

409
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,950
Show me the Messiah!

410
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,600
Alive or dead.

411
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,600
Show me those who follow him.

412
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,900
You look for something,
you will never find, Tribune.

413
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,350
You look for the wrong time.

414
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,150
She's mad. Refuses to talk sense.

415
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,050
Perhaps a witch, Sir?
Should I have her stoned? At least a start?

416
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,900
Just...let her go.

417
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,950
Sir?

418
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,050
Release her.
The woman's touched.

419
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,425
Two days without sleep, Tribune.
You start seeing things.

420
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,100
When that turns, wake me.
Sir.

421
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
You, up!

422
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,450
Move!

423
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,350
Tribune, the sand has run out.

424
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,695
Pilate summons you.

425
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,809
You are digging up the death?
No stone unturned, Prefect.

426
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,695
A Hebrew cemetery?

427
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,950
Do you want to go?
He was Jewish and deceased.

428
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,900
Do you not realize the wrath incurred?

429
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,110
I know in a day or two,
wrath won't matter.

430
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:52,248
Nature will take its course.

431
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,643
Caesar's spies will hear all of this.

432
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:57,755
An unfortunate dilemma.

433
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,550
For both of us, Tribune.

434
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,100
I want his body here! By tonight!

435
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,450
Disciples are key.
Find them, we find Him.

436
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,350
For your help.

437
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,900
There is more, if you assist us further.

438
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,950
The Nazarene's disciples.

439
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,950
How many are there and their names?

440
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,100
Their plans, their weapon caches.

441
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,450
Where they gather, who leads them now.

442
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,950
Where they hiding His corpse.

443
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,750
Work quickly.

444
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,950
There are 12.

445
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,800
Well, 11, now.

446
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,350
Yeshua's inner circle.

447
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,750
All hiding now, I know not where.
Do you have their name?

448
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,350
I will give you one.

449
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,400
Who is Bartholomew?
I am, he.

450
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,950
Bring him.

451
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,950
What do you have to win by spreading fantasy?
I saw with my own eyes, Tribune!

452
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:48,100
I walked with him, he spoke to me!

453
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,900
Of course, it's unbelievable,
but it is, Sir!

454
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,150
Then conjure him up.
Right now.

455
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,229
Or show me the body.

456
00:47:57,231 --> 00:47:59,093
He must have shed the snake skin.

457
00:47:59,095 --> 00:48:01,951
God is not on my beck and call.

458
00:48:01,953 --> 00:48:03,376
God?

459
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:07,712
Yahweh manifests himself through
a crazy, poor dead Jew?

460
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,134
Well, so it appears!

461
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,300
What does this rebirth mean?

462
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,300
Eternal life!

463
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,526
For everyone.
For everyone who believes.

464
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,120
Now He's recruiting too.

465
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,298
Much better than assault.
How many of you are?

466
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,000
Well, we are few for now.
Our only weapon is love.

467
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,100
But this...well, this changes everything!

468
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,100
What are your intentions?

469
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,324
Why do you fear Him, Sir?
This Empire means nothing to him.

470
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:54,400
Render onto Caesar what is Caesar's.
That's what we taught us.

471
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,300
And if I ordered your crucifixion?

472
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:02,350
What? I would happily submit. Strike!

473
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,650
Have you watched a man crucified?

474
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:11,887
No.

475
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,050
No? Well we won't be seeing Him again.

476
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,550
Probably because you ran.

477
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,350
Did you?

478
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,550
Shall I tell you what you missed.

479
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:29,934
Feel it!

480
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,950
Imagine having this driven through your arms.

481
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,091
And then the same driven through your fee.
Do you imagine it?

482
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:49,372
That's what you hang from.
Nails rubbing on bone.

483
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:55,771
You have to decide what's worse.
The agony here...

484
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,110
or here?

485
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,350
You choose what torture your weight
will inflict constantly...

486
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,250
and then you discover you can't breathe.

487
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,700
They you realize you will never
be able to breathe easily again.

488
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,850
With every breath of your horrific life,

489
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:15,200
will be like sucking through wet cloth.

490
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,500
Yes, Yeshua was lucky.
He only hung only for a few hours.

491
00:50:18,502 --> 00:50:21,150
Most take days.

492
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,800
Gosh! Know what it means to kill,

493
00:50:23,802 --> 00:50:27,648
still if he even felt anything at the end,
I'm sure it's the tip of the spear pressed against his heart.

494
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,104
Then maybe I didn't look closely,

495
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:31,789
but they must have had their bone
breaking getting him down.

496
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:34,825
Sometimes they bury them with...nails.
Enough...

497
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,600
...speak of His body.

498
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,600
It's just hideous to look upon right now.

499
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,150
I ask you one last time...

500
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:51,000
Where are the others disciples?
I won't ask again.

501
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,200
Tell me and you'll be free.

502
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,000
Give you all that?

503
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,200
You have my word.

504
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,450
Where am they?

505
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,783
They...are everywhere!

506
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,050
How many of this?

507
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,850
None you can still recognize.

508
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,931
What should be do, Tribune?

509
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,250
It's Him?

510
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,850
So the nail holes here, here and here.

511
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:42,050
The wound on the side.
But the face? I can't tell.

512
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,461
Nor can anyone else.

513
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,650
Let him be some, Prefect.

514
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,500
At this point, any corpse could be the Nazarene.

515
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,850
Still I could find who took him.
That's the threat.

516
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,650
Threat is a creature with many heads.

517
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,100
Right now I need you elsewhere.
Trouble in Hebron.

518
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:17,000
Something, yet needs unravelling with this.
Just allow me till next week.

519
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,300
Next week, I need you in Hebron.

520
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,200
You are dangerously clever, Tribune.

521
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,650
And what if I turn my back on you?

522
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,700
That's what I fear the most, Prefect.

523
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,196
From the same cloth.

524
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:43,947
I remember when I was you...
So sure, so...

525
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:47,665
I forget.

526
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,900
But in the end, what does it all matter? Really?
Pardon?

527
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,200
In a few years...that's us.

528
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,000
Open!

529
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,800
What goes?

530
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,700
Rumor has it, we are heading to Hebron.

531
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,900
So, I took the liberty, Tribune.

532
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,100
Your twin guards have been sighted.

533
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,582
They finally fled the temple.
Where?

534
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:28,059
It's unclear.

535
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:30,251
Bartius said they had
come into for some money.

536
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,850
I wish you the triumph, Sir.

537
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,050
And things will happen in time.

538
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,600
Your ambition is noticed.

539
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,500
A! Yes, it's a nice song.

540
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,650
Pricey wine for a legionary.

541
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,850
You have you been hiding!
Where did you get something like this?

542
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,900
Off a dead man.

543
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,600
Of course.

544
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,900
So, I been pardoned by the Prefect.

545
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,650
Pardoned.

546
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,950
Nothing can be done to me now.

547
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,700
I said what they...was proclaimed.

548
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,650
Say it again.

549
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,348
What?

550
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:08,200
To see how your tail matches your legs.

551
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,996
We were attacked in the night while sleeping,
by the rabid assault...

552
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,828
Sanhedrin paid you to say this.

553
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,437
They stole his body!

554
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:21,829
And His side we were...!

555
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,334
How did the stone get 10 paces
away from the tomb?

556
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:28,075
Takes seven people, including myself,
just to roll it down! 

557
00:56:28,077 --> 00:56:31,298
The ropes were not cut.
They were torn as if they were thread.

558
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,742
Seal melted like butter.
Should we go there?

559
00:56:33,744 --> 00:56:34,854
No!

560
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,000
What troubles you so?

561
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,100
No more lies!

562
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,900
How did they take him?

563
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,050
What happened to the Nazarene's body?

564
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,368
You had forgotten us!

565
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,346
Forgot! We had no supper.

566
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,250
That's what the mine made us!
Somebody eh, eh...eh, we slept.

567
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,398
We been up, two days since the crucifixion.

568
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,000
What could happen?
God in a body of a dead man, so...

569
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,900
We took us turns until the...

570
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,330
Until what?

571
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:23,750
Until we were awakened by this terrible...

572
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,150
this terrible...

573
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,400
this terrible flash.

574
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,020
The night was grandly...

575
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:34,903
The air smell burned and
ropes they just exploded.

576
00:57:34,905 --> 00:57:38,382
And stone flew like a leaf and
all of a sudden, the sun...

577
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,241
rose in the tomb.

578
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,906
That was the sun.

579
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,150
It was...

580
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,400
it was everything.

581
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,361
And then a figure...figure appeared...
I could not gaze upon...

584
00:57:56,26 3 --> 00:57:58,383
The terrible light and...

582
00:57:58,485 --> 00:58:00,434
it wasn't a man.

583
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,700
It wasn't...

584
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,559
And there was this voice all around,
I could not phantom.

585
00:58:07,561 --> 00:58:13,243
And we were running so far.
Running...so far, until...

586
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,800
until we could think again!

587
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:26,100
Then we went told the priest because
that's what you made us do.

588
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,050
And Caiaphas paid you for a different story.

589
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,550
Tribune...

590
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:39,100
I saw much in the service of the Emperor.

591
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,836
Cannibals...

592
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,295
Blue colts in gold, and...

593
00:58:45,295 --> 00:58:49,345
I seen a man taken by a serpent in the sea...

594
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,150
Never I witnessed a moment so...

595
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,800
So...

596
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,550
Explain it to me.

597
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,550
You were drunk.

598
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,200
You saw the sun burst.

599
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,100
The wine in twine was tainted.

600
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,350
Truly?

601
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,300
What do you suppose?

602
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,848
Maybe it was opium, or frankincense.

603
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:33,600
Maybe the disciples stole the
Nazarene's body with magic,

604
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,150
as the priest said.

605
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,100
Maybe our story is true.

606
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,200
What else could it be?

607
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,400
I don't know.

608
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,950
So...I'm drinking.

609
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,622
Sir! Tribune!

610
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,641
We have them.

611
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,300
It's the Romans!

612
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,043
Hurry! Hurry! Quickly!

613
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,100
That's the house.
That's where I lost him.

614
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,448
Lost?
I believe that's where he went!

615
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,231
Believe?
Yes, so...I was coming to tell you.

616
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,700
I saw other disciples coming this way.

617
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:39,555
They favor the upstairs.
My give me the paper!

618
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,685
Romans! This way!

619
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,947
Tribune!

620
01:01:57,949 --> 01:02:00,630
You six, on every side of home!

621
01:02:00,632 --> 01:02:02,308
You five, other side.

622
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,046
I want two in line pair-some!
Come on! Move!

623
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:08,036
Cmon move! Up! Up on the way back!

624
01:02:13,879 --> 01:02:15,092
No.

625
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,450
Tribune! Anything?

626
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,150
Tribune?

627
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,600
Nothing.

628
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,450
Stand down.
Return to camp.

629
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,749
Sir...

630
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:38,300
Tribune?
Stand down!

631
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,750
Look for me shortly.

632
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,650
Tribune! Sir we're close!
I feel it!

633
01:03:45,652 --> 01:03:49,150
I don't need you for this.

634
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,750
I don't need you.

635
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,900
Sir.

636
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,400
Stand down!

637
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,550
Soldiers, return now!

638
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,575
March on!

639
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,550
Welcome, Clavius.

640
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,900
Come join us, brother.

641
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,050
There are no enemies here.

642
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,298
Thomas!

643
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,333
Lord!
Thomas, where have you been?

644
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,350
I'm sorry!

645
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:19,400
I'm sorry!

646
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:22,183
Why are you sorry?

647
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,150
We have no one to fear.

648
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
We are free.

649
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,100
Touch me.

650
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,222
This.

651
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,870
How can this be?

652
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,900
Yeshua!

653
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,450
Yeshua!

654
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,093
Yeshua! Yeshua!

655
01:06:34,095 --> 01:06:36,376
Is he coming back?
Where did he go?

656
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,650
How would I know?

657
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,850
What now? Simon?

658
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:51,950
He said to stay to Jerusalem
until we receive some Spirit.

659
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,129
What riches did we see?
I don't know.

660
01:06:56,131 --> 01:06:58,379
Galilee. What?

661
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,450
When He appeared in the road,

662
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,500
Yeshua said:

663
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:04,198
Tell my brothers to got to Galilee.

664
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,630
There they will see me.
He told me this.

665
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:08,025
I have seen him.

666
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,100
In Galilee you will see him once more.

667
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:18,500
Take care of Him.

668
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,600
Simon!

669
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,400
So, we go.

670
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,650
We go, Mariam.
My brothers.

671
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,883
Goodbye, Mariam.
Goodbye, brother.

672
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,900
Is it a ransom?

673
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,950
Do not seek me.

674
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,350
Do not follow or wander.

675
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,350
Persecute no one on my behalf.

676
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:45,950
I have seen two things which cannot reconcile.

677
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:53,300
A man dead, without question.
And that same man alive again.

678
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:58,724
I pursue the Nazarene to ferret the truth.

679
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,850
Clavius ​​Aquila Valerius.

680
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,200
It's his seal, Sir.

681
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:14,350
Must be a plague.
My right hand turned against me.

682
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,900
How could he follow a Hebrew?

683
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,050
Perhaps...

684
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,700
it's true.
What if it is...?

685
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,981
I'll kill him again.

686
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,133
Brothers lets go.

687
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,250
Alive, if you can.

688
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:40,600
Although dead, would be less embarrassing.

689
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,200
I'll be in Caesarea.

690
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,950
Sir.

691
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,900
Coming out. North of Galilee.

692
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,200
Ten days to the Emperor arrives.

693
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,018
Ten days.

694
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:06,751
Forward!

695
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,906
I brought water!

696
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,050
Water!

697
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,720
That's a scar.
I hope you know that.

698
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:30,804
Yahweh!

699
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:32,944
Our word is your name.

700
01:12:32,946 --> 01:12:35,150
Give us the daily bread.

701
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:41,225
And forgive us our treas, as so we forgive...

702
01:12:42,254 --> 01:12:44,910
We must not lead into temptation.

703
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,015
But away...from evil.

704
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,518
Amen.

705
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,271
A son of Yahweh...

706
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,500
And you believe him?

707
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:24,600
Do you believe?

708
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:28,550
After this, yes!

709
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,600
He raises from the dead, eats, sleeps
and then disappears.

710
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,850
He has a body.

711
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,650
The same vessel Yahweh gives all men.

712
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,400
It is how he reached out to all of us.

713
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,350
I haven't every answer.

714
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,283
We were astounded too!

715
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,000
Why did not show himself to all then?

716
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,800
He can he be slayed once more?

717
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,950
I don't know! I don't know...

718
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:08,666
I wish I did but I don't know.

719
01:14:08,668 --> 01:14:10,894
The answer is waiting in Galilee.

720
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:15,823
We are followers.
We follow to find out.

721
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,661
I think he is preparing us.

722
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:29,040
For what?

723
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,200
Down.

724
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,800
Pilate will not let this rest.

725
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,784
I've endangered you.

726
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:05,088
They have a tracker.

727
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:11,192
They can't know we are up here.

728
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,010
They already do.

729
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,700
They are up after blood.

730
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,480
They are here to scare us.

731
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,451
Not anymore.

732
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,196
Then fear the death in what
you are interested with.

733
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,730
Go back!

734
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,643
This way.

735
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,324
Go on, we must hurry.

736
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:06,539
Hurry up!

737
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,900
Sentry...please!

738
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,000
I don't take orders from you, Tribune.

739
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:28,200
That's what you taught.
Bad lesson.

740
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,200
I give you the teacher.

741
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,400
But let them pass.

742
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,600
And Nazarene?

743
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,700
Vanished.

744
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,098
There are no enemies here.

745
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,200
You hold the world in your hands...

746
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:06,800
Know that.

747
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,250
I believe...

748
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,300
that resides in these men.

749
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,000
No one dies today.

750
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,350
No one.

751
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,300
Now go on.

752
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,300
Say anything.

753
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,738
You will remember this.

754
01:19:56,204 --> 01:19:57,650
Why do you think here?

755
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,750
It was here that He called us to follow him.

756
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,600
Sometimes it's hard to recognize.

757
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,500
Simon? Simon?

758
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,900
Simon, they want to eat.

759
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,900
Then let's fish.

760
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,500
Let's fish! Comon!

761
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,698
Come find us!

762
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:33,000
Comon!

763
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,850
We are here!

764
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,400
Brothers!

765
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,950
Let's fish!

766
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,568
Pull, pull!

767
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,150
Cast again?

768
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,650
Twice more.

769
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,763
then sleep till the sun wakes you.

770
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,981
Any luck?

771
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,193
Try right side again.

772
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:16,450
Brothers, Andrew!
What's happening?

773
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,248
Wake up! Wake up!

774
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,163
Spread! Prepare the nets!

775
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,299
Cast!

776
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,600
What happened?

777
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,050
Heath!
We just did! We're stuck!

778
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,850
We are in the rocks!
Cast the net, Andrew.

779
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,298
We caught on something!

780
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,650
It's fish! We caught on something!

781
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:53,200
It's fish!

782
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:57,550
It's fish!

783
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:05,550
It's fish!

784
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,150
How did you know?

785
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:14,300
Yeshua!

786
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:20,550
Yeshua! It's him!

787
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:26,100
Yeshua! Yeshua!

788
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:51,392
Thomas! Thank you.

789
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,500
Did you know, He would rise?

790
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,250
He said he would, but...

791
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,950
truth be told, we doubted it.

792
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,848
What made you follow Him?

793
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:40,300
A leper! Go! Get out of here!

794
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,200
Get out! Get out of here!

795
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:51,300
Go! Leper, get out! Go!

796
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,900
He is going to do it.
Do what?

797
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,150
He is going to heal the man.

798
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,250
How?

799
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,150
Watch! Just watch!

800
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,350
Nobody touches me!
A miracle.

801
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,078
I saw him many times.

802
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,846
Do you have faith?
Come stand.

803
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,400
Brothers!

804
01:27:43,429 --> 01:27:44,707
That's why.

805
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,381
What do you search for?

806
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,150
Trouble.

807
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,400
It will come.

808
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:28,470
This threatens them.
To Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.

809
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,905
There's trouble this way as well.

810
01:28:32,529 --> 01:28:33,936
Have faith, Tribune.

811
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:54,900
Peter...

812
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:56,700
Just walk a little further.

813
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,050
Why?
To be close.

814
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:04,250
Simon, do you love me?

815
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,400
Yes, with all the heart, I do.

816
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,850
Do you love him?
Yes.

817
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,250
Simon,do you love me?
With all my heart.

818
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,335
Then you must lead the mass.

819
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,650
I don't even know what to ask.

820
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,550
Just speak your heart.

821
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,450
Reckon...reconcile all this,

822
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,800
with the world I know.

823
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,500
With your eyes you have seen,
still you doubt?

824
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:24,500
Imagine the doubt who never seen,
imagine what they face?

825
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:30,000
What frightens you?

826
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,100
Being wrong.

827
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:39,800
My dream of eternity, and...

828
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:45,400
Well then, Clavius...

829
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,950
When you died...

830
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,150
I was present.

831
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,950
I helped.
I know.

832
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,800
What is that you seek, Clavius?

833
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,650
Certainty, peace...

834
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,500
A day without death.

835
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,150
Wake up! Brother!
Wake up! Brother!

836
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:26,850
What?
Yeshua is gone! Yeshua!

837
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:35,100
Wake up! Where's he gone?
Yeshua! He was here!

838
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeshua!
Yeshua!

839
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:53,350
Brothers.

840
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,550
I'm going to prepare a place for you.

841
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:11,600
Go! Preach the whole world of the Gospel...

842
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,000
to all nations.

843
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,650
You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem.

844
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:22,674
In all Judea, Samaria and
to the ends of the world.

845
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:31,100
And know that I'll be with you.

846
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,111
Always!

847
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,544
Lord.

848
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:33,350
It's not just about life eternal,
but how life is lived.

849
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,500
By the sword or by love.

850
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,121
That changes you...here.

851
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:40,123
It's time.

852
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,900
Farewell.
They are all good?

853
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:45,550
You may use that again.

854
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,000
Amen.
Amen.

855
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,250
Farewell Peter.
Farewell.

856
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:53,850
God bless you, Peter.
Goodbye.

857
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:00,400
Farewell, Peter.
Farewell.

858
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:15,000
Join us, Tribune.

859
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,850
Jerusalem only brought us trouble.

860
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,500
Trouble!?

861
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,750
And the Spirit he promised,
we are called to receive it there, Roman.

862
01:36:25,752 --> 01:36:27,350
Your goal is to fish.

863
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,100
Aye, for men!

864
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,550
How could I do anything else now?

865
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:42,200
Will you fish too, Clavius?

866
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,450
Then...

867
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,500
farewell, brother!

868
01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:00,250
Farewell.

869
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,350
God blessing, keep you.

870
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:16,299
I will always have you with me...

871
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:21,100
Always.

872
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,700
Peter, come!

873
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:32,100
Brothers!

874
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,350
Peter!

875
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,650
Wait!

876
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:34,000
I doubt we'll ever hear from them again.

877
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,857
Tribune!?

878
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,700
My payment.

879
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,550
Tribune!

880
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,600
Do you truly believe all this?

881
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,600
I believe...

882
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:29,054
I can never be the same.
