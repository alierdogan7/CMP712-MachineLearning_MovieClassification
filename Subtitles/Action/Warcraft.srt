It feeds on life itself.

00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,418
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.

367
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,758
We're not trying to
be fearsome, Garona.

368
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,045
We're trying to
protect our people,
our families.

369
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,390
If you help us,
I give you my oath,

370
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,510
you will have
your freedom.

371
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,813
(lNDISTINCT CHATTER)

372
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,187
GUL'DAN: Fearsome Blackhand,

373
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,320
Warchief of the Horde.

374
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:30,032
You have allowed
the small-teeth
to kill your warriors.

375
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:35,541
Worse, you've shamed
your people by
running from an enemy.

376
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,828
Are you too weak
to talk, Destroyer?

377
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,213
The Horde has no
use for weakness.

378
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,878
Respect our tradition,
Warchief.

379
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,178
You know the penalty.

380
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,218
Death!

381
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,019
ORCS: For the Horde!

382
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,806
For the Horde!

383
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,227
For the Horde!

384
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,528
For the Horde!

385
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,076
GUL'DAN: Stop!

386
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,674
You dare interrupt
this judgment?

387
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,420
We fought hard.

388
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,127
Their warlock used
your Fel against us.

389
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,797
Only I can
control the Fel!

390
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,348
I see you and your
men have survived.

391
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,348
Perhaps Blackhand

392
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,188
kept you safely away
from the battlefield?

393
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,483
Maybe he knows
you're weak, too.

394
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,608
Do you wish
to challenge me,
little chieftain?

395
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,945
I do not question,
Gul'Dan.

396
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,331
But the Fel
is born of death.

397
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,455
It must have a price.

398
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,795
A price paid
in lives taken.

399
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,521
DRAKA: Will you
hold your son?

400
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:36,991
(COOING)

401
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,368
DRAKA: He will be
a great chieftain.

402
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,076
Like his father.

403
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,536
A born leader.

404
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,036
I was no leader today.

405
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,338
(GIGGLING)

406
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,183
He challenges
you already.

407
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,265
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,

408
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,978
what chance do
the rest of us have?

409
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,192
Whatever happens.

410
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,281
Whatever happens.

411
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,166
I see you.

412
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,996
This gate,

413
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,546
who showed it to Gul'Dan?

414
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,875
Who led him to Azeroth?

415
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,392
Gul'Dan called him
a demon.

416
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,507
Did you see it?

417
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,219
Not the face,

418
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,022
but the voice.

419
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,728
Like fire and ash.

420
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
(GATE OPENS)

421
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,279
(GASPS)

422
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,115
(CAWING)

423
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,995
I'll be here
if you need me.

424
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,747
(LATCH CLANGING)

425
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,718
Your mate.

426
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,433
I could kill you
before he even reaches me.

427
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,732
Lothar?

428
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,357
(CHUCKLES)
He is my brother.

429
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,532
The king is my mate.

430
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,609
You're the chieftain's
wife then.

431
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,817
I suppose so.

432
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,288
Then killing you
would bring me
even greater honor.

433
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,865
Not among my kind.

434
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,705
It is a cold night.

435
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,422
I thought you might
use these.

436
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,313
It will warm you.

437
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,603
(SNIFFS)

438
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,109
More of our villages
burn tonight.

439
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,645
One of them is
the village
of my birth.

440
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,909
I cannot imagine
what horrors you have
been through, Garona.

441
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,044
But this doesn't
need to happen.

442
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,214
We have had
peace in these lands
for many years now.

443
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,920
Peace between races
from all over the world.

444
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,469
What is...

445
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,679
I can have it removed.

446
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,607
There is a life
here for you, Garona.

447
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,444
With us.

448
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,743
A life of freedom.

449
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,954
If you want it.

450
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,420
The Great Gate.

451
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,894
"From light comes darkness

452
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,560
"and from darkness light."

453
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,426
Well, that's clear.

454
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,311
"Ask Alodi."

455
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,113
Alodi.

456
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,410
(BOTH LAUGH)

457
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,616
it's good to see
trees again.

458
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,082
And the snow.

459
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,463
Even from a distance.

460
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,625
Remember when we
would track blood ox
through the Frostwind Dunes?

461
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,756
There was always meat,

462
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,434
always life.

463
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,680
You don't think it's strange

464
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,425
that we lost our home
when Gul'Dan came to power?

465
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,271
One orc cannot
kill a world, Durotan.

466
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,938
Are you sure?

467
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,606
Look around you.

468
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,188
Does it not remind
you of something?

469
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,162
Wherever Gul'Dan
works his magic,
the land dies.

470
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,365
If our people are
to make a home here,
my friend...

471
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,962
Gul'Dan must be stopped.

472
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,048
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.

473
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,214
No.

474
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,301
No.

475
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,809
But with the humans' help,

476
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,521
we could be.

477
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,815
I want that weapon.

478
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,578
You'll have me
to protect you.

479
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,828
I need no one
to protect me!

480
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,721
What are you looking at?

481
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,760
Bookworm.
Take the first watch.

482
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,222
Respectfully,
Commander,
my name is Khadgar.

483
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,095
My deepest apologies,
Khadgar.

484
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,973
You see,
I thought we bonded

485
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,640
when I didn't put
you in a prison cell

486
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,056
for breaking into
the Royal Barracks.

487
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,151
Now take the watch.

488
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,084
Well, at least
you're not reading.

489
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,463
He wishes to lie with me.

490
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,304
Beg your pardon?

491
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,257
You would be injured.

492
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,681
I don't want
to lie with you.

493
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,434
Good. You would not
be an effective mate.

494
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,103
(CHUCKLES)

495
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,223
Why do you laugh?

496
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,729
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

497
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,652
No muscles to protect you.

498
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,944
Brittle bones that break.

499
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,066
You don't look
that different to us.

500
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,362
How did you survive?

501
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,987
Broken bones
heal stronger.

502
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,702
Mine are very strong.

503
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,161
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,326
GARONA: Do not be.

505
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,134
My name...

506
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,133
Garona.

507
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,434
It means "cursed" in Orc.

508
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,979
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

509
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,899
They kept you alive, though.

510
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,986
Gul'Dan did.

511
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,662
He gave me her tusk.

512
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,121
To remember her.

513
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,706
My parents gave me
to the Kirin Tor when
I was six years old.

514
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,176
That's the last
time I saw them.

515
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,505
Or any of my
brothers and sisters.

516
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,143
It brings a family honor

517
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,267
to offer a child
to the Kirin Tor.

518
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,941
To have their son
taken up to the floating
city of Dalaran

519
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,074
and be trained by
the most powerful
mages in the land.

520
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,701
Less so, to have
them run away.

521
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,289
Well, that was cheerful.

522
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,919
GARONA: The Great Gate.

523
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,510
Why do they need
so many prisoners?

524
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,053
Like wood for a fire.

525
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,057
Green magic takes
life to open the gate.

526
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,142
LOTHAR: How many more orcs
are they planning on bringing?

527
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,226
GARONA: All of them.

528
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,726
This is just a warband.

529
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,062
When the portal
is opened,

530
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,396
Gul'Dan will bring
the Horde.

531
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,577
Get them back
to Stormwind.

532
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,619
We'll ride ahead.

533
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,343
KHADGAR: Garona.

534
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,087
We should go. it's not safe...

535
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,177
Durotan.

536
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,099
To the north,
there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

537
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,847
I would meet
with their leader.

538
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,694
To challenge him?

539
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,943
I saw you lead
the small-teeth to
our encampment.

540
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,439
They have seen
what is being built.

541
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,284
But only you know
what Gul'Dan has
planned for my people.

542
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,910
This magic is death,
to all things.

543
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,544
Must be stopped.

544
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,791
Tell him.

545
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,296
The black rock,

546
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,963
GARONA: I will.

547
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,296
Chieftain.

548
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,722
If I return,

549
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,224
would you take me
into your clan?

550
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,392
You're safer here.

551
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,096
With them.

552
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,307
(MUFFLED BREATHING)

553
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,874
Is it as you feared?

554
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,992
The Fel is everywhere.

555
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,408
Then you mustn't leave again.

556
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,119
They need a Guardian's help
now more than ever.

557
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,880
Maybe the boy can help.

558
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:44,085
We need solutions!

559
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,013
We need solutions!

560
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,178
Easy for you
to say that!

561
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,845
The Dwarven forges
must work overtime.

562
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,175
KING MAGNl: You treat us
no better than dogs.

563
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,310
We shall supply
you no more!

564
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:54,728
(SHOUTING) Enough!

565
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,730
You have all called on
Stormwind in the past.

566
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,607
Either for troops
or arbitration.

567
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,605
If we do not unite

568
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,360
to fight this enemy,

569
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,494
we will perish.

570
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,624
ALL: Hear, hear.

571
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,740
KING LLANE: Stormwind needs
soldiers, arms, horses.

572
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,035

kingdoms to look after.

Commander.

575
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,093
The orcs are
building a portal,

576
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,210
through which they
plan to bring an army.

577
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,380
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get
another opportunity.

578

00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,974

of Azeroth?

580
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,138
Where is the Guardian?

581
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,771

Where is Medivh?

582
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:33,682
My liege.

583
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,851
I suggest
we take a recess.

589

What's left?

590
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,410
Callan is among
the injured.

591
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
Dad?

592
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,512
I'm fine. it's fine.

593
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,100
You had me worried.

594
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,104
Where's the rest
of your troop?

595
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,350
They took most
of them alive.

596
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,856
We'll get them back.

597
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,444
Don't be in such a hurry.

598
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,240
You're all I have.

599
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,663
I know.

600
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,293
I'm a soldier.

601
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,014
He would not ask
for this meeting

602
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,046
if he thought he could
defeat Gul'Dan alone.

603
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,306
The Fel must
truly terrify him.

604
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,814
Durotan is scared
of nothing.

605
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,766
LOTHAR: The location.

606
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,111
The suddenness
of this meeting.

607
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,899
Sounds like a trap.

608
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,567
It is not.
Could be.

609
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,782
It is not!
Could be.

610
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:08,862
It is not!

611
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,490
What do you think?

612
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,164
It's too good
an opportunity to ignore.

613
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,581
I think we
have no choice.

614
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,621
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

615
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,003
But we will need help.

616
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,042
And if he's lying?

617
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,208
Orcs do not lie.

618
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,419
What if he is?

619
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,417
There is no honor in it.
And where is the honor

620
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,299
in him betraying
his own people?

621
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,800
Durotan is
protecting his clan.

622
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,470
His enemy is the Fel.

623
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,139
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.

624
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,807
This orc, Durotan...

625
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,390
How do you know him?

626
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,561
GARONA: He freed me.

627
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,769
And he is loved
by his clan.

628
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,227
He is a strong chieftain.

629
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,569
LADY TARIA: Strong chiefs
must earn their clan's trust.

630
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,493
If we are to
expect you to join us,

631
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,197
we must earn yours.

632
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:07,087
To defend yourself.

633
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,762
With this?

634
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,724
Yes.

635
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,972
KING LLANE: Find the Guardian.

636
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,925
What is this?

637
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,227
Guardian?

638
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,111
The gate. We saw it,
in the Morass.

639
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,735
I've been putting
together all the clues
I can about it.

640
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,203
MEDIVH: This.

641
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,613
This drawing.
Where did you copy it from?

642
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,699
Guardian.

643
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,783
And this.

644
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,656
And this.

645
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,536
And this?

646
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,210
I've been researching
ever since I felt
the presence of the Fel.

647
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,843
I am the Guardian! Me.

648
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,086
Not you. Not yet.

649
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,716
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.

650
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,268
Don't presume
you can help me.

651
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,402
You have no idea the forces

652
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,074
I contend with.

653
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,407
If you want to help,

654
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,490
protect the king.

655
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,288
You leave the Fel to me.

656
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,837
Interesting choice.

657
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,219
Guardian.

658
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,470
STORMWIND GUARD:
Pack up and move
to the west gate!

00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,942
(lNDISTINCT CHATTER)

660
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,773
You there!
Rise from your stall
and get moving. Now!

661
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,661
I need your help.
I found a book.

662
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,784
Of course you did.

663
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,451
There was an illustration
that showed a gate

664
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,078
like the one we
saw being built.

665
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,037
Sorry. Sorry.

666
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,247
Khadgar.

667
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,626
So then I tried to
show the Guardian,
but he became furious.

668
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,206
Burned all my research.

669
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,877
He would've burned this,
too, if it hadn't been
hidden in my robe.

670
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,805
No, turn the page. Here.

671
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,185
Look.

672
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,685
See?

673
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,903
What do you think
the image means?

674
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,364
The orcs were summoned.

675
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,360
From this side
of the gate.
They were invited in.

676
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,542
And the Guardian
burned your research?

677
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,504
He's probably just
trying to protect you.

678
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,245
Now go away.

679
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,522
A good spot
for an ambush.

680
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,400
Our sentries
are well placed.

681
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,611
I will check again.

01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,629
and accuse the Guardian...

910
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,957
What is Alodi?

911
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,299
FINDEN: How does he know?

912
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,639
Alodi.

913
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,516
What is it?

914
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:22,732
An entity from
a time before the
Kirin Tor existed.

915
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,979
We think it served
a function similar to
that of the Guardian.

916
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,148
Protector.

917
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,775
No one beyond the
Arch Council knows
of its existence.

918
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,659
And it will stay
that way.

919
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,617
For you to mention it
in the same breath
as the Dark Portal

920
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:39,209
is too much
to be mere...

921
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,214
Coincidence.

922
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:47,586
Do I go in?

923
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,757
I don't know.
It's never done
that before.

924
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,737
ALODl: Khadgar...

925
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,235
KHADGAR: I know you.

926
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,066
From the library.

927
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,160
You're Alodi?

928
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,457
I used

929
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,375
the last of my energies
to summon you here.

930
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,506
The Guardian has betrayed us.

931
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,383
Medivh.

932
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,218
I saw the Fel
in his eyes.

933
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,676
He is consumed by it.

934
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,717
If he is not stopped,

935
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,890
this world will burn.

936
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,019
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

937
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,111
Guardian is but a name.

938
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:49,276
The true guardians
of this world

939
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,650
are the people themselves.

940
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,701
I know you see what
the Kirin Tor cannot.

941
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,616
It's why you left them.

942
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,874
No one

943
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,498
can stand against the darkness

944
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:03,922
alone.

945
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,460
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

946
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,590
Yes, you do.

947
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,762
Trust in your friends.

948
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,308
Together

949
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:21,981
you can save this world.

950
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,903
Always remember,

951
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,519
from light comes darkness

952
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:29,017
and from darkness...

953
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,065
Light.

954
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,580
Up, up.

955
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,383
Thank you, Moroes.

956
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,130
You'll recover, Guardian.

957
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,969
You always do.

958
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,929
No.

959
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,055
Thank you.

960
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,689
For everything you've done.

961
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,121
I'm sorry, old friend.

962
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,041
Seems that I have let
the orcs into this world.

963
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,796
The Fel, it has twisted me.

964
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:37,465
I don't even know what
else I may have done.

965
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:42,264
I just don't remember.

966
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,313
Everything I've
thought to protect, I have...

967
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,357
Destroyed.

968
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,858
I can't control the Fel.

969
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,027
No one can.

970
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,712
KING LLANE: Five legions
to block Deadwind Pass.

971
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,551
Another 10 here,
here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

972
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,970
Supply lines here.

973
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,138
While the Eastern
Sea hems them in
both south and east.

974
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,062
If we hold these
positions, we will
be at our strongest.

975
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,310
Containment.

976
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,151
Until there is
a better option, yes.

977
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,607
And when there's
10 times as many?
What then?

978
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,202
If there were
easy answers...

979
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:44,162
Our priority must be
to stop the gate
from opening.

980
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,575
Fail there, and it's
just a matter of time

981
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,504
before they beat us
with sheer numbers.

982
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,251
What do you suggest?

983
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Send everything
we've got.

984
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,253
Destroy the gate,
free our people

985
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,759
and end the
immediate threat.

986
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,223
And the orcs that remain?

987
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,432
We'll take care
of them later.

988
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,643
After they've ravaged
the entire kingdom.

989
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,222
My lords.

990
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,005
KING LLANE: Medivh,
you are up and well.

991
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,518
I am.

992
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,930
I feel...

993
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,805
Restored.

994
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,098
KING LLANE: We need you.

995
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,021
We've been
agonizing over
our options.

996
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,270
Some of us believe
there are no options.

997
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,822
We need fresh eyes.
I have news.

998
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,244
I met with Durotan.

999
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,914
You met with Durotan?

1000
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:23,623
MEDIVH: The rebellion
against Gul'Dan

1001
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,203
is gaining strength.

1002
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,365
With their help,
we can destroy
this gate.

1003
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:29,834
That doesn't change
my plan.

1004
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:30,914
MEDIVH: What plan?

1005
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,043
Anduin believes
we should attack
with full force.

1006
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,746
I'm concerned it
leaves the rest of the
kingdom defenseless.

1007
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,377
MEDIVH: How many
legions would you need

1008
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,924
to hold the orcs in place?

1009
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,549
Five for
Deadwind Pass.

1010
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,968
10 for the Redridge
Mountains,

1011
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,183
10 more to
protect the city.

1012
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,466
We've already
lost 18 legions.

1013
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,970
That leaves one,
two, three.

1014
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,179
Can it be done, Medivh?

1015
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,479
LOTHAR: No, it can't be done.

1016
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,401
With three legions,
Frostwolves
and my power...

1017
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,477
With all due respect,
Guardian your powers

1018
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,322
have proven
unreliable at best,
recently.

1019
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,405
Llane, have I ever
let you down?

1020
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:04,531
LOTHAR: Let him down?

1021
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,828
Where have you even been
for the last six years?

1022
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,160
Please, Anduin...

1023
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,285
Medivh is the Guardian.

1024
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,251
Not the one
you remember.

1025
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,165
He's lost!

1026
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,333
He's unstable!

1027
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,501
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

1028
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,673
Find your bearings,
Anduin.

1029
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,839
I would march
into Hell for you

1030
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,587
if I thought there was
the slightest
chance of victory.

1031
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,097
But there isn't.
This is suicide.

1032
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,219
Is this about Callan?

1033
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,600
It was a tragedy.

1034
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,444
If he hadn't
been trying so hard
to win your approval

1035
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:35,772
he might still
be with us today.

1036
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,106
Medivh.

1037
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,113
Callan wasn't ready,
you knew it.

1038
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,855
And you let him
play soldier anyway.

1039
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,356
Anduin, stop! No!

1040
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:43,528
You killed him!

1041
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,777
Just save it!

1042
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,277
Commander, please, sir!
Please!

1043
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:47,777
KING LLANE: Varis.

1044
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,537
Take him to
a cell to calm down.

1045
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,664
You are no use
to us like this.

1046
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,968
MEDIVH: We'll protect
the kingdom, my lord.

1047
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,051
You and l.

1048
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,806
(GATE OPENS)

1049
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,614
Why are you here?

1050
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,240
The King.

1051
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,156
He goes to fight
the Horde.

1052
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,039
With your Guardian's help

1053
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,079
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.

1054
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,456
Don't trust him.

1055
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,212
I have told you,
orcs do not lie.

1056
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,667
Not Durotan.

1057
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,842
Don't trust Medivh.

1058
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,425
I will try to
protect your king.

1059
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,100
Don't go with them.

1060
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,430
Why?

1061
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,225
I don't want you
to get hurt.

1062
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,871
Come back alive.

1063
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,633
MAN 1: Free us.
WOMAN 1: We're thirsty!

1064
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,390
MAN 2: Spare us! Spare us!

1065
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,773
WOMAN 2: Please!
We need your help!

1066
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,442
ORC GUARD: Hey! Frostwolf!

1067
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,976
Now, you're
enemies with all sides.

1068
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,741
I'll tell them
it was you.

1069
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,579
(GROANS)

1070
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,539
What happened?

1071
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,125
I'm sorry, Durotan.

1072
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,261
I did not see
how we could side
with the humans,

1073
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,224
against our own kind.

1074
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,184
I was wrong.

1075
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,353
Gul'Dan's Fel
magic is destroying us.

1076
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,275
Where's Draka?
Safe.

1077
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,359
But the rest...

1078
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:39,865
They wouldn't follow him
if they could see
what he has become.

1079
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,381
Then I'll show them.

1080
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,147
There is no other
man I would entrust

1081
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,990
the safety of my
family to, Varian.

1082
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,368
Keep them safe
while I'm gone.

1083
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,127
Ready?

1084
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,719
I would feel better
if Lothar were
riding with us.

1085
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,434
We'll be fine.

1086
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,684
I will return to Karazhan,

I know you're
just doing your job.
And a good one at that.

1092
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,683
But I've cooled down now.

1093
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,761
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...

1094
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,845
So I can protect the King.

I just hope
we're not too late.

1104

We can't go after them.

to save Azeroth.

Azeroth needs you more!
