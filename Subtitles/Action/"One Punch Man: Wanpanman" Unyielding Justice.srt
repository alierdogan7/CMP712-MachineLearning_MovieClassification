1
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,320
It...it approaches!

2
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,650
Madame Shibabawa?
What's wrong?

3
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,700
A violent catastrophe draws near...

4
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,030
Madame Shibabawa!
Get a hold of yourself!

5
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,870
This is the end!

6
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,580
The Earth is doomed!

7
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:25,050
NEXT EPISODE





UNPARALLELED PERIL

8
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,090
Eh? What is this place?

9
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,880
I am the Deep Sea King!

10
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,340
If I made one misstep, it was
not fighting the battle at sea.

11
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,550
An away game!

12
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,180
If we'd fought at sea,
things would be different!

13
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,430
Next time on One-Punch Man:
Episode 10, "Unparalleled Peril."

14
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,020
Really? There's something even
more dangerous than me?
