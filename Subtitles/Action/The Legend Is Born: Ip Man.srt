00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,960
Cancel the Twenty-one Demands!

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,273
Give back Qingdao! We swear on our lives!

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,600
Democracy

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,555
Science

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,878
Wing Chun Martial Arts School

6
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,920
Mr. Ip Master Chan

7
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,194
Please come in OK

8
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Finish the lesson for me

9
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,393
Yes, Master. How are you, Mr. Ip?

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Girl's stuff, no substance

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,160
Watch your mouth, Man!

12
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,799
Master Ng Mui created this Wing Chun fist style,

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,831
the secret is the control of power with flexibility

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,840
It's my honour and pleasure to see

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,200
this fine class of disciples you have, Master Chan

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,120
Mr. Ip, I've heard that you're travelling between
Hong Kong and Foshan

17
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
Business must be doing well, then

18
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
Oh, before I forget, I must pay you the rent

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
No hurry, no hurry. We're good friends!

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,240
You rent Mulberry Garden to me at such a low
rent;

21
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
I have not yet found an opportunity

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,320
Seriously, it won't be hard to pay back the favor,
if you wish

23
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,753
Man!

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,394
Yes, Dad!

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,520
This is my youngest son, lp Man,

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,400
my own flesh and blood

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,311
Tin Chi! Dad!

28
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,920
This is my adopted son who has been with us for
a year now,

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,960
Tin Chi

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,480
The purpose of my trip here today is to get them
a superb master

31
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
A master?

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,634
Yes! They both have a passion for Kung Fu

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,076
Please accept this tea to show my commitment,
Master

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,959
Please accept the tea, Master

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
As members of our school,

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,720
you two must observe the guiding principles

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,280
Martial arts learning - genuine and authentic;

38
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
behavior - proper and discrete;

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
judgement - objective and rational

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,440
Understood, Master

41
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,960
Didn't you say that you love Kung Fu, Man?

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Many other disciples will keep you company.

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
I have to go to Hong Kong on business

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,232
Dad, take good care of yourself!

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,920
Make sure you look after your little brother, Tin
Chi

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,388
Dad, I will, I promise

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,952
Dad!

48
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Time to take the medicine, Master

49
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,312
Leave it there!

50
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,400
Remember! All hand movements are clearly
directed by the intention in mind;

51
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,597
if your intention is justified, you're on the right
track

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,798
Master, the medicine is getting cold

53
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
You have shown improvement

54
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,560
Remember! The noble mind commands authentic
style- movements,

55
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,360
which allow stability when you defend, and
invincibility when you attack

56
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,440
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's
shadow, not his hand.

57
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,520
Focus on what you feel rather than what you see.
Understand?

58
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,715
Yes, Master

59
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,680
Maintain world peace;

60
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
establish the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity
Sphere

61
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
You are the hope of our Empire,

62
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Japan's future rests with you

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,040
Dad...

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,635
Tin Chi, wake up! Are you having a bad dream?

65
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,960
What... were... you saying?

66
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,748
Are you hungry? In fact, I'm hungry, too

67
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,591
There's nothing to eat at all

68
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,800
Look! Two huge rats coming out to find
something to eat!

69
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
You'll be dead if the master finds out

70
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,480
Not him, it's me

71
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,600
It's... me... not him

72
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
Hush!

73
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,520
Since you gave me a toffee,

74
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,999
I'll help you out!

75
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,552
This is for you

76
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Why do fried double-sticks only come in pairs?

77
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
How nice if there were three pieces

78
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,640
Drink this one, Master

79
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,312
This bowl is freshly made

80
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,000
You're so busy

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,230
The medicine won't be as effective if it's reheated

82
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,680
Chung So, you are dedicated and dutiful,

83
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,800
I'll be happy to see you inherit this school

84
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Man is gifted in martial arts

85
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,434
Give him the best after I'm gone.

86
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,948
Yes!

87
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,318
Go watch them!

88
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Master! Master!

89
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,835
Stay away, stay clear.

90
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:11,910
Have a smooth voyage, Master! Give us your
blessing

91
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,280
The sun is setting, clear of obstruction and ill luck

92
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,316
Raise the casket

93
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,038
Lower the casket

94
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,800
This is my promise and my oath to Master Wah
Shun:

95
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,000
I, Chung So, will exert all energy, with all my
might,

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,629
to make authentic Wing Chun prosper for as long
as I live

97
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
1, 2, 3, 4

98
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,920
palms up, strike, withdraw, reach out, strike

99
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,878
1, 2, 3, 4, palms up, strike

100
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:36,040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

101
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,155
Withdraw

102
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,674
All right! That's it for the day.

103
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,313
Go home

104
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,229
Tin Chi, you were quite good today

105
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,080
Take a rest, Man!

106
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,600
Hey! Listen to Brother Chung So. Let's eat!

107
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,040
Mei Wai, let me help you set the table

108
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,234
Good!

109
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,600
Rest! Dinner's ready

110
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,953
All right!

111
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,480
Spend the Lantern Festival with sweets

112
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,000
Enjoy sweet dumplings together

113
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Tin Chi, how lucky we are!

114
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,040
A leather-silhouette puppet show has opened
across the street

115
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,920
Bringing us such good business

116
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,360
It's not luck, this was carefully planned

117
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
You're wonderful!

118
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,880
Lp Man, this was specially saved for you

119
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,520
I've had six bowls already, I'm so full

120
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,960
Why are you still eating, then?

121
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,320
Go take a walk to help your digestion

122
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Tin Chi, business is quite good;

123
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,320
I want to take time off to look around

124
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,720
Fine!

125
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Lantern Festival, see if I'll have some... romantic
luck

126
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
Alright, I'll stay,

127
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,400
you fellows have a good time

128
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Alright Alright

129
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,760
Come on, let's go!

130
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,840
Wait for me!

131
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,800
Mei Wai, you can't just go

132
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,473
Who will cook the dumplings?

133
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,720
I'll go with you when they return

134
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,835
No, thanks

135
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,800
Look! Foreigners can play Chinese chess

136
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Chinese can play foreigners' games, too!

137
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,240
If foreigners are capable of learning Chinese
culture,

138
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,356
we can take up Western culture, too

139
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Let's go over there! Let's go

140
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,114
See you later

141
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,040
You surely know what good stuff is

142
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,440
This is the biggest invention of this century: The
gramophone

143
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,560
It can contain your most beautiful voice

144
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,472
Amazing! Even voices can be captured now

145
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,480
This is an English folk song

146
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,600
The story is that King Henry Vlll wrote it

147
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,080
for a girl who rejected his love.

148
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,868
Really? That's amazing! The girl had character

149
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,080
Oh my God! How can I sell this?

150
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,680
You scratched my record

151
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,800
How am I going to sell it?

152
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,040
I didn't mean it... Well... I'll pay you for it

153
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,510
This is very expensive. Do you have the money?

154
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,480
All right, boss, I'll buy it from you

155
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,000
When the record is scratched, the song won't
play smoothly

156
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,673
Didn't I say I'd pay for it? Is this enough?

157
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,920
May I know your name, please, Miss?

158
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,040
I'll pay you back

159
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't worry about it

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,479
Thank you

161
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,317
Sister!

162
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,920
We don't have a gramophone at home. What did
you buy the record for?

163
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,708
I wasn't buying a record, I was buying a feeling

164
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,840
You hit my head with that thing. Pay!

165
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,400
Sorry, Sir! I don't have the money

166
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,840
I don't care

167
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,920
You've got to pay me 50 silver dollars

168
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,717
Where will I find 50 silver dollars?

169
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,069
No money, eh?

170
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,360
Sister!

171
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
What are you getting at? Tricking people?

172
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,111
What? Get back! Get up

173
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I clearly saw what happened

174
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,840
The bamboo spinner fell on the ground, it didn't
hit you at all

175
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,120
How dare you meddle with me!

176
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm warning you,

177
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,280
if you don't stop right now, I'll alert the police

178
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,080
You need a beating!

179
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
No, she doesn't

180
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,320
You bums do!

181
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,673
Strike!

182
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,189
To hell with you!

183
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,116
Sister!

184
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,669
Hold it!

185
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,314
Please spare my life!

186
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,720
Please spare my life!

187
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,075
I'll never do this again, never!

188
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,799
Go!

189
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,480
Thanks for such great help. It's much appreciated

190
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
Your act of chivalry is greatly admired

191
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,555
Could you leave your name?

192
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,200
Don't worry about it

193
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Miss, he's lp Man, and I'm Siu Shan

194
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm Yiu Choi

195
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,320
We are from the Wing Chun School

196
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,153
You may call us the Three Wing Chun
Musketeers

197
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,440
Don't forget your record, sis

198
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,880
Why bother with other people's business. Are
you hurt?

199
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,757
No, let's go!

200
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,829
Move!

201
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,399
Can I help you?

202
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,154
I'm looking for lp Man lp Man?

203
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
He's out

204
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
If you have something for him, you can leave it
with me

205
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,560
No! I was told to

206
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,880
deliver this letter in person

207
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
It's up to you. You can wait if you want

208
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,680
You can also feed the huge mosquitoes

209
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,920
Huge mosquitoes? Wait!

210
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,148
All right!

211
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,240
You must give this letter to lp Man. Thank you!

212
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
All right!

213
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,798
Thank you

214
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,320
Uncle lp! Mei Wai!

215
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,312
Please go in, lp Man's home

216
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,431
Dad! Dad!

217
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,320
What have you brought back?

218
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,356
It's Sis' new toy

219
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,280
Be careful! It's very heavy!

220
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,520
What's taking him so long to reply?

221
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,238
Hasn't he?

222
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
Honestly, did you deliver it in person?

223
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
I did!

224
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,316
Are you sure? Absolutely!

225
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,360
Keep this medicine with you,

226
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,280
it's good for headache, fever, diarrhea, everything

227
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
I appreciate it

228
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
You'll be on your own studying in Hong Kong,
Man!

229
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,271
Take good care of yourself Yes!

230
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
So long, Brother Chung So

231
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,960
Remember not to waste any time in Hong Kong

232
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,440
Neglect neither your studies nor your martial arts
training;

233
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
do not forget our Master's advice

234
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Don't get involved in fights, don't think you're
better than others

235
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Martial arts learning - genuine and authentic;

236
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,440
behavior - proper and discrete; judgement -
objective and rational.

237
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,953
Don't worry!

238
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,391
Good morning Good morning

239
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,240
Good Morning, Reverend

240
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,913
Good morning, class

241
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,318
Practice more at home, understand?

242
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
Is lp Man at home, please?

243
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,915
He's gone to Hong Kong. May I know who's
asking for him, please?

244
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,436
It's nothing important. Thank you.

245
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,800
Good morning, Brother Chung So

246
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,392
Good morning Let's eat fried sticks

247
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,320
These fried sticks look very interesting

248
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,600
You are all big eaters, double sticks aren't
enough to feed you

249
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,477
So I made them triple

250
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,715
Let's eat!

251
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,960
Why are you people so unhygienic?

252
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,599
You want to know why? Come on!

253
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,872
Do you know now?

254
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,388
Let me help you

255
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,159
Don't bother!

256
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,120
There you are! How nice!

257
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,560
Chairman Lee Godfather

258
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Thanks for looking after me, Mei Wai

259
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,475
Here's a present for you

260
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
How beautiful! Thank you

261
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,560
Tin Chi, you have given tremendous help

262
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,720
ever since you joined the Jing Wu Athletic
Association

263
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,800
Don't mention it

264
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,080
Anyway, I have a present for you, too

265
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
Thank you, Chairman Lee

266
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,040
These were selected from

267
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,400
my jade collection

268
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
They seem like a pair

269
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,437
Definitely, a pair, like you two

270
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,600
I've never seen Chinese pigs playing hockey
before

271
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,158
It's so funny!

272
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
Hey, you! Mind your language.

273
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,880
My language? It's none of your business

274
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
I heard you say Chinese pigs

275
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,760
Oh, no, no! I'm sorry, I don't mean Chinese pigs

276
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,479
I mean... Sick Man of East Asia!

277
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,593
Come on, then!

278
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,840
I'll give you three minutes

279
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,200
No, two minutes

280
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,589
No, one minute

281
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,637
Good!

282
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,636
Just 45 seconds!

283
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,714
Take a seat

284
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,753
Relax

285
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,120
It's OK

286
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
Your Kung Fu is formidable

287
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,756
We call it Wing Chun

288
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,320
What's your friend's name? He's wonderful

289
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,833
His name is...

290
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,997
Good morning, lp Man! Morning

291
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,080
Master lp, morning Say Good morning to him!

292
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,320
Morning! Have I met them before?

293
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,630
Good morning, lp Man

294
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,073
Not this one, I'm sure

295
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,800
Boss!

296
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,920
I'm not the boss here, I'm the manager

297
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,440
How can I help?

298
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,032
I need some medicine for a friend

299
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,320
What else would you buy in a drug store, kid

300
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,788
Which is better to treat bruises, powder or
ointment?

301
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,920
What? He's injured? What happened?

302
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,760
A fight? What else?

303
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,751
Who beat him?

304
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
I did

305
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,920
I thought he was your friend

306
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,360
That's how we became friends

307
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
Why did you beat him?

308
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,360
Boss, why don't you...

309
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,320
Why don't you bring him here?

310
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,400
Here to receive treatment?

311
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Treatment? Bring him here so I can beat him, too

312
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,880
Make sure he won't call us 'Chinese pigs' again

313
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
Where did you learn about that?

314
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,400
From your friends

315
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,680
You and your name are known to everybody on
this street now, lp Man

316
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,880
You're popular, kid. So, you're studying Wing
Chun?

317
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,600
Authentic Wing Chun. The name was inherited
from the school taught by Master Leung Jan from
Foshan

318
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
So you must be one of Chin's (Nickname of Chan
Wah Shun) disciples

319
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,360
Correct! Authentic my foot.

320
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,320
So much so that you made me believe you
learned directly from Master Ng Mui

321
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,680
How long have you studied it?

322
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Finished the lower body strength training yet?

323
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,520
What about 'targeted finger'?

324
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,320
You're in Wing Chun, too, boss?

325
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,000
First, I told you I'm not the boss;

326
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm the manager here

327
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,800
Second, I am practicing Wing Chun,

328
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,760
but don't know if it's considered authentic

329
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,440
Do you want to try it out?

330
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,800
Next time

331
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,720
I might be too busy next time

332
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,080
If you want to try me, try me now

333
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,760
Better not, if there is any injury...

334
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,960
Are you looking down on old folks like me?

335
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,949
Come on!

336
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,238
Mr Manager!

337
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,320
Hasn' t your master taught you that when
practicing with the others,

338
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,440
you reserve only the strength applied, not the
skill?

339
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,680
What, despise me?

340
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,352
I mean business then

341
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,000
Are you alright, kid?

342
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,400
I'm fine

343
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,789
Well, again!

344
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,278
Watch my medicine!

345
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,076
Be careful with the Three-Prick Wine

346
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,280
Wait! You call this Wing Chun?

347
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,113
Whatever comes from my fist is Wing Chun

348
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,680
They are not Wing Chun

349
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,877
My Master said Wing Chun strategic movements

350
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,998
30% from the legs, and focus on attacking an
opponent's lower body

351
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,000
Your master wasn't wrong

352
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The traditional focus is on the use of the hands

353
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,680
But that doesn't mean it forbids changes

354
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,520
Changes allow more flexibility

355
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,240
Movements can be adapted in multiple ways,

356
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,000
such as leg movements in a form of wrestling,
and they all work

357
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,960
May I know your name, please?

358
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm Leung Bik from Foshan

359
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,920
People call me Sir Bik

360
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,754
Master Leung Jan was my father

361
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,553
You're my senior!

362
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,760
So is my Wing Chun authentic?

363
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,280
You're funny

364
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,960
Come back the day after tomorrow, kid

365
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,320
Come here the day after tomorrow?

366
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
Don't you want lessons?

367
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,880
Of course I do

368
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,200
But I can't afford to pay you

369
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,794
Did I ask you to pay?

370
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,992
Customs inspection. Open the crates, officers!

371
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,598
Hold it!

372
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,072
Inspection is not authorized. The medicine was
purchased from

373
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,280
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the
British Embassy

374
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,200
Mr. Kitano said you can't open this as it was
purchased from

375
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,080
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the
British Embassy

376
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,672
I don't understand English

377
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,720
How dare a low-ranking customs officer

378
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,360
display public contempt for the Japanese
business bureau

379
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,080
Should any damage be incurred, who will be held
responsible?

380
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,400
How dare a low-ranking customs officer like you

381
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,440
display public contempt for the Japanese
business bureau

382
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,480
Should any damage be incurred, who will be held
responsible?

383
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,400
If smuggling is going on, who will be held
responsible, then?

384
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,118
Officers, open the crates!

385
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,273
Mr. Kitano said you can't open this

386
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,999
Stop!

387
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,120
What do you think you're doing?

388
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,160
Do you know who this gentleman is?

389
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,118
Do you know how much Mr. Kitano donates to
Foshan every year?

390
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,200
My apologies! Mr. Kitano

391
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,000
You may take the goods

392
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,150
What're you standing here for? Clear the way!

393
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
Of course I welcome donations

394
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
But if they are from the Japanese, I will definitely
decline

395
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
Why did you make such a comment, Chairman?

396
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,240
Japan's evil intentions became apparent

397
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,560
after the Russo-Japanese War, they annexed our
territory...

398
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,040
and built the Manchurian Railway,

399
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,120
aiming at economic invasion

400
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,240
Look at what they did in the North-East,

401
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,160
their ambitions are obvious

402
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,880
I think I understand how the Chairman feels

403
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,320
But the thing is, the Japanese Chamber of
Commerce in Foshan

404
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,600
did not participate in the North-Eastern affair

405
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,080
Mr. Kitano came here only to do business,

406
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,400
not much different from other foreign investors

407
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,880
So I think we should treat his donation

408
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,400
the same way as others

409
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,480
I don't believe the Japanese

410
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
would make a donation without a personal
agenda

411
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,120
Well... after he's done business for so long in
Foshan,

412
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,920
this could probably be his gesture of retuning a
favor

413
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,600
Don't be suspicious

414
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
You're in business, too, Tin Chi

415
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
Why don't you tell us what you think,

416
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,040
as a newcomer?

417
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,880
I tend to agree with what Chairman Lee
suggested

418
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,480
After all, our Association is on very sound
financial ground,

419
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,311
and is not urgently in need of donations

420
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,918
Tin Chi, I'm going back to the school

421
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,160
See you later

422
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,760
Try to talk Chairman Lee

423
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
out of being so stubborn, Tin Chi

424
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,800
Mr. Mayor, we are all educated people

425
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,440
Why should we allow the uneducated

426
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,160
to upset us?

427
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,560
You are right

428
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,357
Goodbye Take care

429
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,588
Bye

430
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,640
The improved version of Wing Chun is the good
use of

431
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,680
'distant fist, near elbow, close wrestling,

432
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,000
incorporating long and short distance movements'

433
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,480
Wing Chun wrestling uses the reverse joint
principle;

434
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,471
no need to hold on to your opponent

435
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,800
Your Master concentrated on

436
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,240
the long stretch and low kick

437
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,120
My improved version of Wing Chun

438
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,120
incorporates the short stretch and high kick

439
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,200
Wing Chun should not be described as

440
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,360
'authentic' or 'non-authentic' anymore

441
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
To me, Wing Chun is one big family,

442
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,796
there is no distinction between you, me, and him

443
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,520
Goodbye, Man lp

444
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,400
Our surname goes first, Reverend

445
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,200
lp Man, all the best

446
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Same to you, goodbye Goodbye

447
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,228
Let's go

448
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,352
Bye, lp Man! Bye!

449
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,277
Goodbye! Bye!

450
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,313
Thank you Thank you

451
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
You should have told me you were coming back,
lp Man

452
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,320
Mei Wai lp Man's back, everybody!

453
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
You brought back so many things

454
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,400
Only this one is mine,

455
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
the rest are presents for you all

456
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,040
We know lp Man is good to us!

457
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,440
Let's go This is for you

458
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,160
For me?

459
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,440
How am I supposed to finish all these toffees

460
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,040
Don't eat them all, some are for my brother to sell

461
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
Man! Tin Chi's back!

462
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,960
Brother! There you are!

463
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,394
Yes! Long time no see.

464
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,400
You're still stout. Keeping up with martial arts
practice?

465
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,920
Do you want to try me? Sure!

466
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,114
Give it to me

467
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,479
One point for Man

468
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,595
Great! Another point for you, Man!

469
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,360
What style is this?

470
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,600
Wing Chun!

471
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,400
The high kick doesn't exist in Wing Chun,

472
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,320
where did you pick that up?

473
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,709
Try me more first OK

474
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,829
Good! One point for Tin Chi

475
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
Excellent! Good!

476
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,880
Don't tell me this is Wing Chun, Man?

477
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,040
This is fantastic. Show me, lp Man

478
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,520
It's wonderful! Teach me, too

479
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,400
Me, too Me first!

480
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,515
One at a time

481
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,194
Mei Wai

482
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,640
Mei Wai, watch out!

483
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,160
Is this necessary, Man?

484
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,440
I'm all right. Take it easy next time

485
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,880
Take a rest, Mei Wai

486
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,040
Let's learn it together

487
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,395
To reward your enthusiasm. Come on!

488
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,400
Alright?

489
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,520
Amazing!

490
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
This focuses on the reverse joint principle

491
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,920
It's a different approach like Japanese Judo,

492
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,560
there's no need to hold on to your opponent

493
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,640
It's amazing! I want to learn, too

494
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Me, too Count me in

495
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,280
Brother Chung So

496
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
Brother Chung So

497
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,720
Let me help you

498
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,439
Such a fat chicken, let me take care of it

499
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,115
Remember what Master Chan said to you, Man?

500
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,600
Time to go home

501
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,520
Let's go!

502
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,600
I ask you

503
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Whose style is authentic,

504
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,750
our Master Chan's or Leung Bik's?

505
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,240
Leung Bik?

506
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,560
Brother Chung So, Mr Leung and our Master are
from the same school;

507
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,040
his style shouldn't be considered deviant from
authenticity

508
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,880
Also, Leung Bik is Grand Master Leung Jan's
son;

509
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,600
he practiced with him since he was a child

510
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,840
But he never got along with the Grand Master,

511
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,640
nor with his brothers. Leung Bik is conceited

512
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,920
Perhaps... he held different views

513
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,280
Despite a difference in views,

514
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,600
he shouldn't have created tension in the family

515
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,480
I remember after the Grand Master passed away,

516
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,520
Bik's brother immendiately put up a wall...

517
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,640
to partition the two families;

518
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,600
you can see how badly he was received by the
others

519
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,440
He's a bit strange,

520
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,520
but we can't assume that his art is not competent

521
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,240
People often thought that Wing Chun seldom
uses wrestling moves

522
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,400
But he believes that by applying the targeted
finger style

523
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,560
or darting hand movements, opponents can be
overpowered

524
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,600
I've tried it and it's very effective

525
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,229
Comparing Bik's with the tradional moves, his
allow more flexibility

526
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Let me tell you, the Wing Chun Leung Bik has
learned...

527
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,920
only accounts for a fraction of his father's

528
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
Most of his movements are made up

529
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,400
How can one improve without deconstructing the
old?

530
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,280
You are greedy to aspire for more before

531
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,920
you can manage the basic Wing Chun principles

532
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,680
You'll end up gaining nothing

533
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,880
I'm fed up. Enjoy your meal

534
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,320
Don't get upset, Brother Chung So

535
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,517
Man just got back, give him a chance!

536
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,920
Fine! He has his chance now

537
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,560
Show me the sort of deviance you've picked up

538
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,028
Get up, up!

539
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,472
Brother Chung So! Brother Chung So!

540
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,720
Brother Chung So! Stay away!

541
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,676
What happened to the things Leung Bik taught
you?

542
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Brother Chung So! Man!

543
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,120
Lp Man should be feeling sorry by now

544
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,520
Brother Chung So, that's enough!

545
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,600
Was it Wing Chun that he just demonstrated?

546
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,760
Does our school have high kick like that?

547
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,557
Or elbow as low as his?

548
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,760
Now, I demand you all go on your knees in front
of our master and vow that...

549
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,600
you will never again learn anything that deviates
from our school tradition

550
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,876
They have nothing to do with this, Brother Chung
So

551
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,440
It was me who wanted to try things out

552
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,640
They never said they wanted to learn it from me

553
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,518
I'm the only one who deserves punishment for
this

554
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,760
I have taught you all I know, Man

555
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,920
Thank you, Master!

556
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Stop calling me master

557
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,640
Why?

558
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Your master is Chan Wah Shun;

559
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,840
you have to show due respect

560
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,360
When I was young, I was too emotional

561
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,720
to try to think from another's perspective

562
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,040
And my family was too conservative

563
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,760
to accept my innovative ideas,

564
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,080
thus causing a lot of misunderstanding and
friction

565
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,720
In order to aviod conflict,

566
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,837
I decided to leave Foshan

567
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,120
Master, lp Man is gifted,

568
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,880
but he's such an ungrateful brat

569
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,792
Do you think I should expel him?

570
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,280
Please give me instruction, Master

571
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,640
If you think I should,

572
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,358
please show 'the head' when I toss the coin

573
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,960
Master, lp Man is young and restless;

574
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,560
he's doomed to make some mistakes

575
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,200
And... perhaps it's not entirely his fault

576
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,640
I might not be competent enough as an instructor

577
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,200
Why don't we do it three times to decide on the
result?

578
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,472
Thanks, Master

579
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,991
Thanks, Master, thanks a great deal

580
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
You are...

581
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,800
We heard that your Association has a reputation
for the vision of

582
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,720
promoting martial arts on the grounds of
abolishing segregation of schools

583
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,920
So we're here to join the Association

584
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,080
I'm glad that you share the same vision

585
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,040
How may I address you?

586
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,800
Before we enroll, I'd like to see

587
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
whether the Association is qualified to teach us

588
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,880
I don't quite understand what you mean

589
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,320
You need to show a sample when you sell goods

590
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,520
So we'd like to check out how competent the
masters are first

591
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,920
This is not how our Association operates

592
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,560
Don't make things difficult

593
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,840
All right, then. If you don't want to demonstate

594
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,592
we'll be happy to take over

595
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,000
You just came to create trouble

596
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,160
Hold it!

597
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,673
Wait a minute!

598
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Father

599
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,120
Chairman Kitano,

600
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,520
what do you want from us?

601
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,120
Not much, I only want to say hello

602
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,720
I don't think so, it's more like picking a fight

603
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,800
This is a place to learn martial arts;

604
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,916
I don't see why not!

605
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,919
Chairman Lee, allow me

606
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,431
Good! Good fight!

607
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,152
Stop! What are you doing?

608
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,195
Good! Good show!

609
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,031
Sorry that my daughter isn't as capable

610
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,959
Valour is better demonstrated by the young!

611
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,995
Come and have a snack, lp Man

612
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,840
Yours Triple fried sticks

613
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,080
Yes! My creation

614
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,080
Three-sided. How can one person finish it?

615
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,760
It's for all three of us. We each have one

616
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,760
You two have the crispy sides,

617
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,432
the middle part is not as crunchy

618
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,277
The triple stick is what you wanted when you
were a kid

619
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,320
I didn't say that

620
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,760
You really don't remember, eh?

621
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,360
It seemed that I had a sense of humour when I
was a kid

622
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,600
Too bad you have none left

623
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,354
I won't eat any more Mei Wai...

624
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,832
What have I said wrong?

625
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,076
No! Let's eat

626
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,760
Oh yes! I forgot to congratulate you

627
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,920
On what?

628
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,040
On your successful career in business, young
and hopeful

629
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,080
What's more, Chairman Lee will recommend you
for Vice Chairman

630
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,680
a bright future lies ahead of you

631
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,600
Stop teasing me. I owe this to Brother Chung
So's leadership

632
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,560
What's your plan after graduation?

633
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,438
I won't keep it from you, but don't laugh at me,
alright?

634
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,160
I'd like to start a martial arts school

635
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,040
to promote Wing Chun

636
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,920
What a wonderful idea! If you start in Foshan,

637
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,960
I'll come up with the capital for you

638
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,720
Not just in Foshan, I want it all over the world

639
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,680
I want to show the world how wonderful Wing
Chun is

640
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,840
The world? Great!

641
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,520
Congratulations to you, Guru of Wing Chun,

642
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,840
who will breed numerous splendid students

643
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,114
Thank you!

644
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,640
Also, when you become popular,

645
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,960
let's make a film

646
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,560
to promote Wing Chun to the whole world

647
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,039
You'll contribute the capital, and me, the hard
work

648
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,480
Good! What about profit?

649
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,240
Let's say thirty seventy Fifty fifty!

650
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
You forty me sixty. Definite!

651
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,600
The congee is getting cold. Eat!

652
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,478
Done deal! Let's eat first!

653
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,074
Sis!

654
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,240
What?

655
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,120
The mayor's son is here. He wants to ask you out
to a film

656
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,480
And Dad has agreed on your behalf

657
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,240
Is that right? Yes!

658
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,231
Did he say what film?

659
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,840
Do you really want to go? What about lp Man?

660
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,760
What about your freedom of romanatic love

661
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,080
Freedom of romantic love?

662
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,198
I've waited so long, but have yet to find my love

663
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,671
Perhaps lp Man and I are not connected

664
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,880
Do you really think so?

665
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,040
Or else how could I have done so much but to no
avail

666
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,393
What else can I do about it?

667
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,200
Look! A new film is on

668
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
I don't think you're a fan of horrors

669
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,600
Let's go have a drink

670
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,680
No! I want to see the film

671
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,716
I'll go get the ticket, then

672
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,640
This way please!

673
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,437
Here's your ticket, have a seat.

674
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,759
Ip Man?

675
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,952
Miss Justice?

676
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
Aren't you the daughter of the Deputy Major?

677
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,120
How are you?

678
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,160
Hello! Watching this film, too?

679
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,120
Yes, what a small world!

680
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,192
Miss Cheung was looking for you, Man

681
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,152
Really? Anything important?

682
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,829
Let's wait until the end of the film

683
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,960
You're not even afraid of thugs

684
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,394
I thought you're the fearless kind

685
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,918
Of course I'm fearless

686
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,040
Don't touch me! What's happening now?

687
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,669
Now Dracula is moving towards the female lead

688
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,032
and about to bite her

689
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,154
Is the biting over? He's still biting

690
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,320
Alright, you may open your eyes now

691
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,912
Are you sure?

692
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,397
Yes!

693
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,400
I'm Dracula So am I

694
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,880
Scared the wits out of me. Excuse me

695
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,920
Please allow me to take you home, Miss Cheung

696
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Don't worry about it, Mr. Cho, bye!

697
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,320
Come on... Miss Cheung, when will we...

698
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,360
Three yams, please!

699
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,280
Thanks for taking me to the film, thank you very
much.

700
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,952
See you Bye!

701
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,360
Buying yams?

702
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,680
Where did you pick up your Englsih, Miss
Cheung?

703
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,120
I learned it myself

704
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,280
My brother took Englsih lessons in Hong Kong,
too

705
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,880
Perhaps you two can get together

706
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,393
and practise speaking it

707
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,320
Where are we heading now?

708
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,240
Tomorrow will be our Master's birthday, we'll go
buy a chicken

709
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,320
OK Let's leave, Mei Wai

710
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
We don't speak English, neither do you!

711
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,673
Let's go

712
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,360
Didn't you say you had something to ask me?

713
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,120
No need now

714
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,440
You're amusing,

715
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,440
yet I have a question to ask you

716
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Please do

717
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,271
I've not got your name

718
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,720
Didn't you address me as Miss Justice?

719
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,000
I like it

720
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,355
You're not going to tell me

721
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,389
My name is Cheung Wing Shing

722
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,480
The feeling of thinking of a person,

723
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,640
whose name is not known,

724
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,360
is like listening to a song

725
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,158
without knowing the title

726
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Or you know the person's name,

727
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,080
but not what he's thinking about

728
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,920
The feeling is like listening to a song,

729
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,070
when the title is familiar but not the tune

730
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,873
One, two, three, four

731
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,840
Is it hurting you?

732
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,760
It's not nice to me. Beat it up

733
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,398
Watch me!

734
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,360
Like this, one, two

735
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,320
So slow, speed it up,

736
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,440
come on, come on

737
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,874
Don't laugh, laughing drains energy

738
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,400
Look at you, being around this log all day long

739
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,360
You've grown to be loglike,

740
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,316
hopelessly inarticulate

741
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,353
How can I be more expressive, then?

742
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,560
You can exercise your thoughts, for instance...

743
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,400
Think of something you like

744
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,992
or somebody you want to be with

745
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,560
Well, I'll stick your name here, then,

746
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,160
Cheung... Wing... Shing

747
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,960
So you want to beat me up every day?

748
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,840
No, no, no! I just want to be with you

749
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,960
lp Man! Go and help prepare dinner

750
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,030
I'm taking Wing Shing out for dinner

751
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,480
Come over here, Wing Shing, I have something
to tell you

752
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,993
Go clean the study Yes, Sir!

753
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,997
What do you want to tell me, Dad?

754
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,200
You've made a major mistake, Wing Shing

755
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,792
What major mistake?

756
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,040
The worst I could think of was giving the Mayor's
son the cold shoulder

757
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,560
You shouldn't have gone out with that martial arts
guy, lp Man

758
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,960
If you loathe martial arts guys so much,

759
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,080
why do you support the Jing Wu Athletic
Association, then?

760
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,920
I support them because my job requires it

761
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,880
Our freidnship is not based on a job

762
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,600
I'm not a hypocrite like you

763
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,440
Me a hypocrite? I'm your dad

764
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,480
why won't you listen to me?

765
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,840
I'm just worried that you make friends who are a
bad influence

766
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,440
and bring disgrace on the family

767
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,557
Unless you don't care much about our family,

768
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,510
go back to your room and reflect

769
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,200
For you Thank you

770
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,350
I'm sure it'll bring a lot of sweet dreams

771
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,720
I'm afraid that we might have to stop seeing each
other

772
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,119
What happened?

773
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,640
I'm here to see Deputy Mayor Cheung

774
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,993
Please come in!

775
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,229
Please take a seat, Sir

776
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,793
OK, it's done

777
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,309
I hope to see you soon, Mr. Cheung

778
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,760
The pleasure was all mine

779
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,432
See you soon

780
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,512
By the way, where can I purchase bone china?

781
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,720
He wants to find out where he can purchase
some Chinese bones

782
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,400
Chinese bones?

783
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,960
The British simply adore bone china

784
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,720
The British have developed a taste for Chinese
bones

785
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,870
I think he can get a better price from the
slaughter house

786
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,240
Go to the Killing Animal House to buy some

787
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,920
Killing Animal?

788
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,115
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Kill, kill, kill

789
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,720
In that place they kill chickens, kill cows,

790
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,836
kill pigs, kill ducks, kill geese...

791
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,880
Good. Thank you OK!

792
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,760
Sir!

793
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,673
The British would like to buy bone China

794
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,316
He wants bone china!

795
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,600
Just kidding

796
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Mr. Cheung says he can take you to buy very
good china bone

797
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,000
Just kidding

798
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,280
Thanks for doing the favor for me

799
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,998
Goodbye Goodbye

800
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,680
Your English is not bad, young man

801
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,920
Your name? Lp Man

802
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,760
So you're lp Man, here for Wing Shing?

803
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,760
I'm here to pay a special visit to Mr. Deputy
Mayor

804
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,398
Pay me a visit?

805
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,160
Something's happening, sis!

806
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,480
What are you fussing about?

807
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,760
Lp Man's here lp Man's here?

808
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,558
He came to see Dad. I don't know what they're
up to. Come and see

809
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,629
Let me help you! No, thanks!

810
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,680
Let's go to a movie tonight

811
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,720
What about the others?

812
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,349
Siu Shan and Yiu Choi don't like dramas

813
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,708
What about lp Man?

814
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,600
Lp Man... has company

815
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,795
Let me think about it

816
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,592
Don't think for too long. The movie will be off soon

817
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,279
When do you want to go, then?

818
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,960
Actually, I've already got two tickets

819
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,837
Too bad I couldn't get toffee,

820
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,752
only some chocolates

821
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,840
Good day, Master Ng. This is a present from Mr.
Chan

822
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,040
Thank you, Yiu Choi! Yes!

823
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,840
Take the presents to the main hall

824
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,120
This way, please! Thank you!

825
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,680
Look at these paper cuts, Man

826
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,840
Thanks for your trouble Thank you!

827
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,353
Lay it out properly

828
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,760
Hey, move the left lantern more to the left

829
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,320
All right!

830
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,640
Move the right lantern more to the right

831
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
Finished?

832
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,960
Is my writing all right?

833
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,080
Tin Chi! Lp Man!

834
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,880
Put these couplets on the front door

835
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,080
Alright!

836
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,160
I'll get the rice paste, be back soon

837
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,559
Hurry!

838
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,632
Mr. Ip Tin Chi

839
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,320
Can I help you?

840
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,680
The Kitanos asked me

841
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,600
to deliver a gift on your big day

842
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,352
Happy wedding day!

843
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,753
I really want to know how you feel now

844
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,320
Thank you all! Cheers!

845
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,760
Hope you have beautiful kids

846
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,910
I appreciate it Congratulations!

847
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,995
Please take a seat!

848
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,274
Mr. Ip, please sit down! Thanks

849
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,520
What a great evening!

850
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,920
Tin Chi's got himself a wife and I've got a
daughter

851
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,320
I'm very happy, too. To me, Mei Wai is like half a
daughter

852
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,040
while Tin Chi is half a son

853
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,400
Now half a daughter is marrying half a son;

854
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,960
half a son is marrying half a daughter

855
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,520
The two halves together form a perfect couple

856
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,520
Don't forget that Tin Chi is my whole son

857
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,000
I'm most thrilled to see him

858
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,160
marrying your half daughter

859
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,600
You'll have another happy occasion very soon

860
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,640
I believe it'll be lp Man's turn soon

861
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,400
Keep up the good work, Man!

862
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,080
Tin Chi, have a wonderful wedding night!

863
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,760
Thanks! Congratulations on your promotion

864
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,840
to the Deputy Chairmanship, too. Cheers!

865
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,920
Thank you! Why don't we fill up the glasses?

866
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,800
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

867
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,920
Bottoms up! Tin Chi, work hard!

868
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,230
I know, Dad. Cheers!

869
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,080
To my woman

870
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,991
To my man

871
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,993
Cheers again! Great!

872
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,199
Come on!

873
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,720
Master!

874
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,029
He was very happy and is a bit tipsy

875
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,920
Stay here tonight, Man

876
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Go to sleep, go!

877
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,000
Yes, Sir!

878
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,638
Watch your step Man

879
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,040
Let's fill our glasses again

880
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,080
It's getting late, President Lee

881
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,399
What do you mean by late?

882
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,120
The night is still young

883
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,800
Tin Chi said your martial arts skill is superb

884
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,240
Come on! Show me your skills

885
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,520
Next time!

886
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,600
Why next time? Let's do it tonight

887
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,720
President Lee, seriously, it's getting late!

888
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,836
Let's not start late, then

889
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,155
President Lee!

890
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,160
Sir!

891
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,160
We don't need you here. Retire to your room

892
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,798
Let's try again President Lee!

893
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,154
Let's go! Yes, Sir

894
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,514
Sit tight, off we go!

895
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,720
Master Ng, Master lp,

896
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,360
where's Tin Chi? Isn't he coming?

897
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,840
It was his wedding night last night

898
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,160
I'll tell him later

899
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,388
Let's go in first

900
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,590
Master This way

901
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,040
I can't imagine the honorable and respected

902
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,760
President ended up with such a tragic death

903
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,480
We must locate the murderer,

904
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,640
the President cannot die in vain

905
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,000
Show me in

906
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,200
Have you reported to the police?

907
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,080
Not yet We'd better report it first

908
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,071
Right away Got it!

909
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,035
Where's my brother? In his room

910
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,079
lp Tin Chi!

911
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,395
Lp Tin Chi!

912
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,280
Lp Tin Chi, come with me

913
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,720
What's wrong? You stay here

914
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,836
You come with me right now; I have to talk to you

915
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,160
What's the matter?

916
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,160
People should have qualms of conscience

917
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,000
What're you getting at?

918
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,080
Didn't Lee Man Ho treat you like his son?

919
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,280
Why did you do that?

920
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,508
What've I done?

921
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,480
Are you out of your mind?

922
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,600
Stop acting innocent!

923
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,240
Strangle me if you have the balls

924
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,280
I have no clue what you're talking about

925
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,200
You strangled President Lee, only you used left
hand

926
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,520
Lee is dead?

927
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,240
I won't let him die in vain!

928
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,160
Let go of him, Man!

929
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,200
What are you two doing? Why start a fight?

930
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,880
Your Godfather was killed

931
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,314
Look this man in the eyes. He is the killer

932
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,560
All because he was strangled with the left hand,

933
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,320
you're accusing me of murder

934
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,560
I'm not the only one in Foshan who's learned the
strangling move

935
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,120
You taught me this move

936
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,400
You know how to strangle with your left hand,
too.

937
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,200
The Japanese want to get rid of their opponents

938
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,720
You must be the one who helped them

939
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,720
Tell me, why did the Japanese send gifts to your
wedding?

940
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,400
I do business with many foreigners

941
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,280
It's no surprise that the Japanese would send me
presents

942
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,477
Swear that you have nothing to do with President
Lee's murder

943
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,720
All right! I, lp Tin Chi swear...

944
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,920
Tin Chi, the police are here

945
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,911
lp Man, have you reported to the police?

946
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,960
Mr. Ip Tin Chi,

947
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,320
we are here to take Mr. Ip Man to the police
station

948
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,800
Why are you taking my brother away?

949
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,120
He's suspected of President Lee's murder

950
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,600
Lee's servant witnessed a fight

951
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,680
and heated argument between lp Man and Lee
last night

952
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,320
The President was quite drunk

953
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,720
and my brother just escorted him home

954
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,840
No need to start a fight with President Lee

955
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,640
after taking him home, right?

956
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,880
Arrest him

957
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,560
You're not taking lp Man away

958
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,600
There must be some understanding here My
brother doesn't kill

959
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,480
Mr. Ip, please stop your wife from obstructing our
course of action

960
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,200
I'll go with them

961
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,760
I fear not as I'm innocent

962
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,239
Go!

963
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,640
Lp Tin Chi, remember you swore an oath

964
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,360
Inspector, if you don't have enough evidence to
press charges

965
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,560
you have to release him

966
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,680
Deputy Mayor, lp Man has been charged with
felony

967
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,760
We need more time to investigate

968
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,080
lp Man is innocent, you can't lock him up.

969
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,520
Miss Cheung, we go by evidence;

970
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,960
we don't bring charges against innocent citizens

971
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,760
There are witnesses in this case

972
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,960
If he's innocent,

973
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,280
why won't he try to defend himself?

974
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,000
You keep saying lp Man is innocent;

975
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,400
do you have evidence, Miss Cheung?

976
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,914
Unless you can prove his innocence, stop making
these empty claims

977
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,800
lp Tin Chi has been elected

978
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,040
President of the Jing Wu Athletic Association

979
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,600
Good! Congratulations!

980
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,200
Congratulations! Thank you!

981
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,395
Congratulations! Thank you!

982
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,840
Mr. Kitano will donate $300,000

983
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,160
to the Association

984
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:02,480
And will send his students here to exchange
knowledge.

985
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,879
Any objections?

986
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,238
Lee Man Ho... killers in ambush

987
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,480
You can leave now!

988
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,357
How come?

989
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,599
Let's get out of here first

990
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,560
Come on!

991
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,480
At 10:30 pm, the night of the murder,

992
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,400
lp Man came to my place

993
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,160
We stayed up and chatted

994
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:27,120
He was drunk and so spent the night in my room

995
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,480
Miss Cheung, are you telling the truth?

996
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,800
Were you really with lp Man on the night of the
murder?

997
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,640
Your testimony is critical to the case

998
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,920
If you're making things up,

999
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,638
you could be arrested

1000
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,160
I swear the truth in my capacity as the Deputy
Mayor's daughter

1001
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,600
However, I can't simply take your alibi

1002
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,600
and believe that lp Man is innocent

1003
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,440
I need more supporting evidence

1004
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,800
More supporting evidence?

1005
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,080
Is my daughter's chastity not enough

1006
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,798
to prove his innocence?

1007
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,360
I guess I need the Provincial Governor

1008
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,157
to come and do justice

1009
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,600
Dad, don't be too upset

1010
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,000
I had no alternative but to make up such a lie

1011
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,760
I'm so sorry

1012
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,720
You sacrificed your reputation

1013
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,680
to rescue him;

1014
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,560
just to rescue a Kung Fu guy!

1015
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,840
You must marry my sister as soon as you can!

1016
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,800
Dad, don't get mad! Wing Shing!

1017
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,040
Sorry! I'm not worth it

1018
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,156
Worth it or not is only for me to decide

1019
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,797
I don't want you to marry me because of this

1020
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,073
Wing Shing!

1021
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,600
That's not what I mean, I want you to marry me

1022
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,720
I'll take you as my wife with an official ceremony
and a grand wedding.

1023
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,358
Your father need not worry

1024
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,636
Mei Wai! Mei Wai!

1025
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,320
Mei Wai, why are you doing this?

1026
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,596
Did you kill my Godfather, Tin Chi?

1027
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,600
Do you work for the Japanese?

1028
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,440
Did you betray your own people for money, or for
power?

1029
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,800
It's not as simple as you think

1030
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,836
It's hard to explain

1031
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,840
Mei Wai, please don't leave me!

1032
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,960
Listen to me

1033
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,360
I beg you. Please listen!

1034
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,640
What other lies do you want to tell me?

1035
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,758
You can't die, you'll be a mother soon

1036
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:22,680
But you've killed, you should give yourself in

1037
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,360
It won't work! It won't work!

1038
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,320
Listen!

1039
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,153
We should go somewhere we belong

1040
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,988
Where's the letter?

1041
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,869
Who came?

1042
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,840
Tell me, who came?

1043
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,520
No... Nobody

1044
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,671
Tell me who was here?

1045
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,349
Brother Chung So... he came to see me just now

1046
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,680
I've caused my brother enough damage,

1047
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,955
I don't want to involve Brother Chung So

1048
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,040
Where are you heading?

1049
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,440
I've done so much for your career advancement

1050
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,600
Dad even made lp Man the culprit for your crime

1051
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,400
And you back out because of this lowly woman!

1052
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,680
I've done what you told me. What more do you
want from me?

1053
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,400
Kill Ng Chung So; he's aware that you're working
for us

1054
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,360
For you, and for us,

1055
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,560
whoever gets in the way should be eliminated

1056
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,320
I don't want to kill any more!

1057
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,799
This is not an option!

1058
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,160
Tin Chi! Don't hurt her!

1059
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,920
Tin Chi!

1060
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,920
I gave you my word on the honor of a samurai:

1061
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,680
You'll be free to leave after this mission

1062
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,720
Don't say that you haven't been given a second
chance!

1063
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,720
How can I overcome him?

1064
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,711
If you can't do this alone, we'll form a brother and
sister team

1065
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,080
Tin Chi, come out!

1066
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,200
Tin Chi, come out quick!

1067
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,440
We don't spare traitors in the Wing Chun Martial
Arts School

1068
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,960
He's no longer your senior

1069
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,030
Get him out here, now!

1070
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,798
Tin Chi! Tin Chi!

1071
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,960
I beg your forgiveness, Master

1072
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,109
I've failed as a teacher and a leader

1073
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,238
Yiu Choi! Yiu Choi!

1074
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,599
Master!

1075
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,514
Lp Tin Chi, you traitor!

1076
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,912
That's no way to treat your fellow disciples

1077
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,674
Watch out, Man! I will!

1078
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,348
Kill him!

1079
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,079
Clear the way!

1080
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,240
I beat you up, not in revenge for being framed

1081
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,320
But to defend Lee Man Ho,

1082
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,560
the Master, and Dad's reputation

1083
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,960
Why did you turn traitor

1084
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,393
when you were so loved and respected by us?

1085
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,278
I'm not a traitor!

1086
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:05,996
I'm a Japanese sergeant, Tanaka Eiketsu

1087
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,755
I left my parents when I was twelve

1088
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,280
to become a spy in China

1089
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,720
I miss my country,

1090
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,392
I want to go home

1091
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,960
I couldn't even see my mother

1092
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,240
when she died

1093
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:32,075
I have yet to be able to pay my respects at her
grave

1094
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:41,920
It might not be a bad idea to die now,

1095
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,911
so everything can be ended

1096
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,439
I'm a soldier, which leaves me no choice

1097
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,953
I'm relieved now

1098
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,436
as I've finally carried out my mission

1099
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,439
I don't need to hurt the people I love any more

1100
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,877
It's been a pleasure to be adopted by the lp
family

1101
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,717
and be your brother

1102
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,680
I have no regrets,

1103
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,480
as Mei Wai has been my wife

1104
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,072
Where's Mei Wai now?

1105
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,480
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's
shadow, not his hand.

1106
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,391
Focus on what you feel rather than what you see

1107
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,718
Where's Tin Chi?

1108
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,637
I feel guilty; I wasn't able to keep his son

1109
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,160
Captain, these crates have just arrived

1110
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,280
They are all Kitano's

1111
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,999
Open them for inspection!

1112
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:19,640
Where am I? Who are you?

1113
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,520
I want to go home

1114
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,760
There's one over here, too!

1115
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,955
Over here, too! Help him out

1116
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,600
Any water? Give them some!

1117
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,794
Will do!

1118
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
Easy, get him out!

1119
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,434
Dad, a beggar is unconscious outside

1120
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,960
Don't be afraid! Leave!

1121
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,678
Give them some water!

1122
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,720
At the critical moment,

1123
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,040
he arrived in a hurry with a long rod in hand,

1124
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:19,240
beating the hell out of the Japanese with

1125
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,040
the authentic Wing Chun 'half-past six' rod style

1126
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,160
However, his rod was slashed into two halves

1127
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,840
by your Uncle Tin Chi's Japanese sword

1128
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,000
Yet Tin Chi didn't let go,

1129
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,560
he pressed even harder...

1130
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:38,156
by attacking lp Man with Karate and Judo

1131
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,800
How did my Dad react?

1132
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,040
He was very alert;

1133
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,080
he immediately used the two half rods

1134
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,760
like a pair of wing-shaped swords,

1135
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,600
and brandished them frantically,

1136
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,120
at times mixing in some unknown styles,

1137
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,800
styles difficult to identify, to beat his opponent

1138
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,640
These mixed movements, regardless of their
authenticity,

1139
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,920
were not only powerful enough to win,

1140
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,840
but also good enough to save my life

1141
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,640
From then on, I stopped believing that martial
arts schools

1142
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,840
should be segregated to maintain their own
authentic styles

1143
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,120
My eyes were opened and saw a broader horizon

1144
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,200
I don't understand how Uncle Tin Chi picked up
Japanese Kung Fu

1145
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,680
Yeah! Why? Why?

1146
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,440
As a matter of fact, your Uncle Tin Chi...

1147
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,680
Why stop practicing? Dad!

1148
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:23,080
Go and do more training and practice. Hurry!
Hurry!

1149
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,800
Let's go and practice!

1150
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,160
Telling stories again, Brother Chung So?

1151
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,680
You've gone over them thousands of times

1152
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:32,080
The thing is, every time it's a new story to them

1153
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,680
You're right! Children should know about their
past

1154
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,840
Pay full attention when you practice. You are not
allowed to eat before you're done

1155
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,440
Dinner's ready, Jun! Stop the training

1156
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:43,280
Come and eat, everybody!

1157
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,640
Dad says I have to practise well before I can eat

1158
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:52,400
What's more important? Martial Arts or food?

1159
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,040
Food! Dad!

1160
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,800
All right! Take a good rest

1161
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,000
Practise more after you eat

1162
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,514
Eat!
