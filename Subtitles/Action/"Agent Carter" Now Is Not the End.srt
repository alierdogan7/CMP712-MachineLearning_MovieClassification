broom closet finally came to.

724
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,775
Says he caught a blonde with
Raymond's body around 9:30.

725
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,010
Why didn't he stop her?

726
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:47,379
'Cause they're still pulling
staples out of his face.

727
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:49,248
[Telephone rings]

728
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,250
Get that.

729
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:52,251
Chief Dooley's office.

730
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,652
So we're looking for an angry blonde.

731
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:55,020
Have you called my house?

732
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,023
And that is where my
promotion comes in, chief.

733
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:01,093
I talked to the club photographer.

734
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,128
He thinks he got a shot of her.

735
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:07,299
I'm thinking real hard about
kissing you right now, son.

736
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:08,500
Yeah, I'll tell him.

737
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:10,168
Double-time this over to
the lab, see if we can...

738
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:12,671
Port Authority says Roxxon
Refinery just blew up.

739
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:14,106
The whole thing?

740
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,374
Any casualties?

741
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,442
Hard to say. They can't find the building.

742
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:21,480
Let's go. You two, you're with me.

743
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,453
[Jazz music plays]

744
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:30,222
Carter: Perhaps some warm milk.

745
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:32,224
Jarvis: Something a little
stronger might be in order.

746
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:34,593
You did very well, Mr. Jarvis.

747
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:37,095
Your wife would be very proud.

748
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:39,097
She must never, ever know.

749
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,533
You'll get used to that.

750
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:45,437
What word did he use?

751
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:47,706
"Leviathan."

752
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:52,544
I'll check Mr. Stark's files.

753
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:57,883
Provided the SSR hasn't taken them all.

754
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,285
Get some rest.

755
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:03,689
To be perfectly honest...

756
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:06,224
I'm not sure I'll sleep for days.

757
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:12,497
[Bell dings] Cook: Order up!

758
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:16,835
Hey, honey, you back there,

759
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,104
or are you still getting your beauty sleep?

760
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:20,405
Yes, sir. You're in early this morning.

761
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:21,440
How can I help?

762
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:22,574
You do know the difference

763
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,576
between real eggs and powdered ones, right?

764
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,978
Believe it or not.

765
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:28,013
I did three weeks in a P.O.W. camp.

766
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:30,816
The Nazis fed us better than this.

767
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,985
Next time, don't get
smart with me, sweetheart.

768
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,619
Your brains aren't your best feature.

769
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:35,854
[Smack]

770
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:37,189
[Chuckles]

771
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:40,258
[Door opens, closes]

772
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,430
I understand you're not
happy with your meal.

773
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:47,099
- You work here?
- Unfortunately, no.

774
00:40:47,134 --> 00:40:48,433
Ohh! Just so we're clear,

775
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:50,302
this is pressed into your brachial artery.

776
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:51,937
It may be dull, but I'm determined.

777
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,138
Keep smiling.

778
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:54,306
Once you start to bleed,

779
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,041
you'll lose consciousness in 15 seconds.

780
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:58,176
You'll die in 90 unless
someone comes to your aid.

781
00:40:58,212 --> 00:40:59,678
Now, given your recent behavior,

782
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,046
how likely do you think that is to happen?

783
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,214
[Groans]

784
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:04,116
To prevent this not entirely
unfortunate event from occurring,

785
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:06,418
I'd suggest you find a new place to eat.

786
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:07,719
Do we understand each other?

787
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:09,021
[Strained] Yeah. Good.

788
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,057
Oh, one more thing... Tip generously.

789
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,291
[Exhales deeply]

790
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:24,102
[Indistinct conversations]

791
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,141
Jarvis: [Sighs]

792
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:31,043
Swish the glass with the vermouth,

793
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:32,711
tip it out, <i>then</i> add the gin.

794
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,112
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,

795
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:36,481
but I'm afraid I can't
be everywhere at once.

796
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:40,152
Well, you're quite right.

797
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:43,155
Miss Carter's an excellent choice.

798
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,758
I don't think she'll have
any suspicions at all.
