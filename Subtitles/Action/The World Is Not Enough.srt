00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,948
BILBAO, SPAIN

2
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:51,088
So good of you to come, Mr. Bond,
particularly on such short notice.

3
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:54,927
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

4
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:58,009
"Bon." Now that we're all comfortable,

5
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,170
why don't you sit down?

6
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,409
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

7
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,569
No doubt Sir Robert
will be pleased to see it again.

8
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:13,410
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees and certain

9
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,369
unforeseeable expenses.
"Voilá." Your receipt.

10
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,171
Would you like to check my figures?

11
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:24,010
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

12
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,891
- It's all there.
- I didn't come for the money.

13
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:34,412
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an MI6 agent who was killed for it.

14
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,611
I want to know who killed him.

15
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:40,452
- Terrible tragedy.
- I just want a name.

16
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:46,612
I am merely the middleman. I'm just
returning the money to its rightful owner.

17
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:51,772
And we know how difficult that can be
for a Swiss banker.

18
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:58,454
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.

19
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:02,054
I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out alive.

20
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:05,735
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,

21
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:08,414
I'd say that the numbers
are not on your side.

22
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:11,615
Perhaps you failed
to take into account my...

23
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,294
hidden assets.

24
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:27,215
Get up! You seem to have had
a small reversal of fortune.

25
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,535
- Give me the name.
- I can't tell you.

26
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,816
Let's count to three.

27
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:33,697
You can do that, can't you?

28
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,296
One.

29
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,136
Two.

30
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:42,736
All right, but you'll have to protect me...

31
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:26,225
MI6 HEADQUARTERS
LONDON

32
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:39,506
James! Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

33
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,585
Chocolates? An engagement ring?

34
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,306
I thought you might enjoy one of these.

35
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,347
How romantic.

36
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:53,387
I know exactly where to put that.

37
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:59,267
Oh, Moneypenny.
The story of our relationship.

38
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,468
Close, but no cigar.

39
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:08,188
<i>I hate to tear you away, 007.</i>
Would you mind coming in?

40
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,347
Right away, M.

41
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:14,548
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

42
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,348
Ah, the man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough.

43
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,829
Careful, M. I might steal him from you.

44
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,310
Construction's not exactly
my... speciality.

45
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,189
Quite the opposite, in fact.

46
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,990
Best to the family.

47
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,831
- Old friend?
- We read law at Oxford together.

48
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,030
I always knew he'd conquer the world.

49
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,471
- Care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

50
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:50,511
- He's a man of great integrity.
- Who buys stolen reports for £3m.

51
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,632
Thank you.

52
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,872
- Any leads on the sniper?
- Not one. Professional job.

53
00:05:57,112 --> 00:06:00,233
She must be working for someone.
Is this the stolen report?

54
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,752
Yes, classified, from the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

55
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,473
What would King want this for?

56
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,992
He was led to believe
the document was a secret report,

57
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:13,754
identifying the terrorists
who'd attacked his new oil pipeline.

58
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,872
Interesting.

59
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:22,073
But it doesn't explain why someone
would want me out of their office alive.

60
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:33,915
- King! The money!
- Moneypenny, stop King.

61
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:42,876
Move! Move! Move!

62
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,997
Stop!

63
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,679
Move!

64
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,279
- Get out of the way!
- Medics coming through!

65
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,041
Stop! Stop! It isn't finished!

66
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:16,176
What was that?!

67
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,942
- Let's go!
- What the hell do you think?

68
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:37,383
Let's go!

69
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:03,825
Listen to me!

70
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:09,184
You can't get away. We can make a deal.
Who are you working for?

71
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:12,146
Don't do it! Don't blow us up!

72
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,465
I can protect you!
Do you understand? I can protect you.

73
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,866
Not from him.

74

100
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,759
# <i>I feel ready</i>

101
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,718

00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,239

00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:15,279
# <i>No, nowhere near enough</i>

105
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,160
# <i>The world is not enough</i>

106
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,641
That's right.

107
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:40,282
Hello, my dear.

108
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:53,643
- Who's that young woman?
- King's daughter.

109
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,202
Elektra.

110
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,043
Thank you.

111
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,124
<i>The money was dipped in urea,</i>

MI6 HEADQUARTERS
SCOTLAND

113
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,243
<i>in effect, a fertilizer bomb.</i>

114
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,324
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands

115
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:10,083
started a chemical reaction.

116
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:13,364
In one of the notes
the anti-counterfeiting strip

117
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:16,963
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

118
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,484
And King's lapel pin
was switched for a copy,

119
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:23,245
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

120
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:27,245
In other words,
"he" set off the bomb that killed him.

121
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,566
We know it was someone close to King.

122
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,765
And our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.

123
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,526
But given the size of
King's organization,

124
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:38,365
it could be anyone, anywhere.

125
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:41,006
M.

126
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,765
This will not stand.

127
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:49,847
We will not be terrorized by cowards who
would murder, and use us as the tool.

128
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,046
We'll find these people.

129
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:56,127
We'll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth if needs be.

130
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,407
And we "will" bring them to justice.

131
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:12,449
Tanner!

132
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:19,450
Sorry, James. M says you're off the active
duty list until you're cleared by Medical.

133
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,569
Dislocated collarbone.

134
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,529
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you'll be out of action for weeks.

135
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,009
Molly, I need a clean bill of health.

136
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,650
You have to clear me for duty.

137
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,731
James,

138
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:42,610
- that wouldn't really be...
- Ethical?

139
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,211
Practical... smart.

140
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:51,931
Well, let's just... skirt the issue, shall we?

141
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:55,172
You'd have to promise to call me...

142
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,331
...this time.

143
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,012
Whatever the doctor orders.

144
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:03,171
And I suppose if you stayed
in constant contact...

145
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:04,692
Of course.

146
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,973
If you showed sufficient stamina,

147
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,733
- and cut out all kinds of...
- Strenuous activity?

148
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,334
We all have to pay the piper some time.

149
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:38,296
- Right, Q?
- Oh, pipe down, 007.

150
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:40,375
Was it something I said?

151
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,815
No. Something you destroyed.

152
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,736
My fishing boat.

153
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,536
For my retirement. Away from you!

154
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,377
Now, I want to introduce you to

155
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:57,697
the young fellow
I'm grooming to follow me.

156
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,137
Helps if you open the door.

157
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,698
And you might be?

158
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:15,577
- This is 007.
- If you're Q, does that make him R?

159
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:19,499
Ah, yes, the legendary 007 wit.

160
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,737
Or at least half of it.

161
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:25,099
Now I dare say, 007,
that you've met your match

162
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,459
- with this machine.
- Yeah?

163
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,459
New model, improved specs?

164
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:33,540
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

165
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,379
Yes, well, we'll see about that. So?

166
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:39,500
The very latest in intercepts
and countermeasures.

167
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,219
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display,

168
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,220
and six beverage cup holders.

169
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,821
All in all, rather stocked!

170
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,220
Fully loaded, I think is the term.

171
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,381
- I think...
- You're not here to think.

172
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,860
You're here to do what I tell you.
Now go and put on the coat

173
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,021
and demonstrate it for 007.

174
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:02,102
But of course.

175
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:05,781
Now watch closely, please, 007.

176
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,302
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus,

177
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,821
and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

178
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:15,703
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

179
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,104
Take the lower part of the zipper

180
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:21,503
- and insert it into the...
- Oh, pull the tag!

181
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:25,184
What? You said...

182
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,424
Q!

183
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:32,943
Seems well-suited for the job.

184
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:37,064
You're not retiring any time soon,

185
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,865
are you?

186
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:43,185
Now pay attention, 007.
I've always tried to teach you two things.

187
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:46,426
First, never let them see you bleed.

188
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:47,984
And the second?

189
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,266
Always have an escape plan.

190
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:07,067
<i>Good evening.</i>
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

191
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:11,947
<i>The Cyprus authorities say she escaped</i>
after shooting dead two of her captors,

192
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:15,946
<i>and is...</i>

193
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:19,668
<i>He shouted.</i>

194
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:24,187
<i>He shouted all the time.</i>

195
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,511
<i>Level One. Clearance required.</i>

196
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:18,193
<i>Level One. Clearance required.</i>

197
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,112
Yes, 007?

198
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:24,873
Tell me about the kidnapping

199
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,312
- of Elektra King.
- I wasn't aware you were on this case.

200
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,713
I brought the money in that killed King.

201
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:35,673
- Don't make this personal.
- I'm not. Are you?

202
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:40,873
You're the only one
who could seal her file.

203
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:46,395
Will you excuse us?

204
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:55,154
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

205
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:03,075
What happened?

206
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:07,836
After Elektra King was kidnapped,

207
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:11,236
her father tried to deal with it
on his own,

208
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:13,676
with no success.

209
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,356
So he came to me.

210
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,917
As you are aware,

211
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:30,877
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

212
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,558
And against every instinct in my heart,

213
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:35,638
every...

214
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:37,637
emotion as a mother,

215
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,358
I told him not to pay the ransom.

216
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:44,638
I thought we had time on our side.

217
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:48,159
You used the girl as bait.

218
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,040
Yes.

219
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,159
The money in King's briefcase

220
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:59,239
was precisely the same amount
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

221
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,361
It's a message.

222
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,600
Your terrorist is back.

223
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,761
Victor Zokas, aka...

224
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,922
Renard, the anarchist.

225
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:23,321
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

226
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,601
And he's been spotted in Afghanistan,
Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Beirut,

227
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:29,922
and Cambodia.

228
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,203
All the romantic vacation spots.

229
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,441
His only goal is chaos.

230
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,883
After Robert came to me
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

231
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:41,602
Before he completed the mission,
Elektra escaped.

232
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,803
A week later our man
caught up with the target.

233
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,804
He put a bullet in his head.

234
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,843
That bullet's still there.

235
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,963
How did he survive?

236
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:53,924
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out.

237
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:56,483
So Renard killed him.

238
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,284
It's moving through
the medulla oblongata,

239
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,285
killing off his senses.

240
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,764
Touch, smell, he feels no pain...

241
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:07,285
He can push himself harder,
longer than any normal man.

242
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,326
The bullet will kill him,

243
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:14,606
but he'll grow stronger every day
until the day he dies.

244
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,365
Robert is dead,

245
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:22,807
MI6 is humiliated.
He's had his revenge.

246
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,286
Not quite.

247
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:28,767
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping.

248
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:32,486
And there's still one he hasn't touched.

249
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:35,167
Elektra.

250
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,806
M.

251
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:44,889
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

252
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:49,368
I'm sure she was
touched by his dedication

253
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,048
to the job in hand.

254
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,609
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

255
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:59,570
She's taken over the construction of her
father's oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.

256
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:01,649
Find who switched that pin.

257
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:04,610
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back.

258
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,809
- And Elektra will be the next target.
- The worm on the hook again?

259
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,571
She doesn't need to know the same man
may be after her. Don't frighten her.

260
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:15,450
A shadow operation?

261
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,891
Remember,
shadows stay in front or behind.

262
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:22,090
Never on top.

263
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,412
AZERBAIJAN

264
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,576
You, go back. Leave! This area is closed.

265
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:25,655
I'm here to see Elektra King.

266
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:27,736
James Bond, Universal Exports.

267
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,856
I'm Davidov, Chief of Security.

268
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:33,936
We're having some problems
with the villagers.

269
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,617
I've told Miss King
to stay at the office in Baku.

270
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:41,937
Oh, hell!

271
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,978
- Miss King, I told you to stay...
- I know what you told me.

272
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,460
Come with me.

273
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,139
Understand us and help us, God,
for God's sake.

274
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:24,620
The fact is that this is
our mutual inheritance.

275
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,941
This is our faith.
You mustn't allow for this.

276
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:31,420
No. My family is very well tied
to this place.

277
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,501
I won't allow this.

278
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:37,180
Everything will be all right.

279
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:45,621
Blessed tidings.
The church is saved!

280
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,262
Send the pipe around.

281
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:50,981
That's going to take weeks
and cost millions.

282
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:55,023
- Your father approved this route.
- Then my father was wrong. Do it.

283
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:58,702
- Davidov...
- I'll talk to her.

284
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:03,464
I saw you at my father's funeral.

285
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:06,343
Yes. I'm sorry.

286
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,944
M told me she was sending someone.
Mr.?

287
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:14,104
Bond. James Bond.

288
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:15,984
Did you know my father?

289
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:19,023
I met him once, briefly.

290
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:22,225
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

291
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:26,104
- Saving the church?
- And avoiding the bloodshed.

292
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:29,985
100 years ago my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

293
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:32,506
When the Soviet Union was formed

294
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:37,386
the Communists spent the next 70 years
plundering our countryside for it.

295
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:40,305
I saw the mess they left on the drive in.

296
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:44,066
The new pipeline
will guarantee our future.

297
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:49,706
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.

298
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,387
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

299
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:57,667
No.

300
00:30:57,907 --> 00:31:00,388
Tell me,

301
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:01,467
have...

302
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:06,108
have you ever lost a loved one,
Mr. Bond?

303
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:11,828
M sent me because we're afraid
your life might be in danger.

304
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,108
Please, I want to show you something.

305
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:21,150
I'm trying to build an 800-mile pipeline
through Turkey,

306
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,349
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

307
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:28,790
Up here the Russians
have three competing pipelines

308
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,070
and they'll do anything to stop me.

309
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,351
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,

310
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:41,111
and you have come all this way
to tell me that I "might" be in danger?

311
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:47,351
We suspect there might be an insider.

312
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,751
- My father's pin.
- No. A duplicate.

313
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:54,912
With a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

314
00:31:55,152 --> 00:31:58,351
My family has relied on MI6 twice,
Mr. Bond.

315
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:02,472
I won't make that mistake a third time.

316
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:08,313
I'm going to finish building this pipeline
and I don't need your help.

317
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:11,714
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

318
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:14,593
I've always wanted to check
the survey lines.

319
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,914
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

320
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:19,753
No.

321
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:24,274
I hope you know how to ski, then.

322
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:28,514
I came prepared for a cold reception.

323
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:44,435
Can't land!

324
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:49,315
- Wind's too strong.
- Hold her steady.

325
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,041
- You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
- Seems you enjoy being chased.

326
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,242
Probably happens all the time.

327
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,281
Less often than you might think.

328
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:05,042
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline?

329
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:07,121
Your father's legacy.

330
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:12,043
My family's legacy... to the world.

331
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:24,243
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

332
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,084
This isn't a social call.

333
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:35,163
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees. Go!

334
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,844
Go!

335
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,693
See you back at the lodge.

336
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,139
- Oh, my God, we're buried alive!
- It's all right! It's all right!

337
00:37:56,379 --> 00:38:00,341
- I can't stay here!
- You're not going to.

338
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:03,380
Elektra...

339
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,821
- I can't breathe!
- Elektra!

340
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,980
- I can't breathe!
- Elektra, look at me! Look at my eyes.

341
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,460
Look at my eyes.

342
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,902
Look at my eyes! You're all right.

343
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,341
Everything's all right. Trust me.

344
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:22,062
OK. Trust me.

345
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:45,063
BAKU

346
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:50,625
She's fine. Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine. She wants to see you.

347
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:54,064
Not you, Davidov. Him.

348
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,745
Are you all right?

349
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,666
I need to ask you something.

350
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:14,505
And I want you to tell me the truth.
Who is it?

351
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,586
Who is trying to kill me?

352
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:18,987
I told you, I don't know.

353
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:21,146
But I'm gonna find him.

354
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:24,827
Not good enough.

355
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:27,866
After the kidnapping I was afraid.

356
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:32,828
I was afraid to go outside,
afraid to be alone, afraid to be in a crowd.

357
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:35,267
I was afraid to do anything at all.

358
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,148
Until I realized...
I can't hide in the shadows.

359
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:42,507
I can't let fear run my life.

360
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,588
I won't.

361
00:39:44,828 --> 00:39:47,509
After I find him,

362
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:51,148
you won't have to.

363
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,189
Don't go.

364
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:56,668
Stay with me.

365
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:00,110
Please.

366
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,629
I can't do that.

367
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,430
I thought it was your job to protect me.

368
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:10,509
You'll be safe here.

369
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:14,351
I don't want to be safe.

370
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:22,432
I'll be back soon.

371
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:26,271
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

372
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:44,033
Bets, please!

373
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:36,996
I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.

374
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,157
Impossible.

375
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,078
Vodka martini.

376
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,157
Shaken, not stirred.

377
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:47,838
Tell him James Bond is here.

378
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,037
Now.

379
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,478
I don't think you heard me.

380
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:10,358
Mr. Zukovsky will be delighted to see you.

381
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,600
After you.

382
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,161
No, after you.

383
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:20,840
I insist.

384
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,761
Bond! James Bond!

385
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,681
Meet Nina

386
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:33,160
and Verushka.

387
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,962
Lose the girls, Valentin. We need to talk.

388
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:41,241
Why am I suddenly worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

389
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:44,282
Chill out, James.

390
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,322
Fine, ladies. Go on, beat it. Scram.

391
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:53,001
Bull, give them an inch.

392
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:03,243
And make sure they lose it
in "this" casino?

393
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,404
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

394
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:08,403
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

395
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:10,684
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.

396
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,005
So, what would you like to talk about?

397
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:18,805
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

398
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,844
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

399
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:26,325
Take a look at this.

400
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:30,765
Russian Special Services.

401
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:33,246
Atomic Energy Anti-Terrorist Unit.

402
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,525
- Where did you find this?
- I took it off a parahawk

403
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:39,206
which tried to kill Elektra King.

404
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:42,885
Renard is behind this.

405
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:50,766
I think you and I had better have a drink.

406
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:57,046
And then after Afghanistan
the KGB decided

407
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:00,168
Renard was a liability,
and just cut him loose.

408
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,288
Now he works freelance.

409
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:04,447
But for whom?

410
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,808
There are four competing pipelines.

411
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:09,729
I'll bet half the customers in this casino

412
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:14,129
would be very happy
to see the King pipeline disappear.

413
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:16,729
- What's funny?
- Oh, nothing.

414
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,049
It just appears Miss King
does not share your concern.

415
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:26,729
I wanna get my money back!
Why can't I get my money?

416
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,410
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are.

417
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,049
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.

418
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:35,290
Let me take you home. Now.

419
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,251
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

420
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,930
Miss King, how very nice to see you.

421
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,411
We have kept your father's chair free.

422
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:46,610
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

423
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,011
Your father had a credit line with us -
one million US.

424
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:54,091
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

425
00:44:56,812 --> 00:44:59,373
So, what's it to be?

426
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,692
Vingt-et-un?
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

427
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:05,613
Let's keep it simple.

428
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:10,253
One card, high draw,

429
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,574
$1m.

430
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:18,293
Wait.

431
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:22,573
Bury the top three cards.

432
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,014
You're determined to protect me.

433
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:29,854
Perhaps from yourself.
You don't have to do this.

434
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:34,895
There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.

435
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:47,536
Queen of hearts.

436
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:01,297
It appears that you have been beaten.

437
00:46:01,537 --> 00:46:05,056
By the ace of clubs.

438
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:12,457
No hard feelings. Come again soon.

439
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:17,539
Shall we?

440
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:20,338
Elektra,

441
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:25,219
this is a game I can't afford to play.

442
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,379
I know.

443
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:34,139
- What happened to Davidov?
- I gave him the night off.

444
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,381
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

445
00:46:56,621 --> 00:47:01,821
For thousands of years Hindu pilgrims
have journeyed to this holy place

446
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:07,463
to witness the wonder of the miracle
of the natural flames that never die.

447
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,022
And to test their devotion...

448
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:12,903
to God,

449
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:17,702
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands

450
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,784
as they said their daily prayers.

451
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:25,583
Tell me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

452
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:29,625
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

453
00:47:29,865 --> 00:47:31,903
Yes, but Bond...

454
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:35,585
Bond was unarmed.

455
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:38,704
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

456
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:41,705
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car.

457
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,346
And I have arranged
for a plane tonight, but...

458
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:45,944
But what?

459
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:48,785
We should scrub the rest of the mission.

460
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:51,905
The parahawks
were meant to be returned.

461
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:56,586
People will start asking questions,
even of me. Because of "his" incompetence!

462
00:47:56,826 --> 00:48:00,145
I see. I see you're right.
You're right. He should be punished.

463
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:03,827
Davidov, hold this for me.

464
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:10,547
It was wrong of me
to expect so much of you.

465
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,906
Kill him.

466
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:17,948
He failed his test of devotion.

467
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:24,988
You can take his place, take his ID.

468
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:29,268
And do be on time.

469
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,311
Ah, poor shoulder!

470
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:51,990
It looks painful.

471
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:56,950
It needs constant attention.

472
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,511
I knew.

473
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:03,590
I knew when I first saw you.

474
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:07,672
I knew it would be like this.

475
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:21,353
Enough ice for one day.

476
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:42,434
How did you survive?

477
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:51,675
I seduced the guards. Used my body.

478
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:55,355
It gave me control.

479
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:59,714
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

480
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:06,676
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

481
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:12,917
I take pleasure...

482
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:16,636
in great beauty.

483
00:52:47,088 --> 00:52:50,527
Let's go. It's getting late.

484
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:56,370
What happened to Davidov?

485
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:01,810
- I was told to expect him.
- He was buried with work.

486
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,729
Let's go. Get your stuff.

487
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,730
OK, come on. Let's get out of here.

488
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,411
You're late.

489
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:23,451
Did you bring it?

490
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:27,051
The grease?

491
00:53:27,731 --> 00:53:31,172
Of course.

492
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:39,133
Excellent.

493
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:56,173
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

494
00:53:56,413 --> 00:54:00,254
And make sure you wear the ID.

495
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:19,415
KAZAKHSTAN
CENTRAL ASIA

496
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:46,497
I'm gonna go get some air.

497
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:05,738
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

498
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:08,819
It's not often we see someone
of your stature here.

499
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,940
I go where the work takes me.

500
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,659
Oh, by the way,
you have the transport documents?

501
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,141
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.

502
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:30,061
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- OK.

503
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:31,301
Look,

504
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:33,422
our IDA physicist.

505
00:55:33,662 --> 00:55:35,701
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

506
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:37,261
Take my word for it.

507
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:42,981
This year we decommissioned
four test sites. Not even a glimmer.

508
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:49,902
Are you here for a reason?
Or are "you" just hoping for a glimmer?

509
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,422
And you are?

510
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:55,302
Mikhail Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

511
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:56,662
Miss?

512
00:55:56,902 --> 00:55:58,103
Doctor...

513
00:55:58,343 --> 00:56:00,183
Jones. Christmas Jones.

514
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:03,022
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard 'em all.

515
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:06,704
I don't know any doctor jokes.

516
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,703
This is OK.
Take the elevator down the hole.

517
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:14,064
- Your friend's already down there.
- Don't I get some kind of protection?

518
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,824
No, Dr. Arkov. Down there it's all
weapons-grade plutonium.

519
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:19,264
Reasonably safe.

520
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:22,305
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
your lab built leaking tritium,

521
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,424
which I've spent six months
trying to clean up.

522
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:29,586
So if you need protection, it's from me.

523
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:33,065
Your friends are waiting for you.

524
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:40,346
Doctor!

525
00:56:41,306 --> 00:56:44,787
Aren't you forgetting?

526
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:48,067
Yes, of course. Thank you.

527
00:56:48,307 --> 00:56:49,507
By the way...

528
00:56:49,747 --> 00:56:54,747
<i>Your English is very good for a Russian.</i>

529
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:58,828
<i>I studied at Oxford.</i>

530
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:58,472
Leave it! Leave it!

531
00:57:59,152 --> 00:58:03,632
Come on. Let's go.

532
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,793
Expecting Davidov?

533
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,954
He caught a bullet... instead of the plane.

534
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:11,152
Get off!

535
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:13,233
Keep your mouth shut!

536
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:15,554
You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

537
00:58:15,794 --> 00:58:17,114
Yeah...

538
00:58:17,355 --> 00:58:21,034
- Not dead enough for me.
- You could show a little gratitude.
