[WHIMPERS]

186
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,678
NO ONE JACKS OUT

187
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,720
TILL WE FIND
WHO'S DOING THIS.

188
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,403
JOBE?

189
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,335
YOU'RE ALIVE.

190
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,247
HOW CAN THAT BE?

191
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,255
THERE ISN'T TIME,
PETER.

192
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,756
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I'M DYING.

193
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,627
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DYING?

194
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,085
THE CYBERSCAPE
IS DYING,

195
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,093
AND SO AM I,
RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.

196
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,426
I'M TRAPPED HERE,
PETER.

197
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,250
YOU'VE GOT TO
HELP ME.

198
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,515
I--I DON'T GET IT.

199
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,295
I NEED YOU TO FIND
SOMEONE FOR ME.

200
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,091
BENJAMIN TRACE.

201
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,211
WHAT?

202
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,539
DR. BENJAMIN TRACE.

203
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,354
HE'S IN SECLUSION
SOMEWHERE.

204
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,716
YOU'VE GOT TO
BRING HIM, PETER.

205
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,935
WHEN THE CYBERSCAPE
DIES, SO DO I.

206
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,024
WHAT IF HE WON'T
JACK IN?

207
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,809
TELL HIM I'M BUILDING
HIS CHYRON CHIP,

208
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,475
AND I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE EGYPT LINK

209
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,443
TO COMPLETE IT.

210
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,113
NO!

211
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,281

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,620
PETER!
PETER!

213
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,790
I DON'T THINK
HE'S BREATHING.

214
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,125
WHAT DO WE DO?

215
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,120
UM, LET'S TRY CPR.

226
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,147
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.
GET UP. YOU OK?

227
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,342
IF YOU KNEW
YOU WERE IN DANGER,

228
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,155
YOU SHOULD HAVE
JACKED OUT, YOU JERK!

229
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,018
THAT WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE
EXAMPLE OF TELEPRESENCE

230
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,028
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

231
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,111

CLEAR THE FLOOR.

235
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,549

I WANT TO TALK TO HALLOWAY

I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER
NONSENSE AROUND THAT.

00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,391
WELL,
SENATOR GREENSPAN.

240
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,816
HOW WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

THANK YOU.

244
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,375
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE YOU

245
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,376

AND DEVELOPMENT,

PLEASE COME WITH ME,

251
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,828
SENATOR...

252
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,830
VIRTUAL LIGHT.

253
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:56,342
UNTIL NOW, NO ONE
HAS HAD THE ABILITY

254
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,346
TO CREATE
AN ENTIRE COMPUTER NETWORK

255
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,839
BASED WITHIN
VIRTUAL REALITY.

256
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,731
OF COURSE,
WHEN I COMPLETE

257
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,236
MY VIRTUAL LIGHT UPLINK,

258
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,058
I'LL RENDER ALL OTHER
SYSTEMS OBSOLETE.

259
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,935
VIRTUAL REALITY
HAS EVOLVED

260
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,443
FROM A SIMULATION
TO AN ACTUAL PLACE.

261
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,446
WATCH YOUR HEAD. THOSE
MONITORS WILL KILL YOU.

262
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,948
SO, IT'S LIKE A WHOLE
NEW WORLD OUT THERE.

263
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,440

POSSIBILITIES.

264
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,442

265
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,083
I LOVE A MAN
THAT DOES HIS HOMEWORK.

DON'T YOU, DOCTOR?

267
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,079
BUT, SENATOR,
WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK

268
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,081
IS FINAL CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL OF OUR LICENSE.

269
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,874
AH. AND THIS...

270
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,589
AH, YES. THIS MUST BE
THE FAMOUS CHYRON CHIP

271
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,418
THAT EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT.

272

00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,554
Platt: SINCE
THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

275
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,050
HAS LEFT PEOPLE
FEELING ISOLATED

276
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:47,552
FROM THEIR FELLOW MAN,

277
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,193
THE VIRTUAL LIGHT
INSTITUTE

278
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,698
WILL BRING CULTURES
AND RESOURCES TOGETHER

279
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,190
IN ONE CONTINUOUS
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.

280
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,704

00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,207

HERE AT VIRTUAL LIGHT.

I'M STILL
A LITTLE UNCLEAR

283
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,213
AS TO HOW ALL THIS
FITS TOGETHER.

284
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,215
WELL, I'M SURE DR. PLATT
WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU.

285
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,718
JENNIFER, PLEASE.

286
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:17,477
THE OUTER CIRCLE
REPRESENTS THE REAL WORLD.

287
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,306
THE INNER ONE,
VIRTUAL REALITY.

288
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,001
THE SPOKES ARE THE DIFFERENT
PATHWAYS BETWEEN THE TWO.

289
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,844
THE CHYRON CHIP WILL OPEN UP
THESE PATHWAYS SIMULTANEOUSLY,

290
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,651
SO A NETWORK BASED INSIDE VR
CAN BE ACCESSED BY EVERYONE.

292
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,607

WHEN YOU HOOK
INTO THE LIBRARY

OF MY VIRTUAL CITY,

297
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,665
YOU'LL HOOK INTO EVERY LIBRARY

298
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,667
IN THE WORLD.

299
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,078
AND ULTIMATELY,

300
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,456
THE CHIP WILL BRING EVERYTHING
ONLINE FOR EVERYONE.

301
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,415
WELL, YES, IT'S VERY
PRETTY, JONATHON,

302
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,924
BUT I THINK
WE'D BE PLACING

303
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,346
QUITE A CONCENTRATION
OF POWER IN YOUR LAP.

304
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,677

IS YOUR LAP, SENATOR.

307
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,109
HOW DID IT GO?

308
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,110
WALKER MAKES ME FEEL

309
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,111
LIKE THE STAR POODLE
IN HIS DOG SHOW.

310
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,624
AT LEAST YOU GET
TOP BILLING.

311
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,126
NO. WALKER ALWAYS
GETS TOP BILLING.

312
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,627
OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T
MENTION THE FACT

313
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,619
THAT IT'S YOU

314
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,490

THE CHYRON CHIP

315
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,667
AND DESIGNING
THE VIRTUAL CITY.

316
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:31,966
I DON'T MIND.

317
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,387
I CARE HOW OTHER
PEOPLE SEE YOU,

318
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,886
HOW THEY
PERCEIVE YOU.

319
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,888
THAT'S YOUR WORLD,
DR. PLATT, NOT MINE.

320
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,722
MY WORLD IS IN HERE.

321
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,177
OUT THERE,
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME

322
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,420
AND THEY SEE
HALF A PERSON.

323
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:51,312
BUT IN HERE, THEY SEE
WHAT I WANT THEM TO SEE...

324
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,606
HOW I REALLY AM.

325
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,900
HERE.

326
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,746
I DON'T SEE
HALF A PERSON, JOBE.

327
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,239
THAT'S YOUR WORLD.

328
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,241
GOOD NIGHT, JOBE.

329
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,665
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

330
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,168
YOU SURE DON'T LOOK LIKE

331
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,459
THE FATHER
OF VIRTUAL REALITY TO ME.

332
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,331
WHAT?

333
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,250
YOU'RE DR. BENJAMIN TRACE,
RIGHT?

334
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,969
HE'S DEAD.

335
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,257
DEAD?

336
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:09,252
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAID
ON THE INTERNET.

337
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,515
ON THE INTERNET, THEY SAID
HE WAS, LIKE, LIVING HERE.

338
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,347
THE BENJAMIN TRACE
YOU WANT IS...

339
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,143
RESTING IN PEACE.

340
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,065
SO I SUGGEST
YOU GET ON

341
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,074
THAT COOL BIKE
OF YOURS AND...

342
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,077
GO ON HOME.

343
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,861
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT JOBE WAS THINKING.

344
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,366
HE'S JUST CRAZY.

345
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,659
TRIPPY FOOL INVENTED
SOME KIND OF CHYRON CHIP.

346
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,912
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

347
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,253
CHYRON CHIP.

348
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,169
COME INSIDE.

349
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,283
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME, KID?

350
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,786
PETER...DOC.

351
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,281
CALL ME TRACE.

352
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,783
TRACE.

353
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,295
WELL, PETER,
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL HERE,

354
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,797
ALL THE ANSWERS--

355
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,709
IN THE EARTH,
IN THE WATER,

356
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,709
AND IN THE AIR.

357
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,211
YEAH.

358
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,554
THE REASON I CAME
IS BECAUSE

359
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,419
MY FRIEND JOBE IS DYING,
AND HE SAID THAT

360
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,758
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
