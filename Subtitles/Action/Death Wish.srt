00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,040
Somebody
ought to come.

182
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,280
There's a man over there.
He's bleeding,

183
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,240
and nobody comes.

184
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,640
Nurse, we're
waiting to find out

185
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,640
what happened
to my wife and daughter.

186
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
A doctor will see you
after he's made his examination.

187
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
But we've been
waiting a long time.

188
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
It hasn't been
that long, Dad.

189
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,360
Just 2 or 3 minutes.

190
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,800
Mr. Toby?

191
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,760
Yes.

192
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,120
Your wife is all right.

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
We've sedated her
and put her to bed.

194
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
My name is Paul Kersey.
How's my wife?

195
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,720
She died a few minutes
ago, Mr. Kersey.

197
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Man: Almighty God,

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,120
we commend to You
our neighbor Joanna,

199
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
trusting Your love
and mercy

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,320
and believing in the promise
of a resurrection to eternal life

201
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,440
through our Lord
Jesus Christ. Amen.

202
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Almighty God, father of the whole
family in heaven and on earth,

203
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
stand by those who sorrow,

204
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,680
that as they lean
on Your strength

205
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,280
they may be upheld

206
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,880
and believe the good news
of life beyond life

207
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,720
through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

208
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm going back
with Sam and Adele.

209
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,120
They go right
by my place.

210
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,360
Don't you want to come
to our apartment?

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,400
It's time
I went to my own.

212
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,840
I have to sometime.

213
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Baby?

214
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,720
Baby?

215
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm going back
with Sam.

216
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
You get plenty
of rest.

217
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,720
She'll be all right, Dad.

Radio: Residents
of northern suburbs

220
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
will need quite some time to dig
themselves out of a snowstorm

221
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,160
that's taking
much of Connecticut

222
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,280
and Rockland and Westchester
counties by surprise.

223
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,640
In New York City,

light snow flurries
lingering till about midnight.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
No accumulation,
but afternoon...

226
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
Turn that thing off.

227
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm listening to
the weather report.

228
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
Why haven't
you found my dog?

229
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,920
He's vital to my income.

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
He paints such marvelous
pictures with his paws.

231
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
Man: Yes. Help you?

232
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Kersey: Can you tell me where I
can find Officer Joe Charles?

233
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,080
What's your business?

234
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,560
My name
is Paul Kersey.

235
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,040
A couple days ago, my wife
and daughter were attacked,

236
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,440
and he was one of the policemen
on the scene.

237
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,040
I want
to talk to him.

238
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,280
Hattie,

239
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,840
is Joe Charles
still back there

240
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
or has he gone
on duty yet?

241
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Yeah. There's someone out here
that wants to talk to him.

242
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,400
Have a seat.
He'll be right out.

243
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Woman: I told you
that somebody snatched my purse.

244
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,240
The man came up
from behind me.

245
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,840
My credit cards is in there,
my rent money.

246
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
I don't have no key.

247
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,040
Do I have
a description?

248
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,760
The man came
from behind me!

249
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,560
Man: You didn't
see who it was?

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,320
Hello,
Mr. Kersey.

251
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,480
Officer Charles.

252
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,400
I dropped by to see
if you had any information

253
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,200
on the people who
attacked my family.

254
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
I'll take you to the detective
in charge of the case.

255
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,920
Lieutenant?

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,320
This is Mr. Paul Kersey,
case number 884.

257
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,360
His wife and daughter
were assaulted.

258
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,680
Glad to know you,
Mr. Kersey.

259
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm going on duty now, Mr. Kersey,
so I'll leave you.

260
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,160
Right this way,
Mr. Kersey.

261
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,880
Will you have
a seat, Mr. Kersey?

262
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Have you found out
anything yet?

263
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,680
Well, the supermarket
security officer

264
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,360
and one of the checkers remembers
these 3 characters leaving

265
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,160
right after Mrs. Kersey
and your daughter.

266
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,680
They think they could have gotten
the apartment number

267
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,480
off the address
on the grocery bags,

268
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,240
but they haven't been able to
pick the faces out of the mug book.

269
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,280
How is your daughter,
Mr. Kersey?

270
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,880
She's under
doctor's sedation right now.

271
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,880
But today
I had the funeral

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,720
for my wife
up in Connecticut,

273
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
and she was able
to make that.

274
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,760
Your daughter didn't give us
much information, Mr. Kersey.

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,200
We wish we could persuade her
to take a look at the mug books.

276
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Did she refuse?

277
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,120
Her husband asked us
to wait for a few days.

278
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,760
In fact, the sooner she looks
at the mug books,

279
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,840
the better chance she has
of recalling one or 2 of the faces.

280
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,240
Well, I'll talk
to my son-in-law

281
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,480
and see what
can be done.

282
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,320
I'd appreciate that,
Mr. Kersey.

283
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Is there any chance
of catching these men?

284
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,600
There's a chance.
Sure.

285
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,960
Just a chance?

286
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,680
I'd be less than honest if I gave you
more hope, Mr. Kersey.

287
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,320
In the city,
that's the way it is.

288
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
I thought
you were asleep.

you really are.

I told Ives
you'd come in this morning.

the kind of man

life lying around.

Carol to see another doctor.

any association with anyone

remind her of that day?

how it is, Dad.

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
But you call me
every other day.

356
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Let me know
how Carol is.

357
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Sure I will, Dad.

358
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,320
You know, that will
be good for you.

359
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,320
I hear Tucson's
a really beautiful place.

360
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,120
Yeah, yeah.
That's what everybody says.

361
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,840
How are you
today, sir?

362
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Son of a bitch.

363
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Turn around,
son of a bitch.

364
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
Motherfucker!

365
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,520
I said
turn around.

366
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,360
Now hand me
the money.

367
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
Aah!

368
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
Paul Kersey.

369
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah.

370
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
Aimes Jainchill.

371
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
How do you do,
Mr. Jainchill?

372
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
Aimes.
I'll call you Paul.

373
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
Come on.
Let's get your bags.

374
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,920
How did you know
who I was?

375
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,360
Well, you look like
a New Yorker.

376
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,400
[Cattle Mooing]

377
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,760
Ho!

378
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
Howdy, Jud.

379
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I wanted you
to see this country

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,560
before you looked at the
drawings back at the office.

381
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,280
Give you
a better idea.

382
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't want to
change these hills.

383
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Don't want to
bulldoze them flat.

384
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,680
You'll waste a lot
of building space.

385
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
Ha ha!

386
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,040
Wasting space.

387
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,640
Now, those are some words
that you big developers

388
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,960
have got to change
for something else.

389
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,720
Such as?

390
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Well,
space for life.

391
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,080
Like old Jud
up there.

392
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Space for people,
horses, cows.

393
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,520
I got funny ideas
about building things.

394
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
Man: Howdy, folks.

395
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
Welcome to Old Tucson,

396
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
the famous movie location
and studio.

397
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,640
In just a few moments...

398
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Come on.
Let's wet our whistle

399
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,640
before I trot you
back to the motel.

400
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Glass of beer,
maybe.

401
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,880
Announcer: ...take their positions
on the porches and boardwalks

402
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,680
of the Red Dog Cafe,
the territorial gunsmith shop...

403
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
What's happening here?

404
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Oh, it's a phony
western town.

405
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
They shoot movies
here sometimes,

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,360
but the rest of the time
it's for the tourists.

407
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,520
Announcer: this is where the
actual performance will take place.

408
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,920
These fellas
are pretty good.

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
You want
to watch this?

410
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Announcer:
the Wild West lives again.

411
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
Man: Where's the Marshal?

412
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,760
Second Man:
He's in the bank.

413
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
I spotted him through
the window as I came by.

414
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,880
What have you
got in mind to do, then?

415
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Well, why don't you
steal my horse?

416
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,800
All right.
That's a good trick. We'll use it.

417
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
You spot yourself
on the porch

418
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,320
while I draw the marshal
out into the open.

419
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,040
Marshal!
Hey, Marshal!

420
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Marshal:
What's the matter, fella?

421
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,600
Somebody
stole my horse.

422
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,600
Marshal: I told you
to get out of town by sunset.

423
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,360
Man: You missing a bay mare
that was tied to the hitching rail?

424
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,160
Saw a feller come and
take her just a spell ago.

425
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Marshal: well,
what did he look like?

426
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,120
Well, he was
about this tall, and he had this...

427
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Get him, Frank!

428
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,600
Let's put him
inside here

429
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,320
and get to the bank
and make that withdrawal.

430
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,800
Marshal: All right,
boys. The fun's over.

431
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,120
Throw out your guns,
and step out with your hands up.

432
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,400
You'd better listen,
Marshal.

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,920
I've got 3 sticks
of dynamite here.

434
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Don't be a fool.

435
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Announcer: The outlaw life
seemed a shortcut to easy money,

436
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,440
which could buy
liquor, women,

437
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
and a turn
at the gambling table,

438
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,240
but there were
honest men with dreams

439
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,280
who would fight
to protect their...

440
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Let's get that beer.

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,120
Announcer: ...and who were to plant
the roots that would grow into a nation.

442
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Blue Ridge won't buy it.

443
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't build a thing that's going
to be a slum in 20 years,

444
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,200
and I won't
doze those hills.

445
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,520
What I build
conforms to the land.

446
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,440
And you can't hear
the toilets flush next door.

447
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,200
You want our help,

448
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,080
you'll have to
let me work with it.

449
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,560
Well, up to a point,
I want your help.

450
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Up to a point,
I'll give it to you.

451
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,320
When do I get
a look-see?

452
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
In a couple days.

453
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,880
Guard says you were here
till after midnight last night.

454
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,640
Yeah. That's
the way I work.

455
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,160
Somebody once said... I forget who...
that he never looked back

456
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,320
because something might
be gaining on him.

457
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
What's gaining
on you, Paul?

458
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,240
$20 million investment.
What else?

459
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, I was
going to ask you

460
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,400
to have dinner
with me at the club,

461
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,720
but I don't think
you'd be very good company.

462
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
No, I don't think
I would.

463
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,520
It might amuse you,
though.

464
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,840
Being from New York,
maybe you never seen a club like this.

465
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,560
It's a gun club.
We shoot guns.

466
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
So goddamn much hoopla
from the gun control people.

467
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,680
Half the nation's scared
to even <i>hold</i> a gun!

468
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
You know,
like it was a snake,

469
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,000
it was going to bite
you or something.

470
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Hell, a gun
is just a tool...

471
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
Like a hammer
or an ax.

472
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,440
Wasn't long ago,
used to put food on the table,

473
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,440
keep foxes out
of the chicken coop,

474
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
rustlers off the range,

475
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
bandits out of the bank.

476
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Paul, how long since you held
a pistol in your hand?

477
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,760
A long time.

478
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
Which war was yours...
Korea?

479
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,720
Yeah.

480
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,160
See much action?

481
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,440
A little.

482
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
In the infantry?

483
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,200
I was a C.O.
in a medical unit.

484
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, commanding
officer, huh?

485
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,880
Conscientious objector.

486
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Oh, Christ.

487
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,160
What a guest to bring
to a gun club!

488
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,720
You're probably one
of them knee-jerk liberals

489
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,920
thinks us gun boys
shoot our guns

490
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,200
because it's an extension
of our penises.

491
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
I never thought
about it that way,

492
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,840
but it could be true.

493
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,120
Well, maybe it is,

494
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
but this is gun country.

495
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,760
Can't even own a handgun
in New York City.

496
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,320
Out here, I hardly know a man
that <i>doesn't</i> own one,

497
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,760
and I'll tell you
something...

498
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,160
Unlike your city,
we can walk our streets

499
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,560
and through our parks at night
and feel safe.

500
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
Muggers operating
out here,

501
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,840
they just plain get
their asses blown off.

502
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,760
Here. Slip these on.

503
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,120
All righty. This is
a percussion pistol.

504
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,680
1842.

505
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,280
You ever handled
one of those before?

506
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
You know
how to fire it?

507
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,440
Watch the kick.

508
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,000
Boy, you're
going to think

509
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,880
that your arm's
going to hit the ceiling.

510
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,960
Goddamn!

511
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,560
Paul, you hit
dead center!

512
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,800
Mind if I try
this hogleg Colt?

513
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,240
No.

514
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,600
Well, you a peculiar
conscientious objector.

515
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,520
These notches
for real?

516
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah. Belonged to a gunfighter
named Candy Dan, 1890.

517
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,320
Hmm.

518
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,720
I do know something
about guns, Aimes.

519
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,080
I grew up with them...
all kinds of guns.

520
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,480
You see, my father
was a hunter.

521
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,360
I guess out here
you'd call him a gunman.

522
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,320
My mother was
the other side of the coin.

523
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,080
When my father was killed
in a hunting accident...

524
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,960
some fool mistook him
for a deer, you see...

525
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,840
my mother
won the toss.

526
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,600
I never touched
a gun since.

527
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,040
I loved my father.

that pistol pretty good.

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,480
against 2 muggers
with an unusual weapon.

883
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,360
Mrs. Brown,
would you tell us

884
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,680
how you drove off
your attackers today?

885
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,480
Mrs. Brown:
With a hatpin.

886
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,040
You ever seen a hatpin?

887
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,280
Reporter: I can't
say that I have.

888
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,520
Well, that's what
we used to use

889
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,920
to hold our hats
on with,

890
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,200
and I ain't got no gun
like this vigilante fellow,

891
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,360
but I went to my closet,

892
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,640
and everybody better look out
for me from now on,

893
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:50,520
'cause I been robbed too many times,
and I've got enough!

894
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,120
Second reporter: Some of the men
building this skyscraper here

895
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,320
made what you might call
a citizens' arrest today.

896
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,160
I'll ask Andrew McCabe,
one of the foremen, to tell you about it.

897
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,040
Me and my crew
was working down in the hole.

898
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,600
One of the boys
up on the steel yelled down,

899
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,200
"There's a mugging
going on!"

900
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,760
So we come out of the hole
and through the gate,

901
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,360
and we caught
this guy running.

902
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,240
We roughed him up a little bit
before the police came.

903
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,960
Reporter: The hospital report
says the man had 2 broken arms,

904
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,680
a broken jaw,
and cracked ribs.

905
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,320

Woman: Walking distances
from D'Agostino's:

908
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,840
2 blocks crosstown,
6 short blocks uptown and downtown.

909
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,680
I mean, that's how far
I'd be willing to walk to a market.

910
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,400
Good. Very good,
Miss Gemetti.

911
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,960
Gemetti: We have 12 families
living within this area

912
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,840
who have suffered a death
in the family in the past 3 months

913
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,720
from mugging, stabbing,
shooting, assault.

914
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,280
2 of these families
have no male members.

915
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,160
One family has only
an 80-year-old grandfather.

916
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,400
That leaves 9 families.

917
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,960
Total number of male persons
in these families

918
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,600

in the Vietnam war, Korea, or World War II

919

920
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,000
Wild.
It's a real wild shot,

921
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,200
but the fact is
that the vigilante

922
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,560
plugged his first victim
in Riverside Park,

923
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,880
exactly 2 1/2 blocks
from that D'Agostino Market.

924
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,280
Even if all these guys
<i>are</i> clean,

925
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,280
we still can't ignore
that coincidence.

926
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,920
No, sir. Our friend lives
in that neighborhood.

927
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,160
But, Frank,
he was on a subway

928
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,760
with groceries
5 miles uptown.

929
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,320
There's no better come-on
for a mugging

930
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,880
than a guy
with a bagful of groceries.

931
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,440
Means he's got some money
in his pocket

932
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,040
and his hands
are occupied.

933
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,960
He might have been carrying
those groceries for hours.

934
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,080
I want a preliminary line
on these names:

935
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,800

service record,

936

effect on the total crime picture

940
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,240
as putting a band-aid
on a leper.

941
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,840
Sam: I don't know
about that.

942
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,400
A mugger's going to think twice
about who he hits.

943

Man: Sure.
They're hitting more old ladies.

the guy's a racist.

946
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,600
You notice he kills
more blacks than whites.

947
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,520
More blacks are
muggers than whites.

948
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,120
What do you
want us to do...

949
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,880
increase the proportion
of white muggers

950
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,960
so we'll have racial equality
among muggers?

951
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,200
Racial equality among muggers?
I love it!

Interesting detail:
the attackers, 3 of them,

to the apartment

as delivery boys
