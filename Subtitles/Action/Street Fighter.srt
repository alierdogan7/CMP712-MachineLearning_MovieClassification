00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:44,932
Good evening. This is Sander Vanocur,
and this is the GNT World News.

2
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,972
After seven months of fighting,
the civil war in Shadaloo...

3
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:51,809
may have reached
the turning point.

4
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,475
The capital has just fallen.

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,213
[Speaking Native Languages]

6
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:12,693
This is Chun-Li Zang
with GNT News.

7
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:17,399
A.N. forces are consolidating their hold
on Shadaloo City today...

8
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:22,570
after a night of skirmishing that
secured this key Southeast Asian port.

9
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,637
But these soldiers
aren't celebrating just yet.

10
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:30,243
They know that defeating
the ragtag city militia is one thing.

11
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,848
Defeating the heavily-armed forces
of General M. Bison is quite another.

12
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,754
The Allied Nations forces know...

13
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,287
that they are dealing
with a power-mad dictator.

14
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:47,132
A dictator whose drug money
has equipped his army...

15
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,000
with high-tech weaponry,

16
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:52,063
which some intelligence experts fear...

17
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,668
is equal to anything
in the industrialized world.

18
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,912
It's been only 24 hours...

19
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:05,284
since this dangerous
and unpredictable warlord...

20
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:08,323
seized 63 Allied Nations
relief workers...

21
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,450
from a village north of here.

22
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:14,360
This self-styled general's
ransom demands:

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,127
An astonishing $20 billion!

24
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:21,967
Meanwhile, the location
of the 63 hostages...

25
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:24,063
remains unknown.

26
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,166
Of the 15 Allied Nations troops...

27
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:30,076
assigned to guard
the missing relief workers,

28
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:33,479
twelve are confirmed dead
and three are missing.

29
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,449

00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,917
Also unknown.

31
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:41,887

I think I see the A.N. commander
arriving now.

00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,404
I'm going to try to talk to him.

Col. Guile, Chun-Li Zang, GNT News.
May we speak to you, please?

41
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,390
No.

00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,429
Don't you want to speak
to the world audience?

No, but I do want to talk to someone.

He took the bait.

56
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:08,468
Why do you address a fellow warrior
with such disrespect?

57
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,377
Warrior? You?

58
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:15,213
How many doctors and nurses
have you killed this week?

have you orphaned?

You think you're so clever, Guile.

Think about this.
You have three days.

If my $20 billion
are not delivered by then,

will hold you responsible!

00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,631
Hey, stop. Stop!

349
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:09,403
[T. Hawk]
You don't have a chance.

350
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:12,002
What a screwup!

351
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:17,408
What a woman!

352
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:21,284
Cruise missile. All original equipment.
You add your own warhead.

353
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:24,188
Armored personnel carrier.
Surplus from Iraqi Army.

354
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,659
Five speeds.
Two forward, three reverse.

355
00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:30,959
1972 turbo French chopper.
Like new.

356
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:33,932
Only used once to evacuate
American Embassy in Saigon.

357
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:37,869
[Computer]
Welcome, warlords of Shadaloo.

358
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:42,568
Gen. Bison invites you to share
his food, drink and entertainment.

359
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,839
No, no, no, no.

360
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,674
[Crowd]
Yes! Yes!

361
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,237
- Yes!
- No!

362
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,093
She likes me.

363
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:50,110
- How 'bout our explosive finale?
- Not yet. We have a problem.

364
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:05,782
Now...

365
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,884
to business.

366
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,953
[Chuckles]

367
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,628
This place makes Detroit
look like Disneyland.

368
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:19,036
The only question is,

369
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:22,769
whose lowlifes are gonna kill us first,
Sagat's or Bison's?

370
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:34,313
[Ryu] I was right.
You've forgotten everything
our sensei talked about.

371
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,379
Trust. Honor.

372
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:38,254
Whatever you think,

373
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:41,556
we're in this until we get that
homing device up to Bison's fortress.

374
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,156
Ken?

375
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:09,681
[Giggling]

376
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,594
You got another one of those masks
for me, darling?

377
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:17,597
[Punch, Scream]

378
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,297
[Bison] I am pleased
with your goods, Sagat.

379
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,635
Now, as for payment,

380
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:29,471
why settle for mere money?

381
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:32,535
After I defeat the A.N.,

382
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:36,105
what if I were to share
the country with you?

383
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:45,721
When the war is over, we'll see
how much of the country is left.

384
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,191
Meanwhile,

385
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:52,858
let's see the color
of your money.

386
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,941
Enough!

387
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,543
[Sagat]
Is this a joke?

388
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:17,814
This money isn't worth the paper
it's printed on.

389
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,257
On the contrary!

390
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,922
Every Bison dollar
will be worth...

391
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,090
five British pounds.

392
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,498
That is the exchange rate...

393
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:31,936
the Bank of England will set
once I've kidnapped their Queen.

394
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,998
We know you're working
for Col. Guile.

395
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,341
You may not believe me,
but we're your friends.

396
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,048
I must've been insane...

397
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:46,985
to think I could do
business with you, Bison!

398
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:52,952
You raving lunatic!

399
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,895
I know you.

400
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:04,199
You're Edmund Honda, the sumo
from Hawaii. You almost made Yokozuna.

401
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:07,434
Until the Shadaloo Tong
destroyed my reputation.

402
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:11,069
They did the same thing to me
and my boxing career.

403
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:13,773
Don't tell me!
Figure skating.

404
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:20,416
All you need to know...

405
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:24,389
is that the weapons,
ammunitions Bison and Sagat deal in,

406
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,291
are gonna blow them
straight to hell.

407
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:32,563
This conclave is over!

408
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:37,333
You will die for this insult, Sagat.

409
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,862
You've got ten minutes.

410
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:43,739
- [Ken] Well, that was special.
- Come on. We've got work to do.

411
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,005
It's show time.

412
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,443
[Indistinct Shouting]

413
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:54,351
She said this place will blow
in ten minutes. Things can't get worse.

414
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,754
[Guns Cocking]

415
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:01,890
Uh, I was wrong.
It got worse.

416
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:04,624
Ken, back me up.

417
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:08,065
- General, you should be...
- Sagat, loosen up.

418
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:14,840
- Are you with me or against me?
- Is that multiple choice?

419
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:18,173
You dare to interfere?

420
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:22,477
Yeah, uh, because...

421
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:25,882
Because there are enemy spies
everywhere among us, General.

422
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,285
Show me these spies.

423
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:33,349
This is Chun-Li Zang. This may be
my final broadcast, but if it is,

424
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,952
- I and my comrades will know...
- There they are!

425
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:39,192
We have not died in vain,
for we will have ended the careers...

426
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:42,360
of the two warlords who have brought
so much death and destruction...

427
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:45,098
to this part of the world.

428
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,331
Bison! Sagat!

429
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:53,368
All your weapons of death
are going to be blown sky-high.

430
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:04,741
Happy landings.

431
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:20,886
Quick!
Change the channel!

432
00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:27,057
Evacuate at once!

433
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,550
[Bison] Search the camp.
Find Chun-Li!

434
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:16,738
[Bison]
The technology of East and West.

435
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,943
While the governments scorned me,

436
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:22,543
their corporations adored me!

437
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:27,456
Zangief, see that Ken and Ryu
are given clean clothing,

438
00:39:27,526 --> 00:39:30,962
for it was they who first warned us
of Chun-Li's treachery.

439
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:33,623
They are our honored guests.

440
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:37,897
Sagat, Vega,
you are welcome to stay here.

441
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,929
I think you will find
the coming events...

442
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,202
most educational.

443
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:46,471
[Zangief]
General, what about them?

444
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:54,113
Take these two
to the interrogation room.

445
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:56,177
[Guards Speaking
Native Language]

446
00:39:56,255 --> 00:40:00,885
They will talk...
or they will die.

447
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,684
Preferably both.

448
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:12,634
Take the, uh... journalist
to my chambers.

449
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,172
We have decided...

450
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,937
to grant her
a private interview.

451
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:22,447
- [Grunts]
- [Balrog] Get off me, man.

452
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:25,906
There. Let's go.

453
00:40:25,984 --> 00:40:30,546
Ken, Ryu, come with me.
We take care of you.

454
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:36,123
- This way.
- [Computer] Attention.

455
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,764
You're gonna dehydrate yourself.

456
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,563
Move! I said, "Move!"

457
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:51,902
This sucks!
Those guys are good guys... like us.

458
00:40:51,977 --> 00:40:54,571
Lately I don't feel very good.

459
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:16,125
An attack from the air
is impossible.

460
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:22,570
The only chance is an assault
with a small amphibious force... here.

461
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,875
The main force will come
from the north,

462
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:30,039
while a single vessel equipped...

463
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,242
with the latest
in stealth technology...

464
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:37,050
will come up this channel
and strike these defenses from the east.

465
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,556
- Colonel?
- Yes?

466
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:43,151
A single boat
against everything he's got?

467
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:46,220
The pilot would have to be
out of his mind.

468
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:51,759
Luckily, Bison has driven me crazy.
So I'm gonna do it.

469
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:54,533
Synchronize your watches.
O500.

470
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:57,769
Cast off at 0600.

471
00:41:57,843 --> 00:41:59,743
This is it.

472
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:14,651
Let me show you
how we treat foreigners in Shadaloo.

473
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:39,310
[Laughing]

474
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,484
- You are next, Yankee!
- Maybe you oughta lie down first.

475
00:42:46,558 --> 00:42:48,048
Yeah.

476
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:52,153
[Coughing]

477
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:58,959
And take a bath! Whew!

478
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,175
Oh, man!

479
00:43:06,478 --> 00:43:10,312
Oh, God. How do you keep
from crying out?

480
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:15,115
I'm sumo, brother. My body can be
in one place, my mind another.

481
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:19,283
Next time your mind leaves,
tell it to bring back a pizza.

482
00:43:19,357 --> 00:43:24,090
- Honda, gimme your hand.
- We've only been in jail
two hours. Maybe next month.

483
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:26,926
Gimme your hand, fool!

484
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:31,926
Ready? Go!

485
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:42,771
Now you look like
Bison troopers!

486
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:47,110
This is where we train...

487
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:51,815
in our glorious struggle
against the Allied Nations tyranny.

488
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:58,391
- How ya doin'?
- Hey, lookin' great.

489
00:43:58,463 --> 00:44:02,024
- Nice goin'.
- Hey, great uniforms.

490
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,365
- Long live Bison.
- Yep, Bison.

491
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:12,042
I see you later
in the commissary, huh?

492
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:20,574
You get a good look
at that video map?

493
00:44:20,652 --> 00:44:24,088
- Just got the left half.
- Good. I got the right.

494
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:27,518
[Reveille]

495
00:44:27,592 --> 00:44:32,029
[Soldier]
Troops... fall in!

496
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,660
Attention!

497
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,148
I'll handle this.

498
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,478
As you were, Colonel.

499
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:59,285
What a surprise.
Welcome to the Shadaloo front.

500
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:02,656
- You're just in time for the kickoff.
- I'm afraid not.

501
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:06,185
The Security Council has just voted.
They've decided to negotiate.

502
00:45:06,264 --> 00:45:09,756
- You're joking!
- We think we can deal with Gen. Bison.

503
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:13,395
You're instructed to call off
the assault. Contact him.

504
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:15,632
Request an extension
of his deadline.

505
00:45:15,707 --> 00:45:18,403
We are prepared to pay
the ransom demand.

506
00:45:18,476 --> 00:45:20,774
Twenty billion dollars?

507
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:24,144
What will prevent him
from taking more hostages next month...

508
00:45:24,215 --> 00:45:27,582
and asking for 50 billion,
100 billion?

509
00:45:27,652 --> 00:45:29,916
Colonel, have you lost your mind?

510
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:32,923
No. You've lost your balls!

511
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,925
Col. Guile,

512
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:38,019
deliver these instructions
to your troops.

513
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:41,896
Then consider yourself
relieved of your command.

514
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,173
Troopers,

515
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:57,703
I just received new orders.

516
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:01,355
Our superiors say
the war is cancelled.

517
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:04,390
We can all go home.

518
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:07,086
Bison is getting paid off
for his crimes,

519
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:10,824
and our friends

But... we can all go home.

Well, I'm not going home.

I'm gonna get on my boat,
and I'm going upriver.

And I'm going to kick
that son of a bitch
Bison's ass so hard...

528
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:48,766
that the next Bison wanna-be
is gonna feel it.

It was 20 years ago.

You hadn't promoted yourself
to general yet.

542
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,272
You were just
a petty drug lord.

543
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:50,115
You and your gang of murderers
gathered your small ounce of courage...

544
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:54,389
to raid across the border
for food, weapons.

545
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:57,556
Hmph. Slave labor.

546
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,537
My father
was the village magistrate.

A simple man
with a simple code: Justice.

548
00:49:13,214 --> 00:49:16,911
He gathered the few people
that he could to stand against you.

549
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,986
You and your bullies
were driven back...

550
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:25,423
by farmers with pitchforks.

551
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:33,159
My father saved his village
at the cost of his own life.

552
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:36,996
You had him shot...

graced your village...

was the most important day

he could lead us outside.

as much as I did.

But most importantly,

582
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:42,556
I studied the martial arts
of three continents.

583
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:45,122
So that one day...

584
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,293
I could meet you,

no one has ever seen you
in combat.

591
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,210
You always hid behind
your sumo and your boxer.

592
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:37,150
Why, since you entered
this country,

593

you never even threw
a single punch.

Yes, yes, Madam Secretary,
I gave him the orders.

The man's impossible.
No, no, no.

I stopped him from taking
all the soldiers.

It's Cherokee.
I wear it for good luck in battle.

718
01:05:21,828 --> 01:05:24,319
You should have brought
three of them.

- What are you, nuts?

826
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,247
Ryu, Guile put a gun to our head.
We did our part.

01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:19,116
The real soldiers are here,
and we're gone.

828
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:22,248
What's wrong with you? There's people
fighting upstairs, dying upstairs.

829
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:24,485
And they get paid for it.
We don't!

Now, you comin' with me or not?

831
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:28,792
Maybe before this place blows up,
we can find something worthwhile.

832
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:33,927
No, thanks. I already found
something worthwhile.

833
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:37,063
- I don't understand.
- I know you don't.

Stop! Stop!

We're pushing back the enemy,
but there's skirmishes on every level.

836
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:35,959
Still no sign of Bison.

837
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:41,826
He's probably hiding.

838
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:46,741
Hiding?

839
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:49,539
What do I have
to fear from you?

01:17:56,652 --> 01:17:59,519
afraid of the purity...

of unarmed combat.

844
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,555
Come out from behind
the curtain, wizard!

845
01:18:04,627 --> 01:18:07,596
Let's see how pure
your combat really is.

846
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:10,359
Come on!

847
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:12,263
Sir, no!
That's exactly what he wants!

848
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:15,064
No, T. Hawk.
That's what we both want.

849
01:18:15,137 --> 01:18:17,367
Am I right, Bison?

850
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,430
Are you man enough
to fight with me?

851
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,477
Anyone who opposes me
will be destroyed.

852
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:25,741
- Colonel, you can't!
- Oh, yes, I can.

853
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:28,009
Just take the hostages out.

854
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,517
If I'm not topside
in 15 minutes,

855
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:34,113
evacuate without me,
both of you.

856
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:37,716
- That's an order!
- Move out!

857
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:39,784
That's right, men.
Move out!

858
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,092
Troopers, out!

859
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:44,325
Throw the enemy
into the sea!

860
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,425
Leave us!

861
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:54,069
You have made me a happy man.

862
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,407
Next, I'll make you a dead one.

863
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:53,061
- You'll have to do better than that.
- Okay.

864
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:55,035
That's for Charlie.

865
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,072
That's for his soldiers.

866
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,025
Aaah!

867
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:24,565
Come on!

868
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:33,365
[Chun-Li]
The hostages, where are they?

869
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:45,549

01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:36,604
C.Q., this is Guile.

872
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:39,232
Cammy here.
Colonel, are you all right?

873
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:42,040
I'm okay.
I'm just half dead.

874
01:21:42,174 --> 01:21:45,302
- And Bison?
- All dead.

875
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:48,835
- What's the situation?
- Fighting in every corridor, sir.

876
01:21:48,914 --> 01:21:51,747
What about our reserves?
Have they arrived yet?

877
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:54,809
Sawada's reinforcements
are still hitting the beachhead.

878
01:21:54,886 --> 01:21:58,322
They have their hands full
with the enemy outside the fortress.

879
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,415
I'm afraid it could
still go either way.

880
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:02,619
[Guile]
Well, it's gonna go our way.

881
01:22:02,694 --> 01:22:04,719
Have our troops
on the upper levels...

882
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:06,957
fall back and turn on the enemy.

883
01:22:07,032 --> 01:22:11,765
- We'll trap the forces outside
between both of our columns.
- We'll do it, Colonel.

884
01:22:11,837 --> 01:22:14,806
But we still haven't
found the hostages yet.

885
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:18,104
I've got some volunteers on it.

886
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:22,408
And maybe they'll be...
able to help.

887
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:31,120
Colonel, I didn't read the last part.
Colonel, are you there?

888
01:22:37,863 --> 01:22:40,195
Ah, yes!

889
01:22:40,265 --> 01:22:44,463
[Sighs]
My mama didn't raise no fool, baby.

890
01:22:44,536 --> 01:22:48,028
Oh, man!
I should have stayed at Microsoft.

891
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:51,940
[Computer] All personnel,
report to battle stations.

892
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:56,208
Battle stations.
Report to battle stations at once.

893
01:22:57,115 --> 01:22:59,982
There's gotta be somethin'.

894
01:23:01,787 --> 01:23:03,914
Ahhh!

895
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:09,353
Okay.

896
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:11,055
Where's the old front door?

897
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,238
Ryu, where're you goin'?

898
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,843
Ryu, hang a "U," amigo!

899
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:33,180
You're walking into a trap!

900
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:38,245
Ryu, get outta there!

901
01:23:38,323 --> 01:23:39,915
Ryu!

902
01:23:50,936 --> 01:23:53,166
- Vega!
- Where were we?

903
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,674
You were losing.

904
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,003
[Guile]
No weapon, Bison.

905
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,671
What happened to the purity
of unarmed combat?

906
01:24:01,747 --> 01:24:06,013
This is merely
superconductor electromagnetism.

907
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,847
Surely you've heard of it.

908
01:24:07,919 --> 01:24:11,787
It levitates bullet trains
from Tokyo to Osaka.

909
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:15,258
It levitates my desk,

910
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:17,955
where I ride
the saddle of the world.

911
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:22,032
And it levitates...

912
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:24,725
me!

913
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:01,938
Something wrong, Colonel?

914
01:25:02,007 --> 01:25:05,534
You come here prepared
to fight a madman,

915
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,010
and instead
you found a god?

916
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,295
Ken!

917
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,809
Die!

918
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:27,815
[Screaming]

919
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,724
Here you go, Sagat.
I owe you.

920
01:27:09,134 --> 01:27:12,262
If I hadn't met you,
I might've become you.

921
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:29,052
You still refuse
to accept... my godhood?

922
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:32,487
Keep your own God!

923
01:27:32,557 --> 01:27:37,654
In fact, this might be
a good time to pray to him.

924
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:40,425
For I beheld Satan,

925
01:27:40,498 --> 01:27:43,399
and he fell from heaven...

926
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:47,964
like lightning!

927
01:27:55,246 --> 01:27:57,646
[Yelling]

928
01:28:05,523 --> 01:28:07,957
Bison, you're off the air!

929
01:28:09,427 --> 01:28:12,794
[Computer] Warning! Warning!
Energy field unstable.

930
01:28:12,864 --> 01:28:15,128
This'll take one minute.

931
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,792
Excuse me.

932
01:28:18,103 --> 01:28:20,298
Maybe less.

933
01:28:20,372 --> 01:28:22,602
We're the rescue team.
We'll take you to safety.

934
01:28:22,674 --> 01:28:25,142
Head up the stairs.
Please hurry.

935
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:36,784
[T. Hawk]
Come on! Get goin'!

936
01:28:36,855 --> 01:28:38,948
[Cammy]
This way. Hurry! Go! Come on!

937
01:28:39,024 --> 01:28:42,721
Honda, come on!
Hurry!

938
01:28:43,862 --> 01:28:46,558
Sorry, man.
Can't play no more.

939
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,059
Coward, come back!

940
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,072
Dee Jay!

941
01:28:56,141 --> 01:28:59,975
[Computer]
Superconductor field meltdown.
Evacuate.

942
01:29:00,045 --> 01:29:05,312
Evacuate. All personnel, proceed to
main entrance level immediately.

943
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:10,518
Dee Jay!
Why you out of uniform?

944
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:14,217
The enemies of peace and freedom
are at our walls.

945
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:16,556
Are you totally demented, man?

946
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:18,562
Our boss is the enemy
of freedom and peace.

947
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,394
These people have come
from all over the world to stop him.

948
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:24,526
If you're smart,
you'll save your own ass.

949
01:29:24,602 --> 01:29:28,561
Gen. Bison,
he's a bad guy?

950
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,131
If you know this,
then why do you serve him?

951
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:34,645
Because he paid me
a freakin' fortune, you moron!

952
01:29:37,816 --> 01:29:40,512
You got... paid?

953
01:29:40,585 --> 01:29:43,952
- [Computer] Warning! Warning!
- Charlie!

954
01:29:44,022 --> 01:29:46,684
- Backup superconductor
suppressors have failed.
- Charlie!

955
01:29:46,758 --> 01:29:49,955
Superconductor field meltdown
will occur in 60 seconds.

956
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:52,016
Evacuate at once.

957
01:29:56,154 --> 01:29:58,588
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

958
01:29:58,656 --> 01:30:01,022
- Keep moving out towards the daylight.
- This way!

959
01:30:01,092 --> 01:30:03,026
Don't panic.

960
01:30:04,128 --> 01:30:07,120
- Pigtails?
- Look who's talking!

961
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:09,766
Come on!
This way!

962
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:12,098
[Computer]
Sealing blast doors now.

963
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:19,835
[Grunting]

964
01:30:19,911 --> 01:30:22,607
Hey, this way!

965
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,172
Fifty seconds until
superconductor field meltdown.

966
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,583
Evacuate.
Evacuate at once.

967
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:34,057
Jamaica, here I come.

968
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,059
Here we come.

969
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:38,652
Forty seconds
until total meltdown.

970
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:42,063
Come on!
Get goin'! Get goin'!

971
01:30:42,133 --> 01:30:45,125
Evacuate at once.

972
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:50,268
Charlie!

973
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:53,071
We have to go.
This whole place is gonna go up.

974
01:30:53,144 --> 01:30:56,602
I can't go back, my friend.
Not like this.

975
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:58,444
Charlie!

976
01:30:58,516 --> 01:31:01,576
Don't worry.
He will not be alone.

977
01:31:01,653 --> 01:31:05,089
I must atone for my part
in this evil.

978
01:31:05,156 --> 01:31:09,183
- You said you did nothing.
- If good men do nothing,
that is evil enough.

979
01:31:21,673 --> 01:31:23,868
Ten seconds
to superconductor...

980
01:31:23,941 --> 01:31:26,034
[Yelling]

981
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,873
Ten, nine,

982
01:31:27,945 --> 01:31:31,039
eight, seven, six,

983
01:31:31,115 --> 01:31:36,314
five, four, three,
two, one.

984
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,493
Where's Guile?

985
01:32:23,434 --> 01:32:25,493
Guile didn't make it.

986
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:29,506
Hey, easy man.
That's me severance pay.

987
01:32:29,574 --> 01:32:31,838
[Sagat]
Severance pay!

988
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:42,409
Come on.
I can help you out here.

989
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:51,625
He was a brave man.

990
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:53,926
A true warrior.

991
01:32:55,433 --> 01:32:58,834
He told us to leave.

992
01:32:58,903 --> 01:33:00,962
We did the right thing.

993
01:33:01,038 --> 01:33:04,439
Well, it still feels
pretty wrong to me.

994
01:33:04,509 --> 01:33:06,909
[Coughing]

995
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:10,547
Guile!

996
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:12,879
Colonel!

997
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:17,785
Lieutenant, make a note.

998
01:33:17,855 --> 01:33:20,289
- I need a vacation.
- Yes, sir.

999
01:33:20,358 --> 01:33:22,849
[Sighs]

1000
01:33:24,095 --> 01:33:28,259
Uh, tear gas, sir...
on the way out.

1001
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:32,401
[Laughing, Cheering]

1002
01:33:34,839 --> 01:33:38,775
- I guess you've earned
your passports back.
- You can hang onto them.

1003
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:41,710
Somebody's gonna have to help
put this country back together.

1004
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:44,976
Maybe a couple of hustlers
can help.

1005
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:49,315
- Ever think of, uh, enlisting?
- No, no, no, no.

1006
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:06,365
[Sagat Laughing]

1007
01:34:11,075 --> 01:34:14,010
Col. Guile?

1008
01:34:18,249 --> 01:34:20,911
How 'bout that interview...

1009
01:34:20,985 --> 01:34:23,715
for my network?

1010
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:26,518
[Sighs]
Sure.

1011
01:34:28,326 --> 01:34:33,389
But only if you...
wear that dress.

1012
01:34:33,464 --> 01:34:36,558
[Explosions]

1013
01:34:44,242 --> 01:34:46,233
Hi-yah!

1014
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:50,345
[Chun-Li Laughs]

1015
01:34:57,709 --> 01:35:01,076
[D.J.]
Good morning, Shadaloo!

1016
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:05,275
Bonjour, guten Tag!

1017
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:08,979
Now, it's time once again for
the "Good Morning, Shadaloo" pop quiz.

1018
01:35:09,053 --> 01:35:12,284
Do you know what it says on the bottom
of Coke bottles in Bison's army?

1019
01:35:12,357 --> 01:35:15,155
Angh! Answer:
It says open other end.

1020
01:35:15,226 --> 01:35:18,821
I'm so alone
And I cry and cry

1021
01:35:18,896 --> 01:35:21,421
Too many tears

1022
01:35:24,569 --> 01:35:27,163
Just like a child who's born

1023
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:31,902
But became
a prisoner of my fears

1024
01:35:33,378 --> 01:35:38,748
People come, people go
They are hiding in shadows

1025
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:42,912
Hiding in dreams

1026
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:48,220
Moving in, moving out
They are nothing but strangers

1027
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:53,457
Strangers who see it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1028
01:35:53,531 --> 01:36:00,061
My broken heart is soggy
again and again

1029
01:36:03,107 --> 01:36:06,975
I never know what
the reason may be

1030
01:36:07,044 --> 01:36:09,740
It just doesn't end

1031
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:16,980
There's a sound in the air
while the time goes on slipping

1032
01:36:17,054 --> 01:36:19,488
Slipping away

1033
01:36:21,392 --> 01:36:26,091
In the air it is everywhere
Nowhere, somewhere

1034
01:36:26,164 --> 01:36:29,361
So I'm gonna have to say

1035
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:35,763
Why, tell me why

1036
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,676
I don't ever
wanna say good-bye

1037
01:36:41,746 --> 01:36:44,112
[D.J.] How do you know
in this man's, uh, pardon me,

1038
01:36:44,182 --> 01:36:48,312
in this person's international army,
if you're in a good unit? It's simple!

1039
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:51,116
The C.O. is English, the cook is French,
the mechanic is German,

1040
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:55,592
the paymaster is Swiss, and the cute
nurse in the infirmary is Swedish.

1041
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:57,753
And how do you know
if you're in a bad unit?

1042
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:01,026
Well, the C.O. is German, the cook
is English, the mechanic is Italian,

1043
01:37:01,098 --> 01:37:06,730
the paymaster is French, and
the cute nurse in the infirmary
is a Bulgarian named Boris.

1044
01:37:06,804 --> 01:37:09,932
Whatever country slapped
those blue pants on your butt,

1045
01:37:10,007 --> 01:37:13,204
this next one was a hit
wherever you're from!

1046
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:16,872
Straight to my feet
To my feet, yeah

Straight to my feet
To my feet, yeah

1049
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:30,125
Straight to my feet
The music makes me wanna jump

1050
01:37:30,194 --> 01:37:35,131
Straight to my feet
To my feet

1051
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:39,659
Everybody get ready
We gotta take this thing
to another level

1052
01:37:39,737 --> 01:37:42,900
That other level
Get your hands in the air

1053
01:37:42,974 --> 01:37:45,636
Now let's count it down
Y'all get ready

1054
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,270
And be smooth with it

1055
01:37:48,346 --> 01:37:53,306
All right, here we go
Three, two, one now sing

1056
01:37:53,384 --> 01:37:55,477
Give the girl that phone

1057
01:37:55,553 --> 01:37:59,853
Get off that phone
Hey

1058
01:37:59,924 --> 01:38:04,327
Give the girl that phone
Yeah

1059
01:38:04,395 --> 01:38:09,355
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah

1060
01:38:09,433 --> 01:38:11,594
But it's the type of phone
you kick all the time

1061
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:13,694
Prime to the Hammer
Give my tube a prime

1062
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:16,331
Oh, my, I get the feelin' that
All night long

1063
01:38:16,407 --> 01:38:18,602
Then I hit it
Dancin' up a storm

1064
01:38:18,676 --> 01:38:20,268
I swore then the party's on

1065
01:38:20,344 --> 01:38:23,802
The party keeps kickin'
'til the break of dawn

1066
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:26,281
Party's on the easy
Say what, say what

1067
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:28,978
We're taking it
Straight to my feet

1068
01:38:29,053 --> 01:38:31,578
Yeah, sing that, G-man

1069
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,590
Straight to my feet

1070
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:39,028
When you feel the beat
you've got to move your feet

1071
01:38:39,096 --> 01:38:42,293
Dancin' all night long
Straight to my feet

1072
01:38:42,366 --> 01:38:46,666
Skip-do-dee-doo-dee
Straight to my feet

1073
01:38:46,737 --> 01:38:51,003
Just dip to the beat
Straight to my feet

1074
01:38:51,075 --> 01:38:55,705
Just dip to the beat
I'm dipping

1075
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:59,876
Dipping, dipping
Straight to my feet

1076
01:38:59,951 --> 01:39:02,511
Just dip to the beat
Yeah

1077
01:39:02,587 --> 01:39:04,748
Straight to my feet

1078
01:39:04,822 --> 01:39:08,155
[D.J.] How many Bison troopers
does it take to change a light bulb?

1079
01:39:08,225 --> 01:39:10,420
Angh! Fifty-one.
One to change the bulb...

1080
01:39:10,494 --> 01:39:12,860
the other fifty to steal it
from a 7-Eleven!

1081
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:16,127
[Laughs]
Got a million of them!

1082
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:23,003
Pandemonium

1083
01:39:23,074 --> 01:39:25,065
Pandemonium

1084
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,445
Pandemonium

1085
01:39:30,514 --> 01:39:32,880
Pandemonium

1086
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,975
Pandemonium

1087
01:39:37,688 --> 01:39:39,986
See that
Catch a vision

1088
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,752
Feel me in the eyes of venicky

1089
01:39:41,826 --> 01:39:44,192
High above the plains
but still remains icky

1090
01:39:44,261 --> 01:39:46,661
Livin' now no matter
how fly there is no scene

1091
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,995
I am not a supreme being
Free me

1092
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:51,591
'Cause many minds to satisfy
is why they never rest

1093
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:53,967
Fightin' for their life and
fightin' holes in their chest

1094
01:39:54,038 --> 01:39:56,404
Merely scavengers
But no one who'll confess

1095
01:39:56,474 --> 01:39:58,908
But in time
They will all undress

1096
01:39:58,976 --> 01:40:01,342
Livin' in the lowest
and trapped without sex

1097
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,642
Trappin' as a bell means
it's way underground

1098
01:40:03,714 --> 01:40:06,239
No calculating
'cause it's all round

1099
01:40:06,317 --> 01:40:09,081
Round like a bigot
An old school calligra-phy

1100
01:40:09,153 --> 01:40:10,950
So figure that's a joke
for to see

1101
01:40:11,022 --> 01:40:13,149
Far greater than the eye
so can fly high

1102
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:15,624
He used to have his act all clean
now they got a tax on me

1103
01:40:15,693 --> 01:40:17,285
But that's if you can find me

1104
01:40:17,361 --> 01:40:19,454
We'll be trippin' with
the scene with the bad "D"

1105
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,964
Pandemonium

1106
01:40:22,033 --> 01:40:24,001
Pandemonium

1107
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:27,901
Pandemonium

1108
01:40:27,972 --> 01:40:30,566
He being cause of calamities
and even Amity...

1109
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:33,508
Ville Horror

1111
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:50,359
Solar batteries recharging.

1112
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:56,397
One solar battery on line.

1113
01:40:57,635 --> 01:41:01,867
[Computer Voice At Normal Speed]
One solar battery on line.

1114
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:04,635
Attempting to activate system.

1115
01:41:05,676 --> 01:41:08,645
System activated.

1116
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:15,512
Good morning, Gen. Bison.
What is your menu choice for today?
