73
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,073
[Man On Radio] There have been genetic
studies on beef cattle.

74
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,409
There has been concern
the degree of heritability...

75
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,078
of economically important traits
such as rate of growth...

76
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,080
meat conversion
and carcass quality.

77
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:25,376
Thin breeds,
and in many cases Herefords...

78
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,671
they have been selected
for these traits.

79
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:32,466
Findings have shown generally
that such traits are highly heritable.

80
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,635
This is consistent
with similar studies...

81
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,264
conducted elsewhere
around the country.

82
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,100
On the other hand,
some other traits...

83
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,269
such as fertility
and calf-survival rate-

84
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:44,479
low inheritability.

85
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,691
Heterosis,
or hybrid vigor...

86
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,235
may be an important factor
in these latter traits...

87
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,404
and the crossing
of genetic unlikes...

88
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,991
produces heterosis
for best crossbreeding.

89
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:59,119
So just a few views
of what's to come...

90

in crossbreeding...

00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,682
as a car delivery driver
by an agency in Denver.

340
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,935

This is not a stolen car.

343
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,028
He's driving it to San Francisco
for delivery due Monday.

It's only Saturday. What's his hurry?

00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,117
[Colorado Officer] That's what
we wanted to know ourselves...

346
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,286

is as good as ours.

goin' on out there, Collins?
- Headin' for Twin Falls.

- He creamed my car.
- What's the matter with you? You gone crazy?

Correction. We're still after him.
We haven't lost him.

He's jumped the main road
and headed out into the desert.

for a while.

to prove now?

- Any time now, Super.
- Yeah. Run a tape.

Now, I know
you can hear me, Kowalski.

00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:15,166
you'll try to get to California
through Death Valley.

382
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:18,586
And others bet
you'll die there in the desert.

And to be interviewed
by K.L.Z. TV News...

420
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:10,694
is the owner of the agency,
Mr. Holly Mekas...

and one of the attendants,
Sandy McKees.

you knew this man best.

- Well, he's a great driver.

What did you say?

- [Sandy] I said he's a great driver.
- Great driver. We all knew that.

made the grade, did he?
