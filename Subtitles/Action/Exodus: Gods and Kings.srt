you'll just come back...

The year of your birth...

369
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,583
there was a prophecy that
our leader would be born...

370
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,585
to liberate us
from our bondage.

371
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,247
And so, there was an edict
from Memphis...

372
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,839
to kill every
firstborn Hebrew boy.

373
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,757

for that to happen.

was better than no chance.

to your sister.

She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river...

377
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,437
and she floated you
to where she knew...

Bithia, bathed.

379
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,614
Bithia took you
and your sister,
Miriam, as a maid...

380
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,699
and raised you as her own.

381

even loved you...

382
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,791

383
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,619

00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,962

that good a story.
