 that they're out there,

  what you saw.

 I think.

 there was this Loth-cat.

 this vision, Kanan.

 to your parents?

35
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,451
 (CONSOLE BEEPING)
    Yeah. But I didn't want
 to hear what he had to say...

36
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,387
               That I'd never

41

           but he had fragments
           of information,

               There was
               nothing to tell.

53
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,440
 Surely our garrison there
 would have spotted
 rebel activity.

 No, Inquisitor.

 when you produce results.

57
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,752
 And they have.
 I have independently confirmed
 the Inquisitors' theory.

58
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:44,690
 There is a rebel presence
 on Garel.

59
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,628
 They use multiple spaceports
 to hide their ships.
 Quite clever.

60
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:54,499

   even though they represent
   your constant failure?

61
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:59,404
       Perhaps, Inquisitor,
       we can achieve together,
       what we have not apart.

        My name is Ryder Azadi.

292
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:04,866
         You're right.
         I know your parents.

293
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,174
             I can't believe
             you're here, Ezra.

294
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,809
          I wanted to find you,

295
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,177
            but I guess
            you found me first.

296
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,045
          I know you, don't I?

297
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,081
       Uh, you remember?

298
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,083
          You were pretty small
          back then.

299
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:24,152
 I was the governor of Lothal.

300
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,053
    I supported your parents
    and the messages

301
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,055
          they beamed out
          against the Empire.

302
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,925
 It was part of the reason
  I was accused of treason

303
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
 and sent to prison with them.

304
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,196
 I do remember.
 Then you know
 what happened to them.

305
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,799
           Yes, I do.

306
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:40,802
  They're dead, aren't they?

307
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,939
   I'm sorry, son. They are.

308
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,908
     (SIGHS)

309
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,914
 Please tell me what happened.

310
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,050
   You know, even imprisoned,

311
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,820
  your parents would stand up
  for those who couldn't.

312
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,788
    Especially after
    they heard your message.

313
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,723
            (GASPS)
             Yes. That message.

314
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,125
      That message of rebellion
      you beamed out

315
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,062
          somehow made its way
         into the deepest dark
          of Imperial prisons.

316
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,997
         They were
         inspired by it, Ezra.

317
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,067
      They rallied others
      to rise up and break out.

318
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:17,705
      Dozens of us,
      rebels, sympathizers
      are free, thanks to them.

319
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:19,941
    But they didn't make it.

320
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:22,043
       They got separated
       in the escape.

321
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,144
          It was just like them
          not to leave

322
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,880
         until everyone else
         got out first.

323
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,115
             But by then,
             it was too late.

324
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:31,853
     How? How did they know
     it was me?

325
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,087
  On the transmission?

326
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:37,024
  Your voice, your words, son,
  telling Lothal to stand up.

327
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,160
     They knew right away.

328
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,995
         You know,
         they used to say it

329
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,830
      all the time
      when I was little.

330
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,767
 "If we don't stand up,
 who will?"

331
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,936
         (SOBBING)

332
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,112
 It's beautiful, isn't it, son?

333
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,915
              Yeah. So peaceful.

334
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,885
  That is all going to change
  when the Empire arrives.

335
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:41,055
   But I don't want things
   to change.

336
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,857
        They already have, Ezra.

337
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:47,061
               You have made us
               so proud.

338
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,897
         You are going to need
         to stay strong.

339
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,934
         Can you do that, son?
         Yes, I can.

340
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:58,806
                Remember, Ezra.
                 Without hope,
                we have nothing.

341
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,840
      KANAN: Moons are setting.

342
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:02,944
                Be morning soon.

343
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,781
     I saw them, Kanan.
     My parents.

344
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,949
 They were right here.

345
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,152
 I... I can't explain how.

346
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:16,023
        The Jedi teach that life
        doesn't cease at death,

347
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,859
    but merely changes form
    in the Force.

348
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:21,796
     Your parents are alive
     inside you, Ezra.

349
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:24,031
 They will be. Always.
