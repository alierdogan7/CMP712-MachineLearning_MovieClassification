00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,136
Something tells me it won't.

178
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,217
Uh, well, sir,
volatile is all relative.

179
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,219
Maybe our data was off.

180
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,587
Or maybe it didn't erupt

181
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,256
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

182
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,458
inside it right after
a civilization

183

invented the wheel

rising out of their ocean!

185
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,233
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

186
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,868
Admiral...
You filed a report?

187
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,870
Why didn't you tell me?

188
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,239
I incorrectly assumed that you would
be truthful in your captain's log.

189
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,441
Yeah, I would have been if I
didn't have to save your life,

190
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,144
and the very reason
I felt it necessary

191
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,345
to take responsibility
for the actions...

192
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,880
(SCOFFS)
Take responsibility, yeah.

193
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,181

194

a derogatory reference to...

and observe, not to interfere.

attitude, Spock?

204
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,535
I'm expressing multiple
attitudes simultaneously, sir.

205
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,870
To which are you referring?

206
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,637

So tell me what you did wrong.

to be learned here?

213

answer the question. You lied.

you lied.

That's why you talked me into
signing up in the first place.

219
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,370
It's why you gave me your ship.

220
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,939
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

221
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,010
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

let Spock die?

You're missing the point.

224
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,247
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

225
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,949
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

226
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,450
in the first place!

227
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,219

to survey a planet,

228

not alter its destiny!

229
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,556
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

230
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,525

under your command killed.

of all the vessels
in the region.

352
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,520
And in the name
of those we lost,

353
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,189
you will run this bastard down.

354
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,627
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple, so let's get to work.

355
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,596
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

356
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,097
any warp signatures
leaving the system,

357
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,180
so we know he can't be far.

358
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,169
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

359
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,472
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

360
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,875
to run down every lead.

361
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,510
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

362
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,079
so the rules of engagement
are simple.

363
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,949
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

364
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,084
or the lives of those nearby,

365
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,020
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

366
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,089
What's in the bag?
James, not now.

367
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,991
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

368
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,726
It's like bombing a library.

369
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,761
Chris?
Everything okay there?

370
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,531
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk
is just acclimating

371
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,500
to his new position
as First Officer.

372
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,901

Kirk, say it.

I'm fine, sir.
My apologies.

375

Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.

376
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,746
Why the archive?

377
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,148
All that information
is public record.

378
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,711
If he really wanted
to damage Starfleet,

379
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,921
this could just
be the beginning.

380
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,823

Mr. Kirk?

Uh, we're not sure, sir.

in the Ketha Province,

for decades.

go near Klingon space,

it'd be all-out war.

but I can.

Please, sir.

All-out war with the Klingons

If you ask me,
it's already begun.

Since we first learned
of their existence,

449
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,657
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

450
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,259
two planets that we know of

451
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,227
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

452
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,964

is uninhabited?

As I am again your First

to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

501
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:53,663
There is no Starfleet regulation that
condemns a man to die without a trial,

502
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,433
something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.

503
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,769
Also, preemptively
firing torpedoes

504
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,470
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

505
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,172
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

one casualty.

507

Our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

508
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,812
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

509
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,349
Regulations aside, this
action is morally wrong.

510
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,584
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

511
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,719
And I didn't win
any points for that.

512
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm not gonna take

513
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,390
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

find my opinion valid.

off my face.

start a war with the Klingons

and it is, by its very
definition, immoral.

take the requisite time

525
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,182
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

526
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,416
I wish I had.

527
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,787
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

528
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,389
"Doctorate in applied physics"

529
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,158

back aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

KIRK: Is there a problem,
Mr. Scott?

539
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,567
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

540
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,836
that I cannot authorize any
weapons on board this ship

541
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,271
without knowing
what's inside them.

542
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,772
Mr. Scott raises
yet another point...

543
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:43,673
Report to the bridge.

544
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,742
Captain.

545
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,577
Mr. Scott,
I understand your concerns,

546
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,880
but we need these
torpedoes on board.

547
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,382
Due respect, sir, but photon
torpedoes run on fuel.

548
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,151
Now, I cannot detect
the type of fuel

549
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,652
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

550
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,187
because it's shielded.

551
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,589
Now, I asked for the
specifications, but he said...

552
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,525
It's classified.
It's classified.

553
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,426
So I said,
"No specs, no signature!"

554
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,262
SULU: Captain.

555
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,364
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

556
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,432
Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.

557
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,715
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

558
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,904
Get down!

559
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,572
Jim, your vitals are way off.

560
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,941
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!

561
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,843
I need you to approve
those weapons.

562
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,412
I don't have time
for a lecture, Scotty.

563
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,448
Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.

564
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,518
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

565
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,620
A subtle shift
in magnetic output

566
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,323
from, say, firing one or
more of six dozen torpedoes

567
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,192
with an unknown payload

568
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,426
could set off a chain
reaction which would kill

569
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,628
every living thing
on this ship.

570
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,830
Letting those torpedoes on board
the <i>Enterprise is the last straw!</i>

571
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,766
What was the first straw?
What was the...

572
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,801
There are plenty of straws.

573
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,604
How about Starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation?

574
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,706
And now some madman's using
it to hop across the galaxy!

575
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,707
Where do you think
he got it from?

576
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,275
We have our orders, Scotty!

577
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,544
That's what scares me.

578
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,947
This is clearly
a military operation.

579
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,815

583

585
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,328
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

586
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,529
You're not giving me
much of a choice...

exception and sign...

my resignation or not?

BONES: <i>Why the hell did he surrender?
KIRK: I don't know.</i>

870
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,706
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

871
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,074
I want to know how.

872
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,210
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

873
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,511
KIRK: You tell me.

874
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,221
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

(INJECTION WHIRS)

876
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,105
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

877
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,244
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

878
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,147
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

879
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,916
How the hell do you know that?
Bones.

880
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,086
I think you'd find my
insight valuable, Captain.

881
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,891
We good?
Yeah.

882
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,660
Let me know what you find.

883
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:22,097
Ignore me and you will get
everyone on this ship killed.

884
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:32,074
SPOCK: Captain, I believe he will
only attempt to manipulate you.

885
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,876
I would not recommend engaging
the prisoner further.

886
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,143
Give me a minute.

887
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,925
Let me explain
what's happening here.

888
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,861
You are a criminal.

889
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,130
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

890
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:58,166
I was authorized to end you!

891
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:01,603
And the only reason
why you are still alive

892
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,272
is because I am allowing it.

893
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:06,842
So shut your mouth.

894
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,144
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

895
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,147
over and over
till your arm weakens?

896
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,082
Clearly you want to,
so tell me,

897
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,686
why did you allow me to live?

898
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,821
We all make mistakes.

899
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,558
No. I surrendered
to you because,

900
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,593
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

901
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,962
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

902
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,999
If you did not, then it
would be impossible for me

903
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,834
to convince you of the truth.

If you want to know
why I did what I did,

907
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,782
go and take a look.

908
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,851
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

909
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,155
I can give you 72.

910
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:55,257
And they're on board
your ship, Captain.

911
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,727
They have been all along.

912
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,097
I suggest you open one up.

You know what really
bothers me, though? (BURPS)

917
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,794
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

918
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,331
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

919
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,133
Just for trying
to do what's right!

920
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,769
And what did you do anyway?

921
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,004
You just stood there
like an oyster,

922
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,005
looking at me!

Are you drunk?

929
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,887
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

930
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,155
I need you to help me out
with something.

931
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,256
Will you take
these coordinates down?

932
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,126

Hmm.

I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

938
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,881
but I have a feeling you'll
know it when you see it.

939
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,712
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

940
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,083
I will consider that
an apology.

941
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,365
And I will
consider that apology.

942
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
You are the one who quit.

943
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,456
You made me quit!

Mr. Scott? (GROANS)

945
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,726
Scott. Ah...

946
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,762
The nerve of that guy!

947
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,100
I am not doing that man
any favors!

948
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,468
No!

949
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,271
Ach! All right, then!

950
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,273
Are you out of
your corn-fed mind?

951
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,208
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

952
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,410
He killed Pike,
he almost killed you,

953
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,312
and now you think it's a good
idea to pop open a torpedo

954
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,480
because he dared you to.

955
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:00,849
Why did he
save our lives, Bones?

956
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,317
The Doctor does
have a point, Captain.

957
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,752
Don't agree with me, Spock.

958
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:04,954
It makes me very uncomfortable.

959
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,221
Perhaps you too should learn

960
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,023
to govern your emotions,
Doctor.

961
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,257
In this situation,
logic dictates...

962
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,727
Logic? Oh, my God!
There's a maniac

963
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,095
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

964
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,863
That's not it. I don't
know why he surrendered,

965
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,832
but that's not it.

966
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,034
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

967
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,902
BONES: But, Jim,
without Mr. Scott on board,

968
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,270
who exactly is qualified

969
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:24,740
to just pop open a four-ton
stick of dynamite?

970
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,208
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

971
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,310
in the torpedoes and she
is a weapons specialist.

972
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,011
Perhaps she could be
of some use.

973
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,414
What Admiral's daughter?

974
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:35,183
Carol Marcus.
Your new science officer

975
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,786
concealed her identity
to board the ship.

976
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,955
When were you
going to tell me that?

977
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,023
When it became relevant.
As it just did.

978
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:43,525
Are the torpedoes
in the weapons bay?

979
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,360
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

980
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:46,828
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

981
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,063
onto your ship to find out why.

982
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:50,065
I do apologize for that.

983
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,467
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

984
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,902
I'm Carol Marcus.

985
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,003
James Kirk.

986
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,904
Torpedoes.

987
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,875
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

988
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,344
then I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes.

989
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,012
Uh-huh. When I went to
confront him about it,

990
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,248
he wouldn't even see me.

991
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,016
That's when I discovered the
torpedoes had disappeared

992
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,485
from all official records.

993
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,888
And then he gave them to me.

994
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,357
You're much cleverer than your
reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

995
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,392
I have a reputation?

996
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,560
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

997
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:19,895
(INSTRUMENTS HUMMING)

998
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,530
Christine, yes.
How is she?

999
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,365
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

1000
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,366
She's much happier now.

1001
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,101
That's good.

1002
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,944
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

1003
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,806
What... What are
we doing in here?

1004
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,874
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?
Of course it is.

1005
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,197
Would you please turn around?
Why?

1006
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,344
Just turn around.

1007
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,081
It's too dangerous
to try and open

1008
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,184
one of these torpedoes
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1009
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,553
But there is
a nearby planetoid.

1010
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,321
I can open one up there.

1011
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,956
But I will need some help.

1012
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,891
Turn around.

1013
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,227
Now!

01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,597

01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,268
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

1017
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,071
SULU: Yes, sir. They're moving
the torpedo into position now.

1018
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,753
KIRK: Good. Any activity
from the Klingons?

1019
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,608
SULU: Not yet.

1020
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,771
But if we're stuck here much
longer, they will find us.

1021
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,112
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

1022
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,614
we have Harrison in custody?

1023
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,316
Yes, sir.
No response yet.

1026
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,290
Mr. Chekov,
give me some good news.

1027
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:25,227

the damage is substantial.

1028
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:26,494
We're working on it.

1029
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,097
KIRK: <i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

1030
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,133
Uh, no, sir. But I accept
full responsibility.

1031
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:38,139
Something tells me it wasn't your fault.
Stay on it.

1032

1033
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,978

01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,913
Dr. Marcus asked for the
steadiest hands on the ship.

1035
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,448
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

1036
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,350
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

1037
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,085
there was no torpedo!

KIRK: <i>Dr. McCoy,
may I remind you,</i>

1039
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,021
<i>you are not there to flirt.</i>

01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,143
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

1041
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,992

1042
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:58,426
CAROL: To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

1043
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,995
we need to open the warhead.

1044
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,429
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

1045
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,898
Unfortunately for us,

1046
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,200
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

1047
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,334
Sweetheart, I once performed

1048
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,436

on a pregnant Gorn.

1049
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,038

1050
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,340
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

1051
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,377
(GROANS) I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

1052
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,113
CAROL: Dr. McCoy, there's a
bundle of fiber optic cables

1053
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,381
against the inner casing.

1054
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:21,449
You'll need to cut
the 23rd wire down.

1055
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:23,018
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

1056
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,319
Do you understand?

1057
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:26,221
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

1058
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,389
CAROL: <i>Dr. McCoy,</i>

1059
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:30,025

1060
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:31,593
<i>I'm rerouting

1061
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,662
Are you ready?
And raring.

1062
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:35,931
Good luck.

I can't get my arm out!

1066
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:47,442
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

1067
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,311
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

1068
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,612
Dr. Marcus,
can you disarm it?

1069
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,548
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1070
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,716
Jim, get her
the hell out of here!

1071
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,351
No! If you beam me back,
he dies!

What have we got?

1091
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:11,352
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

1092
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,555
and retrofitted
to hide this cryo tube.

1093
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,924
Is he alive?
BONES: He's alive.

1094
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,161
But if we try to revive him

1095
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,230
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

1096
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,232
This technology's beyond me.

1097
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,101
How advanced, Doctor?

1098
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:29,471
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

1099
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,841
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

1100
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:35,376
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

1101
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,312
He's 300 years old.

1102

Why is there a man
in that torpedo?

There are men and women

1104
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,494
in all those torpedoes,
Captain.

1105
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:53,728
I put them there.

1106
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,273
Who the hell are you?

1107
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,906
A remnant of a time long past.

1108
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,710
Genetically engineered
to be superior

1109
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,246
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

1110
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:17,385
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

1111
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,455
For centuries we slept,

1112
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,227
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

1113
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,463
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

1114
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,532
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

1115
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,233
distant quadrants of space.

1116
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,802
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

1117
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,671
KIRK: I looked up
"John Harrison."

1118
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,206
Until a year ago,
he didn't exist.

1119
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,275
John Harrison was a fiction

1120
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:41,943
created the moment I was awoken

1121
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:45,413
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1122
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:48,383
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1123
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,719
My name is,

1124
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,221
Khan.

1125
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,529
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1126
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,200
ask a 300-year-old
frozen man for help?

1127
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,902
Because I am better.

1128
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,205
At what?
Everything.

1129
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,209
Alexander Marcus
needed to respond to

1130
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,277
an uncivilized threat
in a civilized time

1131
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,413
and for that
he needed a warrior's mind.

1132
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,281
My mind.

1133
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:22,483
To design weapons and warships.

1134
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:24,586
SPOCK: You are suggesting
the Admiral

1135
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:26,621
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1136
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,790
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1137
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,426
He wanted to exploit
my savagery.

1138
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:34,229
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1139
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,797
You... You can't
even break a rule.

1140
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,999
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1141
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,637
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

1142
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,406
To help him realize his vision
of a militarized Starfleet.

1143
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,476
He sent you
to use those weapons.

1144
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:51,879
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1145
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,284
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1146
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:59,854
in enemy space, leading to
one inevitable outcome.

1147
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,456
The Klingons
would come searching

1148
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,491
for whomever was responsible,

1149
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,793
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1150
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:09,964
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1151
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:11,633
The war he always wanted.

1152
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,635
No. No.

1153
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,873
I watched you open fire in a room
full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

1154
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,808
You killed them in cold blood!

1155
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,444
Marcus took my crew from me.

1156
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,747
You are a murderer!

1157
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,982
He used my friends
to control me.

1158
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:35,490
I tried to smuggle them
to safety

1159
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,924
by concealing them
in the very weapons

1160
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:38,593
I had designed,

1161
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,397
but I was discovered.

1162
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,402
I had no choice
but to escape alone.

1163
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:53,541
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect

1164
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,845
that Marcus had killed
every single one

1165
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,848
of the people I hold most dear.

1166
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,555
So I responded in kind.

01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,827

1894

McCoy to bridge.

1895
01:58:09,349 --> 01:58:12,117
I can't reach Spock.
I need Khan alive.

1896
01:58:12,119 --> 01:58:14,586
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1897
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:17,622
I think he can save Kirk.

1898
01:58:17,624 --> 01:58:19,257
Can we beam them up
to the ship?

1899
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:21,326
Ah, they keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1900
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:22,394
Can you beam someone down?

1901

(SCREAMS) Spock!

1904

Spock!

1905
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:10,175
Spock, stop! Stop!

1906
01:59:10,177 --> 01:59:11,743
He's our only chance
to save Kirk!

1907
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,523
GEORGE: <i>What is it?</i>
WINONA: <i>It's a boy.</i>

1908

PIKE: <i>Your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1909
01:59:28,328 --> 01:59:31,630
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

(GASPS)

1911
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,476
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1912
01:59:44,478 --> 01:59:46,912
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1913
01:59:46,914 --> 01:59:47,779
You were out cold
for two weeks.

1914
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,481
Transfusion?

1915
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:51,583
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1916
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,818
Khan?

1917
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,487
Once we caught him,

1918
01:59:55,489 --> 01:59:58,223
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1919
01:59:58,225 --> 02:00:00,559
Tell me, are you feeling,
uh, homicidal?

1920
02:00:00,561 --> 02:00:02,327
Power mad? Despotic?

1921
02:00:02,329 --> 02:00:03,728
No more than usual.

1922
02:00:04,463 --> 02:00:05,397
How'd you catch him?

1923
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,199
I didn't.

1924
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:18,510
You saved my life.

1925
02:00:18,512 --> 02:00:20,673
Uhura and I had something to
do with it, too, you know.

1926
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,716
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1927
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:25,884
Spock, just...

1928
02:00:27,653 --> 02:00:28,853
Thank you.

1929
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,457
You are welcome, Jim.

KIRK: <i>There will always be
those who mean to do us ha.</i>

<i>To stop them,</i>

1932
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:54,512
<i>we risk awakening the same
evil within ourselves.</i>

1933
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,722
<i>Our first instinct
is to seek revenge</i>

1934
02:01:03,724 --> 02:01:05,523
<i>when those we love
are taken from us.</i>

1935
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:10,395
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1936
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:14,032
<i>We are here today</i>

1937
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:17,302
<i>to rechristen
the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1938
02:01:17,304 --> 02:01:19,571
<i>and to honor those
who lost their lives</i>

1939
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:23,275
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1940
02:01:23,277 --> 02:01:25,477
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1941
02:01:25,479 --> 02:01:27,345
<i>he had me recite
the Captain's Oath,</i>

1942
02:01:28,648 --> 02:01:30,949
<i>words I didn't appreciate
at the time.</i>

1943
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,719
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1944
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:37,455
<i>who we once were,</i>

1945
02:01:39,558 --> 02:01:41,693
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1946
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:44,496
<i>And those words?</i>

1947
02:01:45,498 --> 02:01:49,401
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1948
02:01:49,403 --> 02:01:52,437
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1949

<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1950
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,343
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1951
02:01:58,345 --> 02:02:02,480
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1952
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:05,650
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1953
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,588
CHEKOV: Captain on the bridge.

1954
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:16,461
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1955
02:02:16,463 --> 02:02:17,962
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1956
02:02:17,964 --> 02:02:20,365
"Captain" does have
a nice ring to it.

1957
02:02:20,367 --> 02:02:21,533
Chair's all yours, sir.

1958
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:25,103
Mr. Scott.

1959
02:02:25,105 --> 02:02:26,438
<i>How's our core?</i>

1960
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,340
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1961
02:02:28,342 --> 02:02:29,874
She's ready for a long journey.

1962
02:02:30,376 --> 02:02:31,810
<i>Excellent.</i>

1963
02:02:31,812 --> 02:02:33,912
Come on, Bones!
It's gonna be fun.

1964
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:38,783
Five years in space.
God help me.

02:02:38,785 --> 02:02:40,051
Dr. Marcus.

1966
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:43,874
Uh... I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1967
02:02:44,056 --> 02:02:45,423
It's nice to have a family.

1968
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:48,893
KIRK: Spock.

1969
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:50,495
Captain.

1970
02:02:53,566 --> 02:02:54,833
Where shall we go?

1971
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:59,437
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1972
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:03,842
I defer to your
good judgment, Captain.

1973
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:15,453
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1974
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:16,921
Aye, Captain.
