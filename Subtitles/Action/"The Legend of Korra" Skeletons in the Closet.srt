1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:02,140
Earth.
Fire.

2
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:05,009
Air.
Water.

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:10,712
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

4
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:15,283
and bring balance to the world.

5
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:20,021
[Dramatic music]
 The equalists

6
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,090
are on the attack.
The Lieutenant

7
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:23,892
and his chi-blockers
invaded air temple island

8
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,428
and forced Tenzin
and his family to flee.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,363
In the daring escape
lin beifong sacrificed herself

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,966
and saved the airbenders.
But she was captured

11
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:35,370
and Amon took her bending away.
Now team Avatar is in hiding

12
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,439
as they await help
from General Iroh

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:45,441
and the united forces.
 It is a glorious day

14
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:49,184
my equalist brothers
and sisters.

15
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:51,386
Amon has torn down
the tyrannical

16
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:54,422
bending government!
He has declared

17
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:58,226
bending illegal.
And he has the Avatar

18
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:05,333
on the run.
Our great leader has a vision

19
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,569
for the future.
One day soon

20
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:09,737
bending will no longer exist
and we will live in a world

21
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,976
where everyone is finally equal!
The united forces

22
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,512
are on their way right now
to try and stop that dream

23
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:25,514
but we will prevail!
[Cheers and applause]

24
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,232
Can you believe Hiroshi?
"The Avatar's on the run."

25
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:39,634
I'm not running from anyone.
Let's go back up there

26
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:42,036
and knock some heads.
They'll never know

27
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,038
what hit them.
 Relax.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,140
General Iroh's coming
with an entire fleet

29
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,408
of battleships.
Then Amon will be

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,211
the one who's running.
 I hate this

31
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:58,213
"being patient" stuff.
[Squeaking]

32
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,754
You two were gone a while.
 We were doing

33
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,924
reconnaissance.
 Whatever.

34
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,994
Welcome back!
Hope you worked up an appetite

35
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:10,899
'cause dinner is served.
 Thanks so much for

36
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,667
letting us hide out with you
the past few days.

37
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,236
Honored to oblige.
My associates and I

38
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:19,674
heartily oppose Amon's so-called
"equalist" policies.

39
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,009
We got benders and non-benders
living together down here

40
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:26,381
but do you see us fighting?
No, siree.

41
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,550
We figured out how
to harmoniously co-exist.

42
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:35,223
You are a wise
and noble hobo.

43
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:36,991
Mmm.
This is the best-tasting

44
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:37,825
street gruel I've ever had.

45
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,427
Seriously.
 I culled it

46
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:42,830
from the finest dumpsters
the city has to offer.

47
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,999
[Chokes] Blagh!

48
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:53,001
[Coughing] [Squeaking]

49
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,114
Can't sleep either?
 No, I have this

50
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:05,887
awful pit in my stomach.
 Me too.

51
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,555
It's so crazy.
A few months ago

52
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,957
I was in the South pole
practicing for

53
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,226
my firebending test
and now I'm in the middle

54
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:14,429
of an all-out war.
 I know.

55
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:16,297
We didn't even
know each other then.

56
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,868
And now, I can't imagine
my life without you in it.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,037
You're the most loyal
brave, and selfless person

58
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,909
I've ever known.
 I think you're

59
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:34,048
pretty incredible too
but you already knew that.

60
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,683
I should probably
try to get some sleep.

61
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:39,654
Me too.
Good night.

62
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:47,656
Good night.
[Grunts]

63
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:04,579
You will now be cleansed
of your impurity.

64
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:12,581
[Groans]  Next.

65
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:23,425
[Whimpers]  Coast is clear.

66
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,683
Once the united forces
arrive

67
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,218
we need to be ready to help
in any way we can.

68
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,423
They're here.
[Gasps]

69
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:56,425
Whoops.
 Hmm.

70
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,535
Amon had to know
we were coming.

71
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:03,471
So why aren't
we meeting any resistance?

72
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,406
Wait a second.
Where are

73
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:13,408
the equalist airships?
 I don't see any

74
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:22,884
mecha-tanks either.
 Something's not right.

75
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:34,696
[Rumbling explosions]
 It's a trick!

76
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:50,618
Water and earthbenders
detonate those mines!

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,756
[Muffled explosions]
 What is that sound?

78
00:05:54,758 --> 00:06:02,758
[Low buzzing]
[Buzzing intensifies]

79
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:13,835
What now?
[Engines rumbling]

80
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,044
Where does Hiroshi
find the time

81
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:25,046
to keep inventing
new evil machines?

82
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:34,122
[Whistling]

83
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:14,971
Incoming!
[Screaming]

84
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:25,882
[Gasps] [Grunts]

85
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:35,291

86
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:51,207
[Deep breath] [Screams]

00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:10,966
Aaaah!

[Water bubbling]
[Gasps, coughs]

90
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:03,085
It's all right.
I've got you.

91
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:07,790
[Coughing] Avatar Korra...

92
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:15,792
You saved my life.
Thank you.

93
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,403
I was prepared to deal with
sato's mecha-tanks

94
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,405
but not these new
high-speed aircraft.

95
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,240
I know.
Every time we think

96
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:28,043
we have an advantage
Amon outsmarts us.

97
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:31,346
No matter what our plan is
he always has a better one.

98
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:32,581
Amon is winning so far
but we're not

99
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,318
out of the fight yet.
 I like this man's

100
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:44,320
confidence.
So how are we not

101
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:45,661
out of the fight?
 A second wave

102
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,929
of reinforcements
is on the way.

103
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,397
But I need to warn them.
Do you still have a way

104
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,865
to get a message out?
 I know just the man

105
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,767
for the job.
[Click]

106
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:52,868
And who is the recipient

107
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,770
of this top-secret message?
 Commander Bumi.

108
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,471
Second division
of the united forces.

109
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:58,006
[Knuckles cracking]
 Tenzin's brother?

110
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,608
Yes.
A bit of a wild man

111
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,643
but the bravest Commander
you'll ever meet.

112
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,946
Ready, sir!
 Fleet ambushed and destroyed

113
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,815
by equalist aircraft.
Retreat to red sand island

114
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,718
until my signal.
Do not approach city

115
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,191
until you receive the all-clear.
[Beeping]

116
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,961
Now comes the hard part.
We need to ground

117
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,395
those aircraft
otherwise Bumi's fleet

118
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,664
will never be able
to retake the city.

119
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,666
They flew in
from this direction.

120
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:26,436
The airfield must be somewhere
over this Mountain range.

121
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:33,109
Everyone get ready.
We leave at dawn.

122
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:41,084
It's time
to take down my father.

123
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,987
Wait.
I'm sorry, but I'm not

124
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,990
going with you tomorrow.
 What?

125
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:49,158
Why not?
 I'm sick and tired

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,028
of hiding from Amon.
It's time I face him.

127
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,632
That's not a good plan.
We need to stick together.

128
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm not waiting for him
to hunt me down.

129
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,802
My gut's telling me
it's time to end this.

130
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:04,173
On my terms.
 Korra, this is not a mission

131
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:06,910
you should be handling alone.
 She won't be.

132
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:09,445
I'm going with you.
 You don't

133
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:15,919
have to do that.
 Yes, I do.

134
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:19,555
[Sighs]  My grandfather would

135
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:27,557
respect the Avatar's instinct.
So will I.

136
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,502
Love you, little bro.
 Love you back, big bro.

137
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:37,774
[Sniffling]
 Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.

138
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:42,345
Be careful.
 I will.

139
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:45,048
Good luck.
If you're going

140
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,751
into the mountains
you should bring naga.

141
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:50,620
[Grunts]
 Take good care of bolin

142
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:56,225
for me.
 Asami.

143
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,628
I'm sorry things got
so messed up between us

144
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,862
but whatever happens today
I want you to know

145
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,465
how much I care about you.

146
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:10,467
I care about you too.

147
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:26,416
Good fortune and success
to you, Valiant heroes!

148
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:45,435
There's Amon!
 We need to get

149
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,585
into the temple.
Then, when he returns...

150
00:12:55,587 --> 00:13:03,026
We ambush him.
 What are you two

151
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:06,529
doing here?
 Uh

152
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,531
we were just transferred.
 Well, you're getting

153
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:13,169
transferred again.
Amon wants extra security

154
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,271
at the arena today.
 The arena? For what?

155
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,540
The rally.
You should have

156
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,544
been briefed about this.
 We'll be there, sir!

157
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:29,546
I know another way in.
 Let's hide in the attic.

158
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:48,304
Uh, we're not alone up here.
 Tarrlok?

159
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,274
I don't suppose
you're here to rescue me?

160
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,776
We had no idea
you were here.

161
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:56,446
Are there other prisoners
on the island?

162
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:59,048
No, I'm the only one.
 And what makes you

163
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,219
so special?
 I'm Amon's brother.

164
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:11,221
Both: [Gasp]

165
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:16,063
Amon is from

166
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,598
the northern water tribe.
He is a waterbender

167
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,899
and a bloodbender
just like I was.

168
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,400
What?!
 Did you know

169
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,002
this all along?
 No, not until

170
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:24,972
after he captured me.
 How did your brother

171
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:28,442
end up becoming Amon?
 It all began

172
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:32,446
with my father, Yakone...
With the help

173
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,915
of his former gang
he escaped prison

174
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:38,952
and underwent surgery
to change his appearance.

175
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,821
He assumed a new identity
and settled down

176
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:45,726
in the northern water tribe.
That's where he met my mother

177
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:52,933
a warm, caring woman.
Before long, they started

178
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:58,238
a family together.
[Laughs]

179
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,073
Amon was the firstborn
under the name Noatak.

180
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:03,010
I was born three years later.

181
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:08,115
Noatak was a good-natured kid
always looking out for me.

182
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,117
Those were the good years
before my brother and I

183
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:14,021
discovered
we were waterbenders.

184
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:16,423
At first, we were excited
by our new abilities

185
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:19,493
but our training brought out
a different side of my father.

186
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:22,329
Tarrlok!
You better shape up

187
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,231
or you'll be out here
in the cold all night

188
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,267
until you get it right.
 I'm trying, but...

189
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,603
try harder!
Your brother

190
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,339
was never this sloppy.
 Dad, he'll get it.

191
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,342
He just needs time.
 Don't talk back to me, son.

192
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:38,679
Ever!
 Even back then

193
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,347
my brother wanted everyone
to be treated

194
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:44,351
fairly and equally.
When I was seven

195
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:45,752
my father took me and Noatak
on a hunting trip

196
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:50,123
far away from our home.
He told us his true identity

197
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,960
was Yakone Republic city's

198
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:57,931
most notorious crime boss
and that he was once

199
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:02,536
a bloodbender of rare skill.
 What's bloodbending?

200
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:07,374
The most powerful and feared
form of bending in the world.

201
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:12,379
It was declared illegal
thanks to that coward, katara.

202
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:16,483
Our family has the strongest
line of bloodbenders in history.

203
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:17,918
You boys have this power
inside of you

204
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,455
and I will teach you
to master it.

205
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:24,057
What happened
to your bending, dad?

206
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,361
The Avatar stole it from me.

207
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:31,765
That's why I brought you
out here... to learn your destiny.

208
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,669
You two will become bloodbenders
of the highest order.

209
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:38,205
When the time is right
you will claim Republic city...

210
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,874
and you will
destroy the Avatar.

211
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:46,480
You must avenge me.
That is your purpose in life.

212
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:51,351
The good days
were behind us.

213
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:55,021
Every full moon
our father took us on

214
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,924
another supposed "hunting" trip
where he secretly trained us

215
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,894
in bloodbending.
We kept the truth

216
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:08,896
from our mother.
[Animal groans]

217
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,306
[Groaning]
 Stop! You're hurting it!

218
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,242
Toughen up, Tarrlok.
You'll need

219
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:22,983
a thicker skin for this.
[Animal groans]

220
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:29,589
Very good, son.
Very good.

221
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,826
A few years later
my father taught us

222
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,227
to bloodbend anytime
without the need

223
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:37,631
of the full moon.
We practiced constantly

224
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:43,069
and I hated every minute of it.

225
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:51,071
[Growling, barking] [Whining]

226
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,851
I had no stomach for
manipulating helpless animals.

227
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,820
My brother, however
seemed to revel

228
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:05,692
in his newfound power.
[lnhales]

229
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:08,261
[Whining]  He was a prodigy

230
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:10,197
mastering my father's
psychic bloodbending technique

231
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:18,199
by the time he was 14.
[Whining]

232
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:27,775
[Gasps]
 That's the way it's done.

233
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:37,457
That's what you need
to strive for.

234
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,859
Even though Noatak
was my father's favorite

235
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,628
it wasn't any easier for him.

236
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,796
He carried the burden
of all Yakone's

237
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:49,536
expectations and demands.
Something changed

238
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:53,940
in Noatak over the years.
The loving brother I once knew

239
00:18:53,942 --> 00:19:01,281
became cold and detached.
[Thunder rumbling]

240
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:02,382
Our father pushed us
to extremes

241
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:04,784
and one day he made us

242
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:11,258
bloodbend each other.
 Noatak, go.

243
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:18,632
[Inhales] [Groans]

244
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:26,634
[Screams]  Excellent.

245
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:34,347
Uhh!
[Panting]

246
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,417
Tarrlok!
Your turn.

247
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,986
No, I won't do it.
 Bloodbend your brother

248
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:42,455
Tarrlok!
 That felt awful!

249
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,591
I don't want to
do that to anyone!

250
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,726
I never want to
bloodbend again!

251
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:51,598
You're a disgrace
a weakling.

252
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,767
I'll teach you a lesson
you insubordinate...

253
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:59,806
unh!
 Stay away from him.

254
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,609
How dare you bloodbend me!
 What are you going

255
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:05,478
to do about it?
You're the weak one.

256
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,716
Unh! Aah!
 You always say bloodbending

257
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:10,750
is the most powerful thing
in the world

258
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:15,288
but it isn't...
the Avatar is.

259
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,091
He took your bending away.
What could be

260
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:23,129
more powerful than that?
 I made you what you are!

261
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:27,000
You're mine!
 We're your sons

262
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:31,104
not your tools of revenge!
Let's go.

263
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,106
We can run away
from him, forever.

264
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,775
Run away?
But what about mom?

265
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:40,280
We can't just leave her.
 He was right about you.

266
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:46,219
You are a weakling.
Hunh!

267
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:50,056
[Groans]  Noatak!

268
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:58,058
Don't leave, please!
Noatak!

269
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,467
My father and I searched
for days

270
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,937
but we never found
a sign of Noatak.

271
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:06,906
We thought he perished
in that storm.

272
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:13,413
My mother was never the same
after the loss of my brother.

273
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,183
My father stopped training me.
With Noatak gone

274
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:18,952
his hopes for revenge withered
and he passed away

275
00:21:18,954 --> 00:21:26,954
a few years later.
 That's one of the saddest

276
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:34,234
stories I've ever heard.
 Avatar Korra

277
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:36,169
I am truly sorry for all that

278
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,471
I did to you.
I thought I was better

279
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,973
than my father but his ghost

280
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,676
still shaped me.
I became a soldier

281
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,210
of revenge
just like he wanted me

282
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:50,483
to be and so did my brother.

283
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,752
The revolution
may be built on a lie

284
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:55,221
but I think Amon truly believes
bending is the source

285
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:58,992
of all evil in the world.
 How did you figure out

286
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:02,896
Amon is your brother?
 When he took my bending

287
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,865
the sensation
was somehow familiar.

288
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,502
I later recognized it as
my brother's bloodbending grip.

289
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,204
So he somehow
uses bloodbending

290
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:16,009
to take people's bending?
 I don't know how

291
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:17,777
he does it, but then again
I've never encountered a bender

292
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,346
as strong as Noatak.
 How in the world

293
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:23,717
do we beat him?
 We can't.

294
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,387
Any attack we throw at him
he'll redirect with his mind.

295
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,656
That's how he's been able
to challenge any bender.

296
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:33,059
So much for our ambush.
If we stay here, we're toast.

297
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,294
But there's another way
to beat him.

298
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:36,229
How?
 This whole time

299
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,265
Amon has been
one step ahead of us.

300
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,668
But finally we have
the advantage...

301
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,137
we know the truth about him.
If we expose him

302
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,572
as a bender in front of all

303
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,174
his supporters...
 At the rally...

304
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:49,976
We could take away
his true power.

305
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:53,513
And undermine
this whole revolution!

306
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:59,586
Thank you for your help.
We can't just

307
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,756
leave him here.
 Go. Amon can't know

308
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:06,059
anyone spoke with me.
Defeat him.

309
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:14,061
Put an end
to this sad story. V

310
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:37,064
I think we found
our secret airfield.

311
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,473
Bolin, once we get down there

312
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,976
I need you to tear up
those runways.

313
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,011
We can't let those aircraft
take off.

314
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:48,448
Aye-aye, captain...
ooh, general. General.

315
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,718
[Naga whimpers]
All right, you guys wait here

316
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,554
until we get back, okay?
Uh-uh.

317
00:23:54,556 --> 00:24:01,761
Stay.
[Naga whimpers]

318
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:02,795
Why would there be fence
posts

319
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:10,797
but no fence?

 Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion.

[Cheering]

323
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,236
When I was a boy
a firebender struck down

324
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:55,237
my entire family
and left me scarred.

325
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,171
That tragic event
began my quest

326
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:03,339
to equalize the world.
 That's a lie, Amon.

327
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,240
Or should I call you "Noatak"?

328
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,374
You want her taken out?
 No.

329
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,509
Everyone, calm down.
We have nothing to fear

330
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,343
from the Avatar.
Let's hear

331
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:20,478
what she has to say.
 Amon has been lying

332
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,212
to you.
The spirits

333
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:24,546
didn't give him the power
to take people's bending away.

334
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:27,447
He uses bloodbending to do it.

335
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:30,515
Amon is a waterbender.
[Crowd murmuring]

336
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,850
What is this nonsense?
 You're desperate, Avatar.

337
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:40,118
Making up stories about me
is a pathetic last resort.

338
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,285
Your family wasn't killed
by a firebender.

339
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,320
His father was Yakone
and his brother

340
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,387
is councilman Tarrlok.
[Crowd murmuring]

341
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,288
[Chuckles] An amusing tale.

342
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,189
But I will show you the truth.

343
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,257
[Crowd gasps]
This is what a firebender

344
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,559
did to me.
 What?

345
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,994
The Avatar is lying!
 I'm telling you

346
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:18,365
he's a waterbender.
They don't believe me.

347
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,367
It didn't work.
 We said what we had to.

348
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,538
Let's get out of here.
 I wouldn't leave yet

349
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,042

You'll miss the main event.

[Whirring] [Grunting]

351
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:42,089
No.
They got away.

352
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:48,629
We saw them get away.
[Footsteps approaching]

353
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:52,466
Asami.
Asami, I know I have hurt you

354
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:56,403
and I am sorry.
But I believe that one day

355
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:57,938
you will come to your senses
and we can be a family again.

356
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,541
Are you insane?
How can we be a family

357
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,243
after everything you've done?
Mom would hate you

358
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:07,614
for what you've become.
 How dare you!

359
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:09,983
I am avenging her death!
 The airplanes are ready

360
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:13,187
for takeoff, sir.
 Good.

361
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,155
Annihilate the fleet.
Both: [Gasp]

362
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:19,092
That's right, general.
I intercepted your message

363
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,595
to Commander Bumi.
I know exactly

364
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:26,133
where they're hiding.
 How are we gonna

365
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:28,569
get out of here?
 I don't suppose

366
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:36,571
you know how to metalbend?
 That is a negative, sir.

367
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:47,648
Naga, over here.
[Naga roars]

368
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,197
Who needs a metalbender?
We got naga! Yeah!

369
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:00,267
I'm going after
those airplanes.

370
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:08,269
Whoa! No, naga!
[Gas hissing]

371
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,613
Huh, what do you know.
Just like

372
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:20,615
a future industries forklift.
[Screams]

00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:36,670
[Gear clicks propeller whirs]

374
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,538
Aah!
 Tonight, I rid the world

375
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,408
of airbending...
Forever.

376
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,678
[Crowd cheering]
 Amon, let them go.

377
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,746
You're welcome
to come down here

378
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:48,315
and try to stop me.
 He's trying to bait you.

379
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:53,320
I don't care.
We have to save them.

380
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:54,588
The Avatar
needs to be reminded

381
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:02,590
of the power I possess.
[Crowd screaming]

382
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:14,641
[Grunting]
 Where are Pema and the baby?

383
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:18,111
In prison.
 Beifong?

384
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:24,418
I don't know.
[Grunting]

385
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:31,892
Aah!
 Follow me, kids.

386
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:43,832
Get them out of here.
We'll create a diversion.

387
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,336
Let's go get your mother
and the baby.

388
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:47,338
Prison break!
[Exhales]

[Exhales] [Screams]

00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:52,237

[Grunting] [Groans]

392
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:04,710
[Grunting]  No!

393

Korra!
[Gasps]

394
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:22,866
I told you
I would destroy you.

395
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:54,193
[Suspenseful music]  Aah!

396
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:26,525
[Screams] [Whistling]

397
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:56,511
Thanks for
looking out for me, aang.

398
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:05,573
[Grunting]  Whoa!

399
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Whoa!
Thanks, naga.

400
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:32,106
Asami!
What do you think

401
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:34,775
you're doing?
You are aiding the very people

402
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:37,144
who took your mother away!
 You don't feel love

403
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:41,915
for mom anymore.
You're too full of hatred.

404
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:49,917
You ungrateful
insolent child.

405
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,601
[Grunts] Aah!

406
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:11,445
I now see there is no chance
to save you!

407
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:14,248
Aah!
[Grunts]

408
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:21,955
Mr. sato, you are
a horrible father!

409
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:29,957
Aah!

410
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:45,640
You really are
a horrible father.

411
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:53,687
Aah!
[Groans]

412
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:59,193
[Naga whimpers]  Finally

413
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:07,195
you are powerless.
[Grunting]

414
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:13,340
[Struggling]  Amon!

415
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:16,143
Everything the Avatar said
is true, isn't it?

416
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:24,145
I just saw you bloodbend her.

417
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:31,391
You traitor.
I dedicated my life to you.

418
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:39,393
[Grunting]
 You served me well

419
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:47,501
Lieutenant.

00:35:55,684 --> 00:36:03,684
[Screaming]  Mako...

421
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:23,143
My bending...
 Everything

422
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,745
will be all right.
We just need

423
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:32,747
to get out of here.
[Grunting]

424
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:38,358
I'm impressed.
No one has ever gotten

425
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,096
the better of me like that.
[Grunting]

426
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:44,698
It is almost a shame
to take the bending

427
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:50,103
of someone so talented.
Almost.

428
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,105
[Gasps] No!

429
00:36:57,446 --> 00:37:03,383
[Grunts]  Impossible...

430
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:09,222
I-I can airbend?
I can airbend!

431
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:14,561
Hunh! Ha!
Ha! Hunh!

432
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:22,563
Aah!

00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:32,807
No... You...
Don't!

Aah!
[Crowd gasps]

435
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,252
Did you see what happened?
Who was that?

436
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:44,257
[Crowd murmuring]
 Can you see him?

437
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:46,693
[Crowd gasps]
 Could that be...?

You bending tyrant!
 Evil Avatar!

439
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:58,099
What did you do to our
leader?

440
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:06,273
[Gasps]  He's waterbending.

441
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,415
What?
 He is a bender!

442
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,817
The scar is fake!
 The Avatar

443
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:18,819
was telling the truth!
[Suspenseful music]

444
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:35,803
Noatak.
 It's over, brother.

445
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:52,459
I'm sorry for what
I had to do to you.

446
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:55,495
[Sighs]  Our father

447
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:57,130
set us on this path.
Fate caused us to collide.

448
00:38:57,132 --> 00:39:00,233
I should have left with you
when we were boys.

449
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:02,836
[Lock rattles]
 Leave with me now.

450
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:06,907
We have a second chance.
We can start over together.

451
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:14,909
Please, you're all I have left
in the world.

452
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:20,554
I can't believe
Amon got you too.

453
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:24,558
Hey, at least you unlocked
your airbending.

454
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,828
Bro, not the time.
 Right, right.

455
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,297
I'll just stand over here.
Quietly.

456
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:38,299
In silence.
 You saved Republic city.

457
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:45,178
But Amon got away.
 Yay!

458
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,217
Uncle Bumi's here!
 Wa-hoo!

459
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:53,086
[Claps]  Great.

460
00:39:53,088 --> 00:40:01,088
Now I have
to entertain my brother.

461
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,569
The two of us
together again.

462
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:13,773
There's nothing we can't do.
 Yes, Noatak.

463
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:18,512
Noatak...
[Chuckles]

464
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:21,081
I'd almost forgotten
the sound of my own name.

465
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:29,083
[Melancholy music]
 It will be just like

466
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:43,964
the good old days.

[Oogi snoring]
[Door sliding open]

468
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:11,141
I've tried everything
in my power

469
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:17,080
but I cannot
restore Korra's bending.

470
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:18,615
But you're the best healer
in the world.

471
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,251
You have to keep trying!
 I'm sorry.

472
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:25,021
There's nothing else I can do.
Korra can still airbend

473
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:26,523
but her connection
to the other elements

474
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:34,525
has been severed.

475
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:44,874
 It's going to be all right, Korra.
 No, it's not.

476
00:41:57,876 --> 00:42:00,876
[Somber music]  Korra, wait.

477
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:04,394
Go away.
 I will

478
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,131
but I just want you to know
I'm here for you.

479
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,733
No, I mean go away
back to Republic city.

480
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:13,503
Get on with your life.
 What are you

481
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:15,038
talking about?
 I'm not

482
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,140
the Avatar anymore.
You don't need to do me

483
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:20,510
any favors.
 I don't care if you're

484
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:25,114
the Avatar or not.
Listen...

485
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:26,883
When Tarrlok took you
I was losing my mind

486
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:29,686
at the thought
of never seeing you again.

487
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:35,124
I realized...
I love you, Korra.

488
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:37,026
I...
I can't.

489
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:45,028
Korra!
 We need to be patient

490
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:50,673
with her.
It will take time for her

491
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:58,675
to accept what has happened.
[Naga panting]

492
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:26,203
[Sobbing]  Not now, Tenzin.

493
00:43:35,353 --> 00:43:37,754
I just want to be left alone.

494
00:43:37,756 --> 00:43:43,793
But you called me here.
 Aang.

495
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:46,229
You have finally connected
with your spiritual self.

496
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,565
How?
 When he hit

497
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,066
our lowest point we are open

498
00:43:50,068 --> 00:43:58,068
to the greatest change.

500
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:53,282
I love you too.

501
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,307
Thank you.

502
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:43,332
