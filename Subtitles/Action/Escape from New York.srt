1
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,900
The Crime Rate in the United States
Rises Four Hundred Percent.

2
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Manhattan Island

3
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
The once-great city of New York

4
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,800
becomes the one maximum-security prison
for the entire country.

5
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,900
A fifty-foot containment wall
is erected along the New Jersey shoreline,...

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,200
across the Harlem river,
and down along the Brooklyn shoreline.

7
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,100
It completely surrounds Manhattan Island.

8
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
All bridges and waterways are mined.

9
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,400
The United States Police Force, like an army,
is encamped around the island.

10
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,400
There are no guards inside the prison:

11
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
only prisoners and the worlds
they have made.

12
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,400
The rules are simple.
Once you go in, you don't come out.

13
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.

14
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
I have an escape in progress.

15
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

16
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,200
EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND -- NIGHT

17
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,200
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.
Start back to the island.

18
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

19
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,400
Circled the base.  Over.

20
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Security, this is Rehme.
We have confirmation from Gotham 4.

21
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,200
We have a kill in midharbor.
South of the battery.
Two in the water dead.

22
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Two confirmed.

23
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Very well.

24
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .

25
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,100


26
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
"No talking.  No smoking.
Follow the ORANGE line."

27
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,200
Attention.  You are now entering
the debarkation area.

28
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
No talking.  No
smoking.

29
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Follow the orange line to the processes area.

30
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,900
The next scheduled departure to
the prison is in two hours.

31
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,900
You now have the option to terminate
and be cremated on the premises

32
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,600
If you elect this option, notify the
duty sergeant in your processingarea.

33
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Hold on!

34
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,200
We've got a small jet in trouble,
over restricted air space.

35
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,900
- Where is it?
- Seven miles out and closing.

36
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,400
We've been on the board
for the last twenty minutes.
We haven't been able to reach them.

37
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
There was a transmission ten minutes ago.

38
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,500
He identified as "David 14."
Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

39
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,900
David 14, acknowledge.

40
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.

41
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,200
Squawk 7700,

42
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,700
contact on 121.5.

43
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
There's still no reply.

44
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,300
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

45
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,100
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

46
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
- You have the code?
- There's no David 14 on the computer.

47
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
- Unlisted?
- Unregistered code.

48
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,700
We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply.

49
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,900
I think I've got him, sir.

50
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
It's too late, assholes.

51
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,700
All your imperialist weapons and lies can't
save him now.

52
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,500
We're going down.  We're going to crash.

53
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
David 14, acknowledge!

54
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
The code's coming in, sir.

55
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,400
"Aircraft Identified.

56
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,200
Code: David14.

57
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,600
Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

58
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,000
Tell this to the workers when
they ask where your leader went . . .

59
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,100
We, the soldiers of the national
liberation front of America,

60
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
in the name of the workers

61
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,400
and all the oppressed of
this imperialist country

62
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,000
have struck a fatal blow to
the racist police stick!

63
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,300
What better revolutionary example
than to let the president perish

64
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
in the inhuman dungeon of
his own imperialist prison?

65
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,500
Unlock the pod!
She's bolted the door.

66
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,600
- Can't you shoot off the lock?
- No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

67
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,900
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

68
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,900
No, sir.

69
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
Get me to the pod.

70
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,200


71
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you
if you become separated from the pod.

72
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm activating it now.

73
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,100
God save me and watch over you all.

74
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

75
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
The plane goes down.

76
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
It's the escape pod.

77
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
40 degrees,

78
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,900
50 yards from impact.

79
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,700
I'm going in.

80
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000


81
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,400
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.

82
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
We're moving down.

83
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,400
Direct sight ahead.

84
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,900
You touch me... he dies.

85
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,600
If you're not in the air
in thirty seconds...he dies.

86
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,400
You come back in... he dies.

87
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,000
- Twenty seconds.
- I'm ready to talk.

88
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,300
19...18...

89
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,300
- What do you want?
- 17...16...

90
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,200
Let's go.  Let's go!

91
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.

92
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,700
This is Bob Hauk.

93
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,100
We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll
kill him.

94
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,400
We're lucky if he's not dead already...

95
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,300
They don't want anything yet.By the time they
figure out what they want,it'll be too late.

96
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,400
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

97
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,200
We can't wait until tomorrow. If we have to move
in and take the island, it's a last resort.

98
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,800
It's 8:45. I want permission to try a
rescue.

99
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,100
Thank you.

100
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
All right.

101
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,900
- He's dangerous sir.
- I know. I'll be ok.

102
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

103
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,700
Call me Snake.

104
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,600
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.

105
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.

106
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,800
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.

107
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,600
.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.

108
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,500
You robbed the federal reserve depository.

109
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,800
Life sentence, New York
Maximum Security Penitentiary.

110
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

111
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
- Who are you?
- Hauk

112
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,000
Police Commissioner.

113
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,200
Bob Hauk.

114
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,700
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.
We heard of you, too, Plissken.

115
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,600
- Why are we talking?
- I have a deal for you.

116
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,900
You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

117
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,800
There was an accident about an hour ago.
A small jet went down inside New York City.

118
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,400
The President was on board.

119
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,400
President of what?

120
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,100
That's not funny, Plissken.

121
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,700
You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours,

122
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,300
- and you're a free man.
- 24 hours, huh?

123
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
- I'm making you an offer.
- Bullshit.

124
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,100
- Straight just like I said.
- I'll think about it.

125
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,200
No time.  Give me an answer.

126
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,300
Get a new president.

127
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,700
We're still at war, Plissken.
We need him alive.

128
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,100
I don't give a fuck about your war...
or your president.

129
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
- Is that your answer?
- I'm thinking about it.

130
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
Think hard.

131
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,400
Why me?

132
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,800
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.

133
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,700
You know how to get in quiet.

134
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,800
You're all I've got.

135
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
I guess I go in one way or the other.
Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me the paper.

136
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,100
- When you come out.
- Before.

137
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

138
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,200
Call me Snake.

139
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,800
Some of them have cars. They took old junkers
that were left behind and converted them to steam.

140
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,400
We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.

141
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,800
Greenhouses, rigged up generators.
Some areas have streetlights.

142
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,500
The crazies.

143
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,500
Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.

144
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,100
They're night raiders.

145
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,500
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal
for fifteen minutes.

146
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,200
You push it, we can track you on radar.
Just like Leningrad.

147
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
But they added something.  A
safety catch.

148
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Where am I landing?

149
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,200
Top of the world trade center.
Only place you can land.

150
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,300
They won't see it, and you can t
ake off from a free fall.

151
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,100
On the roof there's a
service elevator.

152
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,300
It's still operational.
We use it to infiltrate the prison.

153
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,100
There's a power box.
It'll activate the elevator down to fifty.

154
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,700
From there on down you walk.

155
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,000
You can locate the President by
his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.

156
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,200
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

157
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,100
Homing device.
Shows directions and distance.

158
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria
and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

159
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,600
- Take off the jacket.
- I'll be OK.

160
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,100
Let's go, Plissken.

161
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't like needles.

162
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes,
fifty-seven seconds...

163
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,100
We talked about twenty-four.

164
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,500
In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit
meeting will be over.

165
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,200
China and the Soviet Union
will go back home.

166
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,500
The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

167
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,700
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.

168
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,500
The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

169
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,300
What's on it?

170
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

171
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,300
All right.

172
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,700
It's about the survival of
the human race, Plissken.

173
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,700
Something you don't give a shit about.

174
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to inject you.
It'll sting for a second or two...

175
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,100
That's it, Plissken.

176
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,800
Tell him.

177
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,000
Tell me what?

178
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,400
That idea you had about turning
the Gullfire around 180 degrees

179
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,600
and flying off to Canada.

180
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
What did you do to me, asshole?

181
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,800
My idea, Plissken.

182
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Something we've been fooling around with. Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.

183
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,600
They're already starting
to dissolve.

184
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
In twenty-two hours, the cores
will completely dissolve.

185
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,100
Inside the cores are
that heat-sensitive charge.

186
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Not a large explosive.

187
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,900
About the size of a pinhead.

188
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,300
big enough to --
open up both your arteries.

189
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,500
I'd say you'd be dead
in ten or fifteen seconds --

190
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,100
- TAKE THEM OUT NOW.
- They're protected by the cores.

191
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,600
minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

192
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,700
We'll burn out the charges IF
you have the President.

193
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
What if I'm a little late?

194
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,300
No more Hartford Summit.
And no more Snake Plissken.

195
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,700
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

196
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
The Gullfire's waiting.

197
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm ready.

198
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
21 hours.

199
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.

200
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,600
If I come back without him,
you'll burn these things out?

201
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Get them both back, Plissken.

202
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Remember, once inside you're on your own

203
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,100
- Oh, you mean I can't count on you?
- No.

204
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,600
Good.

205
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,500
"Master Life Clock"

206
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,800
20:17:43... 42... 41....

207
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
30 seconds.

208
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,900
Are you picking up the target blip?

209
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900


210
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Right on course.

211
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,500
It's been a while . . .

212
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,900
How's your altitude?

213
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,300


214
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Plissken?

215
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,800
Plissken?
Plissken, what are you doing?

216
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,400
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

217
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,900


218
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,000


219
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Plissken? Plissken?

220
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm inside the World Trade Center
on the 50th floor.

221
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,700
- Just like Leningrad, Hauk.
- Is the glider intact?

222
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,300
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.
I'll work it out.

223
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,700
You'll have to use the east stairwell.
It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

224
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,100
Call me when you get outside.

225
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm at the plane.

226
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,400
Nobody else made it, Hauk.

227
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,700
Wait a minute.

228
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,300
I've got his pulse.

229
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Right up ahead, moving northwest.

230
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,100
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

231
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,900
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

232
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,200
I thought you were dead!

233
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,200
Hey!  You don't want to
walk around down there, Snake!

234
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,800
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.

235
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,800
Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

236
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,200
Easy now, chief.

237
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm walking.  I'm walking.

238
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Mr. President . . .

239
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm the President?
Sure, I'm the President.

240
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,500
If I knew where I got this thing --
I'd be the President.

241
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,800
- Where did you get it?
- I woke up, and there it was,
just like a miracle . . .

242
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,800
The President's life signs all fail.

243
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,100
Oh my god . . .

244
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,600
It . . . It may be just an impact
on the mechanism itself . . .

245
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
Hauk?

246
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm right here, Plissken.

247
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,100
I don't know who you assholes are l
ooking at, but it's NOT the President.

248
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,800
Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . .

249
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,400
All right, get your machine ready.
I'm coming out.

250
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,600
18 hours, Plissken.

251
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:08,300
Listen to me, Hauk. The President is
DEAD, you got that? Somebody's
had him for dinner!

252
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,600
Plissken, if you get back in that
glider I'll shoot you down.

253
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,000
You climb out, I'll burn you off the wall.

254
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
You understand that, Plissken?

255
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,000
A little human compassion . . .

256
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
- You a cop?
- No.

257
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
You've got a gun.

258
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,000
You got a smoke?

259
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,100
Keep your hand over it.

260
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,000
It's all right if we're quiet.
They won't hear us.

261
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,900
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

262
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,500
What's going on out there?

263
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,400
Crazies.

264
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,400
It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

265
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,000
Do you live here?

266
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,300
Skulls?  You kidding?
I'm with the Turks now.

267
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,700
I just got caught in the street after
dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

268
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,200
- A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?
- No.

269
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
Shit.

270
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,600
- You're a cop.
- I'm an asshole.

271
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,400
Hey, wait a minute.

272
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,000
I know who you are.

273
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,400
Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

274
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,900
I am.

275
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,600
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!
What you doing in here with a gun, Snake?

276
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Looking for somebody.

277
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,300
- Who?
- The President.

278
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,800
Come on!  He really here?

279
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Somewhere.

280
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,000
When you find him,

281
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,300
are you gonna take him out?

282
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,000
Take me out with you, Snake.

283
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,500
Why?

284
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I can think of lots of reasons why . . .

285
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,100
Where you goin', buddy?

286
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,500
Bad neighborhood, Snake!
You don't want to be walking
from the Bowery to 42nd street at night!

287
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,200
I've been driving a cab here
for 30 years and I'm telling you,
you don't walk around here at night!

288
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,900
Yes, sir!

289
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,300
They'll kill you and strip
you in ten seconds flat.

290
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,800
Usually I'm not down around here myself,
but I wanted to catch that show.

291
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

292
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,400
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?
I didn't even know they caught you.

293
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.

294
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,500
Wait'll I tell Eddie!

295
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,000
Hey, hang on, Snake.

296
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,600
- Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?
- Looking for somebody.

297
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Well, why didn't you ask me?
Hell, I know everybody in this town.

298
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I've been driving this cab for
thirty years, this very same cab.

299
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,300
I'm GONNA ask you.

300
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,200
Now where's the President?

301
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,800
The Duke's got him!
Everyone knows the Duke's got him!

302
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,100
You don't have to put a gun to my head.
I'll tell you!

303
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,400
- Who's the Duke?
- The DUKE!

304
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,000
The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!
The big man, that's who!

305
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,900
I want to meet this Duke.

306
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,300
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?
Nobody wants to meet the Duke!

307
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,400
You meet him once and then you're dead!

308
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,800
I hate to leave her on the street.

309
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,300
Usually I don't leave her alone at all.

310
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,500
But you're a special case, Snake.

311
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,700
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.
You can relax.

312
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Thanks.

313
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,900
Boy, they got a great place here.
Like a fortress!

314
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,800
They?

315
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,300
- Who is it?
- It's me!

316
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,400
- Who's me?
- Cabbie!

317
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,700
What do you want?

318
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,000
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

319
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,100
- No way, Cabbie --
- No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

320
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,400
Snake Plissken.

321
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,700
YOU'RE Plissken?

322
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,900
He wants to see Brain.

323
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Why?

324
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,500
I want to meet the Duke.

325
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,700
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?
It used to be a public library.

326
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,200
Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!

327
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,700
Mr. Fabulous!

328
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,800
Duke loves him.

329
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,400
- Who is that?
- That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.

330
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,900
Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy . . .

331
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
. . .see what I mean?

332
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Heard you were dead.

333
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,100
Brain?  Brain!
I brought somebody to see you!

334
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,100
Harold Hellman.

335
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,300
Snake?

336
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,700
Harold?

337
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,900
Where you been, Harold?
It's been a long time.

338
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,400
You never told me you
knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

339
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:28,300
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use
some gas if you can spare some . . .

340
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,100
I'm glad you remember me.

341
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah.  A man should remember his past.

342
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Kansas City, four years ago.
You ran out on me.

343
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,100
- You left me sitting there.
- You were late.

344
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,000
We were buddies, Harold.

345
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,200
You, me, and Fresno Bob.
You know what they did to Bob?

346
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,400
You want to see him sprayed
all over that map, baby?
Where's the President?!

347
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,400
- Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --
- Don't fuck with me!

348
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,700
- Why do you want to know?
- I want him.

349
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,300
- Working for the man now, huh?
- Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

350
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is

351
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,200
and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY w
here he is you'll never find him.

352
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,700
Listen, I'll take you out of here.

353
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.

354
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,000
And all you gotta do is get me to him.

355
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,800
No kidding?  On the level?

356
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,300
Will you take me, too?

357
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,700
- We've got to deal somewhere else.
- No glider.

358
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,000
We've got the President.  And the Duke's
taking everybody out of here.

359
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,000
Never happen.

360
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,100
See, I know something
you and the Duke don't know.

361
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,700
.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President
don't mean a whole lot.

362
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,500
- You're lying.
- Maybe he's not . . .

363
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,800
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

364
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,300
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.

365
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,000
So I might as well have some fun
and keep looking by myself.

366
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,800
Brain, he'll kill us both
if you don't tell him --
Brain, you've got to tell him --

367
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,500
ALL RIGHT!!!

368
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,900
You always were smart, Harold.

369
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Just one thing right now.

370
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,500
Don't call me "Harold."

371
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,200
So you work for this Duke, huh?

372
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,800
Yeah.

373
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,100
Make gas for him.
Figure out things for him.

374
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,100
Like what?

375
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,300
Like how to get across
the 69th street bridge --

376
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,800
it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

377
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,500
We got a diagram from a guy
that got all the way across . . .

378
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,800
. . . beforethey shot the poor bastard.

379
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,400
We got a crew up there now clearing
the way across the first barricade.

380
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,400
What a sight, Snake!

381
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:10,100
The whole camp rolling
right across the bridge and
the President right out front!

382
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,800
Oh, that would have been so fine . . .

383
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,100
Yeah, it would have been . . .

384
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,300
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

385
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,200
That's the Duke!  I know the
sound of his engines.

386
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,900
Don't cross the Duke

387
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,400
-- everybody knows that.

388
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,600
-- everybody knows that.

389
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,200
No, Brain!

390
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,200
- He's looking for you, Brain
- What does he want?

391
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
He wants my diagram of the bridge.

392
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,800
When he finds out I'm with you he's
going to want my life!  Shit, Plissken,
I knew I shouldn't have listened to you --

393
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,300
We've got to get to the President NOW,
while he's busy.

394
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,700
Forget it, he's on the other
side of town and we got no wheels.
The deal is off --

395
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Just calm down.

396
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,900
I think they saw us!
Turn left, turn left here!

397
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,700
Brain. This is Broadway.

398
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,000
- I know, I know, the Duke'll take
Seventh Avenue, Broadway is fiveminutes --
- No!!!

399
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,900
Yes!!!  Just keep driving!

400
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,100
What's wrong with Broadway?

401
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,900
Come on sweetheart . .

402
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,500
Maggie!

403
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,200
Hold on.

404
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,100
He'll be in the third car from
the end, by the last campfire.

405
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,300
It's all right.
He's got to go in the front way.
It'll take him five minutes.

406
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,900
If you're not back to the car
in four minutes you're on your own.

407
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,400
When we get there,
Harold, you just keep talking.

408
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,600
Hi, guys.

409
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,400
Hi . . . how's it going?
Cooled off a little, huh?

410
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,800
What do you want, Brain?

411
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,500
Duke told us to wait inside.
He's on his way here now.

412
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,500
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

413
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,000
Well, you can't expect him to tell
everybody in the joint, now can you?
That's why he's the Duke.

414
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,300
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

415
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,600
Why don't we wait inside for him?

416
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,600
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

417
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,800
What are your specific orders, by the way?

418
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,600
Specific orders, Brain, was for
me not to let no one go inside.

419
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,700
How's the President holding up, by the way?

420
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,500
Any political discussion
you've had with him?

421
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,200
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.

422
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,300
He's always sniffing around like a dog.

423
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,300
He comes up with the gas.

424
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,500
What are you looking at?

425
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Are you from the outside?

426
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,500
- Stop shaking.
- I can't!  Who are you?

427
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,600
- Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast
- Move fast?

428
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,800
- You're goddamned right I'll move fast.
- Quiet!

429
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,800
They got him.  Now watch him.

430
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,500
Friend of yours, Brain?

431
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,500
He had a gun on me, Duke,
there was nothing I could do.

432
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,200
Who are you?

433
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,100
I said who are you?

434
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Snake Plissken, Duke.
he Man sent him in here.

435
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,000
Something's going down
. . . we need him.

436
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,100
Snaaaaaake Plissken.

437
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,600
I've heard of you.

438
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,000
I heard you were dead.

439
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,200
This is surveillance 4 to security control.

440
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,400
Nothing on the infrared body scan.

441
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,600
There aren't any fires on the street.

442
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,300
Nobody moving down here.

443
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,600
Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . .

444
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,800
negative on infrared body
scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . .

445
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,100
nothing strange going on down there.

446
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,100
- We've got to go in now.
- We hold.

447
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,200
- You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.
- This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

448
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,300
I override all that!

449
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,800
Just try.

450
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,100
...still negative on the scan.

451
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,200
This is Surveillance 4
to Security Control.

452
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,900
Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

453
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,700
Surveillance 10.
Still negative on the scan.

454
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,900
Surveillance 5 still negative.

455
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,800
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.
Nothing on the infrared body scan.
Negative...

456
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,300
Don't move, Snake.

457
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,300
I want that diagram, Brain.

458
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,400
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.

459
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,000
Duke, that Plissken said
something about a time limit.

460
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,100
- What time limit
- On him.

461
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,200
That's a lot of crap.

462
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,600
That's a lot of crap.

463
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,300
You... You are...
the Duke of New... New York...

464
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
You're... A-Number-One.

465
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,000
I can't hear you.

466
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,600
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK...
YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

467
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,000
Get me the diagram.

468
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,200
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.
We need him.

469
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,500
Get moving, Brain.

470
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,000
People out below in the park.
Can you see them?

471
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,500
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.

472
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,800
We're getting that readout,
mostly in the infrared.

473
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,900
We have a visual sighting on it.

474
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,500
It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.

475
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,400
They're waving at us.
Signaling us in the food drop area.

476
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,400
They're waving us down.

477
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,900
I still can't figure out whether
that son of a bitch Plissken
was telling the truth or not.

478
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
God, I hate that guy.

479
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,700
He got in somehow.

480
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah, yeah, but how?

481
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
You gotta land the glider and take off.
You can't do it in Central Park,
there's too many trees.

482
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,000
Port Authority's too low to the ground.

483
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,000
Unless it was some......
Someplace high up.

484
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,100
World Trade Center.  That's it.

485
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,700
There we go. The
World Trade Center.

486
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,300
And it's gonna be a hell of
a lot easier for me to take off
than it was for him to land.

487
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,900
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City
in exchange for President.

488
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,500
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.

489
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,500
No bullshit or he's dead."

490
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
- Where's the tape?
- Not here.

491
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,700
They're Plissken's.

492
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,400
So much for your man, Hauk?

493
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,100
Warm up the choppers.
We're moving in.

494
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,400
Plissken?

495
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,800
Come on, get up!

496
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,300
They sent in their best man.

497
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,200
And when we roll down the 69th
street bridge tomorrow

498
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,400
on our way to freedom,...

499
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,600
we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

500
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,200
On the hood of my car!

501
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,200
On the hood of my car!

502
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,800
Hello.
Where'd you get the hat?

503
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,000
- Got it from Cabbie.
- Yeah?

504
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,700
- Traded him.
- For what?

505
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,700
- What are you so nervous about?
- I'm here to see the President.

506
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,800
- Who says?
- The Duke.

507
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,300
- No he doesn't.
- Well... I'll have to
tell him you said that.

508
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,900
Wait a minute.  Why?

509
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,400
He's got something hidden
in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

510
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,400
- What?
- I'll show you.

511
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,000
- You'll tell me.
- Cyanide capsules.

512
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,000
The Duke don't want a dead president.

513
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,900
Gentlemen.

514
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,200
Mr. President.

515
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,500


516
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,400
Cyanide?

517
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,600
Yeah.  He might try to take it tomorrow.

518
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,400
That's bullshit.

519
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,900
You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

520
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,800
Snake! Snake!

521
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,200
"Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

522
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,700
Tracer activated at one hour,
thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

523
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,200
Hauk!

524
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,200
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

525
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,600
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!

526
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,300
BRAIN TOOK HIM!

527
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,300
Hauk!  Plissken's tracer!

528
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:31,200
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!
Nobody move!

529
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,700
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

530
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,300
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

531
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,800
He's inside.

532
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,600
It's gone.

533
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,000
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.

534
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,600
Download the choppers.
We're in a standby situation.

535
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,400
Anybody could have pushed that button.

536
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.

537
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Now we'll give him a little more time,
just to make sure.

538
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,700
Goddamned redskins!

539
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,100
They're savages, Mr. President!

540
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,400
- Listen, Snake, I swear to god,
I thought you were dead --
- Yeah, you and everybody else.

541
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,900
That's your car in the lobby?
The keys!  Quick!  Quick!

542
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,200
Diagram of the bridge!
Hey, hey, hey --

543
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,700
- I'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --
- Stay out of my way, Harold

544
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,400
Besides, you can't read and
drive at the same time.  You need us!

545
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:21,100
You shouldn't have
double-crossed me again,
Brain.  Come on, let's go --

546
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,300
- They sawed it off...
- The tape?
- Gone... I don't know where...

547
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,900
I do.

548
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:33,200
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.
Just take us to the car and
I'll take you right to it.

549
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,000
Don't talk.

550
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,600
Breathe.

551
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,000
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

552
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,500
- What's wrong?
- Dead, Harold.
- What?!

553
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,800
Here, take these.

554
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,300
Car trouble?

555
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,300
Hi, Duke.

556
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,000
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.

557
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,300
You and Brain just say good-bye
to each other.

558
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,100
GO, GO!

559
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,800
They're behind us --

560
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,700
- They come in groups of threes!
- Where's the tape, Brain?

561
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,200
- The tape from the briefcase!
- Oh, that tape! Here it is!

562
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,500
- You traded away your hat for it!
- How'd you know?

563
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,000
See, see!

564
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,500


565
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,800


566
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,300
- Here, give me that tape!
- Not just yet.

567
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,300
- Easy... easy!
- Go for it, Snake!

568
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,300
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

569
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,500
- I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.
- You think?!

570
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,000
Stay left, stay left, stay left,
and then jog right when I tell you.

571
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,400
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

572
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,900
OK, OK, NOW!

573
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,400
I said JOG RIGHT!...
you asshole.

574
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,300
Stay to the right, stay to
the right, now jog left.

575
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,900
Hold it, left...left...

576
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,700
LEFT, DAMMIT!

577
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,400
Keep moving...

578
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,100
Maggie... he's dead.

579
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,600
Come on.

580
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,100
Station 19!  They spotted two cars
on the 69th street bridge.

581
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,100
- Station 19!  They spotted two cars
on the 69th street bridge.
- Taxicab and a Cadillac.

582
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,100
Taxi hit a mine.
There's four people on foot.

583
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,200
- Fourteen minutes...
- Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

584
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,800
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.
They're coming across the bridge.

585
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,100
This is Rehme, Security Control.

586
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,400
We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.

587
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,500
All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.

588
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,900
Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.

589
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,200
All vehicles, stand by.

590
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,200
Repeat, all vehicles, stand by.

591
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,400
Yeah, hey, Number One!

592
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,400
You're the Duke!

593
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,900
You're the Duke!

594
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,300
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

595
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,500
The tape, Plissken.

596
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,400
That's it.

597
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,100
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.
They know the situation.

598
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,800
They're waiting for your broadcast.

599
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,600
Yeah. Oh, it's all right.

600
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,900
I, uh... I want to thank you.

601
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,600
Anything you want... you just name it.

602
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,000
Just a moment of your time.

603
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,700
Three minutes, sir.

604
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,300
Yes?

605
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,200
We did get you out.

606
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:09,000
A lot of people died in the process.
I just wondered how you felt about it.

607
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,500
Well, I...

608
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,300
I want to thank them.

609
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,300
This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

610
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,600
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
Two and a half minutes?

611
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,100
Yes, sir.

612
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,900
You going to kill me now, Snake?

613
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,100
I'm too tired.

614
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,300
Maybe later.

615
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,200
I've got another deal for you.

616
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,600
I've got another deal for you
while you're resting.

617
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,600
I want to give you a job.

618
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,700
We'd make one hell of a team, Snake.

619
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:26,500
The name's Plissken.

620
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:39,400
You're on camera, Mr. President.

621
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,900
Good evening.

622
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:48,000
Although I shall not be present
at this historic summit meeting...

623
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,100
I present this...

624
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,500
in the hope...

625
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,000
that our great nations ...

626
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,600
may learn to live in peace.
