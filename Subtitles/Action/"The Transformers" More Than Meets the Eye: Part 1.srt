00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:36,612
<b>More Than Meets The Eye</b>
part 1

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:43,996
<b>Many millions of years ago
on the planet Cybertron
live existed.</b>

8
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,526
<b>But not life
as we know it today.</b>

9
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,115
<b>Intelligent robots
that could think and feel
inhabited the cities.</b>

10
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,503
<b>They were called
Autobots and Decepticons.</b>

11
00:00:54,905 --> 00:01:00,462
<b>But the brutal Decepticons
were driven by a single goal:
Total domination!</b>

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,679
<b>They set out
to destroy
the peace-loving Autobots.</b>

13
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:09,611
<b>and the war between
the forces of good and evil
raged across Cybertron.</b>

14
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:15,891
<b>Devastating all in it's path
draining the planet's
once rich sources of energy.</b>

15
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:22,433
<b>The Autobots on the
verge of extinction
battled valiantly to survive.</b>

16
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:31,760
There is not enough energy
in these conductors to last a quartex.

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,066
At least found these,
Wheeljack!

18
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,105
And when these run out?

19
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,061
Can't worry about that now.

20
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,682
Let's get back to Iacon.

21
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:47,268
-Load up!
-I bet Optimus Prime
will be glad to see us.

22
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:56,873
We are nearing the bridge to Iacon.
One megamile to go.

23
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,620
Home, sweet home!

24
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,521
Oh, oh.
A Decepticon
welcoming committee.

25
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:13,461
Autobots!
Stop them!

26
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,342
Prime told me
there'll be days like this.

27
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,811
And you didn't believe him?

28
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:30,917
I do now.

29
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,925
We got to get these
energy conductors
back to Iacon.

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,854
I'm right behind you.

31
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:43,633
Try to find a cut in.

32
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:50,627
After them!

33
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,175
Bumblebee, get in, quick!

34
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:16,465
You are all right?

35
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:21,078
Yeah,
I think it's
my rear axel.

36
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:25,449
Well hang on to your crankshaft
I'm shifting into overdrive.

37
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,431
They've gone underground,
we will never catch them now.

38
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,860
We better report back
to Megatron.

39
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:44,109
Wheeljack to Iacon:
we are coming in.

40
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:53,449
Laserbeak,
prepare for flight!

41
00:03:53,936 --> 00:04:00,026
Destination: Iacon.
Operation: assimilation.

42
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,604
Laserbeak: Autobot alert.

43
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:17,403
Disclosure averted,
continue observation.

44
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:25,951
Any luck, Jazz?

45
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:31,266
Negative.
All side of Cybertron's is blacker than
the inside of a drive shaft.

46
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:37,225
Unless a new supply of energy is found,
nobody is going to win this war.

47
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,644
When do we start
the search mission?

48
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,831
Soon as you are
ready to launch.

49
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:57,408
If there is a new source
of energy to be found
the Decepticons must find it first.

50
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,992
Autobots are set to launch,
Megatron.

51
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:04,721
As are we.
Shockwave!

52
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,663
What is your command,
Megatron?

53
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:13,975
You are to stay behind.
I ain't trust Cybertron to you,
Shockwave?

54
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:19,120
Fear not, Megatron,
Cybertron shall remain,
as you leave it.

55
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:27,896
Excellent.
Now it's nearly a matter of time
until Optimus Prime it meets defeat.

56
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:32,627
The Autobots would have
lost aeons ago if
I've been calling the shocks.

57
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,336
Starscream,
only a select few ever lead.

58
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,406
My time will come,
Megatron.

59
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:46,223
Never, never!
Prepare to blast off!

60
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,932
All systems: go.

61
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,148
Ignition.

62
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,108
Contact.

63
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,934
Blast off!

64
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,600
-Look!   -What is it?  -An asteroid.
-There is another one!
-They are going to collide.

65
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:35,497
Leaking lubricant.

66
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,487
Hang on everybody.

67
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,956
Meteor shower. Meteor shower.

68
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,665
We are losing our power.

69
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,466
Jazz!
Ironhide, man the laser gun!

70
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,619
-Got it.
-Fire!

71
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,502
Follow them!
Follow them!

72
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:07,052
New tracks report:
we are being followed.

73
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:09,185
Decepticons.

74
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:13,935
We have been detected.

75
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,353
Stay with them!

76
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,470
Let's just blow them away,
they have seen us.

77
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,934
No, I want to know
what they are after.

78
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,997
Prepare the tractor beam!

79
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,211
They have made a magnetic junction,
I can't shake them.

80
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:40,598
-Fire the laser!
-Nothing!
Power is used up.

81
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,016
Release the boarding shoot.

82
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,718
They are coming aboard.

83
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,269
Prepare for battle!

84
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,382
Attack!
Attack!

85
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,771
What's happening?

86
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,850
G-forces,
they are dragging us down.

87
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,221
We are out of control.

88
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,889
<b>Four million years later</b>

89
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,008
Explore, explore.

90
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,282
Repair, repair.

91
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:30,947
Megatron, my leader,
we are alive again.

92
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,822
Quickly,
we must revive
the other Decepticons.

93
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:53,894
Much time has passed.
We are on a planet
far from Cybertron,

94
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,293
but our mission
has not changed.

95
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,062
How we know
Cybertron still exists?

96
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:08,017
It must exists.
And if this land is filled with resources,
we shall return home

97
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:13,913
with the power
to build the ultimate weapon
and conquer the universe.

98
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:18,514
-Starscream!
-I'm just saying good bye.

99
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:24,989
Save your energy!
The autobots have taken
their last flight.

100
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:31,687
Thanks for the ride, Prime,
Too bad you can't go
the rest of the way.

101
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,008
Explore, explore.

102
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,014
Repair, repair.

103
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:49,701
Thanks.

104
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:59,864
We will set up here.
Those rocks will serve as
our base of operations.

105
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:04,740
Soundwave,
prepare plans
for a new space cruiser!

106
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,854
Starscream,
convert the area for construction.

107
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,980
What about materials?

108
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:14,201
Use your imagination!

109
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:16,628
Well, any ideas?

110
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:17,985
There!

111
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,072
Great, I'll need some help.

112
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:27,548
Rumble activate pile drivers.
Operation: destruction.

113
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,841
Let's do it!

114
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:41,455
This new planet is rich
with sources of energy.

115
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:44,187
But the Decepticons
must know this too.

116
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:47,836
So we must find them
and stop them.

117
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:54,081
-Hound! -Right here, Prime.
-Scout the area, see if
you can locate the Decepticons.

118
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,653
Just turn me loose, Prime.
I'll sniff them out.

119
00:11:56,975 --> 00:12:02,273
I'm going too.
I wanna boost some Decepticon
right in his turbo charger.

120
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:07,594
Easy, Cliffjumer,
just find them.
We will deal with them later.

121
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:10,302
Good luck!

122
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,822
Some day
I will be giving the orders,
Rumble.

123
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,239
You'll do what I say.

124
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:24,437
Look Starscream, Megatron is strong,
he is merciless, he can't be beaten.

125
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,408
And you will never be our leader.

126
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:33,557
I'll find a way.
Everyone has a weakness.

127
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:35,743
Yeah? Well, not Megatron.

128
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:40,115
We shall see.
Now, shake things up a little.

129
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:47,750
I'm impressed.

130
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:51,480
There is a lot different
then Cybertron out here.

131
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:56,225
Don't fall in love with it, Hound.
We won't be staying that long.

132
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,096
You smell something,
Cliffjumper?

133
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:03,893
-No.
-I do. I think we just
found the Decepticons.

134
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,667
Follow me!

135
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:08,846
I was right.

136
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,932
Let's get down there
and bend some metal!

137
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,898
Ease off your throttle,
Cliffjumper!

138
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,080
Remember what Prime said:
"just find them"!

139
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:22,687
What are they doing?

140
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:24,393
Let's find out!

141
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:30,648
<i>I will plunder Earth and
steal its precious resources.</i>

142
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:35,899
We can concentrate the energy
into energon cubes

143
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,591
and store them
in the new space cruiser.

144
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:45,863
How ironic.
By leading us to this planet

145
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:49,629
the Autobots have sealed
their own doom.

146
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,807
Cliffjumper,
what are you doing?

147
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:57,099
I've got Megatron
dead center
in my view finder.

148
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,413
Who could be firing on us?

149
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,471
Who even knows we are here?

150
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:08,004
-The Autobots.
-Impossible.
-They're the only ones.

151
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:11,195
Soundwave,
send Laserbeak to investigate.

152
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:16,595
Laserbeak prepare for flight!
Close heading, north-east.

153
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,221
-Now, you've done it!
-Let's burn rubber!

154
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,427
What is that thing up there?

155
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,004
I don't know,
but we can't seem to shake it.

156
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,927
Let's split up!
It can't follow both of us.

157
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:37,216
Right, at least one of us
will get back to Prime.

158
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,000
Accelerator down.

159
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,322
Eat my dust, birdbrain!

160
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:47,879
You couldn't hit
an Autobot with a moonbeam.

161
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,994
Try this, it's a gas.

162
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,023
You don't give up, do you?

163
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,465
Nooooo!!!

164
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:30,841
Where did they get you?

165
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,033
I... I think it's my...
my drive train.

166
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,192
-Can you transform?
-I... I don't think so.

167
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:44,427
I'm sorry, Hound, it's my fault,
I shouldn't have fired on Megatron.

168
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,825
You shouldn't have missed,
you mean.

169
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:55,211
Ha, yeah, right!
Halliard hale him up!

170
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,995
I can't believe
the Autobots survived.

171
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:08,219
Either can Megatron.
I thought he blow a fuse
when he found out.

172
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:10,745
Hey, what's that?

173
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,075
Let's find out!

174
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,066
Ok, Reflector,
let's see what you can see!

175
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:32,024
<i>Thundercracker to Soundwave.</i>
<i>Thundercracker to Soundwave.</i>

176
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:39,548
<i>-Proceed Thundercracker.</i>
<i>-Alien vehicle approaching,
possible Autobot.</i>

177
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:42,509
Release Ravage!

178
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:54,027
I don't understand it, Joe.
Looks like a tornado hit this place.

179
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,519
Ai, I don't like it.
Something is wrong,
real wrong.

180
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,774
Look out!

181
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,528
And that's all we heard, Prime.

182
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:28,557
They are gonna put the energy
in some kind of cube then
pull it back to Cybertron.

183
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:34,063
Jazz, organize a battle unit,
we are going after them.

184
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,057
Prowl!

185
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:41,086
Trailbreaker!

186
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,355
Wheeljack!

187
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,673
Ironhide, Mirage, Sunstreaker!

188
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,730
Sideswipe!

189
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:57,135
Autobots, start roll engines!
Ready, Prime.

190
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,922
Let's roll!

191
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,384
Megatron, Laserbeak has returned.

192
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,443
He has found a source of energy.

193
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:34,150
Excellent.
Excellent.

194
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:43,238
Give me a hand, Spike,
we got to raise this bit
Watch it out!

195
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:46,086
Right dad, I will get the bailer.

196
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,038
Dive, dive!

197
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,068
Look, up there!

198
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,230
-What is it?
-What are they?

199
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,173
Everybody, come on!
Come on!

200
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:05,135
Look out!

201
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:11,461
Stop!
Let go my dad!

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,567
Spike!

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,086
Starscream,
activate an oil ray,
now!

204
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:36,163
Soundwave,
prepare the energon cubes.

205
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,342
We did it, we did it,
Megatron, the energy is ours.

206
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,575
We can go back to Cybertron.

207
00:19:56,268 --> 00:20:01,451
You fool, Starscream,
this is but a small fraction
of the energy we need.

208
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:05,659
We must suck this planet Earth dry.

209
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,759
It's the Autobots.

210
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:16,057
Decepticons, transform!
Transform!

211
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,105
Don't interfere, Prime!

212
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:30,853
Give it up, Megatron!

213
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,363
The universe is mine.

214
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:03,884
So long, Prime,
have a nice swim.

215
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:13,553
Here is something to keep you warm.

216
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:25,509
Help, help!
We can't get out.

217
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,209
Somebody, save us!

218
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,688
The fire, it's coming closer.

219
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,241
I can't lift it,
too heavy.

220
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:42,577
Grab on to me,
keep your heads above water.

221
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,000
<b>The TRANS-FORMERS will return
after these messages</b>

222
