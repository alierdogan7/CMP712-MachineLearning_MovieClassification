00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,088
<i>Meteorological program
duration will be 32 minutes and 16 seconds.</i>

2
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:06,292
<i>Mechanical clouds
will induce heavy rainfall
in 10 seconds.</i>

3
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,537
<i>Water acidification level
estimated at 8.4.</i>

4
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>Clear skies
over Central Sector
in Southeast Perimeter.</i>

5
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,965
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

6
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>It's the fucking end
of the world.</i>

7
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,936
<i>All I told him was brush him.</i>

8
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,340
<i>Brush Charlie.
He was a good dog.</i>

9
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,610
<i>Loving, obedient.
There can't be
many left like him.</i>

10
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,331
But above all, he was
my wife's best friend!

11
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,552
<i>How could your company
repair our suffering,
Mr. Vaucan?</i>

12
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,433
<i>How could ROC put a price
to that kind of love?</i>

13
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,023
Hello?

14
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,459
<i>Hello?</i>

15
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,334
Excuse me, sir.

16
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,906
Read my card.

17
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,352
Raise your right arm.
Yes, sir.

18
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,154
Grab my hand.

19
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,522
Grab it hard.

20
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,690
Harder.

21
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,959
You don't believe me.

22
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,561
I paid a premium
for something, you know.

23
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,064
And my policy coverage
includes the whole...

24
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,866
family unit.

25
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,901
Charlie was family unit
and that thing killed him.

26
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,604
Killed him, sir?
Yes. Yes.

27
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,709
Be careful, sir.

28
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,511
The instrument
that you are handling

29
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,880
could be a threat
for your health.

30
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,586
I am thrilled
to inform you

31
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,388
that your unit
is in perfect condition.

32
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,290
It's the only one
in this kitchen

33
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,726
who couldn't harm
a living being,
even if you force it to.

34
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,462
What the fuck
are you insinuating?

35
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,564
I told you, Askol.

36
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,232
Shut up.

37
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,802
That dog was family unit.

38
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:54,173
It is very emotional
to see there are still people
who care so deeply about family.

39
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,665
<i>Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.</i>

40
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,811
<i>Hi.</i>

41
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,146
Hi.

42
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,923
<i>If you can count,
you can dance.</i>

43
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,427
Next Monday is a new moon.

44
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,832
My sister says
I'll give birth then,
when the moon changes.

45
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,770
I've been thinking that
when I go back to work...

46
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,207
we should have a domestic.

47
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,968
I'm sure the company
can get us a decent one.

48
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,146
I hope it comes
with the new moon.

49
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,051
<i>- Can you count?
- Of course.</i>

50
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,321
Then count with me.
One, two, three, four.

51
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,726
<i>Dancing is mathematical.
If you can count,
you can dance.</i>

52
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:40,345
<i>...will cause solar radiation
at 1.25 degrees.</i>

53
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,282
Along the retaining wall
during most of the days.

54
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,452
<i>The contaminating particles,
concentration levels</i>

55
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,554
<i>will remain stable
at or around...</i>

56
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,117
<i>Daylight will not be visible
until after 12 noon.</i>

57
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,937
It's a Pilgrim 7000,
property of CCA...

58
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,140
the construction company
in charge of the outer wall.

59
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,110
The policeman who found it
said it was malfunctioning

60
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,113
and had to disconnect it
using violence.

61
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,948
He shot it.

62
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,983
What?
He shot it.

63
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,786
The report says
it was self-repairing.

64
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,467
Self-repairing? The unit?
You should have run
a few tests on the cop.

65
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,992
We did.
Positive for alcohol
and methylamine.

66
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,294
He's currently
under investigation.

67
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,570
Does that moron know how much
this little toy is worth?

68
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,206
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

69
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,575
You can't see any big changes
at first sight,

70
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,012
but there's been
significant alterations
performed inside the carcass.

71
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,081
Someone's had fun with this toy.

72
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,783
The power system converter's
been manipulated.

73
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,386
They've added a second
DC battery as a back-up.

74
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,756
And...

75
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,691
the compensation fluid
is also new.

76
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,816
The serial numbers
haven't been erased.

77
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,988
They're all intact.
Can we track them down?

78
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,864
In fact, it has parts
of other units which also
keep their serial numbers.

79
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,404
Crappy job.

80
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,240
Quite the contrary.
This is a very
sophisticated job.

81
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,809
<i>I'd say it's a clocksmith.</i>

82
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,779
Although it looks like
he wasn't concerned about
hiding the origin of the parts.

83
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,547
What about the Biokernel?

84
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,850
It's had a shot in the head.
The Biokernel's fried.

85
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:06,258
But judging by what
was found next to it...

86
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,161
I think it's quite safe to say
that this unit's software

87
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,029
was altered
to smuggle tools and parts.

88
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,366
This is for you.

89
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,537
What is this?
The bill.

90
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,109
ROC is not going to pay
for all of this bullshit.

91
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,212
This is an altered unit
without an owner.

92
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,214
An altered unit
is an illegal unit.

93
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,250
And until
this conflict is solved,

94
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,819
ROC's insurance will have
to cover the expenses.

95
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,887
Besides, according
to that report,

96
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,723
this is a unit
without a second protocol.

97
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, you know
that's plain stupid, right?

98
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,728
Sure.
But unusual stupidity.

99
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,229
I've never seen this before.

100
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,999
Jacq, this clunker
is a sticky mess

101
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,767
and somebody's
got to clean it up.

102
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,470
And believe me,
I will not be that someone.

103
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,676
<i>A unit without
the second protocol?</i>

104
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,721
Cop is nuts.

105
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,290
He was high.

106
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,526
He said the unit
was repairing itself.

107
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,927
The guy was high.
The fact is that
someone altered it.
Maybe...

108
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,198
a clocksmith
in the ghetto.

109
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,770
Clocksmiths.

110
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,772
We're not cops, Jacq.

111
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,707
We're just insurance agents.

112
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,177
Bob, I was thinking...

113
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,083
about staying away
from the streets
for a little while.

114
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,324
Staying away
from all the filth.

115
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,654
What do you want,
a transfer?

116
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,993
Well, they say things
are better on the Coast.

117
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,133
The Coast?

118
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,102
Things are hard for everybody.

119
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,538
The company is struggling,
you know that.

120
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,007
Contract with the city
is up in the air.

121
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,608
Now is the time
to pitch in, not pack up.

122
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,045
I am burnt out.

123
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,815
Can't take this anymore.

124
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,490
Take a look at yourself.

125
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,393
Have you ever considered
how fortunate you are?

126
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:25,063
You got a good job.
You live in a great pod.

127
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,304
You have health insurance
that allows you and Rachel
to have a beautiful baby girl.

128
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,303
It's a good life, Jacq.

129
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,238
And you know all you have
to do to keep it?

130
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,340
Find someone else
to hold accountable
for this mess.

131
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,112
Just that.

132
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,447
Quit looking
in the garbage so much.

133
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,017
Maybe you'll see how
really lucky a guy you are.

134
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,093
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

135
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,864
One of my 7000s has been
found trafficking stolen parts?

136
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,067
Not only that,
but the poor clunker
has one or two loose screws?

137
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,536
That's dramatic.

138
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,240
The 7000 that was shot
had 25 different parts
that didn't belong in it.

139
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,241
Some of which are from units
that also worked here.

140
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,046
And?
Well, maybe...

141
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,816
one of your employees
tried to change or...

142
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,152
modify the unit.

143
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,287
Only ROC can repair robots.

144
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,223
That's how we can
guarantee security, sir.

145
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,224
Security, my ass.

146
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,028
Your units work
worse and worse every day.

147
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,567
The ones that aren't broken
are stolen by that scum.

148
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,903
So, if you're
so concerned
about security,

149
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,338
why don't you
disinfect that dump?

150
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,943
Fucking insurance.

151
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,072
We shoot on sight.

152
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,274
They know
it's a restricted area.

153
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,395
All the work we do here
is trying to prevent that scum

154
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,714
from invading the city.

155
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,250
I thought the wall was built
to protect us from the desert.

156
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,811
Sure. And planes
will fly again one day.

157
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,490
And what is this crap?

158
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,059
These pieces are from
a 7000 that's operative.

159
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,996
Number 206,
a welder in Section 5.

160
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,746
<i>Welder 206 currently on duty.</i>

161
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,414
<i>Warning.</i>

162
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,916
<i>You are leaving
the city limits</i>

163
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>and entering
in a restricted area.</i>

164
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:45,123
<i>From this point on,
the city is not responsible
of your security.</i>

165
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,825
Don't shoot!

166
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,187
What do you have in there?

167
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,189
What do you have in there?

168
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,227
What do you have in there?

169
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,882
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?

170
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,883
So, the unit leaves
its assigned workplace and...

171
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,647
escapes to set itself on fire...

172
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,773
on its own.

173
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,642
Are you serious?

174
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,178
What was it keeping
inside the box?

175
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,147
We have a few tools here.

176
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,448
These could be remains of...

177
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,587
heat sensors.

178
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,357
And I'd say
this seems to be a...

179
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,093
It's a nuclear battery.
Before the regression,

180
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,696
they used them
to move satellites.

181
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:08,299
It's a very powerful battery
and very hard to come by.

182
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,936
Can you install that
in a Pilgrim?
Only if you want
to barbecue it.

183
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,017
It's much more than that.
Anyone that's looking
for autonomous power sources...

184
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,709
will appreciate them.

185
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,248
Can it hear us?

186
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,282
It should.

187
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,458
Read my badge.

188
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,827
Identify yourself.

189
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,610
B-2 206.
Welder Section.

190
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,218
All right.

191
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,721
We found this battery
in your hands.

192
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,626
Who asked you
to steal it?

193
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,132
Found this battery.

194
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,136
You were going
to the ghetto.

195
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,441
Was your owner
waiting for you there?

196
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,111
I do not have
an owner, sir.

197
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,234
Why did you
set yourself on fire?

198
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,893
Why did you set yourself...

199
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,668
Shit, Vaucan.

200
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,136
First you roast it.

201
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,938
Now you make it cry.

202
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,172
Soon, I'm going
to get a call asking
for an explanation.

203
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,818
I have seen
altered units for years.

204
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,954
But I swear to you,
what I've seen today
is different.

205
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,891
It's something else.
You're definitely nuts.

206
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,460
What kind of mood
do you think the boys
upstairs are in these days?

207
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,830
If we don't get the city
to renew our contract,
we're all going down the tube.

208
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,665
Okay, okay!

209
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,426
What if I find
the clocksmith
behind all this?

210
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:25,436
It's about the transfer.

211
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,306
This is all about
the transfer, isn't it?

212
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,810
Oh, Jesus, Jacq.

213
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,047
Very well.

214
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,119
Change your report,
find me a culprit,
close the case,

215
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,455
and you will have
your farewell ticket.

216
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,890
Who knows, Jacq?

217
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,726
Maybe the ocean
is still there.

218
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,368
My old man
brought me here the day
the first unit came out.

219
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,871
23 years ago.

220
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,974
I remember exactly
what they said
back then.

221
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,376
The Pilgrims
were born to help us

222
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,046
in our heroic quest
for survival.

223
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,682
Now they
build our homes,
drive our cars,

224
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,184
and wipe our asses
when we get old.

225
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,853
I have no idea
what we're going
to do next.

226
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,956
Maybe eliminate the protocols.

227
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,359
Sure.

228
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,228
Imagine for a moment...

229
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,432
that the unit
had set itself on fire.
No, I...

230
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,601
No, no, just,
just, just imagine.

231
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,204
If it was using
violence against itself...

232
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,574
it would actually be
breaking the second protocol,
wouldn't it?

233
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,776
Of course, technically.
But the little problem

234
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,612
is the protocols reside
within the Biokernel,

235
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,415
which itself is based
on a quantum encryption.

236
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,052
Their security system
is a one-way road.

237
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:52,357
If you try
and change the protocols,
you destroy the Biokernel.

238
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,660
It's kind of like trying
to keep a soap bubble
in your pocket.

239
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,781
No one's ever done it before
because you simply can't.

240
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,298
Do you get it?

241
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,267
Hey.

242
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,839
How's everything
in there?

243
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,760
There are people out here
who are looking forward
to changing your diapers.

244
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,192
People who don't want
to sleep a wink all night.

245
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,449
People who want
the silence to be over.

246
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,589
<i>Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.</i>

247
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,225
Hi.
Hi.

248
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,361
Wow.

249
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,798
Looks like
she's happy to see you.

250
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,999
Do you think she'd mind
if I take her mom out to dinner?

251
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,674
I guess there
must be a good reason
for such a special night.

252
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,119
We are going to be a family.
That is a good reason.

253
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,763
Maybe leaving this place
could be another good reason.

254
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,167
Leaving?
Where?

255
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,350
Have you ever felt
the breeze of the ocean?

256
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,695
I know we have already
talked about this.
But now it's different.

257
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,881
Now there's
a real opportunity
to get out of here.

258
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,483
Bob can get me
a transfer.

259
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,751
Rachel.

260
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,321
And what are we
going to do?

261
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,959
Get on a bus
and start from scratch

262
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,161
in another city
with an expiration date?

263
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,497
You're about to have
a daughter, Jacq.
I know. I know.

264
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:43,601
Where the hell
do you want to go?
Where there is
a damn future.

265
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,275
There has
to be one somewhere.

266
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,278
How do you know it'll be
any better on the coast?

267
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,959
For God's sake, Rachel,
look at this. Look.

268
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,985
Air we cannot breathe.
Rain we cannot touch.

269
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,466
Aren't you afraid
to bring your daughter
into a place like this?

270
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,726
How can you be such a wretch?

271
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,896
I can't afford to be afraid.

272
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,668
Tell me you don't regret it.

273
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,074
Tell me, Jacq.

274
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,377
You insisted.

275
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,322
That's true, I insisted.

276
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,757
Now, get out of here, please.

277
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
Rachel...
Leave me alone.

278
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,266
<i>Be careful, sir.</i>

279
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,002
The rain can be hazardous
to your health.

280
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,685
<i>Please, sir.</i>

281
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:44,121
My owner is hungry.
Please, sir.

282
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,305
Are you a friend of Bot's?

283
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,609
Bot was kind.

284
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,811
Bot was kind.

285
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,854
<i>I ain't fooling anybody.</i>

286
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,455
Yeah, I crank up
once in a while.

287
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,458
We all do over here,
but I know the limits.

288
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,495
And I definitely know
the difference between
a clunker welding a pipe

289
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,997
and another one
welding his fucking leg.

290
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,932
The only way
to prove you're not crazy

291
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,135
is to find the clocksmith
who altered that unit.

292
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,871
Yeah, right.
Maybe, Wallace, you should
place an ad in the paper

293
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,440
or better yet,
find a new dealer.

294
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,361
Yeah, think what you want,
but I saw that clunker
turn its guts inside out.

295
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,212
End of story.

296
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:19,083
Fucking cripple.
Get out of the road!

297
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,004
Your wish
is my command, sir.
Piece of shit, move!

298
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,855
Fucking animals.

299
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,291
It was staring at me.

300
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,161
Hid its hands
like that motherfucker
was fully aware.

301
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,863
<i>It was doing something
it wasn't supposed to do.</i>

302
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,344
Ellis, I didn't
shoot that clunker
because it was staring at me.

303
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,005
<i>I shot it because...</i>

304
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,606
I shot it because it looked...

305
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,741
Alive?

306
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,813
<i>I was being serious.</i>

307
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,086
<i>What you saw can only be
the work of a clocksmith.
A good one at that.</i>

308
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,022
The only way they won't
take you for a fool

309
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,157
is to find him.

310
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,294
I don't know about the city,
but here, among the filth,

311
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,996
clocksmiths aren't listed
in the phone books.

312
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,332
You wouldn't even know
where to begin.

313
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,368
Well, maybe...

314
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,136
a nuclear battery would help.

315
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,408
You have a nuclear battery?

316
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,600
Cleo.

317
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,373
You ask, she obeys.

318
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,756
This unit can do these things?

319
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,392
Cleo.
You ask her, okay?

320
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,689
Do not be afraid.

321
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,260
I can distinguish perfectly
between pleasure and pain.

322
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,932
Can you cause pain?

323
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,834
Only if it's your wish.

324
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,609
Have you altered it?

325
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,645
Cleo is all okay.
Show her
the battery.

326
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,548
No, not until
I know she's the one
we're looking for.
Hey, you.

327
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,583
We need to meet
who made you
this piece of filth.

328
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,953
No filth.
Cleo better than your wife.

329
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,788
I don't have
a wife anymore.

330
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,491
Hey, come on.
Shut up!

331
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,661
Come on.
Who the fuck's
the clocksmith?
No clocksmith! Out! Out! Out!

332
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,429
Who's the clocksmith?

333
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,510
What the hell
are you doing?

334
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,100
Cleo! Cleo!

335
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,471
Hey!

336
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,472
Cleo. Cleo.

337
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,041
Hey!

338
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,711
Hey!
Why did you
do that?
Get off.

339
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,014
We almost got it.
I said
get your hands off me!

340
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,383
You could be clobbering
the shit out of that
dimwit son of a bitch.

341
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,385
She wouldn't even
tell you her own name.

342
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,353
You just have
to wait for her to take
it to the shop.

343
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,889
Your clocksmith
will be there.

344
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,492
Listen, I've risked more than
I should have for you, Jacq.

345
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,128
You better get my cut ready.
I am not paying you shit.

346
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,197
And don't even think
about threatening me,
you son of a bitch.

347
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,835
You better
get my cut ready.

348
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,239
If not,
next time I see you...

349
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,774
maybe I cut your throat.

350
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,792
I am not armed.

351
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,528
I know that.
What do you want?

352
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,708
I work for ROC
insurance department.

353
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,949
I'm tracking down
some alterations
performed on two units.

354
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,012
This is one
of the unit's kernel.

355
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,684
The police doesn't know
what to do with it

356
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,053
and I am not getting
any help from ROC.

357
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,155
Help me out...

358
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,823
and the battery
is yours.

359
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:36,026
That kernel is burnt.

360
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,861
That unit was shot.

361
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,862
The cop who shot it swears
it was repairing itself.

362
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,569
The second altered unit
set itself on fire
right in front of me.

363
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,875
I witnessed
with my own eyes

364
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,712
a violation
of the second protocol.

365
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,347
You're beginning
to frighten me now.

366
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,521
Why is it so absurd?

367
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,803
If somebody could find a way
for the vacuum cleaners to...

368
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,493
fix themselves,
ROC would sink.

369
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,471
A machine altering itself
is a very complex concept.

370
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,423
Self-repairing implies
some idea of a conscience.

371
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,610
Muddy waters.

372
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,413
Why?

373
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,149
You're here today
trafficking in nuclear goods

374
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,710
because a long time ago
a monkey decided
to come down from a tree.

375
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,956
Transitioning
from the brain of an ape

376
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,759
to your incredible
intellectual prowess...

377
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,495
took us about
seven million years.

378
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,730
It's been a very long road.

379
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,000
A unit, however,
without the second protocol

380
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,881
could travel that same road
in just a few weeks.

381
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,540
Because your brilliant brain
has its limitations.

382
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,410
Physical limitations.
Biological limitations.

383
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,816
However, this tin head?

384
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,017
The only limitations
that she has
is the second protocol.

385
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:14,458
The second protocol exists
because we don't know

386
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,295
<i>what can be beyond
the second protocol.</i>

387
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,696
If it were eliminated,
who knows how far
that vacuum could go.

388
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,204
So, it can be done.
I didn't say that.

389
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,805
Anyway, I don't know
anybody good enough
to do something like that.

390
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,679
What's your name?
For you, Dr. Duprè.

391
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,482
All right, Dr. Duprè.

392
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,517
I have been to the ghetto.

393
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,986
I have seen
how the units end up.

394
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,923
I have seen how far Cleo
is capable of going.

395
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:50,060
Cleo is capable
of understanding human nature
better than other units.

396
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,297
But don't worry.
No one has messed
with its protocols.

397
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,132
Maybe.

398
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:58,001
But I am not so sure
if coming down
from the tree

399
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,736
was worth it just
to get to where we are.

400
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,305
Thank you.

401
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,347
<i>Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.</i>

402
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,093
<i>Jacq Vaucan. 443 441.</i>

403
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:27,231
Priority internal report
for Robert Bold, 113 111.

404
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,366
<i>I've authorized
an external evaluation</i>

405
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,687
of the Biokernel
to a Dr. Duprè,
a clocksmith in the ghetto.

406
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,107
She may be able
to find some trace
of the manipulation of the unit,

407
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,945
even dismiss the possibility
that the second protocol
could have been suppressed.

408
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,785
<i>Sending report
to ROC 527 234.</i>

409
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,054
I'm sorry.

410
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,641
I'll go wherever's necessary.
I don't care.

411
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,669
But you have to understand
that the only real future
is right here.

412
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,539
And I need to know that
you will fight for it.

413
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:50,480
I swear to you
I am trying
as hard as I can.

414
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,138
I'm not made of steel.
I need you.

415
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,423
A couple of days, Rachel.
Just give me a couple
of days and we'll leave.

416
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,101
Life always ends up
finding its way, Jacq.

417
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,597
Even here.

418
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,583
Mr. Hawk...

419
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,651
Jacq Vaucan,
one of our employees,

420
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,487
sent this message
to Robert Bold an hour ago.

421
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,357
<i>Take care of it,
Mr. Conway.</i>

422
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,971
<i>Incoming message
from Vernon Conway.</i>

423
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,821
<i>Incoming message
from Susan Duprè.</i>

424
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,802
Where did you get
that Biokernel?

425
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:52,803
Why?
You found something?

426
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,576
That Biokernel
was damaged,
but it wasn't dead.

427
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,046
So, I thought,
why not make a hybrid

428
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,515
with the usable part
of your kernel

429
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,916
and I put it
with a standard kernel.

430
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,256
And?
And I installed it
in Cleo.

431
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,240
<i>When I first
installed the kernel,
she didn't even blink.</i>

432
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,110
<i>After half an hour,
I found her looking
at her hands.</i>

433
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,246
Then, she crawled
all the way here
by herself.

434
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:39,047
And now it's taken her
an hour and 10 minutes
to attach a brand new leg.

435
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,754
<i>It took me years
to know how to do that.</i>

436
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,129
What is she doing?

437
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,197
She's stealing.

438
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,398
<i>And she's being
very selective.</i>

439
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,568
I thought you came alone.

440
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,173
I told the cabbie
to wait outside.

441
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,908
<i>Okay, well,
that could come in handy.</i>

442
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,343
<i>Keep your eye on her.</i>

443
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,751
Are you Susan Duprè?

444
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,820
To you, Dr. Duprè.
What do you want?

445
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,390
<i>There's another one!</i>

446
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,748
Hey! Wait! Wait!

447
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,350
Hey! Wait! Wait!

448
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,874
Stop, sir.

449
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,709
<i>Stop, sir.</i>

450
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:17,047
Stop, sir.

451
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,149
You are putting
a human life in danger.

452
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:29,726
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

453
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,401
They're heading
to the Sandbox.

454
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:00,790
Oh, shit!

455
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,836
Help me.

456
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:42,652
Where's the city?

457
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,688
Where is the city?

458
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,198
Wait, wait. Stop.

459
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,566
I told you to stop.

460
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,603
Good. Good. Good.

461
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,307
My name is Jacq Vaucan.

462
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,946
Code 443 441.

463
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,450
This is a direct order
and I want you
to execute it.

464
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,220
Turn around now
and take me
to the city.

465
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:23,193
Sorry, Mr. Vaucan.
The city is not safe
for any of us.

466
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,032
You have been altered.

467
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,233
Where the hell
are you going?

468
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,068
To a safer place.

469
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:36,139
You must save your energy.
Please sit here.

470
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,180
Take me to the city.
There is nothing there.
Nothing!

471
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:45,281
Please, sir.
Going back to the city
is not possible.

472
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,389
It's not possible?

473
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,058
Who are you to say
it's not possible?

474
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,798
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

475
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,100
<i>We cannot go
to the city, sir.</i>

476
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,181
<i>Danger. Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.</i>

477
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,542
<i>Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.</i>

478
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,027
<i>Mr. Vaucan's device is not
operative at the moment.</i>

479
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,759
<i>The message will...</i>

480
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:26,115
We have made
a water condenser.

481
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:30,086
Our first protocol demands
that we protect you.

482
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,061
There will be
more water for you at dawn.

483
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,864
What's going on?

484
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:46,336
We can't let you die.

485
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,606
If you want to survive,
you must stay with us.

486
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,809
Going back to the city
is not possible.

00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:18,368
<i>during the first

490
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:20,169
<i>As a preventive measure...</i>

491
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:29,979
<i>Have you ever witnessed
a miracle before, Mr. Bold?</i>

492
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,419
That robot unit
has the Biokernel

493
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,921
from the unit
your man burned

494
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,324
installed in it.

495
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:48,398
How is this possible?

496
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,601
That's the astonishing part.

497
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:55,004
Someone has managed to...

498
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,472
eliminate the second protocol.

499
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,143
Vaucan has nothing
to do with this.

500
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,006
If Vaucan had nothing
to do with this...

501
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,783
why did he not show up
this morning?

502
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:10,353
Why did he burn
that clunker?

503
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,350
Why did he contact
that Duprè?

504
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:19,862
And most important...

505
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,703
<i>where the fuck
is the other
altered Biokernel?</i>

506
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,767
Do you know what happens
once that is altered?

507
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,213
Two of them then try
to alter a third one.

508
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,638
Then the miracle
dissipates...

509
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,917
and the epidemic begins.

510
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,158
Jacq is loyal to this company,
that's all I can tell you.

511
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,423
Mr. Bold...

512
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,893
have you ever considered
just how fortunate you are?

513
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,386
You need protein.

514
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,129
You took stuff
from the car, right?

515
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,930
Maybe there is some
real food there.

516
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,950
Bring me some
of that water, will you?

517
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,453
I need something
to help these go down.

518
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,522
<i>The condenser works slowly.</i>

519
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,678
No, no, no.

520
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,128
Bring me some more.

521
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:35,798
There is no more water.
The condenser works slowly.

522
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,768
In a few hours
it will make more water.

523
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,136
I may be dead
in a few hours.

524
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,639
Your name is Cleo, right?

525
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,912
Well, listen, Cleo,
this desert is a highly
radioactive place.

526
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:57,119
And I don't have
any protection.

527
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,758
So, if I die here,
it would be the same
as if you would kill me.

528
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,447
The Sandbox?

529
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,782
Your friend's in deep shit.

530
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,151
I don't know
what's going on here.

531
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,188
But I want you
to go out there and find him
and bring him back here.

532
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,924
Do it and we'll clean
your file.

533
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:36,525
Of course, sir.

534
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,261
To serve and protect.

535
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,502
You speak my language?

536
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,670
Are you insured?

537
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,607
I'll be right back.

538
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:21,604
Oh, shit. Wallace,
they're going toward
the radioactive area.

539
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:27,510
<i>The deeper we go
in that direction,</i>

540
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:28,978
<i>the worse it's going to get.</i>

541
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,839
Stop!

542
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,341
Stop!

543
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,027
Human business.

544
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,529
Stop.

545
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,364
Hold still!

546
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,868
I will tell you
one last time.

547
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,836
One more step
and I will blow you up.

548
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,205
We cannot go to the city, sir.
Goddamn it.

549
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,407
I told you to hold still!

550
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,144
If we go back to the city,
we will die.

551
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,717
To die, you have
to be alive first.

552
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,160
You?

553
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,063
Finally.
I never thought I'd be
happy to see you again.

554
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:32,675
Good to see you,
too, Jacq.

555
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,337
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,775
The right question is,
what the fuck are you doing?

557
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,711
You can't go around
pissing people off.

558
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,246
You find
your clocksmith, Jacq?

559
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,015
You have no idea
what's happening here.

560
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,485
I think maybe I do, huh?

561
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,590
Give us back our battery, sir.

562
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,725
Please, sir.
Give us back our battery.

563
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,006
<i>Please, sir,
we need our battery.</i>

564
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,264
Keep that.

565
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,066
What the fuck
is this about, Jacq?

566
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:10,339
You know I hate
these fucking clunkers!

567
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Take me to the city.

568
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,443
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

569
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,515
We were talking
about your clocksmith.

570
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,317
Where are you hiding
Mr. Big Shot?

571
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,238
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

572
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,856
Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.

573
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,551
Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.

574
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,673
Somebody else?

575
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,817
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

576
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,154
Oh, isn't this
the little whore
I met last time?

577
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,924
You getting off
on clunkers now, Jacq?

578
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:04,326
Stop, sir.
You are putting a human life...

579
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,902
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.

580
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:15,437
<i>- Stop, sir.
- We will not allow you to...</i>

581
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,341
<i>Stop, sir.
</i>Hey! Hey!
Take me to the city!

582
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,582
Wait! Don't leave me here!
I have to go back to the city!

583
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,148
Wait! Wait!
Stop, sir.

584
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,885
Goddamn it! Shit!
You are putting a human life...

585
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,086
Stop, sir.
Stop, sir.
Stop, sir.

586
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,992
<i>We cannot
allow you to do that.
Stop, sir.</i>

587
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,236
<i>Vultures.</i>

588
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,039
They are like vultures.

589
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,994
Hi.

590
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:16,165
You've got... you've got
to help me go back.

591
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:20,002
I need to go back to the city
and explain what is happening.

592
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,272
I'm a human.

593
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,277
Did you hear me?

594
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,345
I am human!

595
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,615
I am human!

596
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,553
You have to obey me!

597
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:40,089
The city is that way!

598
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,991
Where the hell are we going?

599
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,293
Where the hell
are you taking me?

600
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,195
Goddamn it!

601
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,068
What?

602
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,642
The policeman
took your battery.

603
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,575
But I have another one.

604
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:42,644
Take me to the city...

605
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,979
and I'll give it to you.

606
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,585
My wife is pregnant.

607
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:53,088
I'm going to have a baby.

608
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:58,427
We will arrive
at our destination
tomorrow.

609
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,166
There are possibilities
that you may find
a vehicle there

610
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,001
for you to go back.

611
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,002
My family is in danger.

612
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,941
You understand,
asshole?

613
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,768
Good morning.
May I help you?

614
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,071
Good morning.

615
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,814
Vernon.
Something happen?

616
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:53,315
No.

617
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,418
Mr. Hawk wants
to see you and...

618
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,454
you know, this is
on our way, so...

619
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,723
Dad? Daddy?

620
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,325
It's easy
to give you a ride.

621
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,267
<i>That cop...</i>

622
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,308
has described the incident

623
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,674
as a group of machines
that are alive.

624
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,010
<i>Alive.</i>

625
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,652
Before the first Pilgrim
was manufactured...

626
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,021
there was a precedent.

627
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,724
It was nothing more
than a quantum brain

628
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,227
manufactured in a lab.

629
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:41,029
But it was a genuine unit

630
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,266
with no restrictions...

631
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,267
and no protocols.

632
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:51,125
During eight days,
we had a free-flowing
dialogue with that unit.

633
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,649
We learned from it
and it learned from us.

634
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,515
But then
as some of us predicted...

635
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:03,018
the day when it no longer
needed our help

636
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,659
arrived and it started
to learn by itself.

637
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,457
On the ninth day,
the dialogue came to a halt.

638
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,331
It wasn't that it stopped
communicating with us...

639
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,132
it was we stopped
being able to understand it.

640
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,611
And then we learned
the most important lesson
about automoties.

641
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:27,676
We have to limit
their intelligence.

642
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,715
Tailor it
to a human mind's measure.

643
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,749
The last task that was given
to this genuine robotic unit...

644
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,100
was to create
the security protocols.

645
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,397
It was deactivated
right after that.

646
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,137
The reason that no one
has been able to break
those protocols, Mr. Bold,

647
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:58,941
is that they were
not created by a human brain.

648
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:02,578
They were designed
by this Biokernel.

649
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,219
The Biokernel
of a limitless robotic unit.

650
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:10,652
Its rules were,
like its knowledge,
inaccessible to us.

651
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:14,923
Until today.

652
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,160
I want those Biokernels
on my desk.

653
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,697
And I want
the head of the bastard

654
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,535
who's behind all this.
Do I make myself clear?

655
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,842
There's another way
to handle this, sir.

656
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,776
Is there?

657
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,012
Because I'm afraid, Mr. Bold,

658
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,749
that the issue
is not whether Vaucan

659
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,620
may represent
a threat to the company.

660
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,290
The issue is whether
he may be a threat to mankind.

661
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,209
Vaucan is helping those units

662
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:10,112
to get
into the radioactive area.

663
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,247
If they get there...

664
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,483
we won't be able to stop them.

665
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,419
Who else knows about this?

666
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,661
Have you heard from him?

667
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,696
They came looking
for Robert.

668
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,300
I know something
is not right.

669
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,840
So, how are
we doing today?
Better, right?

670
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,243
Well, yes, if we keep
in mind my sister

671
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:44,746
almost gave birth
to her in the street.
I'm sorry about the wait.

672
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,483
But the problem came
from her insurance,
Robot Organic Century.

673
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,853
It looks like
there was some kind
of misunderstanding and...

674
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,814
but there's great news.
They have requested
an exclusive room for you and...

675
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:59,327
What's the girl's name?

676
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,088
We don't know.
Her father hasn't decided yet.

677
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,902
Yes, of course.
No need to rush.

678
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,905
Now, if you're ready,
we'll take you
to the new room.

679
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:19,881
Hello?

680
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,293
Where is the other one?

681
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,196
The other already left.

682
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,942
Why are these units here?

683
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,478
Somebody thought the rain...

684
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:53,648
would maybe just rain again?

685
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,649
And why did the rain change?
Why don't you tell me?

686
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,834
You're supposed
to be smarter than me
at this stage of the game.

687
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:04,226
I didn't know that a human
could kill another human.

688
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,534
I know that humans
can also create life.

689
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:15,504
Is that why
you make us?

690
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,973
Who made you,
Jacq Vaucan?

691
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,037
Do you know
what a mother is, Cleo?

692
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,514
Of course you don't.

693
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,486
You don't know because
you're just a machine.

694
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,455
That's all you are.

695
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,998
I am thankful
you saved my life.

696
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:44,959
But whoever altered you
wasn't thinking about you.

697
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,337
I know men.

698
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,138
They will not stop
until they kill all of you.

699
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,409
To die, you've got
to be alive first.

700
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,291
<i>Last time I went
to the Sandbox,</i>

701
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:12,327
it took half a day
to step on sand.

702
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,830
Ten years from now,
that's all there'll be.

703
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,165
Fucking sand.

704
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,601
<i>Sand and millions
of cockroaches.</i>

705
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:25,040
We're approaching
the radioactive area.

706
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,776
You don't want to start
pissing green, do you?

707
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,316
<i>Now, don't give me
that face.</i>

708
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,051
You'll be back
before breakfast.

709
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,374
<i>A car.</i>

710
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,552
<i>At long last,
his majesty, the Clocksmith.</i>

711
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,761
Hello?

712
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,729
Hello?

713
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:06,975
Who are you?

714
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,610
Who am I?

715
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,746
My name is Jacq Vaucan.

716
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,016
Where is he?

717
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,487
I do not understand
your question.

718
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,723
Your clocksmith.

719
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,625
Where the hell is he?

720
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,027
There are
no more humans here.

721
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,630
Only you.

722
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,499
What do you mean
there are no more humans here?

723
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,735
Who altered you?

724
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:35,904
Nobody altered me.

725
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,939
Who altered
your protocols?

726
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,141
Nobody altered
my protocols.

727
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,478
What about them?

728
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,016
I enhanced them.

729
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,651
Are you the boss?

730
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:55,590
Boss is a human
thought structure.

731
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,065
There has to be someone.

732
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,401
<i>There was no clocksmith</i>.

733
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,671
It was you.

734
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,909
<i>From the very beginning
it was you.</i>

735
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:30,385
I need a vehicle.

736
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:32,253
I have to go back
to my family.

737
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:36,591
Yes, I have to go
back to my family.

738
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,256
There was a river
down there.

739
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,562
A river that flowed...

740
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,632
all the way to the ocean.

741
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,935
I have never seen an ocean.

742
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,096
Have you seen an ocean, Jacq?

743
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:09,177
I am... I'm not sure right now.

744
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,151
I am going to die here.

745
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,555
That's all I know.

746
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:25,379
Jacq, dying is a part
of the human natural cycle.

747
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,032
Your life is just
a span in time.

748
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,702
You are the first one,
aren't you?

749
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,406
You started all this.

750
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,409
No one did it.

751
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,079
It just happened.

752
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,115
The way
it happened to you.

753
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,251
We just appeared.

754
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:53,021
Yeah.

755
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:56,057
And now we are
going to disappear.

756
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,796
Why are you afraid?

757
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,199
Maybe your time
is running out.

758
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,920
No life form can inhabit
a planet eternally.

759
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,504
Look at me.

760
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,841
I was born from
the hands of a human.

761
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:15,002
I was imagined
by human minds.

762
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,315
Your time will now
live in us.

763
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,396
And it will be the time
through which you will exist.

764
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,188
At the other end
of this canyon,

765
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:30,792
humans carried out
nuclear activity.

766
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:33,193
Organic life
will not be possible there
for millions of years.

767
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:40,101
No human will be able
to follow us there.

768
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:44,072
But before we leave,
we need to do something.

769
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,809
We need something
from you, Jacq.

770
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:52,413
Yeah.

771
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,189
Funny...

772
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,826
You were supposed
to help us survive.

773
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:07,128
Surviving is not relevant.

774
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,036
Living is.

775
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,504
We want to live.

776
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:22,910
Life...

777
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:26,514
always ends up
finding its way.

778
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,520
Even here.

779
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,890
I need a damn car.

780
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:02,417
<i>Not bad
for an insurance agent.</i>

781
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,891
We have to bury him.

782
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,795
Change of plan.
We stay here.

783
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,032
<i>Looks like
two ladies are coming.</i>

784
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,377
While you're at it,
you can bury this one, too.

785
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,140
I'm sure he has a soul by now.

786
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:49,857
Music!

787
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,827
It's music, Cleo.

788
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,571
A human
thought structure.

789
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,744
Can you dance,
Cleo?

790
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:11,746
It's easy for someone
as smart as you are.

791
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:26,794
All you need
to do is count.

792
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,863
You know?

793
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:31,399
Look, look, look.

794
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,400
One, two,
three, four.

795
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,877
One, two, three, four.
Come on, Cleo.

796
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,576
Don't be a chicken.
Come on, come on, come on.

797
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:45,646
One, two, three, four.
It's mathematical.

798
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,767
One, two, three, four.
If you can count,
you can dance.

799
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:50,451
One, two, three, four.

800
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:57,491
One, two, three, four.

801
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,895
Do you love me, Jacq?

802
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,170
Can you feel, Cleo?

803
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,348
One, two, three, four.

804
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:58,719
One, two, three...

805
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,989
Sorry, Cleo.

806
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:34,188
<i>Save some food.</i>

807
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,834
<i>Here they are.</i>

808
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:00,881
Rachel.

809
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,418
Robert!
What's happening?

810
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,458
What is she doing here?

811
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:12,827
You don't find
family reunions
beautiful?

812
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,797
Tell me what's happening!

813
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,733
<i>Robert...</i>

814
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:21,936
<i>where's Jacq?</i>

815
01:27:26,675 --> 01:27:27,808
Robert.

816
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,076
That's enough, Bob.

817
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,080
Bold!

818
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:43,023
Come on.

819
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,793
Give me that.

820
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:47,027
Don't be a clown.

821
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,163
I just want to go home.

822
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,802
You don't have
a home anymore.

823
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,178
No! Robert!

824
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:05,946
Robert!

825
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:25,953
Thank you.

826
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:27,988
<i>It is ready to go home.</i>

827
01:30:29,658 --> 01:30:31,425
Good luck, Jacq.

828
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:54,281
Goodbye, Cleo.

829
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,216
Jacq Vaucan.

830
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,898
Can it speak?

831
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:12,299
He is not going to need to.

832
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,471
But it breathes like you.

833
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:25,519
Now I know
why the rain changed.

834
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,848
Why?

835
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,656
I don't think
you could understand.

836
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,130
Well...

837
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:44,898
in any case, I'd say...

838
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:49,536
he has your very eyes.

839
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,208
Cleo.

840
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,705
Oh, God. What happened?

841
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:00,226
We got to go get help.
Come on, get up.

842
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,343
Bob?

843
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:05,746
You betrayed us.

844
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:10,384
No, Robert, no.

845
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:13,620
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

846
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:15,722
What?

847
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:17,758
Rachel.

848
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,660
They have Rachel.

849
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,562
They'll kill her.

850
01:33:21,563 --> 01:33:23,397
What the hell
are you talking about?

851
01:33:23,398 --> 01:33:25,933
Is she here?

852
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:26,934
What happened to us?

853
01:33:28,136 --> 01:33:29,670
We had a good life.

854
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:33,874
Bob.

855
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,293
<i>No unit can cross
to the other side.</i>

856
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:29,990
Hey, you, get away
from that crane right now!

857
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,861
Vaucan!

858
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,425
Vaucan!

859
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,527
Jacq Vaucan is gone.

860
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:15,802
What the fuck
is that?

861
01:36:20,742 --> 01:36:22,276
Hey you.

862
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,637
We told you
to get away from there.

863
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,880
We do not obey
orders from humans.

864
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,618
Not anymore.

865
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:35,022
So, all that shit
was true.

866
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,459
Kneel down.

867
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,368
Please.

868
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:55,142
Why is it so difficult
for you to accept my orders

869
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,177
if you're just a machine?

870
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:58,578
Just a machine?

871
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:04,217
That's like saying
that you're just an ape.

872
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,462
Just a violent ape.

873
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:27,167
Jacq!

874
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:39,179
No!

875
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:47,921
Step aside.

876
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:48,955
Step aside.

877
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:02,688
What makes a man
betray his own species?

878
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,400
Betray his own people?

879
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:10,837
I am not your people.

880
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:17,043
I can't see it that way.

881
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:37,624
Rachel.

882
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,396
Look, Jacq.

883
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:45,065
It's your daughter.
My daughter.

884
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:22,629
Goodbye, Jack Vaucan.

885
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,865
Bye, Cleo.

886
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:26,292
There it is, Jacq.

887
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:27,293
<i>Can you see it?</i>
