(WATCH BEEPING)

526
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,120
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

527
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,393
Sorry, Mickey.

528
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,958
Five, four, three, two, one.

529
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,551
Hey. Hey, Russian.

530
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,518
Good for one. Yeah.

531
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,589
Imagine if you had a thousand.

532
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,199
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

533
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,910
What the hell did they do to you?

534
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,035
(WHISTLING)

535
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,270
Throw you in front of a moving train
for no reason?

536
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,351
Beat the shit out of you?

537
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,268
You know, you can say it,
this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

538
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,634
Bullshit!

539
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,631
(WATER SPLASHING SOFTLY)

540
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,156
Repairman. Five minutes.

541
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,830
Heads up out of the question?

542
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,594
Fuck.

543
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,989
You're a waste of my fucking time!
Why are you here?

544
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,991
I don't know, so hit me.

545
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,435
- Why are you here?
- I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

546
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,355
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

547
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,072
Tell me what you want me to say.

548
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,549
- FOX: Why are you here?
- I don't know!

549
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,078
FOX: Why are you here?

550
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,635
- Why are you here?
- I don't know why I'm here.

551
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,358
FOX: Why are you here?

552
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,429
Why are you here?

553
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,432
I don't know who I am.

554
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,395
- What did you say?
- I said...

555
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,476
I said I don't know who I am.

556
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,079
Do you really want to know who you are?

557
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,631
Yeah. It's my room.

558
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,355
No.

559
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,110
This was your father's room.

560
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,233
WESLEY: What happened?

561
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,719
SLOAN: A member
of this fraternity went rogue.

562
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,309
WESLEY: Cross.

563
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,429
He started by killing
the one man who was better than him.

564
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,039
Your father.

565
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,630
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

566
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,873
Betrayed him.

567
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,950
Everything in this room,

568
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,476
books, weapons, clothes,

569
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,712
belonged to him.

570
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,711
Now they belong to you.

571
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,479
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

572
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,832
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

573
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,554
<i>WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care</i>
<i>about anything before this.</i>

574
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,198
<i>I was living a lie.</i>

575
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,156
<i>Finally, I have a chance to step</i>
<i>into my father's shoes.</i>

576
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,596
<i>Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.</i>

577
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,399
<i>I've been pissing it all away</i>
<i>like it was another fucking billing report.</i>

578
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,072
<i>I have to train harder.</i>

579
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,628
<i>I have to be as good as my father.</i>

580
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,754
On these shelves, Wesley,
are the records of the Fraternity kills,

581
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,912
everything you will need to kill your target.

582
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,434
<i>WESLEY: To kill Cross,</i>

583
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,116
<i>the man who betrayed the Fraternity</i>
<i>and murdered my father, I must prepare.</i>

584
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,352
<i>I have to become his student,</i>
<i>memorise every move he ever made,</i>

585
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,749
<i>every attack he ever executed.</i>

586
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,431
<i>When he dropped a patient in an airtight</i>
<i>room surrounded by Secret Service agents.</i>

587
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,193
<i>When he took out that</i>
<i>businessman in the elevator.</i>

588
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,316
<i>His bullets untraceable, of course.</i>

589
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,117
<i>Or how no matter what the weapon</i>
<i>or how he eliminated his target,</i>

590
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,194
<i>he was always one chess move ahead.</i>

591
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,357
<i>One move more prepared.</i>

592
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,438
<i>One step quicker.</i>

593
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,398
<i>One shot more precise.</i>

594
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,312
<i>In fact, in all my research,</i>
<i>I found that he never missed a target.</i>

595
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,639
<i>Not until me.</i>
