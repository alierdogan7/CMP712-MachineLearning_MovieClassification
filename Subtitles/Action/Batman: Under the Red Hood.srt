01:07:32,488 --> 01:07:35,218
I can't. I'm sorry.

688
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:39,986
That is so sweet.

689
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:41,995
well, you won't have a choice.

690
01:07:55,444 --> 01:07:57,674
- I won't--
- This is what it's all been about.

691
01:07:57,847 --> 01:07:59,314
This.

692
01:07:59,482 --> 01:08:01,382
You, and me and him.

693
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,245
Now is the time you decide.

694
01:08:05,154 --> 01:08:09,181
if you won't kill
this psychotic piece of filth, I will.

695
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,122
if you wanna stop me,
you're gonna have to kill me.

696
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:16,025
- You know I won't--
- I'm gonna blow his deranged brains out.

697
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:19,361
And if you wanna stop it,
you are gonna have to shoot me.

698
01:08:19,535 --> 01:08:21,127
Right in my face.

699
01:08:21,303 --> 01:08:23,533
This is turning out even better
than I'd hoped.

700
01:08:34,383 --> 01:08:36,977
it's him or me, you have to decide.

701
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:40,721
Decide now. Do it.

702
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,223
Him or me? Decide.

I can't believe you got him.

You expert, rooting-tooting, eagle-eyed,
goth-loving marksman.

706
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:11,677
I love it.

707
01:09:11,854 --> 01:09:14,254
You managed to find a way to win.

708
01:09:14,423 --> 01:09:17,551
And everybody still loses.

709
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:28,026
No, don't spoil it. This is better.

710
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:33,502
I'm the only one who's gonna get
what he wants tonight.

711
01:09:33,676 --> 01:09:36,406
Yes, bing, bang, boom.

712
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:37,910
we all go out together.

WOMAN ON TV: Sources close to the
district attorney's office have intimated...

716
01:10:32,668 --> 01:10:35,398
...the case will likely be dropped
due to lack of evidence.

717
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:39,166
But the Black Mask is still under
investigation for his alleged complicity...

718
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:41,969
...in Joker's escape from Arkham.

719
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:44,873
The guards charged with aiding and abetting
the escape...

720
01:10:45,047 --> 01:10:47,914
...were found murdered
in the Gotham courthouse jail...

721
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:51,315
...while the alleged crime lord, Black Mask,
was released...

722
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:54,081
...on $1 million bail
for his suspected involvement...

723
01:10:54,256 --> 01:10:56,486
...and is currently awaiting a hearing.

724
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:59,719
Meanwhile, the Joker has been returned
to Arkham Asylum.

725
01:10:59,895 --> 01:11:02,193
Officials claim extra measures
have been taken...

726
01:11:02,364 --> 01:11:04,764
...to ensure another escape
would be impossible.

Black Mask was being strong-armed...

Sir:

730
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:24,510
in light of all the recent events,
would you like me to remove that?

No.

Perhaps he's primping.

As I recall, Master Richard spent nearly
half an hour admiring his reflection...

739

...the first time he donned his cape.
