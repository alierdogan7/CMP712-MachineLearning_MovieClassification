1
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,633
EXistenZ.
Written like this. One word.

2
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,878
Small "E," capital "X,"

3
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,797
capital "Z."

4
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,150
"EXistenZ."

5
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,438
It's new, it's from
Antenna Research and it's here,

6
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,589
right now.

7
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,599
We encourage consumer loyalty,
and want you to help our testing.

8
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,551
We're a team, Antenna and you.

9
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,996
Those of you who have come
to our invited seminars before

10
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,795
will know that I normally lead
the groups through new games.

11
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,229
But tonight it won't be me. No.

12
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,279
For our test launch
of eXistenZ by Antenna,

13
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
we have brought you
a special seminar leader.

14
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,149
(Audience chattering)

15
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,992
Yes, it is.

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,152
The world's greatest game designer
is here, in person,

17
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,959
to lead you, our first test enclave,

18
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,550
through her newest creation,
eXistenZ by Antenna.

19
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,918
I give you the game-pod
goddess herself, Allegra Geller.

20
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,918
(Audience cheering)

21
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,908
Allegra! Allegra! Yeah! Allegra!

22
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,477
The world of games
is in a kind of trance.

23
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,593
People are programmed
to accept so little,

24
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,509
but the possibilities
are so great.

25
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,753
EXistenZ is not just... a game.

26
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,555
It's an entirely new game system.

27
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,599
And, uh...
(Sighs)

28
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,148
It involves a lot of new toys,

29
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,676
which you are going
to be the first to try.

30
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,716
So...

31
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,631
(Cheering)

32
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,436
We have 12 prototype
MetaFlesh game-pods,

33
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,150
and that means for our first test
enclave we need 12 volunteers

34
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,639
to port into these slave units

35
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,473
with the game-pod goddess herself.

36
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,269
- OK, if I pick you...
- Hold it! Not so fast.

37
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,191
Oh, jeez. Right.

38
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm not late, am I?

39
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,589
You can be part of the second wave.

40
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,354
You, and the guy with the grey hair.

41
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,194
You, sir. This lady here.
Just come up. Thank you.

42
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,834
- Noel Dichter?
- Yes?

43
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,311
- I have to scan you.
- It's a weapons check?

44
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,518
More for recording devices. Lot
of money invested in these games.

45
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,875
We'll help you to port your pod

46
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,396
into your bio-ports
using Antenna Research's new...

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,029
- What's in this case?
- I brought my game-pod.

48
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,032
It's, uh, got original
Marway tissue architecture.

49
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,039
Even though I couldn't afford
the Antenna 15 upgrade,

50
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,829
- I figured out this method...
- You won't need it tonight.

51
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,592
Everything's provided for.

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,439
- How are you doin'?
- Two hours, tops?

53
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,273
Oh, two, three hours.

54
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,112
- So, three?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,155
(Geller) OK.

56
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,590
(Host) Everything's in order.
Ready, Allegra?

57
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,875
Sure, this is my favourite part.

58
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,757
Take it away.

59
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,758
All right.

60
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,356
I'm ready to download eXistenZ
by Antenna Research into all of you.

61
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,270
Now, I'm warning you.
It's going to be a wild ride.

62
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,237
But don't panic...

63
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,995
No matter what happens, OK?

64
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,878
See ya back here in no time at all.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,797
(Squealing)

66
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,239
She seems to be very shy.

67
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,438
Never occurred to me
that a big star would be shy.

68
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,115
She spends most of her time
alone designing her games.

69
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,112
She'd prefer it
if she never had to show them.

70
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,869
Death to the demoness
Allegra Geller!

71
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,359
- No!
- Aah!

72
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,079
(Confused shouts and screams)

73
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,794
Death to Antenna Research!

74
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,549
Aah!

75
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,554
(Gunshot)

76
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,519
(Gunshots)

77
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,109
Get her out of here.
Save her. There might be more.

78
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,196
- Go!
- Me take her?

79
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,189
We have enemies in our own house.
Trust no one! Trust no one.

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,315
Miss Geller, you're coming with me.

81
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,753
(Moaning)

82
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,393
I'm responsible for you.
You're supposed to come with me.

83
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,109
What are we gonna do out here?

84
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,517
Do you know your way around?
Know any country people?

85
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,797
Not country people, games people.

86
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,714
Countryside's full of
games development people:

87
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,196
Project coordinators,
little factories, you name it.

88
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,397
OK, you know your way around.
We can hide out.

89
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,277
Maybe.

90
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,915
It seems I have some enemies
I didn't know I had.

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,070
"Death to Allegra Geller."

92
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,515
Would you like hearing
someone with a gun screaming

93
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,437
"Death to Ted Pikul"?

94
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,275
Wow.

95
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,391
Hey, how'd you know my name?

96
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,516
You're labelled.

97
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,549
Yeah.

98
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,553
(Electronic beeping)

99
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,039
What's that?

100
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,759
It's my pink-fone.

101
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,633
Ted Pikul.

102
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,309
What happen... What?

103
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,197
Hey!

104
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,271
What did you do that for?

105
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,189
- That was our lifeline.
- That was a range finder.

106
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,198
- With that they know where we are.
- "They?"

107
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,475
- You mean head office.
- I mean anybody.

108
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,079
Pikul, why don't you have a gun?

109
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,151
- What?
- You're not armed.

110
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,431
You're my security,
but you have no weaponry.

111
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,354
Who told you that?
I'm just a marketing trainee.

112
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,839
Fucking hell.

113
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,436
I'm marked for death, and they
send me out with a PR nerd!

114
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,829
Marked for death.
Marked for death. Oh, jeez.

115
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,674
OK, don't sweat it, Pikul.

116
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,756
Don't sweat it. I'll handle it.

117
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,037
And, uh, right now we need to stop.

118
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,111
We do? Why?

119
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,511
So we can have
an intimate moment together.

120
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,669
If you're gonna do it, do it.

121
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,037
OK. OK?

122
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,712
Mm-hmm.

123
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,355
Ahh!

124
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,718
- Did somebody bite you?
- What?

125
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,352
(Thunder rumbling)

126
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,078
What I just dug out of you...

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,069
It's a tooth.

128
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,114
A human...

129
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,873
tooth.

130
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,869
Let me see that weirdo pistol.

131
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,673
Yep.

132
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,513
The bullets are human teeth.

133
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,280
This one's got a cavity.

134
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,719
That thing can get past any kind
of metal or synthetics detector.

135
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,677
It's all flesh and bone.

136
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,390
I suppose smaller calibre pistols
would have to fire baby teeth.

137
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,517
The tooth fairy could go
into the arms business.

138
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,676
- Where were you just now?
- I was wandering through eXistenZ.

139
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,711
The new system, I mean.

140
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,391
I like it in there.

141
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,957
'Course, without another player,
you're only a tourist.

142
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,031
It's frustrating.

143
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,435
Why won't you
let me contact Antenna?

144
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,118
(Groans)

145
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,234
They'll be going crazy
wondering what's happened.

146
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,832
I mean, it's not like
we've done something wrong.

147
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,112
We ran because we didn't know how
many of them there were, right?

148
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,036
We owe it to Antenna
to let them know you're all right,

149
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,874
and get them to send somebody to
help who knows what he's doing.

150
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
Besides, I can't...

151
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,436
I can't just keep doing this,
whatever it is,

152
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,152
you know, forever.

153
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,153
Not having any idea
when it's going... Hey!

154
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,110
- What are you doing?
- Where's your bio-port?

155
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,635
You've never been fitted?
I can't believe it.

156
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,439
No, I was never fitted.
What do you care?

157
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,159
You wanna get into the biz
and never played my games?

158
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,038
You've never played any game.

159
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,313
Look...

160
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,431
I've been dying to play your games,

161
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,357
but I have this phobia

162
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,194
about having my body
penetrated... surgically.

163
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,794
You know what I mean.

164
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,110
No. I'm not sure I do.

165
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,589
Getting a bio-port fitted.

166
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,875
I don't know. I can't do it.

167
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,077
It's too freaky.
Makes my skin crawl.

168
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,237
They just pop your spine
with a hydro-gun.

169
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,197
They shoot the plug into it.

170
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,037
It's like getting your ears pierced.

171
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,835
With only an infinitesimal chance
of permanent spinal paralysis.

172
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,151
- I've read about it.
- Hey, it's your chosen profession.

173
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,591
Besides,
once you're ported, zzzt,

174
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,831
there's no end
to the games you can play.

175
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,390
You can't seriously
wanna play games now?

176
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,358
Not while we're being hunted down
by crazy people.

177
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,631
My baby here
took a huge hit in the church.

178
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,754
One of those UmbyCords
got ripped out of her.

179
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,196
Ripped out of her,
just as the game architecture

180
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,750
was being downloaded from her
to all those slave-pods.

181
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,315
That's a very vulnerable
time for her.

182
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,594
She could be crying out for help
right here, right now.

183
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,236
The only way I can tell
if the game's not been contaminated,

184
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,676
if the pod is not about to be
crippled because of my negligence,

185
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,308
is to play eXistenZ

186
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,595
with somebody friendly.

187
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,594
Are you friendly,

188
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,517
or are you not?

189
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,673
Sure.

190
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,439
All right.

191
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,192
Let's do it.

192
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,111
Let's do it now.

193
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,999
Let me see. To get...

194
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,908
an illegal, unregistered
bio-port installed,

195
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,798
at about midnight,

196
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,475
we just drive up to your
local country gas station, right?

197
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,553
(Attendant humming)

198
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,030
Anything else I can do for you?

199
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,715
Well, Gas, you could check
your bio-port plugs.

200
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,075
The what? Sparkplugs?

201
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,997
You heard me.

202
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,476
My friend here
has a bio-port problem.

203
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,357
(Gas) A bio-port?

204
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,399
Now, that's a sorta hole
in your spine, isn't it?

205
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,959
Lots of assholes here,
but that's generally it.

206
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,792
I don't know why
you'd be talkin' to me, lady.

207
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,357
Sure you do.

208
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,431
Oh.

209
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,875
Ohh.

210
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,637
Allegra Geller,

211
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,228
you've changed my life.

212
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,637
What was your life like before?

213
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,512
Before?

214
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,029
Before it was changed
by Allegra Geller.

215
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,871
I operated a gas station.

216
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,477
You still operate a gas station.

217
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,758
Only on the most pathetic
level of reality.

218
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,389
Geller's work liberated me.

219
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,910
- Liberated?
- Did you ever play ArtGod?

220
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,669
- Capital "A," capital "G."
- I don't have a bio-port.

221
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,836
Thou, the player of the game ArtGod.
Very spiritual.

222
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,195
Funny too.

223
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,598
God, the artist,
the mechanic. Funny.

224
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,513
Here.

225
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,278
Those are sterilised, aren't they?

226
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,669
Don't worry.
The way they set things up

227
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,433
you could fire in a bio-port
in a slaughterhouse

228
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,590
and never generate an infection.

229
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,188
Then why the clean overalls?

230
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,798
It's a mental thing. Helps me focus.

231
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,189
The one thing you don't wanna do

232
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,510
is miss with the stud finder.

233
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,719
- Oh, God.
- God, the mechanic.

234
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,880
Step into my office.

235
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,632
(Clang)

236
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,836
(Squeaking)

237
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,390
(Hissing and crying)

238
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,992
(Beeping)

239
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,832
(Gas humming)

240
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,548
See? That didn't hurt, did it?

241
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,509
I didn't expect that to hurt.
I expect the next part to hurt.

242
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,635
Yeah, that's what I expect to hurt.

243
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,035
I haven't crippled anyone yet.

244
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,955
- How many have you done?
- Three.

245
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,674
Well, you'll be my third.

246
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,556
(Squealing)

247
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,795
Hey! Easy.

248
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,638
(Gas) Easy.

249
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,075
What's goin' on, Gas?

250
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,948
Hell, he's actin' like
I'm attackin' him.

251
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,315
People usually pay me to do this.

252
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,595
Yeah? All two of 'em!

253
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,435
As you can see, I've decided
not to have a bio-port installed.

254
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,076
This is it, you see?

255
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,153
This is the cage of your own making
which keeps you trapped

256
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,755
and pacing about in the smallest
possible space forever.

257
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,871
Break outta your cage, Pikul.

258
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,636
Break out now.

259
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,791
(Explosive hiss)
Unh!

260
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,156
(Groaning)

261
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,117
The swelling doesn't last long.

262
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,312
Tomorrow, you won't even notice it.

263
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,789
(Moaning) I love it.

264
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,677
Great.

265
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,914
What's going on?!
I can't move my legs!

266
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,276
The procedure comes
with its own epidural.

267
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,709
Just like when you have a baby.

268
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,156
Kinda like instant paralysis
from the waist down.

269
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,912
That's why it didn't hurt.

270
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,673
It'll wear off in no time.

271
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,749
I'm gonna go wash up.

272
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,997
You two, make yourselves at home.

273
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,596
You don't have to wait
for the swelling to go down.

274
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,230
You're gonna port into me...
while I'm paralysed?

275
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,919
You wanted to play my game,
didn't you?

276
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,389
Yeah, I did. I do, but...

277
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,431
Here? Now?

278
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,909
It's an instant-on world, isn't it?

279
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,075
What's that for? Feels... cold.

280
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,153
New ports are sometimes a bit tight.

281
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,872
Wouldn't wanna hurt ya.

282
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,749
How come...

283
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,952
bio-ports don't get infected?

284
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,877
I mean,

285
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,829
they open right into your body.

286
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,637
Listen to what
you're saying, Pikul.

287
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,557
Don't be ludicrous.

288
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,874
Don't you think
you could call me Ted?

289
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,838
Maybe afterwards.

290
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,155
Shit!

291
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,073
Pikul! I can't believe it.

292
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,479
You blew my pod!

293
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,149
- You must have neural-surged!
- What?

294
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,711
I jacked you in and you panicked.
Now it's totally fucked!

295
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,438
This is a disaster.

296
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,512
I was nervous, but I didn't panic.

297
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,799
I was forced to trust you and you
panicked and you neural-surged

298
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,677
and you blew my pod.

299
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
You can get a new pod.

300
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,429
Pikul,

301
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,917
in this pod is the only,

302
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,355
the original version of eXistenZ,

303
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,149
an entire game system
that cost 38 million to develop,

304
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,549
not including pre-release
marketing costs,

305
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,916
and I'm locked outside my own game.

306
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,560
I can't get me in or it out!

307
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,035
Are you serious?

308
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,793
That's the only version that exists?

309
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,874
It's the only one and it's stuck
inside and it's your fault.

310
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,158
I've devoted five passionate years
to this strange little creature.

311
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,949
And I've never regretted it, Pikul,

312
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,232
'cause it was the only thing
that could give my life any meaning.

313
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,958
Allegra,

314
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,837
why is it my fault?

315
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,717
I'm telling you I didn't...

316
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,519
I did not neural-surge. I didn't.

317
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,477
I didn't feel any surging.

318
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,596
(Gas) It's not your fault.

319
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,750
It's my fault.

320
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,829
Oh, no, Gas. Not you.

321
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,509
I wouldn't try to use
that bio-port again.

322
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,996
'Cept maybe
for a toaster or somethin'.

323
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,037
What's going on?

324
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,029
You're worth a lot of money...
if you're dead.

325
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,317
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

326
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,911
It's all over the countryside.
$5 million for her dead body.

327
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,917
No questions asked.

328
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,474
But, she changed your life.

329
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,870
Yep. And now I'm gonna change hers.

330
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,751
Wait! Why did you install
a bad port into me?

331
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,351
There's a big bonus for killing
Allegra Geller's latest game

332
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,040
or whatever it is.

333
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,588
I think I just did that, didn't I?

334
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,269
But can you kill me, Gas?
Can you kill a person?

335
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,148
Can you do that?

336
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,396
Hide my body?

337
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,080
Contact the crazies?

338
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,191
Trust them to pay up?

339
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,353
Hand over my now decaying,
fucking grotesque corpse?

340
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,358
Really expect them to
hand over five mil cash?

341
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,638
Don't you ever go
to the fucking movies?

342
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,630
I like your script.

343
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,390
I wanna be in it.

344
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,231
(Explosive hiss)

345
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,952
(Hissing)

346
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,110
Oh, God, I think he's dead.

347
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,272
- He wanted to kill you.
- Yep.

348
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,598
That's two people in one day...

349
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,636
who wanted to actually kill you.

350
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,996
I've never been more popular.

351
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,991
Allegra, we need help.

352
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,150
You're right.
I've gotta get this pod fixed.

353
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,797
(Pikul) We're going skiing?

354
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,592
(Squealing)

355
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,834
Hey. Hey.

356
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,190
Look at that huge bug.

357
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,031
It's got two heads.

358
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,032
It's not a bug.
It's a mutated amphibian.

359
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,869
It's a frog-salamander-lizard thing.

360
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,076
Sign of the times.

361
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,513
What happens if somebody
here wants to ski?

362
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,316
Come on, Pikul. Nobody actually
skis anymore. You know that.

363
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,595
No, don't use that!
And bring me the sterile wash.

364
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,517
(Knocking)

365
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,639
My darling.

366
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,190
Allegra Geller.

367
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,752
I'm so pleased and...
s-so astonished to see you here.

368
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,358
- Kiri Vinokur, Ted Pikul.
- Hello.

369
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,476
Sterile wash.

370
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,310
Um, I hear this ridiculous story

371
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,198
about some fatwa against you.

372
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,590
The company are desperately
trying to find you.

373
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,240
Is this really serious?
Are you in danger?

374
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,676
There have been a couple
of attempts on my life.

375
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,835
This is unbearable.

376
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,913
The company must stop this.
They owe you protection.

377
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,230
But I don't know
if they can do anything.

378
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,276
It's open season on me.

379
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,837
Well, you will be safe here.
I assure you.

380
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,595
I will contact Antenna right away
and have them come to collect you.

381
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,110
No, Kiri, don't. You mustn't
let anybody know that we're here.

382
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,795
I can't be sure that Antenna
is completely safe for me.

383
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,199
(Kiri) I understand. Yes.

384
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,475
You know,

385
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,231
you can hide out
in one of the guest chalets

386
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,191
as long as you like.

387
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,078
And I'll make sure
you get fresh towels.

388
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,473
And make sure I don't lose
everything in here.

389
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,317
You bet.

390
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,835
(Kiri speaking foreign language)

391
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,155
Take that.

392
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,759
Good.

393
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,437
Pull this back.

394
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,239
- What did you port into?
- Pikul's bio-port.

395
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,995
Really? That's what caused
all the damage.

396
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,517
It was, uh,
a flawed installation. My first.

397
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,159
(Kiri) Well...

398
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,360
it fried a lot
of very expensive neural webbing.

399
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,113
- You see?
- Looks like an animal.

400
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,037
Feels like you're operating
on somebody's pet dog.

401
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,592
I told you, Landry, we have
become glorified veterinarians.

402
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,234
Put a little in there, please.

403
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,310
The eXistenZ game-pod
is basically an animal, Mr Pikul.

404
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,790
It's grown from fertilised
amphibian eggs

405
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,354
stuffed with synthetic DNA.

406
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,670
Only Antenna Research has this.

407
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,633
Wow. Where do the batteries go?

408
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,717
Very funny.

409
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,909
He's not kidding.
He's a total PR nerd.

410
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,468
It ports into you.
You're the power source.

411
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,473
Your body, your nervous system,
your metabolism, your energy.

412
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,990
You get tired, run down,
it won't run properly.

413
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,389
(Kiri) OK.

414
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,199
Landry here
will finish up the pod work.

415
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,478
Now, let's, uh, get that
nasty bio-port out of you,

416
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,272
put a fresh one in.

417
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,990
Oww! It hurts.

418
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,196
I think it's infected.

419
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,271
No. It's not infected.

420
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,280
It's just excited.

421
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,390
It wants action.

422
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,233
But I don't want action -
me, I mean -

423
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,118
the bearer of the excited bio-port.

424
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,108
My baby here has now taken
three major hits, Pikul.

425
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,074
In the church, in the gas
station and on the operating table.

426
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,994
The only way I can tell
if everything's OK...

427
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,954
is to play eXistenZ
with somebody friendly.

428
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,949
Are you friendly,

429
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,270
or are you not?

430
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,190
You're telling me this thing
will run off my body's energy?

431
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,157
That's how they work.

432
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,278
See?
You're hummin' along already.

433
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,391
OK. EXistenZ.

434
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,432
Only from Antenna.

435
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,028
- Here we go.
- You...

436
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,594
You've got an unfair
advantage, don't you?

437
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,191
How can I possibly compete
with the designer of the system?

438
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,957
Well, you could beat the guy
that invented poker, couldn't you?

439
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,591
(Squealing)

440
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,911
(Electronic beeping)

441
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,550
(1st Man) That one?
(2nd Man) Yes.

442
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,989
(1st Man) Are you sure?
(2nd Man) Yes.

443
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,318
(1st Man) I wouldn't recommend it.
The graphics on this one are better.

444
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,355
(1st Man) This is the one you want.
(2nd Man) That one?

445
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,954
That was beautiful.

446
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,232
(Electronic beeping)

447
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,675
I feel just like me.

448
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,228
Is that kind of transition normal?
That kinda...

449
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,111
smooth interlacing
from place to place?

450
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,872
It depends on the style of the game.

451
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,679
You can get jagged,
brutal cuts, slow fades,

452
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,320
shimmering little morphs.

453
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,475
This is amazing.

454
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,757
I had no idea.

455
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,674
Look at this.
Games I've never heard of.

456
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,395
Wait a minute. That reminds me.

457
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,235
What precisely is the goal
of the game that we're playing now?

458
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,311
You have to play the game

459
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,954
to find out why you're playing.

460
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,429
It's the future, Pikul.

461
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,630
You'll see how natural it feels.

462
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,953
Look at this.

463
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,991
Can this be the future?
Ever see anything like this?

464
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,319
These are delicate.
You got to be careful.

465
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,550
Yes, I can imagine.

466
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,150
Cortical Systematics
is the latest and the hottest.

467
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,397
Not just a new game,
but a new system.

468
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,631
Will it work with
an industry-standard bio-port?

469
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,670
I'm D'arcy Nader.

470
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,918
Welcome to D'arcy Nader's
Game Emporium.

471
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,595
Is there anything I can be,
oh, uh, helpin' you with?

472
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,194
We're just looking.

473
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,274
I have what you're lookin' for.

474
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,708
Who sent you?

475
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,715
It's none of your business.

476
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,832
We're here. That's all that matters.

477
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,034
God. What happened?

478
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,872
I-I didn't mean to say that.

479
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,474
It's your character who said it.

480
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,832
Kind of a schizophrenic feeling,
isn't it? You'll get used to it.

481
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,157
Things need saying to advance
the plot and establish characters,

482
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,516
they get said
whether you wanna say them or not.

483
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,189
Don't fight it. Just go with it.

484
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,959
Should you say this in front of him?

485
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,471
Look at him.

486
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,792
- What's he doing?
- He's in a game loop.

487
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,000
He won't come out of it until you
give him some proper game dialogue.

488
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,115
Uh, this is tricky.

489
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,797
Repeat your last line.

490
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,714
Include his name
so he knows you're talking to him.

491
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,191
We're here, D'arcy Nader,
and that's all that matters.

492
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,117
Yes, you're right.

493
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,152
That is all that matters.

494
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,517
Now, you said you have what we want.

495
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,108
We're waiting.

496
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,437
You're going to need
these micro-pods

497
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,711
to download your new identities.

498
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,872
I assume that you both
have had these

499
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,437
industry-standard bio-ports
that you mentioned installed.

500
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
Yes, of course.
We both have bio-ports.

501
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,751
- We do, don't we?
- I assumed we did.

502
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,909
In the game we might not.

503
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,195
We better check.

504
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,795
Yeah, it's there. Looks
a little different, but it's there.

505
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,673
Yeah, I see what you mean.

506
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,955
Yes, we both have bio-ports.

507
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,792
Good.

508
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,758
Port in, a-and this will tell ya
all you need to know...

509
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,751
for now.

510
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,196
I'm-I'm gonna leave
while you two, uh,

511
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,311
finish up here, because, uh,

512
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,518
it wouldn't be good
for us all to be seen together.

513
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,759
(Door closes)

514
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,753
I assume that Nader
is our entry point into the game.

515
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,350
- Yeah. Kinda disappointing.
- Nader?

516
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,795
Yeah. He's not very well-drawn.

517
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,957
His dialogue was just so-so,
his accent...

518
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,472
Yeah.

519
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,197
OK.

520
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,675
Pods are so small.

521
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,435
They plug directly
into the bio-port.

522
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,153
OK.

523
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,988
(Squishing)

524
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,479
- Oh God!
- What?

525
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,477
The whole pod
just disappeared into your back.

526
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,551
It disappeared into my back?

527
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,518
It's in my spine?!
It's around my spinal cord?!

528
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,273
It's just a game.

529
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,157
Do you feel anything yet?

530
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,718
No, I don't.

531
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,360
I don't feel a thing.

532
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,273
- Want me to do you?
- Yeah.

533
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,038
What the hell was that?

534
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,072
That wasn't me.
It was my game character.

535
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,720
I wouldn't have done that.
Not here, anyway.

536
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,835
Our characters are obviously
supposed to jump on each other.

537
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,354
It's most probably a...

538
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,474
pathetically mechanical attempt...

539
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,235
to heighten the emotional tension
of the next game sequence.

540
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,795
- No use fighting it, huh?
- What about... our new identities?

541
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,314
Do you feel yours yet?

542
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,476
They'll take care of themselves.

543
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,437
(Moaning)

544
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,513
I'm very worried about my body.

545
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,955
(Gasping) Your what?

546
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,556
Where are our real bodies?

547
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,350
Are they all right? What if they're
hungry? What if there's danger?

548
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,519
They're just where we left them.

549
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,670
They're sitting quietly.

550
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,075
Eyes closed.

551
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,069
It's, um, just like meditating.

552
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,877
I feel really vulnerable.

553
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,030
- Disembodied.
- OK.

554
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,195
Don't sweat it.
