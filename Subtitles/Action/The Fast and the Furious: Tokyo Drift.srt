287
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:28,999
What is the rate?

288
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:32,443
Since when you worried so much
about the detail?

289
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,476
When is the driving, han?

290
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,199

00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:27,721

Trust me, you don't want to a 
part of this world

Your don't know anything about me

301
00:40:35,284 --> 00:40:37,559
Why do you think I don't?

302
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,199
Cause I am a 'gaijin'? 
an outsider?

303
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:43,439
Let me guess

304
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:48,638

312
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:28,597

313
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,198

314
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:34,721

318
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:50,761


319
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,513


320
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,642
50% of esomething is better than
100% of nothing

321
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:01,123

00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:17,841


328
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,042
Why are you letting me race?

329
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,240

00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,679
Police's cars are just a factory tube.

334
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,644
If you can do better than 180k, 
they will never catch you

335
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:08,278
They dont even try

336
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:11,797

337
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:14,074

00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:54,597

354
00:44:57,604 --> 00:45:00,721


355
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,278


356

370
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:08,436

386
00:49:20,944 --> 00:49:21,535
This must be some misunderstanding

387
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:24,179

405
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:06,620

409
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:22,896


410
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:31,276

411
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,373
This is my Mexico

412
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:42,028

413
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:43,550

414
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,005

415
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:48,253

417
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:55,634


418
00:51:57,244 --> 00:52:00,294


419
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:08,554
that's the price I can live with.

420
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,943
Look all those people down there

421
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,499

422
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:21,583


423
00:52:24,064 --> 00:52:25,179
What happens if it is not this way?

424
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:28,537
Very simple

425
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,462
you make choices and you dont look back

426
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:49,058
So, if you dont drift to win,
what are you drift for?

427
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:51,455
You really want to know?

428
00:52:52,824 --> 00:52:53,256

429
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:55,214

432
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:17,694


433
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:21,349


434
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:24,460

437
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:43,591
You will see it

438
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:46,273


439
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:52,555

00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:36,473


445
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:44,677
Go Go Go 

446
00:55:54,164 --> 00:55:55,358
Not bad!

447
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:57,723
Dont lose grip!

448
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:36,761


449
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:39,073


450
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:44,080


451
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:52,680
Get this man a bunk

452
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:08,876
That the way to do business

453
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:14,677
Well this way!

457
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,313


458
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:01,993


459
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:05,594
I hate that word

460
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:08,158
They use to call me when I was a kid

461
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:12,439
I thought you were born here

462
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:13,156
Well

463
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,963


464
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:22,402
My mother died when I was 10

465
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:26,644


466
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,283


467
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:31,079


468
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,534
DK's granmother took me in ...

469
00:59:40,404 --> 00:59:42,076
My parents have separated when I was 3

470
00:59:44,404 --> 00:59:46,042
me and mom moves around a lot
 
471
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,494
mostly because of me

472
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:52,593
In fact it was all because of me.

473
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:55,875


474
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,823


475
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:03,839


476
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:07,973


477
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:10,953


478
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:33,358


479
01:00:35,044 --> 01:00:37,035


480
01:00:37,444 --> 01:00:40,675


481
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,233


482
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:56,240


483
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:59,156


484
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:02,593


485
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:05,599
The day I got my license is also
the day I got my first speeding ticket

486
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:07,363


487
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:10,202
The day after I won my first race

488
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:13,116


489
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:15,475


490
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:17,394


491
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:20,359


492
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,597
Everything between us are a dream

493
01:01:25,124 --> 01:01:26,193
No past
No future

494
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:27,841
No problems

495
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:31,474
Just the moment

496
01:01:56,164 --> 01:01:56,755

01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:06,874
No, that is your third set today

501
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:08,034

01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:22,238

What do you expect?

509
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,114
You play with fire

510
01:03:08,464 --> 01:03:10,083
And throws yourself with gasolin

511
01:03:34,284 --> 01:03:35,332

01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:44,113

01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:00,354
We are the same

525
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:07,673
Difference is I know who I am
and where I am from

526
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:15,078
Do you know who you are?

527
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:19,280
Do you know who you really are?

528
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,353

You have come to a wrong place

616

I didn't come here to see you

617
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:55,743


618
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,020


619
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:01,805


620
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:04,573


621
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:22,975
You think

622
01:22:24,584 --> 01:22:27,382
You can walk in here with some cash

623
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:28,973
And walk out

624
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:33,774

01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:38,179

626
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:41,056
I come here to apologize

627
01:22:43,624 --> 01:22:46,741

ourself badly

628
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:49,137


629
01:22:50,744 --> 01:22:51,381


630
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:55,254


631
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:56,775


632
01:22:59,744 --> 01:23:02,702
Sir, I come here to offer you a piece
of solution

633
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:07,940
How do you plan to accomplish that?

634
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:10,580
A race

635
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:18,175
D.K. and I cause nothing but trouble for you

636
01:23:19,384 --> 01:23:19,975
For us

637
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,975
I'm asking you to allow us to settle this

638
01:23:24,744 --> 01:23:26,176
Once and for all

639
01:23:27,784 --> 01:23:28,455
We race

640
01:23:31,064 --> 01:23:32,543


641
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:34,543


642
01:23:35,984 --> 01:23:36,336
Good

643
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:39,935
That should be easy

644
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:19,739
The cops have got the cars

645
01:25:38,824 --> 01:25:39,540


646
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:04,574
we almost there

647
01:26:05,584 --> 01:26:06,778
just a little more tweak

648
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,699
It is not the car i'm worry about

649
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:13,536
D.K. pick this road for a reason

650
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,580
This is a mountain

651
01:26:18,184 --> 01:26:19,697
It is where nobody ever make it to the bottom

652
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:47,654
Dead Charger

653
01:34:53,144 --> 01:34:54,702


654
01:35:30,444 --> 01:35:32,162
Hey, shawn

655
01:35:33,244 --> 01:35:33,960
check this out, man

656
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:36,916
there is someone over here
want to race our new DK

657
01:35:39,244 --> 01:35:41,474
heard that to be all people around asia too

658
01:35:41,964 --> 01:35:42,874
Not tonight, Twink

659
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:48,560
he said he knew Han

660
01:35:55,364 --> 01:35:56,883
said Han was family

661
01:36:11,204 --> 01:36:11,681

662
01:36:13,004 --> 01:36:14,356
Let race!

663
01:36:23,204 --> 01:36:29,154
Dead Charger

664
01:36:40,764 --> 01:36:41,860
nice ride

665
01:36:43,084 --> 01:36:45,279
I wonder if my friend Han have to 
use it years ago

666
01:36:48,084 --> 01:36:49,433
I didn't know he was in 
the Amerika's muscles

667
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:52,596


668
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:57,477
Notice I know a 10 seconds race

669
01:36:58,884 --> 01:37:00,203
I got nothing but time

670
01:37:04,564 --> 01:37:05,280
You ready kid?

671
01:37:20,004 --> 01:37:20,993
Ready!

672
01:37:24,364 --> 01:37:25,435
Set!

673
01:37:30,164 --> 01:37:30,866

674
01:37:33,364 --> 01:37:40,103
