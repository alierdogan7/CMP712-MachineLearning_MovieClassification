872
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:23,859
Hey, Boyd. You got any money? I was
gonna get a bottle for the road.

873
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:28,330
Hey, ponytail just said
something to the other one

874
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,065
about Darryl calling his boss on Martes.

875
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,601
You don't even have to
tell me what that means.

876
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,970
Darryl had this planned the whole time.

877
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,038
Yes, Sir.

878
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,639
Y'all want to go home?

879
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,508
What do you want to do?

880
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,744
You heard the man.

881
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:44,213
Let's go home!

882
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:46,815
BOYD: Shotgun!

883
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,884
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

884
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:54,022
You find Kendal?

885
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:54,923
I did.

886
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,258
Safe and sound.
That's a relief.

887
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,229
You gonna invite me in or keep
me out in the hallway all night?

888
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:03,665
Sure. Come on.

889
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,368
Something the matter?
No.

890
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,937
Want me to open a bottle of wine for you?

891
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,539
Mmm... Nah.

892
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,941
Well, I'm gonna get a beer.

893
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:13,443
All right.

894
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,310
I'm sorry about all this, by the way.

895
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,513
You understand why I
hesitated to get involved.

896
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,615
Oh, don't...
Don't apologize, please.

897
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,651
Miss Crowe's gonna keep her
word, nullify your suspension.

898
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,587
You may have your boss watching
your every move for a while,

899
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,655
but you'll be back at work.

900
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:31,059
Good, 'cause I cannot waste
another day stuck in this place.

901
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,095
About Florida...
Yeah.

902
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:33,762
I'm good. I'm ready.

903
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,433
- Uh-huh.
- We might want to scale back the extravagance a bit.

904
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,837
I, uh, gave away the contest
money to charity... Well,

905
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,273
Kendal, on a whim.

906
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,874
Really?
That's unexpected.

907
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,443
You're telling me.
Huh.

908
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,578
Us going wasn't tied
to that money, though.

909
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,147
I mean, we can go tomorrow morning.

910
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,383
But now I'm due back at work.

911
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,418
Right.

912
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:00,923
Well, I can always enter another
contest, if you don't mind waiting.

913
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,159
That way, we can plan it out,
do it up right.

914
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,328
Go, say, end of next month.

915
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,132
We're not going to Florida, Raylan.

916
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,935
You seem very sure about that.

917
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,170
Yeah, unfortunately.

918
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,106
So...

919
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,008
Yeah.

920
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,377
I'm breaking it off.

921
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,981
How about that.
