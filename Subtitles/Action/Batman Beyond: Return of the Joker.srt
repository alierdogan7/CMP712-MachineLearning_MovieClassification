1
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:21,292
Stay back!

2
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,676
He should've said "heel".

3
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,765
Slag it!

4
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:06,034
-He's got a delicate touch, Dee Dee.
-Delicate like a moose, Dee Dee.

5
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:13,239
I hate ripping this heavy junk.
Give me cash cards any day.

6
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:18,578
Zip it, Bonk.
Plan is get in and get out fast.

7
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:24,715
It's a school night, boys and girls.
I'm gonna have to call your folks.

8
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,316
Bonk! Don't!

9
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,257
Yeah, Bonk.
Don't.

10
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,150
Let's go! Dee Dee,
 open the door.

11
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,792
On the double.

12
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:56,954
Incoming!

13
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:08,536
Bonk! You moron!
Get back here!

14
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:54,377
You got a death wish,
 Bats!

15
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,209
And I thought I was just
being a good citizen.

16
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,348
Got you, sis!

17
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,427
Flagpole.

18
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,956
What did you say?

19
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:17,632
Flagpole.

20
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,576
Come on!

21
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,812
That ain't coming 
out of my allowance.

22
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,579
Still got it.

23
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,297
How did it go with the Jokerz?

24
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,764
I broke up the robbery,
but it was weird.

25
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:49,139
Third time this month that particulary
gang intercepted high-tech machinery.

26
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,740
Jokerz don't use that stuff.

27
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:54,634
They're probably fencing it.
Corporate espionage is big business.

28
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,206
I'll sit tight until
I can get another shot at them.

29
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:00,644
Hey,
lookie here.

30
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,918
That's right,
Tom.

31
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,179
Today, Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne
stunned the financial world...

32
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,918
... with his plan to resume active
leadership of Wayne Enterprises.

33
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:12,028
While shareholders have generally
welcomed Wayne's return...

34
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,995
...support from some key members of the
Wayne board has been oddly lukewarm.

35
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,727
Company operations manager,
Jordan Pryce, offered this comment:

36
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,600
I, of course, join the rest of our
Wayne Enterprises family...

37
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:27,143
...in welcoming back our most valuable
senior resource, Bruce Wayne.

38
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,610
I'm sure we'll all profit
from his years of experience.

39
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,480
Still, the day to day rigors of running
a vast, multinational conglomerate...

40
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,846
... would be stressful,
even for a young man.

41
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,250
I hope Mr. Wayne is up
to the challenge.

42
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:41,254
He's not bitter,
 much.

43
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,993
Pryce was next in line
for the top spot.

44
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:47,422
My return torpedoed any dreams
he had of succession.

45
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,192
-You gonna keep him around?
-If he'll stay on my terms.

46
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:55,100
I've worked long and hard to regain
control of my family's company.

47
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:56,865
I won't hand it over again.

48
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:01,010
Pryce can either get with that program
or start e-mailing his résumé.

49
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,677
With all the long hours you'll planning
on putting in at the office...

50
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,442
...does this mean
you'll have less time for....

51
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,341
Who sleeps anymore?

52
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:12,846
You okay?

53
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,152
The Jokerz are going in
for splicing now.

54
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,625
Crazy hyena-boy nearly took a bite out of me.
No way I could explain that to Dana.

55
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:21,129
You're not going out now?

56
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,961
The night is young and so am I.

57
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:25,831
I think a good night's rest
might be more beneficial.

58
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:28,798
Like you said,
who sleeps anymore?

59
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,711
Up and at them,
Terry.

60
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,283
You can doze on Bruce Wayne's time,
not mine.

61
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:45,922
Sorry, Dane.

62
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:14,046
Great song,
 huh?

63
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,753
Did you see the squid Blade's with?
P.U.!

64
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,918
Ter,
 my head's on fire.

65
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,695
You look good.

66
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,389
McGinnis!

67
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,971
Sorry, babe. Guess the day
was longer than I thought.

68
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,677
Let's sit this one out.

69
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,211
Coffee.
 And leave the pot.

70
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,912
Batman showed up 
and we had to ditch.

71
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,081
We were able to save this:
the console's memory board.

72
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,759
I know it's not much but--

73
00:11:57,296 --> 00:12:00,561
It's not much?
 It's nothing.

74
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:04,668
Losers.

75
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,495
All of you.

76
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:10,767
A disgrace to the name Joker.
Why, in my day--

77
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,341
In your day?!

78
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:14,774
Ever since you cone
your way into this gang...

79
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,916
...it's been "your day" this
and "your day" that.

80
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,048
Bonk.

81
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,014
Your day is over,
 old man.

82
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,279
Even if you are who you say you are.
And personally, I think you're a fake.

83
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,221
Ah,
brave new world...

84
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,691
...
that has such putzes in it.

85
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:34,863
He's got us running around ripping
a lot of geek junk, but no cash!

86
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:38,460
He won't tell us what his plan is,
if he even has one.

87
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,605
I want out!

88
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:42,465
If you insist.

89
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:49,979
Hey, man. Take it easy.
I was just kidding.

90
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,913
So was I.

91
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,524
Oops. No,
 I wasn't.

92
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,201
That's also how we 
did it in my day.

93
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:18,466
You know, kids, a lot has changed
while your old Uncle Joker's been away.

94
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:21,009
New Gotham,
new rules...

95
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,541
...
even a new Batman.

96
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:28,184
But now I'm tanned,
 I'm rested...

97
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:32,552
...and I'm ready to give
this old town a wedgie again!

98
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,692
I have to know 
you're with me.

99
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:38,759
-Will you say it for me one time?
-We're with you.

100
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,792
-Little louder.
-We're with you!

101
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,197
Dee Dee?

102
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,836
-We're with you!
-Boys?

103
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,941
-We're with you.
-Bonk?

104
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,243
Alright.

105
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,202
Dead.

106
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,740
Dee Dee, be lam
and sweap out the trash.

107
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,349
There's good girls.

108
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:05,392
Your renewed faith puts
a smile in my heart.

109
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:08,629
What's if we forget tonight
mishappen and start over...

110
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,894
Great, boss.

111
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:14,860
Ghoul, my boy, we're going
to need another systems scanner.

112
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,591
Who's got one
they'd be willing to donate?

113
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:18,996
Checking.

114
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,635
What we're after 
is cutting-edge.

115
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,740
These are the only other places
we'd find one.

116
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,543
Nope.

117
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,004
No.

118
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:32,105
What, there?
Security's gonna be tight!

119
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:35,948
Oh, yes.
 But think of the fun.

120
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,192
Good evening,
 Mr. Wayne.

121
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,431
Ms. Carr. You remember
my assistant, Terry McGinnis?

122
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:49,032
Of course. I'm glad
you could join us, Terry.

123
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:54,268
Everyone is here. Well, everyone
except Mr. Pryce, unfortunately.

124
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,030
That's no surprise.

125
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,039
May I have your attention,
 please?

126
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:03,577
It's my pleasure to welcome back
the guiding light of this company:

127
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,211
Bruce Wayne.

128
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,682
Thank you,
 Joyce.

129
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:19,023
It's a pleasure to see you all again.
In the future, I hope to--

130
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,635
--spend time getting to know
each member of our company...

131
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,365
...learning about 
you individually.

132
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,261
Security!

133
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,592
Emergency on terrace level.

134
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,033
Hey!
Look out!

135
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,957
-You gonna be okay?
-Go to work.

136
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,653
Well,
if it isn't old Mr. Wayne.

137
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:27,725
So debonair.

138
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,024
So dapper.

139
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:32,999
So decrepit.

140
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:47,980
Hello, Gotham!

141
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:50,177
Joker's back in town!

142
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,692
It can't be.

143
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:59,091
Oh, no, your old eyes
do not deceive you, Brucie!

144
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:02,095
After all, who'd know me
better than you?

145
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,028
Back off,
 gruesome.

146
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,141
Ah,
 the new boy.

147
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,538
Ears are too long
and I miss the cape...

148
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,577
...but not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.

149
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:18,875
Woof!

150
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,821
-How's it coming, boys?
-We're home free.

151
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,520
Then I'll see you there.

152
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,338
Time to go,
 Dee Dee.

153
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,574
Well?
What's it gonna be, Batfake?

154
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,576
I know what you're thinking.
I messed up.

155
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,972
I let the clown go
to save those people.

156
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,712
You did the right thing.

157
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:04,049
So, the Joker, huh? Looks pretty spry
for a guy who's gotta be, what?

158
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,518
Mid-eighties?

159
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,020
Any theories on that?

160
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,384
Clone?

161
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,854
Robot?

162
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,624
Suspended animation due to floating
around frozen in a block of ice?

163
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,323
Shut up and drive.

164
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,057
Yes, sir.

165
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:31,748
This was the scene three hours ago, as a
man claiming to be the legendary Joker...

166
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,851
...disrupted a ceremony at the newly
open Wayne Enterprises building.

167
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,576
Honey,
 what're you watching?

168
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:41,587
Adding to the drama was another
legendary Gotham icon, the Batman...

169
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,192
... who engaged his one-time foe
in a stunning aerial battle.

170
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:46,654
Honey?

171
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,262
It's nothing,
 sweetheart.

172
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,233
Nothing.

173
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:02,601
Go away.

174
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:03,935
Morning,
 commish.

175
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:06,809
You understand English, McGinnis?
Scram.

176
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:10,213
Love to. But first, what can you
tell me about clowns?

177
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,782
In this town 
they're never funny.

178
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,513
I noticed that.

179
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,557
-Now, this Joker--
-Drop it, kid.

180
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:22,731
-That's what the old man's been saying.
-Listen to him.

181
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,993
Hey look, I know this fruitcake was a big,
bad guy from the cape and cowl days.

182
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:28,568
He was more than that.

183
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,967
What? A wacko
who threatened people...

184
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:33,576
...with whoopee cushions
and squirting flowers?

185
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,903
-Big deal. I'm shaking.
-McGinnis!

186
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:43,578
The Joker, the real Joker, was unlike
anyone you've ever faced.

187
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,721
For your sake,
 I hope you never do.

188
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:48,288
If Bruce wants you to drop it,
then drop it.

189
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:53,259
-Commissioner, your 9:00 is here.
-Send him in.

190
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:54,553
You were leaving?

191
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,490
Figure I was.

192
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,880
-Thanks for seeing me, Barb.
-That's what I'm here for.

193
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,500

196
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,935
...unless our dear Dark Knight
stops me first!

197
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:45,646
Hello, Gotham.
Joker's back in town!

198
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,340
VOICE MATCH
IDENTICAL

199
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:55,653
It's funny.

200
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:59,453
I know about all of your other major
enemies but you never mention him.

201
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:03,926
-He was the biggest, wasn't he?
-It wasn't a popularity contest.

202
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,797
He was a psychopath.
A monster.

203
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:10,364
So how is it possible he could still
be around after all this time?

204
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,365
It's not possible.

205
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,544
He died years ago.

206
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:15,733
You're sure?

207
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:17,445
I was there.

208
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,246
You killed him,
didn't you?

209
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,459
He was gonna do something so terrible,
you had no other choice.

210
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,058
-Terry--
-That was it, wasn't it?

211
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:37,567
I want you to give back
the Batman suit.

212
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,061
What? Why?

213
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,897
There is no reason for you
to continue.

214
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:45,576
You've made your father's killers
pay for his murder.

215
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:50,073
...then put your own needs aside to help
the city when it most needed a hero.

216
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,080
You've honored the reputation of Batman
many times over and for that I thank you.

217
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:56,340
Then why?

218
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,753
I had no right to force this life
on you or anyone else.

219
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,018
I was the one who broke in
and swiped the suit, remember?

220
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:08,757
Yes, there was my dad's murder, but we
come from two different worlds, Mr. Wayne.

221
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:11,263
I wasn't like you
or the kids you took in.

222
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:14,999
I was a pretty bad kid once.

223
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:18,935
Ran with a rough crowd, broke a lot of
laws and say nothing to my folks' hearts.

224
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,705
The kind of punk you wouldn't have wasted
a second punch on back in that day.

225
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,036
Your point?

226
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:27,214
I'm trying to make 
up for past sins.

227
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:31,615
The state says my 3 months in juvie wiped
me clean, but my soul tells me different.

228
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:36,125
Every time I put on that suit is my
chance to help people who are in trouble.

229
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,221
I guess on a personal level...

230
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,662
...it's a chance to look like
a worthwhile human being again.

231
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,799
In my eyes,
no one else's.

232
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:48,396
It's what I want,
 Bruce.

233
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,067
Stupid kid.

234
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,240
You don't know what you want.
None of you ever did.

235
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:33,047
Mom, come quick!
Some weirdo broke into our house!

236
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:37,584
-Matty? What are you yelling about?
-There's a stranger's sitting at our table!

237
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:40,654
-Ha, ha.
-That's your brother.

238
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:44,292
I've never seen him 
before in my life.

239
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:48,364
It is rare that you're up before noon, Terry
what with your job and all.

240
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,166
I'm not working for Mr.
 Wayne anymore.

241
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,971
Well, it will be nice to have you home
for a change. Right, Matt?

242
00:24:57,173 --> 00:25:00,871
Sure. Great. Just when I was
getting used to being an only child.

243
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,373
Mom!

244
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:14,980
Once in a while, we have to do it, Dane.
Ditch the guys and go out by ourselves.

245
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:19,288
It may be a change for you, Chelsea. I don't
see enough of Terry to know the difference.

246
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:23,297
Terry's sweet and all, but who says
you can't make friends with someone new?

247
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,557
Not a chance.

248
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,130
Terry!

249
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:29,536
I thought you'd be 
working as usual.

250
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:33,807
The bad news is, for the time being,
I'm not gonna have much money coming in.

251
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,570
The good news is,
you have me all to yourself.

252
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,875
I can live with that.

253
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,259
Cutting in.

254
00:25:58,801 --> 00:25:59,894
Hey!

255
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:07,366
Dana?

256
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:23,080
What is it,
 boy?

257
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:26,159
Ace.

258
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,059
Ace!

259
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:03,992
Don't get up, Bruce. It's just
an old friend come by to say hello.

260
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:13,204
Hello...

261
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:15,009
...Batman.

262
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,678
Dana!

263
00:27:24,954 --> 00:27:26,444
It was her.

264
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:19,025
Don't know why the boss

265
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,847
wants a dreg like you
outta the way, but...

266
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,778
hey,
as long as it's fun...

267
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:57,835
Terry!

268
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:00,275
Dana!

269
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,678
-Let me go!
-Sure, cutes.

270
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:14,222
Slag him!

271
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:31,105
-Dana?
-Stay out of sight!

272
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,221
There!

273
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:06,132
What's he doing?

274
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,740
You got me.

275
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,538
Just finish him!

276
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:32,832
You made a mess,
 dreg.

277
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:44,773
Dana!

278
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:48,436
She's got a bad bump and some cuts,
but she's gonna be okay.

279
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,851
-Why were those guys after you?
-I don't know.

280
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:54,544
Look I'm gonna talk to the cops.
Stay with her, okay, Chels?

281
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:57,347
-I'll come as soon as I can.
-Sure.

282
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:15,005
Leave a message.

283
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:17,871
Hey, the Joker's little playmates
were after me tonight.

284
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,635
Me, not Batman.

285
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:21,972
This whole thing stinks, Wayne,
and you know why.

286
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:26,983
I need some straight answers from--
Wait, it's night. Where does he go?

287
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:49,005
Wayne?

288
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:50,602
Wayne!

289
00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:56,673
Ace.

290
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:13,365
Please,
 God, no.

291
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,018
Floor...

292
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,457
...under...

293
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:52,065
...table.

294
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:28,395
How is he?

295
00:32:28,776 --> 00:32:32,268
The anti-toxin's done all it can.
It's up to him now.

296
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,003
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

297
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:36,182
Who else is there?

298
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:40,015
That reminds me. I'd better
check on our other patient.

299
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:44,690
What have I done?

300
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:48,351
I killed the little rabbit.

301
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,095
I don't deserve to live!

302
00:32:58,403 --> 00:33:00,167
How you doing,
 killer?

303
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:05,806
Yeah,
rough night for me too.

304
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:08,644
Sad news from the financial world
this morning.

305
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:13,250
The return of Bruce Wayne to his family
company has been delayed due to an accident.

306
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,388
Wayne Enterprises' Jordan Pryce
had this to say:

307
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:19,787
We received a call from
Mr. Wayne's houseboy this morning...

308
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:22,484
...saying Mr. Wayne
had taken a bad fall.

309
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:26,826
Everyone at the Wayne Enterprises' family
sends their prayers and good wishes...

310
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:30,433
...to our senior member
for his speedy recovery.

311
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:34,864
I'll bet. Not every creep in Gotham
wears a purple suit.

312
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:37,009
It'd make my job 
simpler if they did.

313
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:41,314
The Joker knew about Bruce, about me,
probably about you too.

314
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,476
Someone knows,
 I'll give you that.

315
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,580
But it's not the Joker.
Not the real one.

316
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:48,846
Bruce said he was dead.

317
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:51,086
And?

318
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:52,719
That's it.

319
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,690
I know there's more.

320
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:57,989
Barbara, I'm part of this. I need
the answers Bruce can't give me.

321
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:00,163
I deserve them.

322
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:09,103
I thought talking about it
would get easier over time...

323
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,210
...but some hurts
never go away.

324
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,840
Dick Grayson,
 Nightwing, had left...

325
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,710
...to establish himself
in another city.

326
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:22,621
There were three of us then:
Bruce, myself and Robin, Tim Drake.

327
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:35,929
Robin was alone when
he came upon a woman in trouble.

328
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,460
Help!
Help!

329
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,932
Somebody,
 please, help!

330
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,009
Hero time.

331
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:55,411
-That evens things up a little.
-Not really, bird-boy!

332
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:05,025
A bird in the hand.

333
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,958
We soon realized 
Tim was missing.

334
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:16,132
Night after night we scoured the city,
running down every lead...

335
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:18,708
...pressing every
underworld connection.

336
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:25,317
But no one had seen 
any sign of Robin.

337
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:29,152
For three agonizing weeks
there was nothing.

338
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:32,951
Then one night,
we were sent an invitation.

339
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,413
Arkham.

340
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:09,657
The asylum had been moved
to a newer, high-security building.

341
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:12,489
The old building had been
partially demolished...

342
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:15,326
...and hung open 
like a rotting wound.

343
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:26,342
Hush, little baby,
 don't say a word

344
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:31,039
Mama's gonna buy 
you a mocking bird

345
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,550
And if that 
mocking bird don't sing

346
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:40,250
Mama's gonna buy 
you a diamond ring

347
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,396
And if that diamond 
ring turns brass

348
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:50,601
Mama's gonna buy 
you a looking glass

349
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:56,072
And if that looking 
glass gets broke

350
00:36:57,543 --> 00:36:59,476
Pudding,
 company!

351
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:06,184
Hello there!
Welcome to our happy home.

352
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:11,648
Where's Robin?

353
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:13,715
Robin?

354
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,527
There's no Robin here.

355
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,820
Maybe he means our little J.

356
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:19,893
Of course!
 That's it!

357
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:27,701
No peeking.

358
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,380
Mommy's little helper.

359
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:45,481
You know, Bats, we've been doing this
little runaround of ours for years.

360
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:48,818
It's been loads of laughs,
but the sad fact is...

361
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:50,961
...none of us are 
getting any younger.

362
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:53,155
That old clock's a-ticking.

363
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,889
Quite right,
 pooh.

364
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:58,704
And Harley and I were thinking
it was time to start a family.

365
00:37:58,905 --> 00:38:02,068
Add a Joker Junior 
to our merry brood.

366
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:05,409
But rather than go through
all the joy of childbirth...

367
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,077
...we decided
to adopt.

368
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:11,746
We couldn't do it legally...

369
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:16,182
...but then we remembered you always
had a few spare kids hanging around.

370
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,550
So we borrowed one.

371
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:23,585
No.

372
00:38:23,797 --> 00:38:25,422
My God!

373
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:30,192
He needed a little molding of course.
What kid doesn't?

374
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:33,599
But in time we came
to love him as our own.

375
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:36,273
Say hello, J.J.

376
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:10,237
Robin!
Robin!

377
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:17,411
Tim, it's Barbara.
Can you hear me?

378
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,385
Robin!
Stop!

379
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:35,157
Hands off,
Brat-girl!

380
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:38,467
Sweetie,
get Mommy's bazooka.

381
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:08,559
How could you help
Joker do it, Harley?

382
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:12,452
Okay, so he roughed the kid up
a little, but I'll make it right.

383
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,659
Yeah, you're mother
of the stinking year.

384
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:17,061
Ha! You'll see.

385
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:22,568
We'll be one big,
 happy family.

386
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:29,637
Good boy!

387
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:21,856
What's the matter,
 Batman?

388
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:25,025
No witty comeback?
 No threat?

389
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,804
Then I'll provide the narration.

390
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,000
OUR FAMILY MEMORIES

391
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:44,686
I'll begin with how I peeled
back the layers of the boy's mind.

392
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:48,655
Though, he bravely tried
to fight it at first.

393
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:03,152
You would have been proud
to see him so strong!

394
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:07,721
But all too soon...

395
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,240
...the serums and the shocks
took their toll.

396
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:15,063
...the dear lad began
to share such secrets with me.

397
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,905
Secrets that are 
mine alone to know...

398
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,641
...Bruce.

399
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,306
It's true, Batsy.
I know everything.

400
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:27,606
And like the kid who peeks
at his Christmas presents...

401
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:31,307
...l must admit,
it's sadly anticlimactic.

402
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,318
Behind all the Sturm 
and batarangs...

403
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:39,152
...you're just a little boy in a
playsuit, crying for Mommy and Daddy.

404
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:41,929
It'd be funny,
if it weren't so pathetic.

405
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:46,827
Oh, what the heck!
I'll laugh anyway.

406
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:04,146
If you don't like the movie,
I've got slides.

407
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,556
I'll break you in two.

408
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:20,257
Oh, Batman.

409
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:24,268
If you had the guts for that kind
of fun, you'd have done it years ago.

410
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:26,668
I, on the other hand...

411
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:39,246
You've lost,
Batman.

412
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,309
Robin is mine.

413
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,355
The last sound you hear
will be our laughter.

414
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,518
Here you go,
sonny-boy.

415
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:56,898
Make daddy proud.
Deliver the punch line.

416
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:05,358
Tim.

417
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:13,056
Do it!

418
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,000
That's not funny.
That's not...

419
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:51,778
It's okay, Tim.
It's okay.

420
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:53,849
We buried the Joker
deep beneath Arkham.

421
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:58,809
The only other person who knew what happened that
night was my father, the first commissioner Gordon.

422
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,318
He promissed to keep
our secret.

423
00:45:03,423 --> 00:45:05,324
With his last act of cruelty...

424
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:10,362
...the Joker had tainted us all
with compromise and deception.

425
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:16,001
I suppose he had
the last laugh after all.

426
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:18,001
I'm assuming his girlfriend
bought it too.

427
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:22,298
We never found her body, but I doubt
she'd be starting trouble now.

428
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:25,302
And Tim?

429
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,175
We had a trusted friend,
Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

430
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:31,943
It took her a year, but she was able
to help Tim back to sanity.

431
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:34,679
Still, things were never
really the same.

432
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:37,355
Bruce forbade Tim 
to be Robin again.

433
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:42,186
He blamed himself for what happened and swore
he'd never endanger another young partner.

434
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:45,860
Tim left us soon after that,
determined to make it on his own.

435
00:45:46,735 --> 00:45:47,722
Did they patch it up?

436
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:52,605
Tim tried once or twice, but you
know Bruce. I check up on Tim now and then.

437
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:56,706
He's a top-level communications
engineer, married, couple kids.

438
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,112
Not too bad,
 all things concerned.

439
00:45:59,313 --> 00:46:00,871
He deserved a happy ending.

440
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:04,485
But he still has the most likely
connection to that night.

441
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:17,326
It looks okay on this side.
I'm going up to the dish.

442
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,336
You might as well show yourself.
I heard you a mile away.

443
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,876
I'm no Boy Wonder anymore,
but that old training never goes away.

444
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,746
Even at my age.

445
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,150
Tim Drake.

446
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:41,981
You heard about Bruce?

447
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:45,092
Barbara told me.
 That was too bad.

448
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,916
You're not too broken up.

449
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:49,927
I had nothing to do with it,
despite what you might be thinking.

450
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:53,431
When the Joker reappeared,
I was just as surprised as anyone.

451
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:55,760
Barb told you the gory details?

452
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:57,601
More or less.

453
00:46:57,806 --> 00:47:00,000
Look,
 it's been almost 40 years.

454
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:03,768
It wasn't easy, but I managed to put
it to bed and go on with my life.

455
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:08,005
You'll have to do it yourself one day.
We all did.

456
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:11,844
We gave our best, but in the end that
wasn't good enough for the old man.

457
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,612
Regrets,
 Mr. Drake?

458
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:18,981
When I was younger, part of me thought
I would go on and on and someday....

459
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:23,286
Capes, costumes, playing hero.
It was kids' stuff.

460
00:47:23,498 --> 00:47:25,260
Bruce probably did me a favor.

461
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:29,994
In the end I was so sick of it, I never
wanted to see that stupid Robin suit again.

462
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:34,304
Some things never change.

463
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:38,346
Were all of you 
bitter when you left?

464
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:40,336
Comes with the territory,
McGinnis.

465
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:43,077
Look up Nightwing, someday.
he has he got stories!

466
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:46,318
Drake's clean. I've got
one more lead to check out.

467
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,920
Someone with a definite grudge
against Bruce Wayne.

468
00:48:05,684 --> 00:48:09,253
Caviar, soft music and
charming company.

469
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,150
Amy, my dear,
I can't think of any better way

470
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,192
to celebrate my ascension to
CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

471
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,849
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

472
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:25,896
You?
Where's Amy?

473
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,063
Missed the boat,
I'm afraid.

474
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:32,505
Turn the yacht around!

475
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:36,409
Detox, boss man.
We're here to talk business.

476
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:39,983
We'll be quick.
Woof gets seasick easy.

477
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,581
Our business is concluded.

478
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:53,989
You've got the equipment
you wanted.

479
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:57,659
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

480
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:00,737
...while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

481
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,599
Word is Wayne's terminal anyhow.

482
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,510
That means you get 
to stay top dog.

483
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:09,045
And everyone's happy.

484
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:11,047
So why are you here?

485
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:16,150
The big guy who originally put us
in contact just decided you're a loose end.

486
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:18,550
And loose ends 
should be tied up.

487
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,632
Let me go!

488
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,228
Got him.

489
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,405
Then amscray pronto,
kiddies.

490
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,835
Things are going 
to start popping.

491
00:49:38,277 --> 00:49:39,643
Let's go!

492
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:43,675
No one's leaving 
until I get answers.

493
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:50,420
No, you idiot!
Not now!

494
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,030
They're getting away!

495
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:03,695
Yeah, and I think they've 
got a good reason!

496
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:09,697
-What's happening?
-Hang on!

497
00:50:52,818 --> 00:50:53,978
We saw the explosion.

498
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,445
You can ask Mr. Pryce
about that.

499
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:58,851
Me?
I had nothing to do with it.

500
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,253
That right?

501
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,496
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

502
00:51:04,697 --> 00:51:07,291
... while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

503
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:08,695
I want my lawyer.

504
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,735
I think the commissioner would like
to hear this too. Night.

505
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:30,878
I'm spent.

506
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:34,817
Every lead I had has gone face-down,
and the Joker's still out there.

507
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:36,393
What have you got?

508
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,697
I don't know,
 pup.

509
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:42,197
If I was the Batman I was supposed
to be, I'd have cracked this...

510
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:45,371
...would have punched the right data
into the computer...

511
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:48,335
...or remembered that one clue
everyone else overlooked.

512
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:50,302
It's rarely that simple.

513
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,878
-How are you feeling?
-Lousy.

514
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:03,715
Gordon told me what happened
to Tim Drake.

515
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,925
That's why I didn't want you
going up against the Joker...

516
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,492
...impostor or not.

517
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,458
Nothing against your old partners,
but I'm a completely different Batman.

518
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,327
I was never a Robin,
I never--

519
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,199
Wait.

520
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,936
Joker smashed up the cases...

521
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:26,010
...but why was this the only costume
he went out of his way to destroy?

522
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,744
Robin did shoot him.

523
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:31,507
A ghost out for revenge?
I don't buy it. I talked to Drake.

524
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:34,481
He's got less love
for that costume than the Joker.

525
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,918
I think somehow 
he's behind this.

526
00:52:37,123 --> 00:52:38,181
That's crazy.

527
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:40,451
So was Drake,
once.

528
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:44,563
Look, here's the readout of everything
we know the Jokerz have stolen.

529
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:50,534
Now let's combine those into something that
would be used by a communications expert.

530
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,699
Someone of Tim Drake's caliber.

531
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,271
Satellite jamming system.

532
00:52:57,677 --> 00:53:00,612
Whoever uses this can access
satellite defense systems...

533
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:02,179
...
and fire them at will.

534
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,610
Someone already has.

535
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,077
I suspected Jordan Pryce
might be the Joker...

536
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:09,380
...but the Jokerz were on
your yacht trying to slag him.

537
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:12,114
I got him off before
it was blasted to splinters.

538
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:18,956
I think your little Robin's
turned into a bitter old crow.

539
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,259
He's gotta be the brains 
behind this new Joker.

540
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,902
It's harsh,
but who else is there?

541
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:27,905
Suit up.

542
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:31,940
Take the car and check it out.
I'll monitor you from here.

543
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:35,239
What happened to
leaving it to the cops?

544
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:36,974
Not their game.

545
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:39,884
There's something else
I want to take with me.

546
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:07,108
Drake, I know you're
the connection to the Joker.

547
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:11,909
Don't pretend you 
didn't hear me.

548
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:13,710
Hologram.

549
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:30,092
You guessed it,
Batfake!

550
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:33,760
The disgruntled Mr. Drake
is indeed in my employ.

551
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:39,344
Took him a few years, but he figured
out who ran the real winning team.

552
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:43,106
This is one of Uncle Sam's
orbiting defense satellites.

553
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:45,784
Hyperion class,
 laser-armed.

554
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,920
Handy litlle gadget for shooting down
unfriendly missiles...

555
00:54:49,121 --> 00:54:51,521
...or giving someone
a world-class hotfoot.

556
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,224
Think of it as urban tagging
on a grand scale...

557
00:54:57,431 --> 00:55:02,333
...reminding all and sundry
that this is Joker territory.

558
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:04,594
You're welcome to 
try and stop us...

559
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:08,900
...but I'm not taking bets on that
happening anytime soon. Toodles.

560
00:56:02,762 --> 00:56:03,956
Miss me?

561
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:15,402
Computer, search for
the name Jolly Jack.

562
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:24,244
Abandoned candy factory.
Just his style.

563
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:26,077
Wayne,
I think I've got something.

564
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:29,447
Download this transmition and tell Gordon
to have her men at that address.

565
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:32,590
-I'm gonna--
-Aren't you the nasty tattletale?

566
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:36,056
Ratting me out 
before I have my fun.

567
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:37,992
Papa spank.

568
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:57,938
Yeah,
I know!

569
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,896
I'd better sit down
before I bust a gut!

570
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,690
Catch you later,
kiddo!

571
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,297
It's stopped.
I'm going after him.

572
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,755
Gotcha!

573
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,313
Ace.

574
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,989
Good bat-dog.

575
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:08,471
Where'd he go?

576
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:14,409
Watch it!

577
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:15,947
You watch it!

578
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,418
It's him!

579
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,239
Double down.

580
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,327
Lovely playroom.
You getting this, Wayne?

581
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:03,664
I see it. You keep
your eyes open for the Joker.

582
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,266
Tim.

583
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,603
Get up, Drake.

584
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,873
What?
Who is it?

585
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,516
Where's the Joker?

586
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:23,806
Joker?

587
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:26,853
Drop the act.
I know you're working with him.

588
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:30,681
No, Joker's gone.
I don't know where he is, really.

589
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:34,286
Suit sensors aren't picking up
any pulse fluctuations.

590
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:35,789
It's the truth.

591
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:39,530
I don't do this anymore.
I have a home and family.

592
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:43,467
I gave this up years ago.
Kids' stuff. That's all it was.

593
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:46,867
It may be the truth,
but he's still whacked.

594
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,646
Fun and games.
Boy Wonder playing the hero.

595
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,838
Fighting the bad guys
and no one ever gets....

596
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,146
Oh, God.

597
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,313
I killed him.

598
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,516
I didn't mean to.

599
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:02,485
I tried so hard to forget.

600
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:06,818
But I still hear the shot,
still see his dead smile.

601
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,360
Every night the 
dreams get stronger.

602
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,159
He's there when I sleep,
whispering, laughing...

603
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,335
...telling me I'm just as bad
as he is, we're both the same.

604
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,434
I'm calling an ambulance.

605
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,130
No, I'm all right.
Forgive me, Terry.

606
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:24,143
Old, nasty memories twisting
inside me like bad oysters.

607
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,335
Nothing really.

608
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:27,679
I'm perfectly fine now.

609
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,181
How do you know my name?

610
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,121
There's nothing about you
I don't know, Batfake.

611
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,222
Terry!

612
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,692
Have a time-out,
kid.

613
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:45,492
Can't let you spoil
the party too soon.

614
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,297
And Bruce, I'm sure you've got
your monkey-boy wired somehow.

615
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:55,034
That's just peachy, because I want you
to see every minute of this.

616
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,541
It's a killer.

617
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,224
My God.

618
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:23,400
Oh,
I never get tired of that!

619
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,762
Drake?

620
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:27,172
You're the Joker?

621
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:31,811
That flabby oaf doesn't even realize
I'm using him as a time-share.

622
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:36,246
Beneath this puckish exterior
lies the mind of a genius...

623
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,010
...years ahead of my time.

624
01:02:38,353 --> 01:02:41,221
In the weeks young Robin
was under my tutelage...

625
01:02:41,422 --> 01:02:45,952
...l used him as the subject
of my greatest experiment.

626
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:49,152
Utilizing cutting-edge
genetics technology...

627
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:51,264
...which I had pinched
here and there...

628
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,833
...l encoded my DNA 
on a microchip...

629
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:57,938
...and set it
into bird-boy's birdbrain.

630
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,898
Here.

631
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:04,704
Everything that was me has been
a-sleeping all comfy and cozy...

632
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,780
...inside Tim 
Drake's subconscious.

633
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,043
At first, I had to limit the time
I spent in Drake's body.

634
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,949
He's not aware of what I do...

635
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,056
...chalking up any lingering memories
to bad dreams.

636
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:20,590
If his family misses him,
I simply call wifey and tell her:

637
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,958
"l'm working late,
 honey."

638
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:25,199
The changes come at will now...

639
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,599
...and soon I'll be strong enough
to live in this body permanently.

640
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,672
Mr. J's on the rebound,
 baby!

641
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:36,902
My comeback party's gonna set
the whole town on fire!

642
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:01,934
So where should I 
make ground zero?

643
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:06,369
Gotham General, where our hero's
dear little Dana is recuperating?

644
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:11,036
Or here, in the happy garden
of Mrs. Mary McGinnis?

645
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:16,280
I always think it adds resonance
to a hero's mission...

646
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,648
...to have some defining element
of tragedy in his background...

647
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,221
...don't you?

648
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:25,592
Ah, but the one and only
kick off point...

649
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,628
...must be stately Wayne Manor.

650
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,056
Gone in a flash...

651
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:34,668
...before Brucie can hobble to safety
or mount a rescue.

652
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,132
Don't worry,
though.

653
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:42,373
I'll be hitting
those other spots soon enough.

654
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:44,936
Adiós, Brucie.

655
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:48,514
I guess I should salute you
as a worthy adversary and all that...

656
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:53,018
...but the truth is,
I really did hate your guts.

657
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:59,318
What about it, kid?
Any last words for the old Batfart?

658
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,056
Yeah. Sic him.

659
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,728
Ace, here!

660
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,670
Attaboy!

661
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:30,186
End of the line,
Snoopy.

662
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:37,195
No!

663
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:54,039
Oh, good.

664
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,911
The beam's headed here.

665
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:58,677
Now I'll have
to start all over again.

666
01:05:58,887 --> 01:06:02,085
Thanks for wrecking everything, kid.
See you around.

667
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:03,889
Hold it.

668
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,291
Oh, wise up,
 junior.

669
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:07,893
Game's over!

670
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,621
-I'm taking you in.
-Right.

671
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:19,465
You're out of your league,
 McGinnis.

672
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:24,237
I know every trick the original
Batman and Robin knew at their peak.

673
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,643
Maybe, but you don't know
a thing about me.

674
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:28,907
You?

675
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:31,052
What's to know?
You're a punk.

676
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:32,844
A rank amateur.

677
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:37,320
A costumed errand boy taking orders
from a senile old man.

678
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:40,619
Still, if it's a whooping
you're wanting....

679
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:45,331
That's right.
Better to run and save yourself.

680
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,831
That's about your speed.

681
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,632
Let's dance,
bozo.

682
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:09,248
He's tough.
Any suggestions, boss?

683
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,791
Joker is vain and likes to talk and try
to distract you, but don't listen.

684
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:14,690
Block it out and power through.

685
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:15,920
Wait.

686
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,565
I like to talk too.

687
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:23,202
-What are you doing?
-Fighting dirty.

688
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:25,670
The real Batman would never--

689
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:28,235
Told you,
you didn't know me.

690
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,574
Funny guy.

691
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:34,347
Can't say the same for you.

692
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:39,913
Impudent brat.
Who do you think you're talking to?

693
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,018
Not a comedian,
I'll tell ya that.

694
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:44,518
Shut your mouth!

695
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,860
The real Batman never
talked to you much, did he?

696
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,362
That's why you were 
so fixated on him.

697
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:55,893
Don't play psychoanalyst 
with me, boy!

698
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:58,900
Oh, I don't need a degree
to figure you out.

699
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,300
The real reason
you kept coming back...

700
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,208
...was you never got a laugh
out of the old man.

701
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:08,380
I'm not hearing this.

702
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,451
Get a clue, clownie.
He's got no sense of humor.

703
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:14,349
He wouldn't know a good joke
if it bit him in the cape.

704
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:18,216
-Not that you ever had a good joke.
-Shut up. Shut up!

705
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:21,020
I mean, joy buzzers,
squirting flowers? Lame!

706
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:25,164
Where's the A material? Make a
face, drop your pants, something!

707
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,730
Show yourself!

708
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:30,804
You make me laugh, but only because
I think you're kind of pathetic.

709
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,530
Stop that!

710
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,773
You fell in a tank of acid,
got your skin bleached...

711
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:40,948
...then decided
to become a super villain.

712
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,175
What? You couldn't get work
as a rodeo clown?

713
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:49,117
Don't you dare laugh at me!

714
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:54,957
Why? I thought the Joker always
wanted to make Batman laugh.

715
01:08:55,395 --> 01:08:56,886
You're not Batman!

716
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:25,146
Come on,
McGinnis!

717
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:28,793
Laugh it up now,
you miserable little punk! Laugh!

718
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:33,097
I can't hear you!

719
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:05,860
Easy,
I've got you.

720
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,100
Way ahead of you.

721
01:11:10,195 --> 01:11:13,529
Delia and Deidre Dennis,
your grandmother's paid your bail.

722
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:16,064
You're being released to her custody,
pending your trial.

723
01:11:16,269 --> 01:11:18,463
-Oh.
-Joy.

724
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,471
You rotten little scamps!

725
01:11:23,676 --> 01:11:28,170
I struggle to make a good home for you
and this is the thanks I get!

726
01:11:29,314 --> 01:11:30,838
Break a grandmother's heart!

727
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:35,487
-I hope they throw the book at you!
-Oh, shut up, Nana Harley.

728
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:41,627
You didn't have 
to cover up for me, Barbara.

729
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:45,828
The Joker's gone, Tim.
You were just along for the ride.

730
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:48,661
How are you,
Mr. Drake?

731
01:11:48,868 --> 01:11:50,859
Tim,
this is Terry McGinnis.

732
01:11:51,069 --> 01:11:53,698
-We met the other night.
-We did?

733
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,033
I owe you big time.

734
01:11:58,578 --> 01:11:59,636
Forget it.

735
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:04,043
For what it's worth, Bruce couldn't have
chosen anyone better to put on the mask.

736
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:07,644
Coming from you,
that means everything.

737
01:12:08,488 --> 01:12:11,650
Sometimes the important things
go unsaid.

738
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:15,289
If there's one thing I've learned you've got
to appreciate the people in your life...

739
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:16,984
...while you have the chance.

740
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:20,228
Not everyone is capable
of expressing that, Tim.

741
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:23,230
No matter how much
they might feel it in their heart.

742
01:12:23,703 --> 01:12:25,000
I know.

743
01:12:29,274 --> 01:12:30,332
What are you doing here?

744
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:32,337
It's where I should be.

745
01:12:35,747 --> 01:12:36,737
Terry.

746
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:41,012
I've been thinking about
what you once told me.

747
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:43,081
You were wrong.

748
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,354
It's not Batman
that makes you worthwhile.

749
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:49,528
It's the other way around.

750
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:52,261
Never tell yourself
anything different.

751
01:12:53,432 --> 01:12:54,729
Thanks.

752
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:03,974
Hello, Tim.

753
01:13:05,278 --> 01:13:07,006
Hi, old man.
