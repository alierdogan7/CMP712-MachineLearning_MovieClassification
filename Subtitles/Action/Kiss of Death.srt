1
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,395
When'd you buy these? They're beautiful.

2
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,071
Bed sheets.

3
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,711
- So where are the drapes? On your bed?
- Gotta try to find the second life in things.

4
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,588
- How's your school?
- Good. Hard.

5
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,513
- I would love to go back.
- So go!

6
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,398
I think it's a little late in the game, no?

7
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,238
School would be a piece of cake
compared to what you've been through.

8
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,198
Thank God for this one, huh?

9
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,670
She saved our lives, this little girl.
She really did.

10
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,958
- How you doin', Rosie?
- Hi, Jimmy.

11
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,474
Hey, little girl.

12
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,710
Hey, little girl. Big girl.

13
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,594
- What's up?
- Rosie's gonna sit for Corinna, study here.

14
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,357
- Tonight?
- Yeah, we got the meeting.

15
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,752
I caught the one by work. The nooner.

16
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,910
We were supposed to go tonight.

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,913
Yeah, but I gotta go to Albany tomorrow.
I gotta check out that body shop.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,276
I think it's better when we go together,
don't you?

19
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,069
Huh...

20
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,196
Jimmy fucked up?

21
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,750
How much I owe?

22
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,229
Gimme a dollar.

23
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,311
OK.

24
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,992
You go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby.

25
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,231
- Sorry, Rosie. OK?
- No big thing.

26
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,153

I can go back to jail just for talkin' to you.

38

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,435
Ronnie, this is your problem.
I don't give a shit.

43
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,910
Look what he did to my hand last week.
He thought I shorted him $50.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,835
Now I got $350,000 worth of this guy's cars
and no driver! I need your help here.

You know I love you, man. I respect you, man.

52
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,753
I'll give you $1500. We'll be back in two hours.

53
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,549
Ronnie, I don't want your fuckin' money.
Get outta here.

You don't want my fuckin' money? Huh?

55
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
I remember after your mom died.
You remember?

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,711
And your father used to go on his benders.
Whose people came to get you, man?

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,394
Whose people came to get you?
Where'd you live?

58
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,948
When you had no place to live,
where'd you live?

59
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,238
- That was a long time ago.
- My family's never asked you for nothin'.

60
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,317
Jimmy, I never asked you for nothin', man.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,109
Jimmy, this guy's gonna cripple me, man.
He's gonna cripple me.

62

I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy.
I'm your blood cousin.

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,431
It'll take two hours, man.

64
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,072
Please don't let this happen. Please don't let
this fuckin' guy hurt me. He's gonna kill me!

65
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,551
The babysitter from upstairs, get her down.
It'll take two hours. Pay her double.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,631
Please, Jimmy. Please...

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,991
Please.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,797
- Hey. I wake your parents up?
- Don't worry about it.

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,269
- OK. I should be back in two hours.
- OK.

70

- Thanks.
- Sure.

71
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,792
Since you went away, man, we got big, man.
No more smash-and-grab bullshit.

72
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,670
You know I got a half-size difference in my
shoes and gotta put three insoles in the left?

73
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,832
Now when I see some shoes I want,
I buy two pairs - 10½ and 11.

74
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,913
- I'm talkin' $300, $400 kicks.
- I don't give a fuck about your shoes.

75
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,479
Mr. Jimmy!

76
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,189
I'm talkin' $200, $300 kicks.
When you want back in, you let me...

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,196
You playin' time games with me?

78
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,512
Whoa. Junior, I'm your man.
It's gonna happen.

79
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,911
Remove the fucking hand.

80
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,075
I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here.
There's no problem. Let's just do it.

81
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,310
You're here, huh?

82

We're saved(!)

84

Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault.

85
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,511
What the fuck, man?

86

Look who showed up to drive.
He's fuckin' socked.

88
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,358
Half now. He'll throw you the rest after.

89

Bev, it wasn't like he was pullin' down
weekly G's out there, you know?

168
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,476
Let's be realistic. I'm not made of money
either. I'm just tryin' to help out a little bit.

169
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,710
I can't believe this.

170

You know, Bev, there is another way
you could get it up a little bit.

171
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,831
You know, if you worked for me
at the garage - you know what I'm sayin' -

172
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,755
and, you know, like, run credit cards
and make appointments and stuff like that...

173
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,718
It'd be... you know, a strictly kosher gig.

174
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,514
Come on, Bev. I mean, I owe him.
I owe him big time, all right?

175
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,797

- What'd he do it for, Ronnie?

176
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,710
Bev, I swear, I don't know.

177

- With Rosie.

So, throw me in a line-up.
I'll take my chances.

332
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,508
That's all I have to say about this.

333
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,152
Tell me about the navy yard.

334
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,149
Same guys: Johnny A, Bobby B and me.

335
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,710
That's three. There were four transporters.

336
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,719
I didn't know the fourth driver.
I never saw him before.

337
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,995
<i>(Zioli)</i> Who called you?

338
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,837
Yo... Mr. Money.

339
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,154
There is no way that you can tell me that you
did not know the guy who got you into this.

340
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,314
Look me in the eye and try it.

341
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,958
I've got no reason to lie.

342
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,954
Everybody's got a reason to lie.

343
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,559
Astro Jewelers? That was four years ago.

344
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,949
Who ratted us out?

345
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,873
Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear.

346
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,317
I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes
on me. Did they pick Ronnie up too?

347
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,031
- Ronnie Gannon?
- Yeah. The whole job was his idea.

348
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,032
No, his name didn't even come up.

349
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,271
Did the prosecutor's office
contact you about this?

350
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,194
No. How stupid do ya think I am?
I wouldn't talk to anybody without you.

351
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,918
Yeah. Well, they also got picked up
on the navy yard thing.

352
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,798
- Who did?
- Bobby and Johnny.

353
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,675
Ronnie too?

354
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,189
- Ronnie Gannon...
- I never liked that kid.

355
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,113
He's a fuckin' rat, is what you're sayin'.

You guys look like the Gorton's fishermen.

Ronnie, I want you to listen to this.

He sure as shit remembers you.

Take the cuffs off him.

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,711
Took the same bullet as you.

393
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,949
Can I see my daughter now?

394
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,990
- Hi.
- What happened to your face?

395
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,789
Nothin'. Listen,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

396
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,110
I don't want her to see me like this.

397
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,989
Oh, Jimmy, she's a baby. She don't...

- In and out.

I've been takin' her to classes with me.
She likes psych and economics.

I also hear you've been a pretty good guy.
That's great.

Whaddaya want?

432
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,910
Did you ever hear of an asshole
by the name of Little Junior Brown?

433
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,471
Think.

434
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,718
What about him?

435
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,752
Little Junior...

436
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,752
His old man, Big Junior?

437
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,434
He's in the hospital. He ain't comin' out.

438
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,596
So it looks like Little Junior's
movin' up in the world.

439
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,631
Big Junior.

440
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,554
That's one of those expressions like...
jumbo shrimp.

441
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,311
Huh?

442
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,510
<i>(Jimmy)</i> Listen to me.

443
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,593
I am not goin' back to that.
I am not rattin' on anybody else.

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,319
What's done is done.
You can't make me do shit.

445
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,358
We never swung the hammer on you
for the Astro job.

446
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,591
Get the indictment on me.
Look, all I got to say to you...

447
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,559
...is how you already cooperated with us
ratting out the others...

448
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,599
...and here we are droppin' it on you anyhow
because you won't do any more ratting.

449
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,069
You know what? You're right.

450
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,596
Forget it.
We probably won't get the indictment.

451
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,554
And you'll be out on the street.

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,553
How long do you think you're gonna
last out there once the word gets out?

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,591
Are you a man of honor?

455
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,031
Sure.

456
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,671
See, let me tell you.

457
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,232
All I want now is what I had in my life
before all the fuckers came through the door -

458
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,311
you and them.

459
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,477
I wanna be left alone with my family,
and I want a job that feels good to me.

460
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,235
So if that means I need to deliver up
this Junior Brown, I'll do that.

461
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,756
If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there,
I will.

462
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,195
But all I've got on you is your word.

463
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,078
So I'm asking you: if I serve him up...

464
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,595
...as a man of honor, will you say to me now
that you will cut me loose once and for all?

465
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,871
Absolutely.

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,915
OK, slow down. Slow.

500
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,953

See that guy in the red shirt over there?

509
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,395
- This guy right over here?
- That's our connect in the DMV.

510
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,516
Alls we gotta do is throw him a license
number, throws us back anything we need.

511
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,275
Sometimes we got more shit
than the real owners. It's beautiful.

512
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,237
No kiddin'.

513
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,431
No kiddin'.

514
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,631
Now, you see her? The Indian? I just love her.

515

<i>- (Jimmy)</i> She's nice.
- No, I <i>love</i> her. We're engaged.

516
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,358
I wanna grow old with her and shit.
You know what I'm tryin' to say?

517
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,358
You remember me?

518
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,431
Yeah.

519
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,273
I heard you lost your wife.

520
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,995
I lost my father last week.

521
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,308
Whaddaya think is worse?

522
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,789
Losin' a wife or losin' a father?

523
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,671
I don't know.

524
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,838
I guess it depends on the individual,
the relationship, whatnot.

525
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,478
You know what an asthma attack feels like?

526
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,354
Feels like you're tryin' to breathe air
through a flattened straw.

527
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,877
But if I take a hit of this, most times I'm OK.

528
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,191
Like that.

529
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,720
But my old man?

530
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,791
In the end?

531
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,630
He had less than five per cent
of his lung capacity.

532
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,318
I mean... he went out hard.

533
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,309
I'm sorry to hear that.

534
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,792
If that starts happenin' with me -
with genetics and shit - it's silver-bullet time.

535
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,950
I'll do it myself.

536
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,873
At least your wife, she went out fast, right?

537
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,915
I'm tellin' ya, man,
you gotta be grateful for that.

538
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,994
So, Sing Sing... You got through that.

539
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,751
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

540
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,829
Whatever...?

541
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,229
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

542
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,994

549
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,189
Which hand did you grab her with?

550
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,636
Put it on the table.
I'm only gonna say that once.

551
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,196
Would you mind lightin'
one of those for me, please?

552
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,837
- Thank you.
- Junior...

Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

You think that's an easy job,
dancin' up there?

555
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,950
It's hard, what they do. Are you kiddin' me?

- Junior...
- Don't you move that fuckin' hand.

557
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,358
When someone steps over the line...

558
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,672
...the difficult becomes
the repulsively impossible.

559
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,916
I think you should have more respect
for what they put up with.

560
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,389
So what can <i>I</i> do...

561
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,868

562
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,350
...and appreciate...

What do you wanna know about the guy for?

590
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,555
JJ pointed him out to me,
like two minutes before you sat down.

591
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,953
If he's got a big fuckin' mouth, take it up
with him. I was tryin' to make conversation.

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,951
It's like letters that stand for things.
You know, like FBI, TGIF. You understand?

599
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,831
Yeah.

600
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,670
I have an acronym for myself.
Know what it is?

601
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,591
B-A-D.

602
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,909
B-A-D. Balls, attitude, direction.

603
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,230
You should give yourself an acronym.
Cos it helps you visualize your goals.

604
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,915
How about F-A-B? Fucked at birth.

- So have 'em paint it.
- No. No, man.

622
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,511
No, it'd still be red under the paint.

What?

653
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,110
I threw it away.
I got patted down twice tonight.

So you're all right with him.
That'll make it easier.

01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,510
- Easier for what?
- Easier to wear a fuckin' wire.

656
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,037
Let me ask you a question. Why you?

657
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,512
Why did they put <i>you</i> on me? Revenge?

658
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,356
You see this eye here?

And if you take that wire off one more time,
I'm personally gonna beat you to death.

01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,395
What you got, a test?

670
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,114
Are you gonna get locked up again?

671
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,357
No.

672
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,512
- You would never do that to me.
- No.

673
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,194
Cos I'm not Bev. I can't live with that.

674
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,429
She couldn't live with it either.

675
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,637
You got something you need to tell me?

676
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,714
I'm under the rock.
They got me wearin' a wire.

677
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,791
<i>(gasps)</i>

678
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,594
Funny thing is,
I liked boostin' cars, you know?

679
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,070
There wasn't any make or model
I couldn't pop the lock.

680
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,149
Kill the alarm,
get it on the road in 90 seconds.

681
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,276
And it felt good.
It felt good to be good at somethin'.

682
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,512
I had money in my pocket,
nice clothes, flash ride...

683
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,876
Buy things for Bev, you know?
Take her places.

684
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,791
Felt good.

685
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,795
But it was bullshit.

686
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,159
And when I finally got caught... goin' to jail...

687
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,950
That's for real.

688
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,997
DA's office, Wednesday, 8 P.M..

689
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,594
Mrs. Wang's restaurant, wiring subject.

690
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,078
Switch the ID plate with the junker's.
Torch the junker.

691
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,151
Cops'll think it's the new car.

692
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,353
Let's go.

693
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,032
Wait.

694
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,389
Ooh!

695
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,155
I always get such a kick outta that.
It's the kid in me.

696
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,391
- Hi.
- Hey.

697
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,074
Ugh! You smell like gasoline.

698
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,754
He's a workin' man, babe. Give him a break.

699
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,479
- I gotta go.
- Where?

700
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,074
Gotta get home. She'll have my ass. So...

701
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,511
Let's go.

702
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,468
What's up?

703
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,792
You don't know who to fucking trust
these days. Know what I mean?

704
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,797
Junior, what?

705
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,155
What's up? I do somethin'?

706
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,834
Walk over there
and ask him if he wants a Rolls.

707
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,717
Tell him it's red.

708
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,554
Oh, come on, Junior. Don't make me do that.

709
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,548
And come up on the passenger side.

710
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,189
Hey. How you doin'?

711
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,719
What the fuck y'all want?

712
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,791
<i>(gunshot)</i>

713
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,711
<i>(Jimmy)</i> Oh, my God.

714
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,509
Oh, my God!

715
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,591
You killed him.

716
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,032
- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

717
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,156
Jesus.

718
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,920
What did you do? What did you do?

719
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,635
What the fuck did you do?

720
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,755
What did I do?

721
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,913
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.

722
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,109
Come up with a more positive
acronym for yourself yet?

723
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,553
A what?

724
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:20,439
You know what I hate more than anything?
I hate the taste of metal in my mouth.

725
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,117
Silverware makes me gag. I've gotta use
plastic forks and spoons all the time.

726
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,431
You know, I...

727
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,914
...I never told anybody about
me and the metal taste thing before.

728
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,952
Tomorrow... fuck the cars.

729
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,630
Just come by the bar.

730
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,751
I want you to... We...

731
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,509
We should have a conversation
about life and shit.

732
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,075
Yeah, get me Calvin Hart.

733
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,518
- I didn't do nothin'.
- I'd like to blow your fuckin' head off.

734
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,556
<i>(Jimmy cries out)</i>

735
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,631
I didn't do it!

736
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,991
<i>(raised voices)</i>

737
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,110
<i>(man)</i> Bullshit!

738
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,394
No, I am not gonna talk to you!

739
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,672
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut, all right?

740
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,837
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
Omar was a federal agent?

741
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,512
<i>(Jimmy)</i> He was a what?

742
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,117
We couldn't compromise our investigation.

743
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,193
- He was a what?!
- Your investigation?

744
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,875
It's called common courtesy.
It's called professionalism!

745
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,110
You arrogant prick!

746
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,590
- What a fucking waste of time!
- What?! Our man was killed...

747
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,591
...and your confidential
informant's a witness!

748
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,559
Well, maybe your man would still be alive
if you'd bothered to let us in on it.

749
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,598
- Yeah, it's your own damn fault.
- Our fault?! Let me tell you...

750
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,272
<i>(others calm him down)</i>

751
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,557
- Your CI is ours.
- The fuck he is!

752
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,357
Oh, yeah?
Then I'm chargin' him with homicide.

753
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,317
Fuck you!

754
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,639
You're not doin' shit.
I'll go to the US attorney.

755
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,429
Once they find out that the guy
you're tryin' to indict is a state-run CI...

756
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,715
...that you knew about from day one...

757
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,758
...holy shit, what happens to you?!

758
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,115
You ever read about yourself in the paper?

759
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,953
Your balls shrivel to the size of chickpeas.

760
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,032
So whaddaya want?

761
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,113
- Stop. Talk to me. I'm right here.
- Shut up.

762
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,317
I want in. I want a joint prosecution,
state and federal...

763
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,118
...and I want this in state court.

764
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,589
- Federal.
- State!

765
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,638
Federal's what I'll give you,
federal's what you'll get.

766
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,517

<i>You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.</i>
<i>That's what I did.</i>

01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,996

- You gotta be dreaming.

779
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,070
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

780
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,030
State or federal?

781
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,791
Both.

782
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,191
Come on, scumbag.

01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,431

784
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,230
<i>- (Corinna)</i> I wanna go to the beach.
<i>- (Rosie)</i> We have to wait, sweetheart.

785
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,596
- I forgot Buttercup.
- Shh, honey. We'll get him.

786
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,432
Can I take her on the beach at least?

787
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,354
- I'm tellin' ya, there ain't gonna be no trial.
- They're gonna cop a plea.

788
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,991
- Cop a plea? He killed a fed.
- He didn't know John was a fed. OK?

789
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,709
- He can't chance a trial.
- I don't like this cereal.

790
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,271
- We'll do all we can to keep you off the stand.
- You really think I'm that stupid?

791
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,193
Fellas, am I tellin' it the way it is or what?

01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,314
- You're a fuckin' maniac, you know that?
- So where they hidin' him?

793
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,516
Atlantic City?

794
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,629
How many times you gonna move us?

795
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,110
We can't stay in one place too long.
It's not smart.

796
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,596
Can't you even play with her a little,
goddamn you?

797
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,272
You hangin' on, honey?

798
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,635
Juicy? Hang on.

799
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,551
Hang on. Whoo!

800
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,837
There you go. Hang on.

801
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,951
Oooh!

802
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,992
Hey, sweetie.

803
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,675
Looky here what I got.
Your wife's final exams.

804
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,834
- Think we need to monitor her for cheating?
- She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin.

805
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,036
We're all goin' fuckin' nuts.
I'm losin' my mind.

806
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,315
Ready, honey? Here we go.

807
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,751
Look.

808
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,434
I gotta go into the city tonight.

809
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,159
My youngest daughter, Coral?

810
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:28,631
Maybe tomorrow when I come back
I can bring her with me. You know.

811
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,837
They're about the same age an' all.
Her and Corinna.

812
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,514
That would be really good of you, man.

813
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,953
Hey. Hey!

814
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,951
Ready? Here we go.

815
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,910
Whoa, a space ride!

816
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,992
My guy was in fear of his life,
and he fired in self-defense.

817
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,992
Dover's gun was holstered
when they pulled him outta the car.

818
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:07,552
My guy claims that Agent Dover - Omar -
made a move for it without provocation.

819
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,474
I can produce witnesses to testify that
Agent Dover had drawn a gun on my client...

820
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,437
...at least three times in the past...

821
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,913
...who can testify that they had seen
Agent Dover taking cocaine, repeatedly...

822
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,879
...and that his behavior in the last few
months was bizarre and paranoid.

823
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,270
Mafia shrinks!
The autopsy came up negative on drugs.

824
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,477
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No.

825
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,591
No, huh?

826
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,917
I wanna know if Agent Dover
had assassination clearance.

827
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,514
- Had what?
- All right, let me rephrase.

828
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,230
Had clearance to shoot first if he perceived
that his cover had been blown.

829
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,040
- You goin' fishin' here, Jack?
- Not at all.

830
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,396
I wanna find out if we got
a drug-taking federal agent, strung out...

831
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,471
...with shoot-first clearance.

832
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,790
In all due respect, if that's what we got...

833
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,758
What a bunch of slanderous horseshit!

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,871
I'm sorry. You got me.

838
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,748
- It's near Allenville.
- Allenville? You just drove through it.

839
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,037
- Why don't you backtrack and ask there?
- OK, thank you.

840
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,875
You're welcome.

841

01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,830
Number three to base. I don't have Corinna.

844
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,469
I want an inventory of all guns,
drugs and cars acquired in New York.

845
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,393
I wanna know how they were
disposed of in Philadelphia.

846
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,952
Was this stuff put back into the community
to establish Dover's street credibility?

847
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,157
I wanna know how many
other agents were involved.

848
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,070
Judge, this is an ongoing operation.

849
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,151
We'd jeopardize agents still in the field.

850
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,878
How can I prove self-defense...

851
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,397
...if I can't show the pressures on the guy or
find out if the guy had shoot-first clearance?

852
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,156
OK. Why don't you bring me all the files?
I'll read them in chambers...

853
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,030
...try to sort out what's privileged
and what's appropriate for discovery.

854
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,988
- I can't do that, Judge.
- What d'you mean? I'm ordering you to.

855
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,358
Either you produce the files

You guys really weren't putting guns back

I mean... that was just
an educated guess on my part.

869

If you try to indict him on anything else
I'll still wanna know where the goodies went.

the same thing!
