and I had an understanding.

When I told you there was
going to be accountability,

93
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:42,679
I wasn't saying it just
to hear myself speak.

94
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,581
Um, I'm... I-I don't know
what you mean, sir.

95
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:48,550
You let a dangerous felon
go last week in hopes

96
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:49,818
that he would lead
you to Wo Fat.

97
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,386
You thought
you could slip

98
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,754
that one by me,
didn't you?

99
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,222
With all due respect, sir,
the objective

100
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,690
is to catch Wo Fat,
not the little fish under him.

101
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:59,559
With all due respect,
Commander, you broke my trust.

102
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,327
And there's
going to be

103
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,261
consequences for that,
as I said there would be.

104
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,262
- What kind of consequences?
- Officer Weston.

105
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,930
- Sir.
- I'm sure you thought,

106
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,998
coming here, you were
going to be appointed

107
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,700
my new public
safety liaison,

108
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:12,269

109

a different position
in mind for you.

110
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:18,407
- Wait a minute.
- Sir, if this has something to do...

111
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:19,709
That's right.

112
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,544
Officer Weston,
welcome to Five-O.

recruiting new people right now.

115
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,616
- No offense.
- None taken.

find Officer Weston to be

to you and your team.

really do appreciate you thinking
of me replacing Officer Kalakaua...

122
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,228
for this position...
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

123
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,031
- I'm not looking to be a babysitter.
- Time-out! Time-out!

124
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,801
Babysitter?

125
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,536
Time-out.

126
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:45,306
This is not about
Officer Kalakaua,

127
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,308
and I'm not asking
you to babysit.

128
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,455
I'm asking you to
be a part of a team

129
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,557
(cell phone buzzing)
that is vital to this state's safety.

130
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:54,151
And frankly, I am not asking;
I'm telling.

131
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:55,552
I need to take this.

132
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,487

135
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,094
Yeah. I'll be right there.

136
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:07,731

so, uh, I have to go.

137

Then get on it.

138
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,335

- What are you still doing here?

139
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,769
You've got a case.

140
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,505
Go.

141
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,206
Yes, sir.

142
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,675
I know neither of
us expected this,

143
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,710
but let's just try and
make the best of it.

144

You ever work
a kidnapping case before?

145
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,513
I started my career
with the FBI.

146
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,915
- That's not what I asked.
- I was in profiling.

147
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,117
- You're avoiding the question.
- Five cases.

148
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:37,086
And how many of those cases
ended successfully?

149
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,087
Three.

150
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:42,590

151
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,225

- Not exactly.

162

to your Five-O task force.
- To do what?

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,376
Uh, assist you in any way I can.
STEVE: I'm sorry.

164
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,478

you used earlier was "babysit."

- Run that.
- Teenage girls

178
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,999
are usually kidnapped
for one of two reasons:

179
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,334
ransom or a sex crime.

180
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,235
- Where are the parents?
- Over there.

181
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:03,097
DANNY:
<i>Any strange phone calls?</i>

182
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,699
Anything at all
out of the ordinary

183
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,133
last couple weeks?

184
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,269
No.
LORI: In over half of all

185
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:09,570
kidnapping cases,
the abductor

186
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:11,039
is usually a relative
or an acquaintance

187
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,274
of the victim.
Is there anybody you can think of

188
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,458
that would have reason
to want to take Jen?

189
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,683
No.

190
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,745
All right. I'm going to send
some of our people

191
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,313
to your house--
they're going to set up

192
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,583
phone taps in preparation
for a ransom call.

193
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:22,651
Okay? Officer Weston

194
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,052
is going to
accompany you home.

195
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,321
She's going to supervise
the whole thing, all right?

196
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,189
Okay?
CHIN: Got something.

197
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:33,227
- Oh, my God.
- I found this outside the changing tent.

198
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,428
Does it belong to Jen?

199
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,630
Jen was born with
a heart condition.

200
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,432
She has to take this
medication twice a day.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,633
If she doesn't
get this

202
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,067
within 24 hours,

203
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,636
she could...

204
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:44,904
She could die.

205
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,306
(sobbing)

206
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:47,841
That's not going to happen.

207
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,104
STEVE: Hey.
- Good. You're here.

208
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,740
What do you got?

209
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,008
HPD reports all

210
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,710
registered sex offenders
within five miles

211
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:19,079
of the abduction site
have been accounted for.

212
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,381
They're expanding
the search now.

213
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:21,715
Okay.

214
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:23,517
Uh, what about Jen's
personal life? Anything?

215
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:26,586
I scanned Jen's cell records
and social network profile.

216
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:28,555
Everything's clean--
no suspicious messages,

217
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,657
no strange calls,
nothing to indicate

218
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,692
a potential threat.
DANNY: All right, see,

219
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,826
this is strange.

220
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,894
All right,
she's got nothing personal

221
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:36,162
on her home page, right?

222
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,064
It's all generic
publicity stuff.

223
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:40,133
I mean, kids use
these sites to vent,

224
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,601
all right, share secrets,
talk trash to each other.

225
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:43,936
It's like Jen
doesn't want anyone

226
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,005
to know who she really is.
Okay, well,

227
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:47,607
maybe she had
a secret profile somewhere.

228
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,008
- Keep looking.
- Get Jen's laptop, okay?

229
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,010
Mine it and see if you can find
anything that she was trying

230
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,579
to keep away from her parents.
- Got it.

231
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:54,882
CHIN: Hey, just got off
the phone with HPD.

232
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,716
MAILE Alert lines
are ringing off the hook.

233
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,351
I'm going to have
to head back to the station

234
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,253
to coordinate a grid search.
- Keep us posted, all right?

235
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,387
Yeah.

236
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:03,490
Hey. So what do we know
about the new hire?

237
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:04,592
She's cute.

238
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,526
- She's very cute.
- She's attractive.

239
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,894
- She used to work for Homeland Security.
- That could come in handy.

240
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:10,696
Yeah, if she lasts.

241
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:11,897
What? Why wouldn't she last?

242
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,465
Well, let's see
what she looks like

243
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,633
when she gets done with
Sergeant Slaughter's boot camp.

244
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,871
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Let's just try

245
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,273
and not get the new girl

246
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,808
blown up, kidnapped, shot

247
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,377
on her first day, that's all.

248
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,045
Can we do that, Steven?

249
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,414
I can't guarantee that.

250
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:45,998
(gun cocks)

251
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,333
Hands on your head.

252
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,737
Turn around slowly.

253
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,841
Do you hear me?

254
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,345
I'm not gonna ask again.

255
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:00,813
Shh.

256
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,485
Wow.

257
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:09,155
You seem to have a lot of people
who really, uh,

258
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:10,723
cared about you.

259
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:17,029
That's nice.

260
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,131
Who the hell are you?

261
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,000
You might want to sit down.

262
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,842
KAYE:
<i>Danny was right.</i>

263
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,043
Jen was hiding something.

264
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,613
She has a second
social network profile.

265
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,814
I managed to extract

266
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,514
all of the deleted e-mails
and private chats

267
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:38,849
and I found a bunch of
exchanges with a guy named

268
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,317
Brant Cunningham.

269
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,185
What do we know about him?

270
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,286
Not much.

271
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:44,887
But everything about it
screams predator.

272
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,322
The account is brand-new,

273
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,325
the only e-mails he sent were
to Jen, and that profile picture

274
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,626
is a stock shot
of a male model

275
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:51,628
I identified through
facial recognition.

276
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,896
All right, when was the last
time they exchanged e-mails?

277
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,397
Last week.
He asked for her address.

278
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:58,100
Said he wanted to
send her something.

279
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,573
Guys, I'm not seeing anything
from a Brant Cunningham here.

280
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,174
And the parents don't remember
Jen getting

281
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,410
anything from that name, either.

282
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:07,678
Okay, it's got to be there.

283
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,713
Well, it's not in her fan mail,

284
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,648
which means she's hiding it.

285
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,883
Wait, this is a girl who's
deleting her private e-mails

286
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:15,984
from this guy, right?

287
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,353
Yeah. Most likely
she didn't want

288
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,821
her parents to find it.

289
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,391
Huh. Which rules out the sock
drawer and under the mattress.

290
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,426
Check for loose
floorboards.

291
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:24,493
No.

292
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:26,762
The room's carpeted.

293
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,931
This is a good kid.

294
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,533
According to her mom,
she's perfect.

295
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,769
She does what she's told,
keeps her room clean.

296
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:36,438
I mean, she's about to go on
a 32-mile race

297
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,575
and still remembers to make
her bed in the morning.

298
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,278
Clearly, appearances
are important to her.

299
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:44,248
Along with her accomplishments.

300
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:52,088
I found something.

301
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:52,923
What do you got?

302
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,729
Guys, the Hassleys
aren't Jen's parents.

303
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,399
MRS. HASSLEY:
<i>"This is your birth mother,</i>

304
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,235
"and she would
like to meet you.

305
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,571
"If you want to know more,
meet me behind the changing tent

306
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,906
after your race
on Saturday."

307
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,209
Jen has always known
she was adopted.

308
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,145
We've been very open
with her about it.

309
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,413
MR. HASSLEY:
Jen's real mother

310
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,482
died in childbirth.

311
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,950
It was in the adoption records.

312
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,985
Jen knows that.
I just can't believe

313
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,587
she arranged
to meet this person

314
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:22,822
and didn't say
anything about it.

315
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,057
I don't know
why she'd lie to us.

316
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,660
LORI:
Yeah, well, my guess is

317
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,596
Jen's abductor
found out she was adopted,

318
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,098
fabricated information
about her birth mother

319
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,367
and used that into luring her
to meet up him.

320
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,969
Okay, so it had to be someone
who knew she was adopted.

321
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,438
Well, she talked about it

322
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:39,106
in her interview
for <i>Aloha Life</i> magazine.

323
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:41,108
I mean, thousands of people
could know.

324
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,511
I'm gonna go take this letter
to the crime lab,

325
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,013
see if I can get
a print off of it.

326
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:46,048
STEVE:
All right, hold on, hold on.

327
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:46,949
Let Kaye take the letter.

328
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:47,950
Lori, I need you to

329
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:49,385
stay with the
family, okay?

330
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,787
Okay.

331
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,020
And, Lori...

332
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,187
Yeah?

333
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:55,321
Nice work.

334
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:58,622
Thanks.

335
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,957
And nice work to you, too.
That's good.

336
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:01,958
What?

337
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,292
"I want you to stay
with the family."

338
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,659
I mean, you're keeping
this woman at arm's distance.

339
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,060
Is it because she's

340
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,162
the governor's hire or is it
something else? Just curious.

341
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:12,363
Hey, MAILE Alert paid off.

342
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,531
Found our abductor's car.

343
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:15,399
Kam Highway,
southern edge of Wheeler.

344
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,836
(siren wailing)

345
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:24,374
(tires screech)

346
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:33,253
Nobody.

347
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,955
It's empty.
Check the trunk.

348
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:45,033
I got blood.

349
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:48,970
And Jen's jacket.

350
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:00,770
STEVE:
<i>What do you got, Max?</i>

351
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,873
The amount of blood I found
on the jacket and in the trunk

352
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:04,908
is quite troubling.

353
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:07,043
Approximately
six to seven pints.

354
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:09,579
The odds of anyone surviving
after that much blood loss

355
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:10,880
is quite low.

356
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,581
Okay, but you're saying,
I mean, it's possible

357
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:13,648
she could still
be alive, right?

358
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:14,782
How old is the girl
you're looking for?

359
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,616
She's, uh, 15.
About 90 pounds.

360
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,250
About.

361
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,787
If this is her blood,
I find it highly doubtful

362
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,489
that she could
have survived.

363
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,992
Listen to me, Max.

364
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,260
I need you to
run this, okay?

365
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,561
Because I can't
talk to the parents

366
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,397
until I know what we
have, you understand?

367
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,931
I'm on it.

368
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,767
DANNY:
<i>Suspect's VIN number:</i>

369
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,772
<i>17Q4378OI95</i>

370
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,577
39572.

371
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:43,579
Got it.

372
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,947
Running it now.

373
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,382
(computer beeps)

374
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,516
Here we go.

375
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,918
Your car is registered
to a Matt Porter.

376
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:52,487
4810 Loho Street in Kailua.

377
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,359
Matthew Porter! Five-O!

378
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:06,199
Clear.

379
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,901
All clear here.

380
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:09,269
No Porter, no Jen.

381
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,937
But you guys should see this.

382
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:18,711
That's Jen right there.

383
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,414
Who are these
other women?

384
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,148
Victims.

385
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,949
Yeah. Or potential victims.

386
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,788
Take a look at these.

387
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,459
Sam Baker, Todd Kilgore,
Charles Tetchy.

388
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,461
He's got, like, 30 of these.

389
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,162
This guy's been at it awhile.

390
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,699
Yep. And he knows
how to disappear.

391
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,400
(phone beeps, recording):
Message two.

392
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:43,568
WOMAN (on voice mail):
Hi, Julie, it's Beth.

393
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,003
Yeah.

394
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,004
That's great.
Okay, thank you.

395
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,606
That was the TSA;
they have an alert out

396
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,108
on all the names that
Porter's been using.

397
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,810
- All right, we check plane tickets?
- Yes, we did.

398
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,378
There's nothing been purchased
under these names.

399
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,280
Okay, good. So Porter
might still be on the island.

400
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,815
Right. Unless he got off using
an alias we don't know about.

401
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:58,915
We're running out of time

402
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:00,317
to get Jen her medication.
- Come on!

403
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:01,551
What do we got?
Something, something.

404
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:02,853
I'm working as fast as I can.

405
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,221
You putting pressure on
an already stressful situation

406
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,556
is not gonna make me
work any faster.

407
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:06,858
I can't even verify
that Matt Porter

408
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,092
is his real name.
- Okay, whoa, whoa.

409
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,861
Look, I don't know
what his real name is, either,

410
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:12,564
but I do know that one of his
aliases, Todd Kilgore, is wanted

411
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:14,732
for questioning in a 2009
kidnapping case in Nebraska.

412
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,066
Okay, good, good, good.

413
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:17,634
So Jen isn't his first victim.

414
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:18,468
Or his last.

415
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:19,736
What do you got?

416
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,539
Julie Nells.

417
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:24,308
I managed to get into her voice
mail and found a message that

418
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,410
Porter left for her yesterday.
He asked her to meet him.

419
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:28,145
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
Wailana Coffee House.

420
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:29,446
All right.
Hey.

421
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:30,847
Hey, you're supposed to
be at the Hassleys'.

422
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,382
What's up? You all right?

423
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,884
Yeah, yeah.
You got a second?

424
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:34,918
Yeah, sure.

425
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:37,420
Good work.

426
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,856
How are the Hassleys doing?

427
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:41,924
They're a mess.

428
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:43,593
I mean, they're waiting
on a ransom call

429
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,860
that you and I both
know isn't coming.

430
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:45,927
What are you talking about?

431
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,596
Look, I get that
you don't want me here.

432
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:49,897
It's your team,
I wasn't your choice.

433
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,599
But sidelining me is just
a waste of your resources.

434
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,901
Okay, first of all, I put
my resources where I need them.

435
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,236
- I needed somebody on the phone.
- Come on.

436
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,238
I looked into
the Hassleys' financials.

437
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:58,439
They don't make any money.

438
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,241
Jen hasn't signed any
endorsement deals.

439
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,677
Her kidnapping was never
about ransom, and you know that.

440
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,078
You just wanted me
out of your hair.

441
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:05,079
Fine.

442
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,614
- Fine?
- Yeah.

443
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:07,815
Fine.

444
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,383
I sidelined you.

445
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,520
Well, at least you're man enough
to admit it.

446
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:14,389
Lori, we met this morning.

447
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,523
You expect me to trust you

448
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:17,057
the way I trust
these people out here?

449
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,526
I've been in the field
with these people,

450
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,728
they've had my back,
I trust them with my life.

451
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,431
The Hassleys are trusting me
with Jen's life,

452
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:25,033
and I promised them I'd bring

453
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:27,101
their daughter home.
- Okay, well, there's your first mistake

454
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,103
right there.
- Excuse me?

455
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,471
We don't make promises
like that around here.

456
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,474
Oh, really? Well, I do.

457
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:36,043
Those two kidnapping cases
that went south--

458
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:38,379
did you make the same promise
to those families?

459
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,614
Yeah. I did.
And I don't regret it.

460
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:41,948
Sometimes you make

461
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,484
all the right moves and
it just isn't enough.

462
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:45,852
You know, the Hassleys
are no different.

463
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,453
I intend to keep
my promise to them.

464
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,624
Hey, wait.

465
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,062
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
Wailana Coffee House.

466
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,731
Meet me there, okay?

467
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,537
Wait a minute.

468
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,372
So you're saying
he was in your house?

469
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,974
Yeah.

470
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,042
This is Captain Fryer, the
head of Internal Affairs?

471
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,613
What did he want?

472
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,715
He, uh, he asked me
a lot of questions

473
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,983
about the asset
forfeiture locker

474
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,851
and the money
that they said I stole.

475
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,686
I don't understand. You answered
all those questions already.

476
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,189
Yeah, well, he wanted
to see my face.

477
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:27,291
See if I was
a good liar.

478
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,994
There's something else,
isn't there?

479
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,002
IA's ruling on my case tomorrow.

480
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,705
Here, come here.

481
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,676
It's gonna be fine, okay?

482
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,179
They got nothing.

483
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,795
Porter's late.

484
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:09,065
Yeah. ' show.

485
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,367
Thank you.

486
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:12,868
Don't you just hate that?

487
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:14,503
Hate what?

488
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,704
The top off.

489
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,506
You know, you get
just the right mix going--

490
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:20,208
coffee, cream, sugar--
all working in perfect harmony.

491
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:22,844
Then, when you're not looking,
waitress comes, tops you off.

492
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,980
Ruins a perfectly good
cup of coffee.

493
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,115
That's why I switched to tea;
they don't mess with that.

494
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,552
What?

495
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,187
I'm just saying.

496
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,323
(groans)

497
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,159
Told you.

498
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,860
When you're right, you're right.

499
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:41,730
You know, I expected
somebody who graduated

500
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:43,131
top of his BUD/S class

501
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,567
would take his coffee black,
but mm-mm.

502
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,539
Did you pull my file?

503
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,575
Mm-hmm. Last night.

504
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:56,777
Which is when I assume
you pulled mine.

505
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:04,585
You graduated with
honors from Penn State,

506
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:06,386
but you switched from
bio to criminal justice

507
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:08,255
in your sophomore year.
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:10,457
What happened,
you couldn't hack the sciences?

509
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,926
Uh-huh, something like that.

510
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:13,894
Hmm.

511
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:16,464
Yeah, phys ed was
more my style.

512
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:17,865
Phys ed?

513
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,100
You care to
elaborate on that?

514
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,535
Uh-uh.

515
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:21,769
Maybe when I know you better.

516
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:24,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

517
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:25,640
Hey, any sign

518
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,641
of Porter out there?

519
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,642
No.

520
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,476
How's the date going,

521
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:30,078
buddy?

522
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,279
Chin?

523
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,951
You didn't answer
Danny's question.

524
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:36,355
I will take that as
no sign of Porter.

525
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,593
I think she's done waiting.

526
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,528
Let me see if I can stall her.

527
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:49,931
Hey, you're Julie Nells, right?

528
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,733
I'm Lo...
Julie, wait!

529
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:52,601
She's running, she's running.

530
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,977
Move, move.

531
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:05,682
(car horn honks)

532
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,452
(tires screech)

533
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,823
Whoa!

534
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,158
Hey!

535
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,360
Julie!

536
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,098
Whoa, whoa, come here,
come here.

537
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:18,700
Get away from me,
I'm not going back!

538
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,102
Julie, it's okay,
we're not here to hurt you.

539
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,770
Where's Matt?
What did you do to Matt?

540
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:22,971
Listen to me,
hey, hey, we're Five-O.

541
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,440
Look, okay,

542
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:26,208
we just want to talk to you.
- What do you want from me?

543
00:23:26,276 --> 00:23:28,009
We're just looking
for Matt Porter.

544
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:29,110
Why?

545
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:30,278
DANNY: Because we
think he might

546
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:31,613
be trying to hurt you,
that's all.

547
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,681
Matt?

548
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,351
He wouldn't hurt me.

549
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:38,818
He saved my life.

550
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,392
Matt Porter rescued me from
a cult in Northern California.

551
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,627
What do you mean "rescued"?

552
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,262
That's what he does.

553
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,630
He's an extractor.

554
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,665
Two years ago

555
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,970
I joined this religious movement
near Mount Shasta.

556
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,541
When things changed, I tried to
leave, but they wouldn't let me

557
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,743
and they've been
after me ever since,

558
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,844
so I called Matt.

559
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,479
He was supposed
to meet me this morning

560
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:10,114
to help me disappear for good.

561
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,149
So why did you
run from us?

562
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,318
Matt said they might send
some people after me.

563
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,220
I'm scared.

564
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,355
I won't go back there.

565
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,624
Okay, okay.

566
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,493
When was the last time
you spoke to Matt?

567
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,361
Two days ago.

568
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,796
Okay, how did you contact him?

569
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:27,931
Matt's got a private number

570
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,433
he only gives out
to people he's helping.

571
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,168
Okay, we're going to need
that number, okay?

572
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:33,636
LORI:
Thanks.

573
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,440
Excuse us.

574
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,845
This doesn't make
any sense.

575
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:44,281
I mean, Jen wasn't
in a cult.

576
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:46,383
She didn't need
to be saved.

577
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,518
Why would Porter kidnap her?

578
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,053
- I don't know.
DANNY: I just got

579
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,454
off the phone with Max
and he ran tests

580
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,256
on the blood we found
in the trunk of Porter's car.

581
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,257
It's not Jen's.

582
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,325
LORI:
Oh, that's great news.

583
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,893
Okay, so she
could be alive.

584
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,894
Well, that's the good news.

585
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,362
The bad news is that the blood

586
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,697
we found in the trunk
was a match

587
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,732
to a John Doe gunshot victim

588
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,300
HPD found
this morning.

589
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,435
Max ran some DNA
and got that hit.

590
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,507
That's Matt Porter.

591
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,577
So where's Jen Hassley?

592
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:19,116
(groaning)

593
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:30,748
According to Max,
Matt Porter was killed

594
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,383
and placed in the trunk
of his car

595
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:34,686
somewhere between 8:00 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m. on Saturday

596
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:35,953
and more than likely

597
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:37,688
dumped along the Kamehameha
Highway shortly thereafter.

598
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,624
Okay, well,
Porter's not our guy.

599
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:41,292
Jen was abducted
on a Sunday morning.

600
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,261
KAYE: Guys, I just got a
strange hit on an alias

601
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:44,729
that Porter was using.

602
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:45,530
Which one?

603
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:46,764
James Westerfield-- it says here

604
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,199
in Jen's adoption records
that he was the one

605
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,300
who delivered Jen
to the Hassleys

606
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:51,202
15 years ago.
Okay, wait a minute.

607
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,203
If Porter

608
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,571
was an extractor
back then,

609
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,239
maybe Jen's biological parents

610
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:56,440
were actually
in a cult.

611
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,674
What if her parents
found out where she was

612
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:58,942
and they just
wanted her back?

613
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,444
LORI: This could be how
they found her.

614
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:02,646
She's been in the
press a lot lately.

615
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,915
- Maybe somebody put two and two together.
- All right, we need to find out

616
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:07,251
which cult Porter extracted her
from because that's where Jen is

617
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,052
right now.

618
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,370
We're ready for you.

619
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:49,224
I think I found something
that may help narrow down

620
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:50,625
where Jen was extracted from.
- Okay.

621
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,493
She was born with a
heart valve condition

622
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,928
that required emergency surgery.

623
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:55,929
Those symptoms
would have presented

624
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,933
hours after
she was born.

625
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,337
Now, a lot of cults don't allow
their members to see doctors

626
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,072
or take modern
medicine.

627
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,741
So if Jen was born
into a cult,

628
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,175
her only chance
of survival

629
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,177
would actually be
getting extracted.

630
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,513
That's what I'm thinking,

631
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:12,349
so I-I ran a search
on the list of known cults

632
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:13,617
that prohibit
medical treatment.

633
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:14,985
That is the
preliminary list.

634
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,454
I'm cross-referencing it
right now with Porter's files

635
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,788
to see if we can narrow it down
even further.

636
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:21,958
That's excellent work,
that's great.

637
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,663
Um, anything else?

638
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:28,199
That's all I got, boss.

639
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,868
Hey, hold up a sec.

640
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:35,874
Is there, is there
anything else you want to,

641
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:37,475
you want to talk
to me about?

642
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,712
What do you mean?

643
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,714
I mean,
you seem distracted.

644
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:47,484
I want you to know that
if something is going on,

645
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:48,986
you can come to me.

646
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:55,359
Well, um...

647
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:58,831
I didn't want to bother you
in the middle of a case,

648
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,633
but...

649
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:04,437
I received a phone call
yesterday from Langley.

650
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:06,506
My old boss at the
CIA said he picked up

651
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:09,842
on some chatter he thought
I should know about.

652
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,244
What are you talking about?

653
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:16,381
My fiancé might be alive.

654
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,785
How accurate is this intel?

655
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:25,723
They can't say, but I can't
stop thinking about it.

656
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,163
Okay, uh,
when are you leaving?

657
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:36,734
I was hoping as soon
as we found Jen.

658
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:39,770
If there's any chance
he might be alive,

659
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:41,037
Steve, I need to be there.

660
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:44,173
Yes, you do, and if there's
anything that we can do,

661
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,976
you, uh, you come
to us, okay?

662
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:49,712
(knocking)

663
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,181
You're gonna want to hear this.

664
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:53,050
WOMAN (over recording):
Matt, it's Rhea.

665
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:55,154
I know you said
it wasn't safe to contact you,

666
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:56,723
but I need your help.

667
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,257
I think my father knows
what happened.

668
00:28:58,325 --> 00:28:59,559
Jen's in danger.

669
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,628
I need you to make sure
he doesn't get to her.

670
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,730
So I ran that
private number

671
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:05,465
the girl from the
diner gave us.

672
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,700
Turns out it has a
voice mail account.

673
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:07,801
This was the
only thing on it.

674
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:09,402
Do we know who Rhea is?

675
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,271
She could be the birth mother.
I'm running

676
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,239
the name and cross-referencing
with everyone in Jen's life.

677
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:14,608
Do we know
where the call originated?

678
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:15,876
Came from an unlisted number
on Lanai

679
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:17,411
a couple
of days ago.

680
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:20,414
Wait, uh, there's a commune
on Lanai that's been red-flagged

681
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:21,682
by several
government agencies.

682
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:23,050
They're the only ones
on that island.

683
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:25,153
That's got to be where Jen is.

684
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:58,553
MAN: <i>About 20 years ago</i>
<i>they bought an old plantation</i>

685
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,021
<i>at the end of the Kaena Trail.</i>

686
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:00,969
Who runs it?

687
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:02,194
<i>Haole</i> by the name
of Steven Carver.

688
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,324
This Steven Carver?

689
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,793
Yep, that's our island's
Jim Jones.

690
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,295
Nice.

691
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:08,663
How many people
drinking his punch?

692
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,197
MAN: Carver started with
about two families.

693
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:12,099
Now he's got about 50 people

694
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,136
on that property,
mostly militia types,

695
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:17,305
isolationists living
off the grid,

696
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,340
thinking modern-day society
and all its trappings

697
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,743
is the work of the Devil.

698
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,177
This island is not only
their home,

699
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:24,512
it's their
Garden of Eden.

700
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,780
They'll do anything
to protect it.

701
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:27,048
I assume they're armed.

702
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,549
I wouldn't bet against it,

703
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,918
but I know someone who's been
on the other side of those walls

704
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:33,054
who might be able to give you
a better picture.

705
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,725
MAN:
<i>Yeah, I've been in there.</i>

706
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:40,061
It's barely living.

707
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,863
Carver's got them thinking

708
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,864
it's paradise.

709
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,032
Do you know
if one of his followers

710
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,033
is a woman named Rhea?

711
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,702
Yeah, she's
Carver's daughter.

712
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:52,506
Okay, please, if you can, when
was the last time you saw her?

713
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,875
Oh, a couple days ago.

714
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,177
She came in
to use the phone.

715
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:57,878
Okay, uh, is this her?

716
00:30:57,946 --> 00:31:00,748
Yeah, it's an old one,
but that's Rhea.

717
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,017
Okay, so Carver's been the one
exchanging the e-mails with Jen.

718
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,552
He wasn't lying;
this is her birth mother.

719
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:06,987
That makes Carver
Jen's grandfather.

720
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:08,389
Does Carver have
weapons up there?

721
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:10,558
He has rifles,
uses 'em to hunt.

722
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,625
Okay, I'm gonna need you

723
00:31:11,693 --> 00:31:13,093
to draw me a map
of that compound.

724
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,862
Sure, absolutely.

725
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,731
Uh, can I help you?

726
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:20,901
- He one of them?
- Yeah.

727
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,569
Danny.
Okay, he made us.

728
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,460
Wait, whoa.

729
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,018
LORI: Listen, he's gonna
go back to the compound,

730
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:26,421
<i>tell Carver we're here,</i>
<i>Carver's going to run.</i>

731
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:27,453
What's the fastest
way up there?

732
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:28,877
There's only
one road in.

733
00:31:29,144 --> 00:31:30,378
Unless...

734
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:32,078
Unless what?

735
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:35,781
This is the only way in--
on an animal?

736
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,049
We couldn't have got
an ATV

737
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,541
or a golf cart or something like...?

738
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:39,629
- Did you say ATV?
- I did.

739
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,786
They wouldn't hear an ATV from
a mile away, would they, Danny?

740
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,291
But you know what? Your whining
is probably louder than an ATV.

741
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,292
Whining?

742
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
STEVE:
Yeah, you're whining.

743
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:47,895
How long have
you two been married?

744
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:51,566
- Horses.
- Whoa,

745
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,136
whoa, whoa, that's it,
that's it right there.

746
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,072
(Jen groaning)

747
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:05,211
(sobbing)

748
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,821
What are you doing?

749
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:19,958
I told you
to keep away from here.

750
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:22,661
She's, she's not well.

751
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,296
That's none of your business.

752
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:27,766
It is my business--
she's my daughter.

753
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:30,969
And she's my granddaughter
and you told me she was dead.

754
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:33,838
You threw her away
like trash.

755
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,875
Go on, go to your room.

756
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:38,376
I'll deal with you later.

757
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:52,423
Here.

758
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,424
Uh, drink this.

759
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:54,825
There's herbs
in here.

760
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,459
It's good for your heart.

761
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:00,296
I don't want your tea.

762
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:01,664
I just want to go home.

763
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:02,665
Please.

764
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,534
This is your home.

765
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:10,139
I know this is hard
for you to understand,

766
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:13,275
but this is my fault.

767
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:16,345
I-I didn't raise
your mother right.

768
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,615
But I'm not gonna make
that same mistake with you.

769
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:21,516
You're my family.

770
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,951
I'm not gonna let them

771
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:24,019
take you
away from me.

772
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,120
You're not my family!

773
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:26,522
Now, listen
to me. Listen.

774
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,525
Those people...

775
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,627
are the ones that have been
poisoning you.

776
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:33,897
Now, I can make
you better.

777
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,667
You have to trust me.

778
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:40,003
(sniffles)

779
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,139
Just drink your tea.

780
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,808
(door opens)

781
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,210
We've got a problem.

782
00:33:57,821 --> 00:33:59,255
All right.

783
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:01,591
According to this,
Carver's cabin is right in

784
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:02,857
the middle
of the compound, okay?

785
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,092
If Jen is here, that's where

786
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,227
he's gonna be holding her.

787
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,394
Wait, I think that's her.

788
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,800
Come on, we got to move.

789
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:21,509
(grunts)

790
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,678
Down on your knees. Now.

791
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:24,079
Face down, face down.
Hands behind your back.

792
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,214
It's okay.

793
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:26,248
Get them inside.

794
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:27,550
Jen, we're not
gonna hurt you.

795
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:28,751
We're the police.
We're Five-O.

796
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,819
Get down.

797
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:31,888
It's okay.

798
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,958
Where's Jen?

799
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:37,560
- I don't know.
- What do you mean,

800
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:38,528
you don't know?

801
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:39,529
My father found out

802
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:40,963
you were coming,
and he took her.

803
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:48,347
STEVE:
We got company.

804
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,118
Everybody down!

805
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,387
(grunts)

806
00:34:57,523 --> 00:34:58,456
Whoa! Please.

807
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,458
Can we try
not to kill

808
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:02,426
everybody in the
compound, okay?

809
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:03,694
One of these hippies might know

810
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:04,996
where Jen is, all right?
Fine.

811
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,364
(gunfire continues)

812
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,499

What'd I tell you?!
Go, go, go, go!

815
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,508
Stay here and stay down.

816
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:29,988
Down!

817
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:38,832
Drop it.

Where did Carver take her?

821
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,686
Don't make me
ask you again.

822
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:02,723
He has a plane.

823
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,657
Where?

824
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:05,092
Where is the plane?

825
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,963
Two miles west of here.

826
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,698

Jen, you hear me?

Everything's gonna be okay,
all right?

844
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:12,314
We're gonna get you

(sirens approaching)

846
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,651
Okay?

847
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,199
I knew as soon as

848
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,835
Jen was born
that something was wrong.

849
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,806
She needed
medical treatment.

850
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,643
With real doctors.

851
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:43,679
But my father
would never allow it.

852
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:45,181
He said,

853
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:47,349
"Medicine makes us weak.

854
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:50,886
We have to empower our bodies
to fight."

855
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,956
But her little body--
it just...

856
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:03,933
It just didn't have
anything to fight with.

857
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,405
I-I knew we were
losing her.

858
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,473
So that's why you
gave her away?

859
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:19,083
The only way to save her life
was to let her go.

860
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:22,719
So I faked her death.

861
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:25,721
But a few weeks ago,

862
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:29,725
my father was in town
and saw a magazine article

863
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:35,162
about this amazing girl
with a heart condition...

864
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:40,767
...and he just knew it was Jen.

865
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,705
Hmm. So you
called Porter.

866
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:50,109
I tried to warn him
that my father was coming.

867
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:52,644
And he said
he'd take care of it.

868
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:56,114
And...

869
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:58,082
now he's dead because of me.

870
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,383
No.

871
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:01,385
You were looking after Jen.

872
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:04,988
You did what any mother would
do to protect their child.

873
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:10,726
She's not my child.

874
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:13,396
The Hassleys raised her.

875
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:17,600
And I'm just thankful
for everything they've done.

876
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,770

(cell phone ringing)

885
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,025
Thank you.

886
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:47,459
Thank you.

887
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:52,764
Hey, cuz, how'd it go?

888
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,100
Mm-hmm.

889
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:01,972
WOMAN:
Sir, you can't go in there.

890
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:06,276
We need to talk.

891
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:08,245
We have nothing to talk about,
Lieutenant Kelly.

892
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:10,747
You're about to kill the career
of a good cop just because

893
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,915
you think she did
something wrong.

894
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:14,918
I know...
she did something wrong.

895
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:18,755
Apple doesn't fall far from
the family tree, does it?

896
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,690
This isn't about me.

897
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:21,858
You're right.

898
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:23,226
It isn't.

899
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:25,395
The governor wants to make it
very clear that there's

900
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,730
a zero-tolerance policy with
regard to crime and corruption.

901
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,867
He's tasked me with
cleaning up this department,

902
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:34,170
which is exactly
what I am going to do.

903
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:35,605
(taps desk)

904
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:37,340
Starting with your cousin.

905
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:45,448
After a lengthy investigation by
the Internal Affairs Department,

906
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:47,884
Officer Kono Kalakaua has been

907
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:50,686
stripped of her badge and is
no longer a member of Five-O

908
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:53,322
or the Honolulu
Police Department.

909
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,392
Her case has been handed over
to the prosecuting attorney,

910
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,527
who is officially moving forward
with charges.

911
00:42:58,595 --> 00:42:59,995
I'll take your questions now.

912
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:01,564
(reporters clamoring)

913
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:04,133
I'm not at liberty
to say right now.

914
