ever starts.

You're gonna be
inspired by music.

of all those
great warriors.

704
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,729
Every one of them had
a distinctive musical theme

705
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,822
that put fear in the hearts
of their opponents,

706
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,319

them defeated

I couldn't wait for
the school year to start.

I was like a... A freshman
decorating my dorm.

1348
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,990
You know, I'd put posters
up all over the place

1349
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,037
and I'd set up
these plastic models.

1350
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,539
No, you didn't.
I did! I would jump up

1351

on the desk just to
get the kids into it.

1352
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,502

No, it's not.

better when you were that stupid.

always turn me down?

lady who's got the hots for me?

only hold her off for so long.

that every time

an effort to get up.

so comfortable together.

win a few more, I could fight less.

This isn't me

00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,252
This is me seeing if
you're worth my time.

Is it hot in here?

1396
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,042
I cranked the heat to 90.

01:11:57,979 --> 01:11:59,196
Niko turned it down.

1907
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:02,071
He what?

1908
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,494
NIKO: Relax.

1909
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:07,949
Om...

1910
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:11,291
Let your tailbone be heavy.

1911
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,958
Om...

1912
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:17,460
{LAUGHS} Hey!

1913
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:20,094
Relax. Relax.

1914
01:12:20,172 --> 01:12:23,473
Back to the peaceful meadow.

1915
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:24,769
{MAKES CHIRPING NOISE}

1916
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,392
{LAUGHS QUIETLY}

1917
01:12:32,646 --> 01:12:34,148
Hey, why would
you pass on the UFC'?

1918
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:36,405
You're not ready
for a fight like this.

1919
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:39,328
You realize we're six grand away
and the semester's almost over?

1920
01:12:39,487 --> 01:12:41,240
It's too dangerous.

1921
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:43,163
Yeah. But this
could be one and clone.

1922
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:44,961
Hey, the UFC's the real deal,
all right?

1923
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,334
It's big-time.

1924
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:48,382
There's no broken cages or
chickens running around.

1925
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:50,001
Okay, you know what?
I got to be honest here.

1926
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:51,545
I don't see what
the problem is.

1927
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:54,014
Oh, yeah, okay.
You know the problem?

1928
01:12:54,089 --> 01:12:57,515
The problem is we're the same
age, and I can kick your ass!

1929
01:12:57,761 --> 01:12:59,183
{GRUNTS}

1930
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,934
You know, maybe we should...

1931
01:13:04,352 --> 01:13:05,525
You know what?
He's up, he's okay.

1932
01:13:05,604 --> 01:13:07,447
You're a schoolteacher,
Scott!

1933
01:13:08,106 --> 01:13:10,451
I devoted my whole life
to fighting.

1934
01:13:12,028 --> 01:13:14,123
And you should've
been given this shot.

1935
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:15,498
I was good, Scott.

1936
01:13:15,574 --> 01:13:18,499
When I was fighting, man,
I was beating everybody.

1937
01:13:18,578 --> 01:13:19,875
I was unstoppable.

1938
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:23,051
And then when I got my big
break to fight for the UFC,

1939
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:25,378
I thought to step it up.

1940
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:30,468
And during training,
I just destroyed my neck.

1941
01:13:30,593 --> 01:13:31,890
That was it.

1942
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:33,430
Over.

1943
01:13:33,596 --> 01:13:35,349
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know that.

1944
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:37,480
Look, if you don't think
I deserve this fight,

1945
01:13:37,559 --> 01:13:38,811
you know what,
I'm not gonna take it.

1946
01:13:38,894 --> 01:13:40,147
No, you deserve it.

1947
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:41,944
It's just me. It's...

1948
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:44,740
I'll set this up.

1949
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:46,116
I'm sorry, bud.

1950
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:48,332
Yeah.

1951
01:13:50,283 --> 01:13:54,255
It's just...
Yoga makes me emotional.

1952
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:59,466
Mr. Voss, welcome.

1953
01:13:59,586 --> 01:14:00,930
Come, this way.

1954
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:03,432
I want to thank you
for your help.

1955
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:05,640
<i>Business has
never been better.</i>

1956
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:07,183
Oh, that's great.
I'm so glad.

1957
01:14:07,346 --> 01:14:08,644
Your table.
Joe. What's up'?

1958
01:14:08,765 --> 01:14:09,766
What's up, Niko?
How are you, brother'?

1959
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:10,897
Scott, nice to meet you.

1960
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:12,023
I am such a big fan.

1961
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:13,150
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, man.

1962
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:14,523
Joe Rogan, wow.

1963
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:16,528
I showed Dana White
some of your fights,

1964
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:18,573
and I was there
at the Romero fight.

1965
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,074
Great job when
you put him down.

1966
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:22,123
That is a tough guy.
That's a serious win.

1967
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:24,121
Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much.
ERIC: Good evening, gentlemen.

1968
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,831
I have created some
delicious lettuce wraps,

1969
01:14:27,955 --> 01:14:32,302
prepared with very little oil
and a hint of ginger.

1970
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:35,886
Thanks.

1971
01:14:35,965 --> 01:14:39,937
Actually, best eaten
while hot, so...

1972
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,104
Yeah, we're gonna...

1973
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,478
ERIC: Enjoy.
Yep, yeah.

1974
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:45,560
{QUIETLY} Get out of here.

1975
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,355
Okay.

1976
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,733
Thanks.

1977
01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:51,318
So, here's the deal.

1978
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:54,371
The UFC had a fighter
fall out last minute

1979
01:14:54,654 --> 01:14:56,953
in an undercard fight
against Ken Dietrich

1980
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:58,831
in Las Vegas next week.

1981
01:14:58,993 --> 01:15:00,917
Dana's a little worried
you might throw up on him.

1982
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,881
No, no, that was
a one-time deal.

1983
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,798
I'm telling you, it was some bad
applesauce that got away from me.

1984
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,846
It won't happen again.
Good to hear.

1985
01:15:07,922 --> 01:15:09,765
Look, my daughter got
into music in middle school.

1986
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,137
It changed her life.

1987
01:15:11,217 --> 01:15:14,267
And I think what you're doing
is awesome, and the UFC agrees.

1988
01:15:14,346 --> 01:15:16,064
We'd like to
give you a shot.

1989
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:17,900
Now, Niko,
you had some concerns'?

1990
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:21,651
He's ready.

1991
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,232
JOE: Okay, good.

1992
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,701
I'm gonna grab one of
these lettuce things,

1993
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:26,031
and I'll see
you boys in Vegas.

1994
01:15:26,111 --> 01:15:27,363
All right, Joe, thanks.
Good luck, sir.

1995
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:28,948
Wow. Thank you.

1996
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:30,370
You got yourself a fight!

1997
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:31,788
Fight!

1998
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:33,787
MARTY: Okay. I can't believe
that we're doing this.

1999
01:15:33,912 --> 01:15:34,959
NIKO: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

2000
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:36,585
Oh, my God,
I love you guys!

2001
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:38,709
I really do.
Take it easy, Marty.

2002
01:15:38,793 --> 01:15:40,215
Oh! Listen,

2003
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:42,552
I have a window seat
and I pee a lot.

2004
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:44,304
Do you mind if I...
Okay, we're switching seats.

2005
01:15:44,424 --> 01:15:46,052
Thank you very much.

2006
01:15:46,553 --> 01:15:47,600
I'll be right back, honey.

2007
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,721
Okay.

2008
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:51,980
Hey, Scott. Can I talk
to you for a second?

2009
01:15:52,101 --> 01:15:53,398
Sure.

2010
01:15:53,477 --> 01:15:55,105
I just want to tell you
how grateful we are

2011
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,449
for everything you've been
doing for my family.

2012
01:15:57,607 --> 01:15:59,406
It's been an honor.

2013
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:01,116
He's my hero.

2014
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:02,907
{MAN SINGING}

2015
01:16:03,448 --> 01:16:05,246
Mine, too.

2016
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:09,080
Thank you.

2017
01:16:10,915 --> 01:16:12,589
All right, you gonna
wish me luck or what?

2018
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,594
Please be careful.

2019
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:18,054
Niko says this guy you're
fighting is really dangerous.

2020
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:20,102
Look, I'm going in there,
I'm gonna lose the fight,

2021
01:16:20,178 --> 01:16:21,805
get my 10 grand,
and I'm getting out.

2022
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:23,431
{CLEARS THROAT}

2023
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:29,443
I know you really want
to kiss me right now.

2024
01:16:29,522 --> 01:16:31,274
But I think we have
something special here,

2025
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:33,827
and I don't want
to rush the magic.

2026
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:35,571
Okay, first of all, do you
know anything about magic?

2027
01:16:35,654 --> 01:16:37,032
'Cause magic
has to be rushed,

2028
01:16:37,115 --> 01:16:38,332
otherwise you can see
how the trick is done.

2029
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,952
So, bring it in.

give me a little bit...

Hey!
What?

01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,231
What are you doing, man?
Just a little bite.

2066
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:06,566
No way,
you're fighting tomorrow.

2067
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:08,269
Come on.
I made weight today.

Doesn't matter. MARK: Bro,
you've been eating clean

2069
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,233
for six weeks. You eat this
crap and you'll be lethargic.

2070

I don't care if
I'm "lethargic."

One bite, come on, man.

Have it after the fight.

Fine, just give me a smell.
