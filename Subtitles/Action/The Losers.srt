185
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,090
You were there.You know what we did.

186
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,300

187
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,300
Man killed us,Clay.

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200

194
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,280
But I heard his voice.

195
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,810
A man with a voice is a man with a throat.

196
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,420
-The guy has a throat ...- Come ...

197
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,620
Clay,look around you.

198
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,220
Do you really think we are in position to take on CIA super spook?

199
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,520
- Rogue ...- No,its a hell of a plan.

200
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,890
Know what Pooch can setup there next to the taco stand,

201
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,630
and Jensen can serve communications right there next to hookers.

202
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,430
- Captain ...- Yo! Yo! ...

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,630

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,340

205
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,040
All right?

206
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,740
Clay,for Christ sake your losing your mind.

207
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,850
- Men are falling ...-Well your losing me,okay?

208
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,050
He won,We lost.so lets gets us home.

209
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,860
Can you do that?

210
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,130
Cheers.

211
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,030

212
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,140

213
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,340
You want a bite?

214
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,250
Maybe later.

215
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,350

216
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160

221
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,590
Wow! its everything a girl could dream of.

222
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,660
Do u have a bathroom?

223
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,100
No,I specifically asked only the hotel room in the world that has no bathroom.

224
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,910
Are u trying  to turn a  "Yes" into a "No"?

225
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,110
Oh.Thank you.

226
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,320
So,What brings you in Bolivia?

227
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,320

228
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,430

229
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,630
Yeah well,it's an amazing cruise ship.

230
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,240
Where were we now?

231
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,150

How did you know that we were alive?

245
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
I counted the number of teeth in the chopper wreckage.

246
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,600

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,710
Its pretty much a suicide missions.

251
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Why should i trust you ?

252
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Be because if i was lying,I would'nt of use words "suicide mission ''.

253
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,330

Yes it was.

261
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,960
Sorry we're late.It was a party at the doll factory.

262
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,960
Pepito's birthday.

263
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,860
- Yes ...- Yeah.

264
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,870
So,she wanted to meet in a cemetery?

265
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,880

266
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
- I'm the only one thats sees his shirt? - No.

267
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,630
Ahh! Its my niece soccer team?8 and under.

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,490
There in the play-offs!

271
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,590
What do we have on her ?

272
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,300
Besides a pants bustin crush ...

273
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
The company file is blank.

274
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
CIA has a standing kill order on her.

275
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,910
Hamas,Sien Feim ...pretty much all except PETA wants this chick antsgrave.

276
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,210
Hey,think you're thinking clear on this?

277
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,910
Hein?Because every time you messed up it was because of a women.

278
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,730
- Name one time that i..- Amber.

279
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,520
Amber was not the problem Her husband was the problem.

280
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,520
Amber's husband was not the one who shot you.

281
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,020
- it was only in the leg .- What about Emma?

282
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,870
Emma doesnt count,I didnd sleep with Emma.

283
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,630
No because She put a bomb in Your Car.

284
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,130
alright i have to admit it.

285
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,830
It did take lil romance out the relationship.

286
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,330
Yes,now this chick shows up n...

287
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,040

288
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm clear,Rogue.

289
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,440
You better be,because I aint gettin killed by no girl.

290
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,150
Long time since anyone called me a Girl.

291
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,450
She put a bomb in your car?

292
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,850
She was volatile..

293
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,660
Aisha,they are Jensen Pooch,Rogue and Cougar.

294
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,760
Really?

295
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,170
Gentlemen,in 97 hours,Max will be in Miami.

296
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,640
He Travels in an armored column,

297
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,370
that at least 30 guards armed to the teeth.

298
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,480
You have a better chance at kidnapping the president.

299
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,080
The good news for you is ...

300
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,480
I have the power bring you back to the U.S.

301
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,090
And fund the entire Ops,as you see fit

302
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,290
You get Max it and we're square.

303
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,490
And ...Why should we belive u ?

304
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,900
Because I'm the first person you've met that even admits he exist.

305
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Listen,you guys can all stay here in Bolivia n rott.

306
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,310
Or go home and get revenge on the man that framed you.

307
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,710
It is your choice.

308
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,010
Colonel?

309
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,710
Dont call me that.We are not soldiers anymore.

310
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,420
All right.You know that if we do this,

311
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,020
we are waging a war against C.I.A.

312
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,420
They had started it!.

313
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,420


314
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,630
Okay,heres what im hearing ...

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,540
Im hearing "No" Im hearing "Leave"

316
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,540
Im hearing  'Im Sorry." Is that what im hearing?

317
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,040
We can not do what you ask.

318
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,140
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,050
Tell me,Nabil ...is it a moral issue,or financial issues?

320
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,350
- A moral issue.- Really?

321
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,250
- You moraly object to this deal? - Yes.I'm sorry.

322
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,750
- Please,leave.- Alright so that what im hearing.

323
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,860
Now,I want U to listen to me.

324
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,360
Listen carefully.

325
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,760
Because I want U to hear this.

326
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Wade?

327
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,670
Ahhg!! What is this?

328
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,570
What are you doing?

329
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,470
What? No! Please!

330
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,690
What the hell was that?

331
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,290
You gave me the nod.

332
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,190
To hit the face nod,not to throw him off the roof nod.

333
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,860
I thought thats what you wanted?!?!?!.

334
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,900
At most,at most that was a brake his finger nod.

335
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,200
Jesus! Wade..

336
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
The man was a scientific genius.

337
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,610
granted his weight signals certains impulse controls issues

338
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,410
But thats no reason to throw his fat ass off 57 floors .

339
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,910
sorry...

340
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,710
Well ...

341
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,220
I think I speak for everyone here

342
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,420
May say your actions were excessive.

343
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,920
And yes,more than just a little wasteful.

344
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,830
But then it does seem to have the desired effects.

345
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,430
ill tell you what.Throw baldy up next .

346
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,740
No,please.Wait.

347
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,740
We have a different moral perspective that of our late colleague.

348
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,640
I need one to test it and four to use.

349
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,840
Four snoops?

350
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,050
We will need much money.

351
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,850
you will have ''Much money''.

352
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,900


353
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Welcome back to the land of the living.

354
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
How do you want to begin?

355
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,610
We're gonna go bird huntin,

356
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,660
Its a Sonic Dematerialized.

357
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,260
Better known as "Snoop."

358
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,970
21st Century green terrorist.

359
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,170
Pure destruction,no pollution.

360
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,980
So,who we sellin'em to?

361
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,650
Chinese extremists,the PLF,French,Basque,I do not care.

362
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,990
As long as they have the right  price,and willing to use it.

363
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,890
No stock pilling ,No detourence.

364
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,090
It's like giving a hand gun to a six years old,Wade.

You do not know how its gonna end,but pretty sure it will make the papers.

Classic loss of identity.

416

Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure.

417
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,720
his way of measuring the good he did the world.

418
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,020

438
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,410

Do you have any hobbies?

444
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,040
When I was little

445
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,440
I collected human ears.

446
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,450
Good times  ...

447
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,350

No,no,no.k listen ...

449
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,570
If you want a gas turbine generator find a force fed electrified unit

450
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,070
hooked it to the fuel tank.

451
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,370
Are few things in life which can not be solved by duct tape.

452
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,480
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

453
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,880
Its takin care of,thanks.

454
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,180

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,390
Aisha?

456
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,190

457
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,150

I want answers.

464
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,010
Max is trying to buy next generation weapons.

465
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,510
I dont know the end game.

466
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,020

Do you gonna put a bullet in the head.Sounds fair?

481

Sounds fun.

482
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,060
Sounds like my parents.

483
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,560
I knew your not gonna shoot her.

484
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,770

Yes,I am aware thats not us.

644
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,240

645
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840

00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,550

00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,400
Freeze!!

729
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,100
Wow! this has gotten serious.

730
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,610
I'm warning you!

731
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,720
I am a lethal killing machine.

732
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,520
It was a secret government experiment

733
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,920
They did stuff to me ...

734
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,630
Spooky stuff...

735
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,330
Anal stuff...

736
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,330
Turned me in a dangerous telekinetic.

737
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,640
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states,

738
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,640
"Dont start none''

739
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
wont be none."

740
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,250
"telekinetik" your way on these.

741
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,270
Face Down..

742
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,770
Or I'll make your heart stop beating with my mind.

743
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,580
Thanks,Cougar.

744
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,090
- Who has the hard drive? - Yeah.

745
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,890

748
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,370
- A what? -21st century Human Briefcase .

749
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:04,170
Russian Mob banks pionnered them its like electronic bearer bonds.

750
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,610
All right,say it again but much slower and dumber,please.

751
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,920
Pretrend your super evil,

752
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,920
And you want to move a ton of you i'll gutted blood money

753
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,020
but you cant because it can be tracked.

754
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,030
So you load the cash On this badboy

755
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,030
and you can physically move anywhere you want to go.

756
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,630
We have Max's courrier drive ,right?

757
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,030
We have Max's $ 400 million dollars.

758
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,740
R'right Clay,before you do something noble,Like smashing it,

759
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,140
I say we go on Amazon.com And get a jet.

760
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,740
Ahhh it doesnt work that way.

761
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,450
Unfortunately,courrier-drive can be Loaded and unloaded

762
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,450
On there home system.

763
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,350
Although,if we were gonna buy stuff,

764
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,350
I say a canary yellow streatch Hummer.

765
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,820
No,no.We're gonna trade it back to him .

766
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,960
Hes gonna get his money and we will clear our name.

767
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,560
- No,We did a deal.- Yes.

768
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,460
Aisha ...

769
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,860
Hes gonna kill us now,you know that,

770
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,430
Yes,I know that.

771
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,870
This thing has a record all IPs from where it was accessed.

772
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,470
And one address comes up alot.

773
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,180
its obviously a place where this thing keep going back too.

774
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,380
Max's Base of Operations .

775
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,580
Port of Los Angeles.

776
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,990
there probably files of every Black book ops which he ever did .

777
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,190
Including Bolivia.

778
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,890
We could hit it there and clean it out.

779
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,790
Expose the world the what hes done.

780
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,900
And clear ourname in the prossess.

781
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,800
A'right,it's a good plan.

782
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,500
But we still kill him.

783
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,410
Absolutely.

784
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,810


785
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,610
We appreciate you meeting us at a single storie facility

786
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,420
No problem.

787
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,220
I regard the whole incident

788
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,420
as a way of us knows each others bisiness orientation.

789
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
I agree.

790
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,820
But now that we do know each other,

791
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,430
Know that if you ever get near me with that Yankee-cockeye Bullshit

792
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,230
You will be fed to my dogs.

793
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,640
As you know,we've have a hiccup on our end with the money

794
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,040
One billion dollars.This is the new price.

795
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,240
- A billion? - Cash.

796
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,540
Cash will be difficult.

797
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,850
Difficult? Mr.Wade...

798
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,650

Cultivate your serenity.

803
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,060
way less difficult.

804
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,060
But you,you want to buy bombs.

805
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,970
I afraid that this is a more difficult way of life.

806
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,670

- Congratulations,man.- Congratulations,thank you ...

861
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,330
You say that now,but you know Jolene.

When she know I'm alive,she's gonna kill me.

01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,630
I cant let her have that baby without me.

865
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,540
Ofcourse we all know we're gonna die in there.

01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,950
Or can do this without you.

867

No,you cant.

868
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,250

Got it!

870
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,460
Fadhil's 4 million didnt disappeared,

871
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,960
but entered into a private account.

872
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,460
Whose account?

873
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,270
It's a family trust...

874
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,670

875

01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,850
Painting terrorist camp

880
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,290
So we could bomb it.

881
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,590
It turns out that we were executing Max's redetta.

882
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,100
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

883
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
A Target a target.

884
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,200
It would have been no difference if I have wouldnt've seen those kids.

885
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,210
- You went in? - Yeah.

886
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,710
Had to.

887
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,410
There were 25 children in innocent.

888
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Have you seen him?

889
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,020
Yes.

890
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,730
Why do you want to know all this?

891
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,230
Did you kill Fadhil,Clay?

892
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,730
Who are you?

893
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,240
Fadhil's daughter,Clay! Fadhil's daughter!

894
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,640
She's Fadhil's daughter.

You'd rather it be pointed at your face??

898
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,850
I know it makes no sense,but yes!

899
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,850
It's better now?

900
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,060
Not really.

901
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,660
Where's your gun,Jensen?

902
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,520
In the van?!

903
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,430

"Hi.How are you?"

918
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,150
''How have you been ?"

919
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,660
