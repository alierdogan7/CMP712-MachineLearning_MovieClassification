We have hostages.

189
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,965
Hey. Welcome back, Murtaugh.

190
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,216

Adrian, what's up?

196
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:15,717
Three armed suspects inside,
about 20 hostages,

197
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,384
and they beat up
a security guard pretty bad.

198
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,417
- Anybody talk to them yet?
- ‭ADRIAN: They said something about

199
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,234

- Yeah, good luck with that.

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,186
He was actually a SEAL.

366
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,437
'06 through '11.

367
00:14:04,523 --> 00:14:05,989
He also has scarring on his wrists.

368
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,491
Might not have been his first attempt.

369
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,943
MURTAUGH: Hmm.

370
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,661
Okay. Well, I think we have

371
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:12,996
a pretty clear picture of what happened.

372
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,948
I'll go fill out some paperwork.

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,399
RIGGS: How'd he get here?

374
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:19,953
No car, no bike, no bus stop.

375
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,088
Maybe he walked.

376
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:24,791
He's got silt on
the bottom of his boots.

377
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,459
If he'd've walked, it would've come off.

378
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:27,427
There's none of that around here.

379
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:28,461
Maybe he Ubered.

380
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,130
RIGGS: To kill himself?

381
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,631
Come on, seems like a pain
in the ass, don't you think?

382
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:32,933
Wouldn't you just go bang at home?

383
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,218
I wouldn't know.

384
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,687
Lucky you.

385
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,889
Take the body to the morgue.

386
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,108
Push his autopsy
to the front of the line.

387
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,225
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

388
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,694
This man served his country.

389
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,399
I'm gonna give him
a proper investigation.

390
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,821
(sniffles quietly)

391
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,491
We are very sorry about your loss,
Mrs. Alvarez.

392
00:14:58,543 --> 00:14:59,876
He didn't do this.

393
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,386
Do you understand me?

394
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:04,247
Ma'am, we're exploring
all possibilities.

395
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,082
That's why we're here.

396
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,134
We noticed some scarring

397
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,895
on your husband's wrists.

398
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:11,838
That was a long time ago,

399
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,424
when he first got home from the war.

400
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,842
One day, I came home

401
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:18,428
early from work, and I found him.

402
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,262
In the tub.

403
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,901
But then everything changed.

404
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,631
How so?

405
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,178
MRS. ALVAREZ: He found this new job,

406
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:30,407
working security
down at the Port of L.A.

407
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:33,193
He was exercising, he stopped taking

408
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,112
his anti-anxiety medicine, Klonopin.

409
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,865
I think he felt like a soldier again.

410
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:41,668
Mrs. Alvarez,

411
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:44,004
were you guys going somewhere?

412
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,288
(sighs)

413
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,506
Yeah.

414
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,729
Ramon wanted us to start over.

415
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,260
He found us a big house

416
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,846
in Arizona.

417
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,047
When were you leaving?

418
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:57,217
Next week.

419
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:06,393
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Alvarez.

420
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,817
Lefty, huh?

421
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:15,504
This your dad's?

422
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,991
You guys play?

423
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,293
We'd play catch sometimes.

424
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:24,911
Always seemed to make him happy.

425
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,955
I certainly understand killing yourself

426
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,573
once you've moved to Arizona

427
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,076
but seems a little aggressive
to do it the week before, no?

428
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,028
If you were gonna kill yourself,

429
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,402
how would you do it?

430
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:42,562
Hypothetically.

431
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,902
Pills seem nice, you know?

432
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,237
Drift off, fall asleep.

433
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,571
Then, of course,
some idiot pumps your stomach,

434
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:48,739
you wake up, you're in the hospital,

435
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:49,844
you gotta go to work the next day,

436
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,885
everybody knows about it,
that's humiliating.

437
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,386
I have heard really nice things

438
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,971
about drowning, though, you know?
‭No, no, no.

439
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,641
If you were going to shoot yourself,

440
00:16:58,429 --> 00:16:59,595
how would you do it?

441
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,541
May I?

442
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:09,152
Come on. I'm not gonna
do it here, I promise.

443
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:22,699
First, I'd swing by Home Depot.

444
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,367
Pick up a nice,
polyethylene plastic sheet,

445
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,753
lay it out nice and neat
so as not to make a mess.

446
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,789
Then I'd take my final,
last shot of Jonathan Daniel's,

447
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,708
leave the instructions for my internment

448
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:34,711
and a nice $6,500 check
for burial costs.

449
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,013
Actually, things are
more expensive out here.

450
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,048
I might need to look into that.

451
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,850
My point was,

452
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,385
you'd use your dominant hand.

453
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,856
So why would Alvarez

454
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,691
shoot himself with his right hand

455
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,025
if he was lefty?

456
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,228
Maybe he didn't.

457
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:53,063
Guy wants to get out of town in a week,

458
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:54,397
he's either really excited
to get somewhere...

459
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,565
Or he's trying to get away from someone.

460
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,118
Come on.

461
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,619
Where we going?

462
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,371
To find out how a guy who works security

463
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,291
can afford a big house in Arizona.

Tight security today?

469

Sorry, we got the Grand Prix
circuit in town.

470
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,803
Been kind of a zoo around here.

471
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,005
Daryl Hennicky.

472

Run patrol for the docks.

473

Wait a minute. Isn't that Customs' job?

474
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,689
We just babysit the containers
till they process 'em.

475
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,422
And what did Ramon Alvarez do here?

476
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,423
Basic foot patrol.

477
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:35,507
Didn't know him very well.

478
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:36,675
He was a good worker.

479
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,260
Showed up on time.

480
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:39,812
His patrol was right over there,

481
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:41,146
a warehouse belonging to an importer.

482
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,514
You mind?

483
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:43,682
Nah, go for it.

We're here to inform you
that one of your co-workers,

488
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,998
Mr. Ramon Alvarez, just passed away.

489
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,250
He was a rent-a-cop, not a co-worker.

490
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,952
But I heard he had a young son.

491
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,371
It's a tragedy.

492
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,913
What about him?

493
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,198
He a co-worker?

494
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,453
He's an employee.

495
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,607
- Why?
- ‭I dig his ink.

- Go say hi.

I'm gonna go talk to him. Maybe
we know some of the same people.

629
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,276
which I associated with
a cartel in Juarez.

630
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,861
Right, so he questioned him.

631
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,112

Just, um...

730
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,412
Hi. Martin Riggs.

731
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:26,613
The guy that almost
got your husband killed.

732
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:27,914
I'm sure you've heard a lot about me.

733
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,846
Not a word. We're about to have dinner.

734
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,926
Would you like to come in, Martin Riggs?

735
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:31,702
No, he can't.

736
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,972
- He can't...
- Yeah, and I ate, like, a week ago,

737
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:35,038
- so, you know, I'm fine.
- TRISH: Oh.

738
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,540
- I mean, it smells great, but...
- (laughing): Oh.

739
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,542
- Tastes even better.
- Oh, okay.

740
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,807
My dad says you were in a war.

741
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,442
See any action?

742
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:56,393
(groans) Such a nerd.

743
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,529
Yeah, a little.

744
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,329
You know, I'm thinking
about enlisting, too.

745
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,282
No, you're not.

746
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,950
ROGER JR.: I want real-life experience.

747
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,152
What am I gonna learn at Princeton

748
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:06,165
that I couldn't learn from the Internet?

749
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,704

750
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,290

751
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,875
I think you should enlist.

752
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,126
Hell, I think there should be a draft.

753
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,245
But I suppose

754
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,080
it all depends on the life
experience you're after.

755
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,915
If you want to see your best
friend's head get blown off,

756
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,417
it's ideal.

757
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,335

to piss off your parents?

758
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,921
Hitchhiking through Thailand,
that be a little bit better.

759
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,911
See, Mom, that's exactly
what I'm talking about. Experience.

760
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,092
No, stop, we're not talking
about that right...

761
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:30,093

762

763
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,174
I don't like being out of the loop.

764
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:35,175
What's happening?

765
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,664
I had a teeny bit of weed.

766
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,995
- What?!
- And now Mom is losing her sh...

767
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,425
- No... watch it.
- ‭stuff.

768
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,332
Watch it. Losing her stuff.

769
00:28:41,357 --> 00:28:42,478
I'm really impressed
with the weed out here.

770
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:44,218
I mean, it's incredible, you know?

771
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,987
I mean, as far as I can tell,
it's really the only perk

772
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,572
to living in California.

773
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,807
I had massive, you know,
psychological issues.

774
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:59,476
So, of course, I would never,
uh, suggest that for a child.

775
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,011
What I would suggest, though,

776
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,679
maybe your old man
take a little hit off the tree.

777
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,431
You know what I mean? Little
bald-headed Coolio gets loose.

778

779
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,601
That's funny, huh?

780
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:08,936
I like being tight.

781
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:10,104
It keeps me alive.

782
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,189
Well, we can tell. Yeah.

783
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,825
So, Martin... do you have any kids?

784
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,663
Uh... no.

785
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:21,532
Um...

786
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:22,771
wasn't really in the cards.

787
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:24,451
- You know?
- Mm. But you're married?

788
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,756
Not anymore.

789
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,291
Not anymore, no.

You had an affair with your gun.

Nobody's laughing.

794
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,520
She passed away.

Yeah, they keep us on our toes.

811

And up all night.

812
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,399
Yeah, I noticed the slight...

813
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,518
The slight age difference, yeah.

814
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:34,820
What do you want?
It wasn't part of the plan.

815
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,071
Trish was 42.

816
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,189
The kids were out.

817
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:38,858

Hey.

A few things.

See that? Notes of stippling,

847
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:05,143
or gunpowder around the entry
wound suggests the gun

848
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,945
wasn't directly against
his head when it was fired.

Nope.

851
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:10,816
Also the tox reports say he had

852
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,651
40 milligrams of Klonopin in his system.

853
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,486
Enough to kill him if the bullet
didn't get there first.

854
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,038
Didn't his wife say
he was off of that drug?

855
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:19,257
So someone had to know
the meds he was on,

856
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:20,577

00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:40,070
Okay.

904
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,039
So we're back to doing that bit

905
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:43,717
where we don't
tell each other things, right?

906
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,042
Well, I was raised

907
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:46,646
that when you come to someone's house,

908
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:49,413
no matter how disgusting it is,

909
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:50,798
you bring something.

910
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:54,418
Look who I found
in Alvarez's military records.

911
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,192
Daryl Hennicky.

912
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,889
Alvarez's boss from the port.

913
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,162
And his commanding officer

914
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,379
in Iraq.

915
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:04,589
He said they barely knew one another.

916
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,409
Well, I guess he lied.

917
00:35:06,558 --> 00:35:08,358
So I'm gonna ask you again,

918
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:10,360
what the hell is going on here, Riggs?

919
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,232
Someone kidnapped Alvarez's kid.

920
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:17,784
Told the wife

921
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,903
if she doesn't return
the heroin that he stole,

922
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,371
they're gonna kill the kid.

923
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:22,468
Heroin?

924
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:25,492
Okay, that explains why he was
rushing to get out of town.

925
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:27,377
So who has the drugs?

926
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,424
Hennicky had to know they were
smuggling drugs down at the port.

927
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,876
So he hires Alvarez
and then he convinces him

928
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,536
to steal them.

929
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:40,014
So Hennicky kills Alvarez...

930
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,933
- Mm-hmm.
- ‭...makes it look like a suicide.

931
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:44,552
Drug dealers think that
Alvarez still has their stuff

932
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,554
and the cops think he offed himself.

933
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:48,226
Perfect crime.

934
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,311
So what's the plan?

935
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,248
(inhales)

936
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,020
Go down there and talk to 'em.

937
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,483
Tell 'em I want the kid back.

938
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:57,240
Okay, then I'm going with you.

939
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,385
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
- ‭Yes, yes,

940
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:01,574
yes.

941
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:04,096
(sighs)

942
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,027
This is the kind of thing
I'd prefer to do alone.

943
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,483
You understand?

944
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:12,583
Well...

945
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,135
all right, you're the boss.

946
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,553
But you can't go running around

947
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,645

that you got there.

948
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,626
All right? So you want the 870
or you want the SIG?

949
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,591
You gotta pick one of 'em.

950
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,809
Hey, hey!

951
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,761

970
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,062
What kid?

971
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:26,680
Ramon Alvarez's son.

972
00:37:26,732 --> 00:37:29,015
Unless you got other
kidnapped children here,

973
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,900
in which case, I'll take them as well.

974
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,686
Look, I get it. You took the kid

975
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:34,521
because you thought
that his dad stole your heroin,

976
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:35,855
which he did.

977
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,023
Which, I could care less
about all of this.

978
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:39,650
My only concern is the 12-year-old boy.

979
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,861
So if you let me walk
out of here with him,

980
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:43,947
none of this ever happened.

981
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:47,590
Or we can explore option number two.

982
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:50,954
Which is?

983
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,872
Ooh. Well, that's the one where

984
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:55,124
I kill as many of you as I can
before you take me out

985
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,794
and then you up your profile from
small-time dealer to cop killer.

986
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,212
Then you spend the rest
of your life in prison

987
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:00,463
or on the run... most likely, dead.

988

1092

You have five seconds

1093
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:13,453
to get your ass in this bed.

1094
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:16,553
Oh, look at you! Look at you...

1095
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:19,126
- Mm.
- ‭Happy...

1096
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:20,844
belated...

1097
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:23,263
...birthday

1098
00:43:23,465 --> 00:43:24,765
present.

1099
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,763
Where am I going?

1100
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,018
Mm. ‭Mmm...

1101
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:29,803
(doorbell rings)

1102
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:32,055
It's okay, it's okay. Don't
worry about that. ‭Honey...

1103
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:33,640
It's just the wind. Don't worry
about it. Oh, honey, come on.

1104
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:34,892
- Go get the door.
- (doorbell rings)

1105
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:35,692
It's the wind. ‭Roger,

1106
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:37,227
go get the door, please.

1107
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:38,729
Go on! ‭Damn the door!

1108
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:41,480
What?

1109
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:43,533
Look, I, uh...

1110
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,986
I never thanked you for saving my life,

1111
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:48,038
although I'm not sure you meant
to shoot me in the foot.

1112
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,610
Thank you.

1113
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,245
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get
another shot at it.

1114
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:54,494
And I'll see you tomorrow, all right?

1115
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:58,539
- All right.
- All right.

1116
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,083
All right. (groans)

1117
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:05,283
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1118
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,076
I will see you tomorrow, right?

1119
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,945
You're not gonna go home and,
like... (imitates gunshot)

1120
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,033
No. Not tonight.

1121
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,369
But you want to.

1122
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,787
For real.

1123
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:24,127
Yeah.

1124
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:25,595
I do.

1125
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,254
But if it makes you feel any better...

1126
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,967
I can't do it myself.

1127
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:33,219
And why is that?

1128
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,060
'Cause she'd be ashamed of me.

1129
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:47,483
Crazy, right?

1130
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,487
That's probably
the least crazy thing about you.

1131
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,326
Martin! What are you doing out here?

1132
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:59,495
MURTAUGH: Oh, he just dropped
this off and then he was leaving.

1133
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:00,663
Well, did you invite him in?

1134
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:02,081
- No, 'cause he's...
- ‭No, he did not.

1135
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,416
- He didn't invite you in?
- Which was quite rude, actually.

1136
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,967
I'm standing out here;
obviously, I'm injured...

1137
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,084
- Get in here.
- ‭You know,

1138
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,647
your husband's the one that shot me

1139
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:09,298
and he's just gonna leave me
standing out here in the cold.

1140
00:45:09,352 --> 00:45:11,352
You didn't tell me that.
No, get in there.

1141
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,266
I hope I'm not intruding.

1142
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,666
Not at all.

1143
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:18,121
Don't worry, honey,
60 is right around the corner.

1144
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:23,728
Sixty? <i>Sixty?</i>

1145
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:25,802
RIGGS:You guys got anything to eat?
