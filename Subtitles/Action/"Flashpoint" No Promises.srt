1
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,274
Thank you.

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,109
I can't believe
you remember that.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,344
What, are you kidding me?

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,913
You singing
"Everybody Hurts."

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,047
Jules:
Oh sorry.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,682
Yeah, my R.E.M phase.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
(Chuckles)

8
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,452
Well, I couldn't take
my eyes off you, so...

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,087
Are you sure it didn't have
anything to do

10
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,588
with what I was wearing
maybe?

11
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,758
Uh, black leather miniskirt,
white tank top...

12
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,593
Seriously though,
you guys were good.

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,594
You coulda went
on the road.

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,262
I don't think so.

15
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,631
Yeah,
I got a confession.

16
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,767
Your best show -

17
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,702
five am,
morning after graduation,

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,836
on the roof
of the gym.

19
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,271
What?

20
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,739
You just got dumped
by Curtis

21
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:45,043
at that party...

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,544
Oh God,
I don't believe this.

23
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:47,946
You took your guitar,
you went up to roof

24
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:50,815
and you came up
with this...

25
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,183
Really gentle song-

26
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,384
you were up there?

27
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,751
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,654
It's just after I heard that
I thought...

29
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,123
I felt like I knew you.

30
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,126
You know there's this
wine tasting thing,

31
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,795
Niagara on the lake,
next weekend.

32
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,030
<i>I was thinking, you know,</i>
<i>maybe we could go.</i>

33
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:08,565
Um...

34
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,133
I mean we don't have
to stay over,

35
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,734
it could just be
a day trip.

36
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:12,635
I was just thinking 'cause
we've been seeing each other

37
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:12,868
for a while.

38
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,806
I... I just-

39
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,407
(loud pop nearby,
someone screams)

40
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,408
What was that?

41
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:20,275
That was gunfire.

42
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,777
(Screaming nearby)

43
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,079
Steve:
Hold on.

44
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,546
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Steve, wait!</i>

45
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:25,547
(Car tires and brakes screech)
Steve: Hey watch!

46
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:26,848
(Tires screech,
horns honk)

47
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,983
Jules:
Stop!

48
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,253
Man:
Somebody's been shot.

49
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,688
Jules:
Winnie, it's Jules.

50
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,023
Oh hey, how are you enjoying
your day off?

51
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,591
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>I've got shots fired.</i>

52
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,294
Inside the Sultan Grill
on the Danforth.

53
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:41,730
Guys! Guys!

54
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,196
Sam: What's happening?
Winnie: Are you okay?

55
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:44,498
We're outside the restaurant
right now.

56
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,100
Is the shooter still inside?

57
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,601
I can't see.

58
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,237
Someone's shot, Jules.
I gotta get in there.

59
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:51,471
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>No, Steve, we need to wait</i>
<i>for backup.</i>

60
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,007
<i>The shooter might</i>
<i>still be active.</i>

61
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:54,474
Sam:
Jules, hang tight!
We're coming!

62
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,209
Team one, hot call!
Suit up!

63
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:57,377
He may be dead
before they get here.

64
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:58,746
Jules:
You don't go in there.

65
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,480
<i>Steve!</i>

66
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:01,981
<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>Shots fired at the Sultan Grill</i>
<i>on the Danforth.</i>

67
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,117
<i>There's one confirmed</i>

68
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:05,918
<i>Gunman:</i>
<i>I warned you!</i>

69
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,187
<i>I ask you a simple question,</i>
<i>all you have to do is answer.</i>

70
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,855
Waitress: Eric...
Gunman: Now one more time!

71
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,423
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
tell me where he is!

72
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,159
I don't know!

73
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:15,927
Where's Riyaz?

74
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,296
I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.

75
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:19,398
Where are your hands?
Where are your hands?!

76
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:20,832
No, no cell phones.

77
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,101
Hey, all cell phones
on the floor now.

78
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,970
Now! Go get 'em!
Collect them!

79
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,239
<i>Now!</i>

80
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,408
Anyone caught attempting
to communicate with him

81
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,809
will be shot.

82
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,742
Do you understand me?!
It's gonna be okay.

83
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,444
Total communication blackout.

84
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,712
<i>Steve:</i>
<i>I'm a medic,</i>
<i>I'm gonna help you.</i>

85
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,913
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

86
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,582
All right.
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

87
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,949
<i>What're you doing?</i>

88
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,084
He just wants to make sure
that he's okay.

89
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,919
Okay, well get away.
Come on get away.

90
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,754
Get away from him!

91
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:45,623
You, lock it.

92
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,957
Lock the door!

93
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,292
You, barricade it -
tables and chairs.

94
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,859
<i>Come on!</i>

95
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,895
Nobody's leaving
until I get some answers.

96
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,863
All right.
Okay.

97
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,333
You - knives, forks, uh...

98
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,867
Corkscrews,
any sharp implements.

99
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,836
If I find anything
that can be used as a weapon...

100
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:01,205
Go!

101
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,839
Come on, come on, come on!

102
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,342
That's good.
Get against the wall.

103
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,443
Hands where I can see 'em.

104
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,578
Go! Move!

105
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:12,748
(SUV's rumble up)

106
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:19,654
Set up a perimeter.

107
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,223
Get the uniforms
to keep these people back.

108
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,857
<i>Let's do it now.</i>

109
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,025
Parker:
We're dealing with at least
one shooter.

110
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,194
Wordy:
How many hostages?

111
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,195
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Ten, maybe more.</i>

112
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,162
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules?</i>

113
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,531
Limited vantage.

114
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,065
Looks like the front doors
are barricaded.

115
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,435
Maybe Jules can feed us
information from inside.

116
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,769
Sam:
No, if that gunman finds out
Jules is a cop...

117
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:40,641
All right.

118
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:41,975
Hey, quiet!
Hey, hey!

119
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,477
You guys clear outta here!

120
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,778
Go!

121
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,414
I want everyone to keep quiet,
I gotta think.

122
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,082
You, on the floor.

123
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,884
<i>Knees. Here.</i>

124
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:52,852
Hands behind the head.

125
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,721
You know what this place is,
right?

126
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:56,289
It's, it's a restaurant.

127
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:58,458
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

128
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,361
It looks very much like
a restaurant, but do you...

129
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,597
(Exasperated exhale)
Do you know what it is?

130
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,031
(Exhales forcefully)

131
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,768
What're you looking at?!

132
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:09,802
<i>You know what</i>
<i>it's really for?</i>

133
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,570
(Jules' phone buzzes)

134
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,173
<i>Gunman:</i>
<i>You know who eats here</i>
<i>and what they want?</i>

135
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:15,307
<i>Huh?!</i>

136
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,677
<i>Where's Riyaz?!</i>

137
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:19,945

138
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,313
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Jules is okay.</i>

139
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,448

18 hostages.

140
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,216

<i>What does the gunman want?</i>

<i>Looking for Riyaz.</i>

Who's Riyaz?

00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,125
<i>Hey, Spike,</i>

147
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>see if there's a connection</i>

<i>and someone named Riyaz.</i>

149

On it.

150
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,298
You told him not to come
because I'm here,

151
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,400
didn't you?
I don't even know who you mean.

152
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,335
I gotta try to talk to him.

153
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,070

<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Sir?</i>

Hey, you stay

I'm gonna stay
right here.

157
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,642
All right, good.

158

My name's Jules.
What's your?

159
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:54,812
Oh... (Laughs)

160
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,238
You're looking for somebody
named Riyaz?

161
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,306
Yeah, what,
you know him?

162
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,575
No, I don't.

163
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,776
But maybe I could help you
find him.

164
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,345
Oh well, he knows him.

165
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:07,380
And if he had just told me
where he was when I asked,

166
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,982
then this wouldn't have
happened.

167
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,583
(Sirens blip and wail)

168
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,317
No, oh no.

169
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,819

No, no, okay...

170
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,654
Uh, everybody...

171
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,790

Everybody against the door!

<i>Uh, go to the front.</i>
<i>Everybody, go, go, go!</i>

Get to the front.

Go. Get to the front.

175
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,563
Go now!

176
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,299
He's lining up hostages
against the window.

177
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,067
He's making a human shield.

178
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,569
Sam?

179
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:33,705
No vantage.
I'm coming down.

180
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,072
Hey, hey,
what're you doing?

181
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,440
Sir, this man is losing
a lot of blood.

182
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,876
He needs to go
to the hospital.

183
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:39,644
I said no one's leaving.

184
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:40,311
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Okay, well this is my friend,</i>
<i>Steve.</i>

185
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,845
He's a paramedic.

186
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:42,880
<i>If you let him look at him,</i>
<i>maybe he can help him</i>

187
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,548
and then you can find Riyaz.

188
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,782
<i>That's what you want,</i>

189
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,050
(Laboured breaths)

190
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:49,052
Yeah.

191
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,591
Just hang in there, buddy,
hang in.

192
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:56,693
Okay,
he's barely conscious.

193
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,827
Look, I'm gonna need
some napkins,

194
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,461
clean water
and plastic wrap.

195
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,330
I can get them.

196
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,933

200
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:12,909
Okay, we know who
we're looking for.

201
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,045
The owner of the restaurant
is Riyaz Fayad.

202
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,180
Parker:
Good, now let's find out
who's got a beef with him.

203
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,849
<i>Neighbours,</i>
<i>disgruntled employees.</i>

What's going on, Eddie?

205
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:23,919
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>All right, we got an air vent</i>
<i>on the roof.</i>

206
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:25,820

a snake cam through that.

207
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,356
All right, go for it.
Let's do it.

208
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,428
Is Eric gonna be okay?

209
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,229
He's got decreased breath
sounds on the left side.

210
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,397
What does that mean?

211
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:37,398
His lung collapsed.

212
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,666
Oh my God.

213
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,401
Look, he needs chest
decompression.

214
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,403
Wouldn't happen to have a kit
in your purse, do you?

215
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,704
Can you improvise?

216
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:45,940
Yeah, but I need a pen,
I need some vodka...

217
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:46,973
A knife.

Sir?

219
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,078
A knife.

220
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,312
What do you think I am?
An idiot?

221
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,680
Sir, I promise.
We're gonna hand it back

222
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,516

please.

223
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,018

242
00:07:58,609 --> 00:07:59,542

00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:42,149
Angle it

263

<i>it'll take time</i>

Eddie, Fayad's being

267
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,776
You think he's connected

Why do you need
to find Riyaz?

Riyaz Fayad is using
this restaurant as a front

Tell him Fayad's being
investigation by the ATU.

00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:38,124
Riyaz is already under
investigation by the ATU -

the anti-terror unit.

312
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:40,893
And if he's a terrorist,

313
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
they're gonna do everything
they can

314
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:42,995

<i>What do you have on Davis?</i>

351
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,287
Parker:
Substance abuse?

<i>No, but we do have</i>

<i>assault...</i>

354
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,756
A history of violence.

355

Also served time
in a psych ward.

356
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,258
What's he been diagnosed with?

357
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,094
I can't get details.
I'd have to get clearance.

358
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:30,963
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Well, it's some kind</i>
<i>of delusional disorder.</i>

359
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,197
Let's see if we can track down
his family.

360
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:33,398
So this terrorist attack...

361
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,500
Parker:
Could be delusion,

362
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,701
could be there's a grain
of truth.

363
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,568
Riyaz Fayad is being
investigated.

364
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,870
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>We're still waiting</i>
<i>on that call from ATU,</i>

365
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:42,373

366
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:49,113
Police! Riyaz Fayad,
open up the door.

367
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,581
Do it now!

368
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,583
Police!

369
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:54,951
(Doorknob rattles)

370
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,086
Can I help you?

371
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,187
Yeah, we're here to talk
to Riyaz Fayad.

372
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,589
What do you want
with him?

373
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:00,624
Ed:
We need to ask him
a few questions.

374
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,458
Sorry, he's not here
right now. Hey!

375
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:03,527
Ed:
Police! Wordy.

376
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:04,460
Mrs. Fayad:
Leave him alone!

377
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:05,862
Ed:
Police!

378
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,532
Wordy:
Police! Stop right there!
Police!

379
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,599
Ed:
Right there! Right there!
Let's see some hands, now!

380
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,668
<i>Wordy:</i>
<i>Do it now!</i>

381
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,038
Don't come any closer!

382
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:18,373
Mr. Fayad, I'm officer Lane,
this is officer wordsworth.

383
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,608
Now we just need to talk,

384
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:20,809
but you need to put that
weapon down now.

385
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,545
Sir, we just wanna
talk to you.

386
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:24,246
I haven't done anything
wrong!

387
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:25,580
Mr. Fayad.

388
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,582
We have to consider that
a threat, sir.

389
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,350
I know how this works!

390
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,554
You capture me like an animal -

391
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,022
no lawyer,
no rights -

392
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,256
fly me off to some other country
to be tortured!

393
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,791
Mrs. Fayad:
Please, Riyaz, don't!

394
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,893
Mrs. Fayad, back in the house.
Back in the house!

395
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,795
Cashmira, stay back.

396
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,729
Mr. Fayad,
listen to your wife.

397
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,364
<i>We just wanna talk here.</i>

398
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,667
You knock on my door
with assault weapons

399
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:47,834
for a conversation?

400
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:49,335
We will put the guns away.

401
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,738
Please, put the pipe down.

402
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:55,275
Cashmira: Please, Riyaz.
Ed: Just help us out here.

403
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,077
Don't make this
any worse.

404
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,150
That's it.
Thank you, sir. Wordy?

405
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,219
Drop it, drop it.
Right down!

406
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,754
Ed:
That's it.

407
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:11,891
Wordy:
Turn around.
Up against the fence.

408
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:15,660
Just tell me if he's okay,
will you?

409
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:16,928
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Right now he's got a gun</i>

410
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,496
and he's holding
several people hostage

411
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:19,931
inside a restaurant.

412
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,034
Oh, my God.
Davis, my boy.

413
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:25,036
Oh.

414
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,706
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Mr. Lagosto, we understand</i>
<i>that your son has a history</i>

415
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:29,840
<i>of mental illness.</i>

416
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,175
Yeah.

417
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,877
He was diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic

418
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,479
when he was 15.

419
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:37,279
So he suffers
from delusions?

420
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:39,749
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>Yeah... yeah.</i>

421
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,151
<i>Davis thinks everyone's</i>
<i>out to get him.</i>

422
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,221
Jules:
Hey, Davis, how you doing?
Are you okay?

423
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:46,288
Riyaz should've been here
by now,

424
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:47,456
<i>where is he?</i>

425
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:48,825
Well, the police
are looking for him.

426
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,393
Yeah, well,
we're running out of time.

427
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:53,762
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>We have an armed man</i>
<i>who has barricaded himself</i>

428
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,964
inside your restaurant
looking for you,

429
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,266
now we need to know why.

430
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,901
His name is Davis Lagosto.
You ever seen him?

431
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,570
No, I've never seen him
before.

432
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:04,906
Soldiers are all out
in the middle east, you know,

433
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,143
but where are they
when we need them here?

434
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,877
Why do we need soldiers
here?

435
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,878
Davis:
There are terror operatives
in every major city

436
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,647
in North America.

437
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,782
Of course we need them here.

438
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,118
Sounds really scary.

439
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:20,688
He thought his mother
was under orders to kill him.

440
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:23,691
So he came into our bedroom
one night

441
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,693
while we were sleeping,
with a rope,

442
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,663
tied it around her neck,
tried to strangle her.

443
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,266
I'm sorry.
That sounds terrifying, sir.

444
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,168
(Sighs heavily)

445
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,036
But we loved him,
you know?

446
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,571
(Exhales heavily)

447
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,474
There are dozens
of sleeper cells

448
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,209
all across this country.

449
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,611
It's not just al-Qaeda.

450
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,181
It's Hezbollah and Hamas.

451
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,948
<i>Wordy:</i>
<i>Gunman's convinced that</i>
<i>you're planning an attack</i>

452
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,284
on the subway system.

453
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,018
(Scoffs)
Of course.

454
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,687
'Cause I'm a "terrorist."

455
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,055
Ever since those
news reports came out,

456
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,390
they've threatened my wife
and my child.

457
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,791
They painted hate messages
on my home

458
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,693
and my restaurant -

459
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,994
all based on nothing.

460
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,262
He could be living
next door to you

461
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,030
and you wouldn't even
know it.

462
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,799
And you feel like
it's your responsibility

463
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,966
to do something about it.

464
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,570
I don't have a choice!

465
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,970
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>There was an anti-psychotic.</i>

466
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,407
It really helped
for a while.

467
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,642
Davis managed
to get through college,

468
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,444
got a degree
in chemical engineering.

469
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,045
What,
the drug stopped working?

470
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:24,114
Robert:
Yeah, he had a breakdown
after college,

471
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,816
had to be hospitalized.

472
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,017
Ed:
All right, Mr. Fayad,

473
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,219
can we take a look
at those threats?

474
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:30,320
Gladly.

475
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,488
Wordy, uncuff him.
Ma'am?

476
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,760
Is he on any medication
right now?

477
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:40,830
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>I really don't know.</i>
<i>I...</i>

478
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,998
I haven't seen my son
in over a year.

479
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,867
Why not, sir?

480
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,301
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>The last time I checked him</i>
<i>into the hospital,</i>

481
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:47,769
he got very angry;

482
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:50,472
he thought I was trying
to have him committed.

483
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,207
<i>When he got out,</i>

484
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:55,310
I tried to get him
to come home, but...

485
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,945
He didn't want any part of me.

486
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:59,281
Okay, where's he living now?
Do you know?

487
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,349
Robert:
He's, uh, at Harmony House.

488
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,552
It's a group home.
St. George Street.

489
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,587
Okay, just hang on one second,
Mr. Lagosto.

490
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,821
Get a hold of Harmony House.

491
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,022
I'm sure he's got
a social worker there.

492
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,358
Let's get in touch
with him.

493
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,162
Parker: Mr. Irwin?
Clive: Yeah.

494
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,397
How're you doing?
I'm sergeant Parker.

495
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:17,597
Thank you for coming.

496
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,333
Will you follow me
please, sir?

497
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:22,569
So you're Davis's
primary social worker?

498
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,738
Yeah, I've known him
for over two years.

499
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,872
Look,
this is all my fault.

500
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,307
Davis is my responsibility.

501
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,709
Look, we understand
that Davis has been charged

502
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:30,910
with assault in the past.

503
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:32,279
Now,
these violent outbursts,

504
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:33,545
do they happen often?

505
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,547
He's not some kind of monster.
He's sick.

506
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:37,015
Yeah, I understand that,
Mr. Irwin.

507
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,485
Look, paranoid schizophrenics
are prone to suspicion.

508
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:40,819
If they feel threatened,

509
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,554
they sometimes lash out
to protect themselves.

510
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:43,889
But Davis believes
that terrorists

511
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,891
are planning an attack
on the city.

512
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,559
What did he say?

513
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:49,794
He said that restaurant
is a front for a terror cell.

514
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,230
Has he mentioned
Riyaz Fayad before?

515
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,666
I don't think so,

516
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,101
but he's been talking a lot
about terrorists lately.

517
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,936
Do you know what might have
triggered that?

518
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,406
Terrorism's all over the news
these days.

519
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,241
Bombings in Madrid,
Chechnya...

520
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,375
Yeah.

521
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,478
Eric?

522
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,149
<i>Waitress:</i>
<i>Oh my God!</i>

523
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,551
What's happening?

524
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,487
His pulse is thready.
There's no breath sounds.

525
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,855
Angela:
Oh my God.

526
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:21,090
Come on, Eric,
hang in there!

527
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,758
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

528
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,862
<i>Hang in there, buddy.</i>

529
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,163
Steve.

530
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,532
<i>Waitress:</i>
<i>Why're you stopping?</i>

531
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,267
Help, please!

532
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,902
Tell him to keep going.

533
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,271
<i>Why're you stopping?!</i>

534
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:36,873
I'm sorry, it's...

535
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:37,973
No!

536
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,309
Man: Oh my God.
Davis: Hey!

537
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,877
Is he dead?

538
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:43,411
Yes.

539
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,546
Oh.

540
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:46,648
Oh?

541
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,050
Okay, Angela...

542
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,952
That's all
you have to say?!

543
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,954
<i>Eric never did anything</i>
<i>to you.</i>

544
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,155
<i>Davis:</i>
<i>Okay, shhh.</i>

545
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,688
He harboured
a known terrorist.

546
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:57,391
Riyaz is not a terrorist!
What's wrong with you?!

547
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,860
Okay, she's escalating him now.

548
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,061
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Angela, you know what?</i>

549
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,729
We need to stay really calm
right now.

550
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,265
<i>Davis:</i>
<i>Hey! All right, just shut up!</i>
<i>Quiet!</i>

551
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,499
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Both of you!</i>

552
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,601
You come in here
on a Muslim witch hunt...

553
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,303
No, you're not listening to me,
all right?

554
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,504
This is a front
for a terrorist operation.

555
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,572
You are not listening to me.

556
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:13,974
So then what does that
make me?

557
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,542
All right, oh my God,
you're one of them.

558
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,245
You're a black widow.

559
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,247
So now I'm a terrorist too?!

560
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,915
Aw crap!

561
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,449
Davis:
Everybody, get back!
Stay back, everybody!

562
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:24,851
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

563
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,585
Davis, what do you see?

564
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:27,686
All right, she's got a bomb.
She's about to detonate a bomb.

565
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,088
Angela:
We're all terrorists!

566
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,123
Get down!
She's got a bomb!

567
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:32,224
All right.

568
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,625
Hey.

569
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,094
(Gunshot pops)

570
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,528
Shots fired!

571
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:37,662
Davis: Why'd you do that?
Jules: Are you okay?

572
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,299
I think so.

573
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,867
Oh my gosh!
Steve?

574
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,098
It's Steve.
He's been shot.

575
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,127
Steve.

576
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,128
I'm okay.

577
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,130
Just lay still,
Angela.

578
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:56,765
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules needs backup,</i>
<i>I wanna go in.</i>

579
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,167
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>From where?</i>

580
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:59,969
This back door leads
right into the basement.

581
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,803
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Okay. Sam?</i>

582
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,304
You're just covering on this,
all right?

583
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:04,472
She knows what she's doing.

584
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,774
I know she does.

585
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:08,576
Just saying.

586
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:09,710
Yes, sir.

587
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:14,849
Jules:
We gotta stop the bleeding.

588
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,184
Steve:
(Low pained grunts)

589
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,452
It's okay.
I got it, I got it.

590
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,622
Get back, get back!
Get back!

591
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,491
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>All right, let's slow down.</i>

592
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,925
Shut up! Shut up!

593
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,861
Hands above your head!

594
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,463
Hands above your head!

595
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,964
All right, I know that
you're afraid right now, Davis.

596
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,299
All right,
we have to find something

597
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>to bind her hands and feet.</i>

598
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:34,433
<i>We have to dismantle the bomb.</i>

599
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,834
She's not gonna hurt you.

600
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,603
She's got a bomb!
Are you blind?!

601
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,038
Patron:
Oh my God.

602
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,539
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>He's turning on Jules.</i>

603
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,674
We gotta find a way
to get past his delusions.

604
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,742
He said we needed soldiers here.

605
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,277
Maybe I can talk to him as one.

606
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Go for it, Sam.</i>

607
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,347
But, boss, this place has serious
security for a restaurant;

608
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,882
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>at reinforced steel.</i>

609
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,083
After 9-11, a lot
of middle eastern businesses

610
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,585
have been targets for vandals.

611
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm gonna have
to torch my way through.

612
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,322
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

613
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,393
Riyaz:
This brick was thrown
through our window.

614
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,861
(Reading)
Die Arab pig.

615
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,630
Sayid was in the room
when it happened.

616
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,697
<i>He was terrified.</i>

617
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,799
Go back
to the middle east.

618
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,167
He was born in Vancouver.

619
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,937
Why didn't you report this?

620
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,471
You think anyone cares
about death threats

621
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,107
against a suspected
terrorist?

622
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,577
Why were you accused
in the first place?

623
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,879
Back in, uh... 2004,

624
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,082
I started donating money
to an Islamic charity.

625
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,751
I was told
it was a scholarship fund

626
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,118
for underprivileged kids.

627
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:33,656
I found out later that
the charity was a front

628
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:35,658
used to fund
terrorist activities,

629
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,125
including the London bombings.

630
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:39,261
And from that they assumed
you were the leader

631
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,596
of a terrorist cell?

632
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:42,264
I convinced a lot of other
members of my mosque

633
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,732
to donate
to the same charity.

634
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,935
We thought we were doing
something good.

635
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:50,672
ATU dragged us from our homes
in the middle of the night.

636
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,774
<i>They interrogated us</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

637
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:55,376
They froze our bank accounts,
confiscated our passports...

638
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:56,711
Once it got leaked
to the press,

639
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,846
that's when all the threats
started to happen.

640
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,481
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Hey, Ed?</i>

641
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:01,949
<i>Just got off the phone</i>
<i>with the anti-terror unit.</i>

642
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,350
Excuse me one second.

643
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,720
Any intel
on a possible attack?

644
00:22:06,788 --> 00:22:08,221
No. And they checked
with other agencies -

645
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,556
no chatter, nothing.

646
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,324
And Mr. Fayad?

647
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,659
Spike:
Well, he's gonna be on
a no-fly list for a while,

648
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,260
but they're wrapping up
their investigation.

649
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:15,896
He's been cleared
of any wrongdoing.

650
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,529
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, good to know.</i>
<i>Thanks, Spike.</i>

651
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,533
The ATU is clearing you.

652
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:22,635
What?

653
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,636
Really?

654
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,004
Oh my God.

655
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:27,372
Oh my God! It's over!
(Elated laughter)

656
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,541
Hey, Spike,
a lot of these email threats

657
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,444
<i>are being sent from the same</i>
<i>I.P. address.</i>

658
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:34,846
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I'll run a trace,</i>

659
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,047
<i>see if we can connect them</i>
<i>to Davis.</i>

660
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,029
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>All right, I'm just gonna</i>
<i>change this, okay?</i>

661
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:54,364
Don't try to be the tough guy.
I know what it feels like.

662
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,767
I've been shot before.
I know how much pain you're in.

663
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,702
So, how do you like the date
so far?

664
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,138
You really know how to keep
a girl on her toes, huh?

665
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,007
Wait 'til you see what...
Ungh!

666
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:04,341
I have planned
for the next one.

667
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,977
Woman:
We can't. He's just gonna
start shooting again.

668
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:09,479
Man:
That's why we gotta do it fast.
Disarm him.

669
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,681
Woman 2:
There are a lot of us
and only one of him.

670
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:12,915
Steve, you're shivering.

671
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,618
(Steve shivers)

672
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,053
The room's spinning.

673
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:18,622
Your heart's racing
really fast.

674
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,290
Yeah, I'm cold.
I'm just going into shock.

675
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm gonna go try
and get your jacket.

676
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:25,894
N-no...

677
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,196
Okay,
I want you to look at me.

678
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:28,531
I want you to look at me.

679
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:31,400
I want you to keep
talking to me, okay?

680
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:32,934
I'm an idiot.

681
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:34,570
You're not.
It's not your fault.

682
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:38,005
No, I mean, I shouldn't have
waited so long to ask you out.

683
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:39,474
Let's save the deathbed
confession

684
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,409
for 50 years from now,
okay?

685
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,411
You gonna be there?

686
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:46,414
(Torch whirs loudly)

687
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,016
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Sam, let us know</i>
<i>when you're close.</i>

688
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,751
Hey, guys,
those threats against Riyaz?

689
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,320
You were right;

690
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,754
the I.P. address traces back
to Davis's group home.

691
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:57,023
So he did make those threats.

692
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,426
Hey, Ed,
take a look at this one.

693
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,261
Okay, boss,
listen to this.

694
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:03,197
<i>With one bomb,</i>
<i>you killed 26 people.</i>

695
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,532
<i>Time for you</i>
<i>and your followers</i>

696
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,766
<i>to get a taste</i>
<i>of your own medicine.</i>

697
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,034
Taste of his own medicine...

698
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,768
Think Davis built a bomb?

699
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,170
His father mentioned
that he had a degree

700
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,572
in chemical engineering.

701
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,207
So why show up at the restaurant
with a gun?

702
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:15,941
Maybe he'd already
planted it somewhere;

703
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,643
he wanted to take the leader out
personally.

704
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,645
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Sounds like Riyaz</i>
<i>wasn't his only target.</i>

705
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,380
Okay, boss, we're gonna head
to the group home.

706
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,416
Okay, Eddie, check Davis's room,
check everywhere.

707
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:25,350
Find out what he's building
and who he's targeting.

708
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:26,951
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

709
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:27,952
Mr. Fayad?

710
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,087
Riyaz:
Yes, officer?

711
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,391
An officer's gonna take you
downtown for processing.

712
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,126
<i>It's just procedure.</i>

713
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:36,228
Uh, I'll go with you.

714
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,762
No,

715
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,031
you and Sayid go to the mosque.

716
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,700
Pray for Eric and the others
at the restaurant.

717
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,034
Cashmira:
Okay.

718
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:49,240
Man:
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.

719
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:51,275
Get back!

720
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:52,376
Sam, hostages are turning
on him.

721
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:53,510
Get in there now!

722
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,612
Get back against the wall
now,

723
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,946
or I'll shoot you all
one by one.

724
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:57,380
Jules:
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapons.

725
00:24:57,448 --> 00:24:58,448
<i>Drop...</i>

726
00:24:58,515 --> 00:24:59,749
(Glass shatters)

727
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,817
Sam:
Everybody do what the man says!

728
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:05,054
<i>Drop your weapons</i>
<i>and go back to where you were.</i>

729
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,522
<i>It's all right, buddy,</i>
<i>you can stand down.</i>

730
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,625
I got this area of operations
contained.

731
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:11,060
Go back to where you were, now,
all of you!

732
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,795
<i>Do it now!</i>

733
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,229
Who are you?

734
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:16,798
Master Corporal Sam Braddock,
Special Forces.

735
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,500
I'm here to help.

736
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,603
You knew this place
was a front for terrorists?

737
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:22,604
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Sam, don't lie to him.</i>

738
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,539
He's sensitive to deception.

739
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,874
I know what it's like
to feel afraid;

740
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,744
I served two tours
in Afghanistan.

741
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,244
I know what it's like
to walk down the street,

742
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:32,680
<i>and wonder where they're</i>
<i>gonna strike again.</i>

743
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,914
You feel helpless,

744
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,215
like you're never
gonna be safe.

745
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,717
That's what they want -

746
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,586
all of us to live
in a state of fear.

747
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:41,422
Yeah, that's why we gotta
fight back.

748
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,590
<i>You know that operation</i>
<i>they're-</i>

749
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:43,791
(gunshot pops,
patrons scream)

750
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,760
Davis and Sam:
(Struggling grunts)

751
00:25:48,562 --> 00:25:49,829
Sam:
Settle down.

752
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:50,930
Davis:
(Grunts)
What are you doing?!

753
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:52,332
You lied to me!

754
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,501
You lied to me!

755
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:56,803
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>I didn't lie.</i>

756
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,104
Subject in custody.

757
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,873
Parker:
Good work, guys.
Good work.

758
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:02,775
(Breathing hard)

759
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:03,909
Thank you.

760
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,481
E.M.S.
We need E.M.S. in here now.

761
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,523
Eddie, you find anything
at the group home?

762
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,959
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Boss, we're in the basement.</i>

763
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:24,462
Davis is building
something here...

764
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,197
(PDA camera clicks)

765
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,700
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>But it doesn't look like</i>
<i>any kind of bomb</i>

766
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,834
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

767
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,102
Have a look.

768
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,941
Those fire extinguishers?

769
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:41,277
Uh huh.
They're all empty.

770
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:42,813
Watches, pesticides...

771
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,748
What's that on the floor?

772
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,683
(PDA camera clicks)

773
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:47,684
Castor beans.

774
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:48,785
Talk to me, Spike.

775
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:50,052
Castor beans
and pesticides -

776
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,455
major components in both ricin
and sarin.

777
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:53,789
Nerve gas.

778
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,123
Fire extinguishers
hold compressed gas,

779
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:56,659
watch is the timer...

780
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,027
He's made a chemical bomb
and it's already out there.

781
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,888
Parker:
Sam?

782
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,490
How is he?

783
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,960
Davis?
Davis, I'm sergeant Parker.

784
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,628
How are you doing?
You doing okay?

785
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,030
Look, I want you to know
that you're safe.

786
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:16,564
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

787
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,099
Okay?

788
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,268
But we could really use
your help right now.

789
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,636
We know that made
some kind of chemical bomb

790
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:25,639
and we need to know
where it is.

791
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:27,775
Davis, a bomb like that

792
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:30,511
could kill a lot
of innocent people.

793
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,646
Sam:
I don't think we're gonna
get anything out of him.

794
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,049
Parker:
Get him to the hospital,
regulate his meds.

795
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:37,617
Parker:
Keep an eye on Mr. Lagosto.

796
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:41,020
When he becomes coherent,
you question him again, okay?

797
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:43,556
Eddie, couldn't get anything.

798
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:45,525
You need to tear
that place apart

799
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,761
and figure out where
his next target may have been.

800
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,896
Let the social worker, Clive,
know that he's there,

801
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,431
he's safe,

802
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:52,465
<i>but he's gonna meet us</i>
<i>up at the hospital.</i>

803
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,367
Boss, the social worker's
not here.

804
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:55,667
Boss, I got something.

805
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:58,069
All right,
I'm on my way.

806
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:04,009
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>I'm right here, Steve, okay.</i>
<i>I'm coming with you.</i>

807
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:05,711
Nah, nah-nah.
You don't have to come with me.

808
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:07,045
Jules:
You're going into surgery.

809
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:08,480
You need somebody there
when you wake up.

810
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,948
Yeah, there's a bomb out there;
The team needs you.

811
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,716
Jules: Are you sure?
Steve: Yeah, I'll be all right.

812
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,150
Okay,
I'm gonna come by later.

813
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,351
(Siren wails)

814
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,191
(Gurney rattles)

815
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,861
You better suit up.

816
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,496
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

817
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,932
I got into Davis's computer.
Those threats against Riyaz?

818
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,400
<i>They're in Davis's outbox</i>

819
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:31,435
<i>but they're not in</i>
<i>his "sent" mail folder.</i>

820
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,769
What does that mean,
Spike?

821
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,503
It means someone was using
his computer

822
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,471
as a proxy server.

823
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,605
Davis didn't send
those threats.

824
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:36,807
Someone was setting him up.

825
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:38,308
Can you trace it?

826
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,208
Yeah, I'm running a tunneling
program right now.

827
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:41,077
(Computer beeps)

828
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:42,345
Clive Irwin.

829
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,346
His social worker.

830
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:47,115
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>So why would Clive</i>
<i>want to frame Davis?</i>

831
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,784
Parker: Eddie.
Ed: Boss?

832
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,486
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Clive is now a person</i>
<i>of interest.</i>

833
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:59,627
Wordy, let's get this open.

834
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,262
<i>Wordy:</i>
<i>Copy.</i>

835
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:12,373
Ed:
Boss, it looks like Clive's
been conducting

836
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:14,976
his own investigation
of Mr. Fayad.

837
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:16,343
What'd you find?

838
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,612
We've got articles
on domestic terrorism,

839
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,547
surveillance photos
on Mr. Fayad

840
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,048
and other Muslims.

841
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:23,750
Suspected cell members.

842
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,752
Clive's the one who's paranoid
about terrorism.

843
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,387
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I think I know why.</i>

844
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:28,956
<i>Clive's wife was killed</i>
<i>in the London terror attacks</i>

845
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,657
a few years ago.

846
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:33,125
<i>Carol:</i>
<i>Clive never got over</i>
<i>losing his wife.</i>

847
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:35,461
Ed:
Did he ever discuss it
with Davis?

848
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:36,629
It's funny,

849
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,130
he never talked
about it to anyone,

850
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:41,601
and then a few months ago
they were playing chess...

851
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:44,604
When the bomb went off,
the train split in half.

852
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:48,306
She was thrown
onto the tracks.

853
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:52,176
I tried to go to her,
but I couldn't stand up.

854
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:54,846
Both my legs were broken.

855
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:57,382
(Long drawn out inhale)

856
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:01,252
I didn't know
if she was alive or dead.

857
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:04,955
Her face was turned away.

858
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:09,226
I just kept
calling her name.

859
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:15,032
I'm almost convinced
it's been a bad dream.

860
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,837
(Breathes deeply)

861
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,211
They say that Riyaz Fayad

862
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,649
was connected
to those suicide bombers.

863
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:35,951
There must be a way
to stop him.

864
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:45,260
I mean you can't blame Clive
for how he feels.

865
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,228
Okay, thank you.

<i>Did you get all that?</i>

867
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,967
Yeah.

868
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,969
Sounds like Clive's been
whispering in Davis's ear

869
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,236
for months.

870
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,605
Feeding his paranoia
about an attack

871
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,540
and convincing him
to build a bomb.

872
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,075
Well, Davis probably had
no idea

873
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,509
his friend was using him
as a weapon.

874
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,344
Setting him up
to take the fall.

875
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:05,646
<i>Wordy:</i>
<i>One of the residents</i>
<i>said they saw Clive</i>

876
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,448
driving away 20 minutes ago.

877
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:08,982
Where'd he go?
No idea.

878
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,617
<i>Just said he's moving fast.</i>

879
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,052
Well, if he was using Davis
to keep his own hands clean,

880
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,519
why would he take the bomb
himself?

881
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,689
'Cause Davis can't now
and the job isn't done.

882
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,523
It's gotta be the mosque.
Remember?

883
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,059
Clive didn't just threaten
Riyaz.

884
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,894
He said, "you and your followers
are gonna get a taste

885
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,195
of your own medicine."

886
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:23,929
He thinks it's their base
of operations.

887
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,130

Zelovitsky: Sergeant Parker?
Parker: Yeah.

896
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,009
Dr. Zelovitsky,
I'm with Hazmat.

897
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:14,476
I'm heading up
the medical team.

898
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,211
Any idea what kind of toxin
we're dealing with?

899
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,412
It could be a nerve Agent,

900
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,148
maybe a derivative of ricin
or sarin.

901
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:20,850
It's hard to be specific
'cause it's a home brew.

902
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,417
We need to prepare
for hemorrhaging,

903
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,219
convulsions,
even fatalities.

904
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,688
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

905
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:27,556
Zelovitsky: We'll be ready.
Parker: Thank you.

906
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:29,357
Ed:
Okay, Spike,
what do we got?

907
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:31,126
Looks like Davis outfitted
the extinguishers

908
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:32,193
with artificial heads.

909
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:33,461
He presses
a manual detonator,

910
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:35,429
the cylinder will blow
releasing the gas.

911
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,731
Okay, can you disarm it?

912
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,199
Spike:
Yeah, if we find it in time.

913
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,134
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>If we evacuate,</i>
<i>it'll tip him off.</i>

914
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:40,301
He could release the toxin.

915
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:42,370
Okay, absolute stealth,

916
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:43,804

Ed:
Spike, shut down

Better...Now.
