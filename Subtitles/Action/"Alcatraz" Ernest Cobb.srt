Maybe I'm not

You know what kind
of rifle Cobb used,

00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,849
back in the day?

158
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:19,320
It's Winchester,
model 70, I think.

159
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,690
No. No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Uses the same bullets
as an M-40.

161
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,946
So the S.F.P.D.
is assuming

162
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:29,614
that he's using
a modern weapon,

163
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,983
but Cobb's maximum range
with a Winchester

164
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:35,003
is what?
Probably 500 yards?

165
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,955
Not 750.

166
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,542
So the buildings they're
searching are too far away.

167
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:44,512

He would've
cleaned up afterward.

On March 21st, 1963,

184
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:01,775
Alcatraz
officially closed.

185
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:07,313
All the prisoners were
transferred off the island.

186
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:11,668
Only that's not
what happened.

187
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:14,786
Not at all.

I know you're in there.

196

You can't hide,

197
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,249
Leave me alone.

198

to poke her in the laundry room.

202
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,145
Anyways, they're
asking for rent,

203
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,147
which request
the missus passes to me.

204
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,649
Even from a distance
she is a piece of work.

205
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,768
<i>Already she sent</i>
<i>my entire shop salary.</i>

206

213

Where does he go?

214
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,422
<i>Solitary.</i>

215
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,825
<i>That's the last</i>

216
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,257
Do you know him?

217
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,127
No.

218
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:54,447
He's back.

219
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,649
Just like
you're back.

220
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,737
Why?
Are you working together?

221
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,410
Where have you been, Jack,
for the past 50 years?

222
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,795
Who's watching me?

223
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>You disappeared from Alcatraz</i>

224
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,539
I don't know.

225
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,309
<i>One minute,</i>

226

and then I...

227
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,318
And then I wasn't.

228
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,245
When you
were captured,

229
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,399
they found this
in your pocket.

230
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,370
Do you know
what it opens?

231
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,511
Did someone
ask you to get it?

232
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,682
I...don't...know.

233
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,886
[Beeping]

234
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,555
He's telling
the truth.

235
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,524
(Lucy)
<i>All right, Jack.</i>

236
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,094
<i>Let's start at the beginning</i>
<i>again, shall we?</i>

237
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:24,587
I found Cobb's
storage box.

238
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,439
This isn't the only door
without a handle, you know?

239
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,742
There's another one
in the file room.

240
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,911
And there are three buttons
in the elevator

241
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:34,497
that you can't press
without a key.

242
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,665
He's got
a whole operation,

243
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,449
and we're only
a tiny part of it.

244
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,668
Now you're the main part
of our part,

245
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,002
so what does he
need me for?

246
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,137
- I'm just...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

247
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,388
<i>Who caught</i>
<i>Jack Sylvane, doc?</i>

248
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,006
Hauser's people?
No.

249
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,892
We did.

250
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,232
Cobb spent more time
in solitary confinement

251
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,434
than any other
inmate on record.

252
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:59,822
Any issues with authority or
had trouble following the rules?

253
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,440
How'd they catch him
the last time?

254
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,410
Someone recognized him from
the FBI's most wanted list.

255
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,996
<i>But not before he shot his way</i>
<i>through eight cities,</i>

256
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,997
<i>from Denver</i>
<i>to Anchorage.</i>

257
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,415
Yeah, I don't
think we can

258
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,983
put a time-traveling
sniper's face

259
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,201
on the most wanted
list.

260
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,503
Yeah,
probably not.

261
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,004
<i>So...</i>

262
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:18,374
The hammer markings
on the casing you found

263
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,992
<i>are a match...</i>

264
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,094
For Cobb's
gun of choice.

265
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:24,547
<i>How could you possibly</i>

266
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,550
get a ballistics report
in two hours?

267
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,102
Does this lead
to something concrete?

268
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,470
Old rifle.

269
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,523
He would've had to get it
at a specialty gun shop.

270
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,559
Then why are you
still here?

271
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,732

272
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,407

Go babysit.

(Madsen) Tell me Hauser isn't
the nutcase I think he is.

275
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,056
He's a little prickly
sometimes,

276
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,307
but he's
all right.

277
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,708
You've been
with him a while?

278
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,011

I gotta
hand it to you.

You could have
done anything,

fire-bombed your cell,

541

heck, you could have
took a page

542
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,303
from your own playbook
and made yourself a gun.

543

real smarts.

and you forced my hand.
