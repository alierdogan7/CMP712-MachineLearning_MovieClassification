00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,120
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

184
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
until things change.

185
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,760
You are married
not even a year...

186
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,120
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

187
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
I am sorry.

188
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,840
It's not my business.

189
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,480
How come you know
so much about me?

190
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
It is a gift.

191
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

192
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,520
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

193
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,560
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
by the laying of hands.

195
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
INSPECTOR: Hmm.
He's the same build...

196
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,400
as the description
the Russians gave us...

197
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,000
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

198
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,160
WOMAN: No.

199
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
WOMAN: Could be faking it.

200
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
SECURITY GUARD:
X-rays are clear.

201
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

202
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,040
SIMON: You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

203
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
On the airplane, I had chicken.

204
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,560
WOMAN: Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

205
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Last year. Same eyes.

206
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
INSPECTOR: Different chin.

207
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,600
DRIVER: Halcyon Hotel, guv.

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,880
[Dreaming]
PRIEST: Stand up!

209
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,040
What is your name?!

210
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
Answer the question!

211
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
[Echoing]
What is your name?! Hey!

212
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,600
MAN ON TELEPHONE:
Lou, the microchip arrived.

213
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
I put the dough in your account.

214
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
SIMON: Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

215
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,600
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

216
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,160
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

217
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

218
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,680
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

219
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
-I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
-I heard that before.

220
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
SIMON: Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

221
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,720
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

222
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
-Fuck you, Lou.
-See yourself.

223
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
Can't seem to break 50.

224
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,000
[German accent]
"One million U.S. dollars...

225
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,520
"nonrefundable...

226
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,360
"reserves you a quiet table...

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,440
"which has

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,920
"To get inside, you walk

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,200
"and I walk through
the metal detectors.

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,160
"Since you know I'm not armed,

"we can both fall in love,
and nobody gets hurt."

233
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
ILYA: I can't see him.

234
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,880
TRETIAK: Then look for him.

235
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
SIMON: You have
a long and beautiful cane...

236
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,160
along with your beautiful eyes.

237
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,200
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

238
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,680
TRETIAK: Who are you?

239
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
SIMON: My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

240
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,560
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

241
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,640
Had the wine, women, songs...

242
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,280
then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

243
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,240
went to live in the forest...
in the nude.

244
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,680
TRETIAK: Please leave.

245
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,040
SIMON: I represent
the professional you hired.

246
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm his business manager.

247
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,840
I speak for him.

248
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,920
ILYA: We don't deal
with underlings.

249
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,680
Come on, Father. Let's go.

250
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,000
TRETIAK: Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

251
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,480
SIMON: Ah. Youth.

252
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,840
TRETIAK: Who runs this thief?

253
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,880
CIA? MI-6? Libya?

254
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,680
SIMON: He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

255
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
He's an independent contractor.

256
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,640
TRETIAK: Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

257
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,360
Oh, yes.

258
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,880
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that...

259
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,440
even with metal detectors...

260
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,760
even in this transit lounge.

261
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,320
SIMON: Oh, it's so early.

262
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,280
You guys wanna get coffee
or something?

263
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,960
TRETIAK: Sure.

264
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,760
Be quiet.

265
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
SIMON: What is it
you request of my employer?

266
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,440
TRETIAK: Do you know
what cold fusion is?

267
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
SIMON: Of course.

268
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,040
It's the theory...

269
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,600
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

270
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
free energy forever.

271
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,000
TRETIAK: Yes.

272
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,120
SERVER: Kaffee?

273
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,240
SIMON: Klein, Bitte.

274
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,720
SIMON: As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

275
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

276
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,760
have never been able
to duplicate it.

277
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,040
TRETIAK: Until now.

278
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,720
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

279
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,040
We believe
that this good lady...

280
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,880
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

281
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,840
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

282
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,520
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

283
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Your offer must inspire him.

284
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,840
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

285
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,560
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

286
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
She's cagey, difficult.

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
Maybe your agents are stupid.

288
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,000
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

289
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,240
TRETIAK: [Chuckles]
Ridiculous.

290
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,840
SIMON: Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

291
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,240
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

292
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,520
His deposit should go--

293
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey. It is not for me.

294
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,080
It is for mother Russia.

295
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,880
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

296
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,520
Three million on deposit 
in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?

297
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
Yes.

298
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,360
And... How long to get
your employer's agreement?

299
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,560
I'll ask.

300
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,920
Your offer has inspired her.

301
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
I'll do it.

302
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,840
Bank account number in Zurich.

303
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,600
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

304
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,360
TRETIAK: Bye-bye.

305
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,920
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

306
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
ILYA:
Too bad we have to kill him.

307
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah, too bad.

308
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
WOMAN: When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

309
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,040
announced in 1989...

310
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,160
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

311
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,320
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

312
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

313
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,480
and then condemned
as charlatans.

314
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
The protocols of cold fusion...

315
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,920
SIMON: What are those? Drugs?

316
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

317
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,040
She's boring the life
out of me.

318
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
-They're for my heart.
-Oh.

319
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,080
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

320
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,480
-Who are you?
-Me?

321
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,920
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

322
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

323
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,440
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

324
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,520
-Actually, I do.
-Really?

325
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,640
WOMAN: Dr. Emma Russell.

326
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,680
Oops.

327
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,440
EMMA: Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

328
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm actually more interested...

329
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,760
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

330
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,840
so I thought we would
start with those.

331
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Any questions?

332
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,160
Please?

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
MAN: I have, Dr. Russell.

334
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

335
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,320
you know, the theory?

336
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,080
Yes. Oh, there it is.

337
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,960
This is the--the apparatus.

338
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,320
And very simply...

339
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,480
when positively charged
deuterons...

340
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,360
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

341
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
they cram together...

342
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,240
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

343
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,520
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

344
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,640
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

345
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
WOMAN: But I read somewhere...

346
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,920
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

347
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,600
so how do we know it works?

348
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
EMMA: We don't.

349
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,880
Not yet.

350
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
But if you remember Einstein...

351
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

352
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
long before he could prove it.

353
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
I mean, he felt the truth.

354
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

355
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,000
about cold fusion...

356
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,400
because it's there.

Are you OK?

904
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,680
Let's jump.

905
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,400
Come on.

906
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,200
Wait.

907
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,680

I've been waiting two hours.

912
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,720
Come on. I've got some beautiful
paintings for you to buy.

In here. Come on. Come on.

914

Don't fret.
It's just my curator, Toli.

I am Alexa Frankievitch,
but being you're Americans...

916
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,680
you can call me Frankie.

917
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,720
SIMON: OK, Frankie.
I've got money. We want--

918
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,600
FRANKIE: I know. 
The icon of the Virgin of the Damned.

919
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,000
-Are those maps of the tunnels?
-Yes.

920
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,720
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American Embassy.

921
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,720
FRANKIE: Right.
I need $10,000 up-front.

Everything is complicated.

931
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,720
But you know the way?

932
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,280
Like the face
of a Bulgari chronograph.

933
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,000
I remember. This way.

934

FRANKIE: At last. Water main.

935
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,800
They shut it down
each afternoon in winter.

turn it back on?

937

plus or minus.

minutes earlier or later.

It should take you 10 seconds
to run to those gates.

960
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,800
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

962

needed a pill.

01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,480
Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase--

1069
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,960
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

1070
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,520
"but do not give it yet."

1071
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,440
[Protesters chanting in Russian]

1072
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,880
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

1073
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,080
Are you coming with me?

1074
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,480
No. But they are.

1075
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,880
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1076
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,720
Find a quiet room.

1077
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,800
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1078
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,520
My number's on the back.

1079
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,200
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1080
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,000
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1081
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,040
or you'll never be safe.

1082
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,760
Be good at school.

1083
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,920
Wait.

1084
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,200
-Don't you trust me, darlin'?
-Trust who?

1085
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,720
SIMON: That hurts, Emma.

1086
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,320
EMMA: I'm serious.
What's your name?

1087
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,040
My name is August Christopher.

1088
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,960
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1089
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,920
I mean, Vincent Ferrer...

1090
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,080
I mean, Martin de Porres...

1091
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,040
Thomas More.

1092
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,000
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1093
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,760
You have to be a very good...

1094
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,200
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1095
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,720
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1096
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,960
Now, get to work.

1097
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,320
Who's that man?

1098
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,640
AIDE: You're leaving
on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?

1099
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,560
Probably be your
last chance out of here.

1100
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,040
Better hurry. It's leaving.

1101
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,840
YURI: Your troops
will depose the president...

1102
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,720
and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.

1103
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:11,320
TRETIAK: Moscow must be
ringed with tanks by early evening.

1104
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,560
Don't worry.
The people will follow me.

1105
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,760
They will be crying
for revolution.

1106
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,280
YURI: Still, no one's
guessed the simple truth...

1107
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,320
of where the heating oil went.

1108
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,040
[Laughter]

1109
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,040
TRETIAK: Who would believe
that a sea of oil...

1110
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,640
was hidden under
this very building?

1111
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,240
[Laughter]

1112
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,120
Yuri, I understand
your Nataly is to...

1113
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,640
WOMAN: Francis, you devil...

1114
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,920
I heard you came down here,
and you didn't call me.

1115
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,200
-Hello, Dominic--
-Give me a ring, when you get this, Charles.

1116
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,840
MAN: Lou,
I've heard on the grapevine...

1117
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,080
you're brokering a revolutionary
new energy source.

1118
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,120
If it's as good
as it's cracked up to be...

1119
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,280
I have friends who can double
your best offer...

1120
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,400
on deposit in Zurich...

1121
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,200
within one hour
of delivery and confirmation.

1122
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,120
I'll be waiting.

1123
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,640
[Door opens]

1124
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,280
The work could be here.

1125
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,160
This machine could work,
couldn't it?

1126
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,800
[Guards shouting in Russian]

1127
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,440
Who are you?

1128
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,520
SIMON:
A friend of Dr. Russell's.

1129
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,720
BOTVIN: Dr. Russell?

1130
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,800
What's this equation?

1131
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,160
It's so simple.

1132
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,640
This is the key
to Dr. Russell's formula.

1133
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,960
Yes.

1134
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,680
[Guards speaking Russian]

1135
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,880
The alarm. You had better go.

1136
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,800
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

1137
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,360
But Mr. Tretiak's rally
is tonight.

1138
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,000
Can you make it work?

1139
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,720
Make it work.

1140
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,480
GUARD: What is wrong here?

1141
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,880
BOTVIN: Uh, the alarm...

1142
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,320
Uh...uh...

1143
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,440
I tripped.

1144
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,320
[Russian accent]
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

1145
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,000
You are Nikolai Provovich--

1146
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,200
Petrovich.

[Doorbell buzzes]

1148

Tunnel built by KGB...

1149

Leads to machine room
in Kremlin.

1150
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,320
SIMON: Do you know where
the president's quarters are?

1151
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:53,160
FRANKIE:
President Karpov is there.

1152
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:57,200
But there are many guards,
so I suggest--

1153
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,160
An alternate route?

1154
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,000
Money. 
Now.

1155

on the brink
of a second revolution.

1158

from freezing mounts...

hundreds of thousands
of protesters...

1160

have taken to the streets.

1161

Even as
Russian President Karpov...

1162
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,680
is promising
a mysterious solution...

1163
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,560
to the crippling
heating-oil shortage...

the Russian capital city.

the Kremlin in Red Square...

but they're not braving
the bitter cold...

1170
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,160
for yet another political rally.

1171
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,520
They've been drawn here by
the promise of a revelation...

1172
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,920
whatever that may be...

1173
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,360
in what's become
a life-and-death struggle...

1174
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,280

of democracy in Russia.

1179
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,040
I want to help you
to destroy Tretiak.

1180

I need you to listen
for about 30 seconds.

1181

I'm all right. Stay outside.

1182

Please, continue.

Tonight you'll stand trial
in Red Square before the world.

Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

1185
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,720
Agree with this criminal?

1186
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,120
If you want
to destroy Tretiak...yes.

published in today's papers...

prove that the traitor Karpov...

1204

was about to steal
over 40 trillion...

1205

Russian rubles...

called cold fusion.

to be a chemical reaction.

01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,120
There was a miscommunication 
somewhere in the chain of command.

1242
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,680
[Thinking]
Miracle two.

1243
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,840
NEWSWOMAN: The billionaire
industrialist and his son, Ilya,...

1244
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,320
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison...

1245
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,520
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1246
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,160
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth...

1247
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,360
as millions of gallons
of heating oil...

1248
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,960
flowed from a storage depot discovered 
beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.

1249
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,520
INSPECTOR: He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1250
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,720
EMMA: He never had the chance.

1251
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,200
You'll tell us
if he does make contact?

1252
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,920
- EMMA: Oh, yes. 
- Which he may well do.

1253
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,360
He's a proper rogue, you see.

1254
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,840
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1255
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,680
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1256
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:36,400
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint...

1257
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,760
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1258
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,600
Count yourself lucky.

1259
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,080
Look, I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1260
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,360
INSPECTOR: We understand.
You have a life.

1261
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,040
WOMAN: We appreciate
your taking the time.

1262
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,520
EMMA: No problem.

1263
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,680
INSPECTOR:
She's in love with him.

1264
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,640
[Giggling]

1265
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,960
SIMON: I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1266
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,160
It hasn't been safe.

1267
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,720
EMMA: I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1268
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:18,720
SIMON:
So...have you been busy?

1269
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,920
EMMA: Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1270
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,640
Thank God I have my cards back.

1271
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:27,120
SIMON: You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1272
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,720
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1273
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,960
EMMA: Oh, my God.

1274
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,400
That was you?

1275
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,720
SIMON: That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1276
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,240
I thought you were
some old biddy...

1277
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,520
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1278
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,360
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1279
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,480
EMMA: I am?

1280
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,320
SIMON: Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1281
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,600
-Emma.
-Yeah?

1282
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,320
My life is very strange.

1283
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,520
I just...

1284
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,400
I don't do anything normal.

1285
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,920
I'm--I can't even--

1286
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,280
I know. I know you.

1287
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,760
I know your life.

1288
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,320
-What do you want?
-I want you.

1289
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,320
For how long?

1290
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,280
It doesn't matter.

1291
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,560
Tell me you love me.

1292
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,000
I--I love you.

1293
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,160
Simon.

1294
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,680
I love you, Simon.

1295
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,840
Miracle three.

1296
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,320
EMMA: Dear Simon...

1297
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,600
the pin is something I've kept for years. 
God knows why.

1298
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,920
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1299
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,400
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1300
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,800
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1301
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,880
something I loved.

1302
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,680
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1303
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,360
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1304
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,480
and so I hope you'll understand.

1305
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,960
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1306
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,200
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1307
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:38,000
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1308
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,720
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1309
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:46,680
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I, Simon,  will be free, too.

1310
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,840
Listen. If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1311
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,120
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1312
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,200
will accomplish anything...

1313
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,000
you're absolutely right.

1314
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,400
Simon, what are you doing here?

1315
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,800
There are police.

1316
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,240
They're everywhere.

1317
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,520
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1318
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,480
-You wore the pin.
-Of course.

1319
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,400
You better go.

1320
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,040
How will I find you?

1321
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,960
[Giggles]

1322
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,720
I'll find you. You found me.

1323
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,280
[Applause]

1324
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,720
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1325
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,120
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1326
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,400
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1327
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,160
SIMON: Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1328
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,080
No.

1329
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,840
CHAIRMAN: Dr. Russell?

1330
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,320
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1331
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,920
EMMA:
Thank you. Good morning.

1332
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,400
INSPECTOR: No.

1333
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:38,480
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1334
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,360
a difficult childhood.

1335
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,920
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1336
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,840
bastards, at best.

1337
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:50,800
But difficult childhoods, I believe, 
make the most interesting adults.

1338
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,680
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1339
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,080
SIMON: I'm her biggest fan.

1340
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,840
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1341
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,960
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1342
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,760
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1343
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,400
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1344
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:10,520
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1345
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,240
becoming a reality.

1346
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,040
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1347
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,960
SIMON: Look at the time.
Got to go.

1348
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,480
EMMA: ...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1349
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,400
we can all work towards
making the--the...

1350
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:28,800
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1351
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,080
Quickly!

1352
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,880
We got him!

1353
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,760
Hyah!

1354
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,120
INSPECTOR:
Hands behind your back!

1355
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,160
Got you, you slippery--

1356
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,400
MAN: What's going on?

1357
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,600
Damn!

1358
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,120
REPORTER: Donations totaling
three billion dollars...

1359
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,040
were made today
to the Red Cross....

1360
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,360
the Salvation Army...

1361
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,080
and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

1362
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,760
The funds were wired
from the account...

1363
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,760
of jailed Russian tycoon
Ivan Tretiak.

1364
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,680
In other philanthropic news...

1365
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,960
a nonprofit
research foundation...

1366
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,960
has been established to develop
cold fusion technology...

1367
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,160
funded with
an anonymous donation...

1368
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,080
and to be headed by Russian
physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.

1369
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,440
The E.J. Russell Foundation...

1370
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,360
is charged to develop
inexpensive...

1371
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,920
SIMON LE BON: [Singing]
Light a candle.

1372
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,320
Lay flowers at the door...

1373
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,000
for those who're left behind...

1374
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,880
and the ones
who've gone before.

1375
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,040
Here it comes now...

1376
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,200
sure as silence follows rain...

1377
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:06,080
the taste of you upon my lips...

1378
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:08,400
the fingers in my brain.

1379
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,680
Ever gentle...

1380
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,400
as it kills me where I lay...

1381
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,920
who am I to resist?

1382
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,320
Who are you to fail?

1383
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:23,280
Got to get you out of my mind...

1384
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,880
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1385
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,680
as I try to leave
the memory behind.

1386
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:39,680
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1387
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,720
I'm so sorry...

1388
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,640
for the way it had to go.

1389
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,040
Now I feel your presence...

1390
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,800
in a way I could not know...

1391
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,880
and I wonder...

1392
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:07,360
do you ever feel the same?

1393
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,560
In the spilling darkness...

1394
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,840
do you ever hear my name?

1395
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,760
Got to get you out of my mind...

1396
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,200
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1397
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,520
as I...

1398
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,200
try to leave
the memory behind.

1399
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,840
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1400
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,160
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1401
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:55,000
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1402
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,560
And how could you dare...

1403
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,760
to come so close...

1404
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,000
when you're just a ghost to me?

1405
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:15,360
And I've got to get you
out of my mind...

1406
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,920
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1407
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,200
as I...

1408
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,760
try to leave
the memory behind.

1409
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:31,480
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1410
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:42,560
Here in the back of your mind...

1411
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,240
[Ballad begins]

1412
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,320
CRYSTAL: [Singing]
It's just black-and-white...

1413
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,800
or color.

1414
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,240
Those postcards...

1415
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,960
sent from heaven...

1416
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,880
says, "Make the most...

1417
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,560
"of never-never."

1418
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:21,720
Horizon starts right here.

1419
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,920
The future's always near...

1420
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,080
and I...

1421
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,120
I know this time...

1422
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,320
is borrowed.

1423
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:39,400
I try to remember
and forget my sorrow...

1424
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,520
celluloid...

1425
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,200
monochrome...

1426
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,720
or color.

1427
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,800
Don't want to end in tears.

1428
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:04,000
I'll leave before
my fears are found.

1429
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,680
Scared to love...

1430
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,160
wasted knowledge...

1431
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,800
into the brink...

1432
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,160
these four walls...

1433
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,240
are lost forever.

1434
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:20,320
I will never...

1435
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,520
be that clever.
