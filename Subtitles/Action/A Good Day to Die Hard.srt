721
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,625
<i>I need that file, Alik.</i>

722
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,660

731
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,970

732
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,274

733
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:13,442
No.

734

No, I'm fine.

735
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,413

00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:20,883
Oh, fuck.

738
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:25,220
I can't believe she betrayed
her father for Chagarin.

739
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,824

748
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,484

749
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,927

750

a little pharmacy
on our way out of Moscow,

754
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:16,071
get you some Merthiolate
or mercury

755
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,906
and fix up your
little scratches, here.

756
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,843
Get you home.
Get a little toy set.

757
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:25,280
Get yourself a nice
warm glass of milk
with a little Bosco in it.

758

What's in the file?

763
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:39,261
Evidence on Chagarin.

764
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,600
Evidence about what?

765
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,736
Chernobyl.

766
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,306
Look, listen to me.

767
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,142
Komarov and
Chagarin used to have this

768
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:58,747
nasty little
side-racket going on
back in the day.

769
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,952
They siphoned
weapons-grade uranium,
got greedy,

770
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,989
caused the meltdown.

771
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,326
Then, you know, they fell out.

772
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:14,596

773
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,800
Scumbags.

774
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,802
So, Chagarin had
Komarov thrown in jail.

775
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,038
You know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.

777

So what happened
to rescuesque?

778
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,114
Well, he grew a conscience.

779
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,717
Yeah, well, that figures.

780
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:39,655
Listen, Chagarin is bad news.
He's the real deal.

781
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:44,526
If we see this guy in control,
we're gonna see
the whole thing fall apart.

and we do our thing.

789
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:13,388

790
