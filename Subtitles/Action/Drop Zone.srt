- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBl.
- Bob Covington.

169
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,245
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.

170
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,831
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.

171
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,589
Pete. Pete, did you see anything?

172
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,346
Two, three, maybe more.

173
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,727
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?

174
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,067
The little girl, I reached for her
and I grabbed her.

175
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,195
And...

176
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,495
They shot Terry. Motherfuckers.

177
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,959
He was bad. He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...

178
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,004
He was falling. I grabbed him and I had him.

179
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,840
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.

180
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,719
I couldn't hold him.

181
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,016
BLACKSTONE: Bring up the passenger list
and seating assignment.

182
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,232
Okay, break down the ticket purchase
into cash and credit card.

183
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,444
Cross-check that with advance purchase
and same-day purchase.

184
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,826
(BEEPING)

185
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,539
- What are you doing?
- WOMAN: Nothing.

186
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,667
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.

187
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,878
I'm trying,
but the whole system's going down.

188
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,556
- It's Leedy...
- COVINGTON: What?

189
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,307
- It was a setup.
- A what?

190
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,184
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?

191
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,020
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?

192
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,481
So, what did they do? Come down
and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?

193
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,401
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.

194
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,278
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- BLACKSTONE: What about Leedy, now?

195
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,197
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella
and floats down like Mary Poppins?

196
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,700
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.

197
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,577
Their heads were down
and the plane was filled with smoke.

198
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,039
What 32 people did see was they saw your
brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.

199
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,294
That's a lie! Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBl get brownie points for speed?

200
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,297
We're talking about my brother here, man.

201
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,340
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?

202
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,217
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!

203
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,720
Two hours after the explosion,
an airline maintenance man

204
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,514
was gunned down at Miami airport
running away from MPD detention.

205
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,725
And in his apartment they found
Posse Comitus literature

206
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,268
and homemade C-4 explosives.

207
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,186
The maintenance man
put the explosives on board?

208
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,898
That's right. Detective Fox, Miami PD,
recognized the man

209
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,190
from the pre-flight inspection.

210
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,734
I'm telling you...

211
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,488
Look, we all feel bad
about what happened to your brother,

212
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,491
and don't nobody want to paint him
the fall guy. But the fact of the matter is

213
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,120
your brother opened fire on that plane
and panicked, and 14 people are dead.

214
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,747
My brother didn't panic.

215
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,585
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID
on one of the remains found on the plane.

216
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,754
Your prisoner, Leedy.

217
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,674
Damn!

218
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,977
Through the coordinated investigation
of federal, state

219
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,021
and local law enforcement officials,

220
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,941
the FBl believes that it has answered
most of the questions

221
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:47,028
concerning the attempted hijack
of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.

222
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,450
REPORTER: It was the Marshal on board
who set off the explosion. Is that true?

223
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,954
That question has been raised
and is under investigation...

224
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,631
Hey, guys!

225
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,050
Guys, check it out!

226
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,471
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.

227
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,098
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.

228
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,809
We went out that fucking door, that
wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.

229
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,310
I'm dragging away from the jet,

230
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,481
I come face to face with this woman, and
I swear, she was still holding a magazine.

231
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,691
Has Leedy finished throwing up?

232
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,067
- Yes.
- Good.

233
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,944

234
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,990
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't! No! Don't touch my hand!

235
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,908
- Watch out! Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!

236
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,827
Don't touch my hand!

237
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,787
Shut up and say thank you.

238
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,955
- Thank you?
- Yes!

239
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,125
You threw me out of an airplane
and you bit off my finger.

240
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,170
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?

241
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,840
You crashed the entire airline computer
system with one hand, didn't you?

242
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,882
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

243
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,801
REPORTER: The information we have is
sketchy right now,

244
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,179
but what we're hearing is that the MarshaI
allegedly fired at a hijacker,

245
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,140
and according to passengers,
set off the explosion

246
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,309
which killed 14 people,
including the hijackers.

247

(ALL CHEERING)

248
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,524
Yes! Unload the boat. Unload the boat.

249
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,152
...and a federaI prisoner
by the name of Earl Leedy.

250
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:14,574
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?

251
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,578
You're not free. Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.

252
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,371
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.

253
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,789
What about the other Marshal
that was on the plane?

254
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,957
He's dead. He's dead. I shot him.

255
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,417
I don't think so. He was in the bathroom.

256
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,919
Listen to me! All he saw was smoke.

257
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,339
We got out clean, except for that bitch
that grabbed you, Jagger.

258
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,551
Next time, you just get her
and throw her out the door.

259

I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go. Breakfast.

- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

262
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,585
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you. It's important.

263
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,045
PETE: So is this.

264
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,089
Wait till you see what I found.

265
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,883
I got it nailed down
to a two-square-mile radius

266
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,760
where the hijackers could've landed.

267
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,261
We've got our bodies, Pete.

268
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,098
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got
that are burned beyond recognition

269
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,433
are those of the terrorists
and that prick Leedy.

270
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,810
Does that make any sense?

271
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:29,482
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747
at that altitude and speed and lives.

272
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,818
- Period. You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.

273
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,988
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.

274
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,449
I'm telling you, it's a setup.

275
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,411
Now all I have to do is figure out
how Leedy fits into all this.

276
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,122
What?

277
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,707
The Board of Review is looking at this
in two weeks...

278
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,209
The Board of Review!

279
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,087
...to determine yours and Terry's
responsibility for the accident.

280
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,422
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.

281
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,301
The FAA and the airline's in the middle
of a goddamn firestorm with the media,

282
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,554
the insurance companies,
relatives of dead passengers...

283
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,767
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!

284
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,353
They're looking to point fingers
at somebody,

285
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,731
and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?

286
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,780
You know the SOP on this. I have
to ask you for your badge and your gun.

287
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,700
- What? You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.

288
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,578
Give me your badge and your gun, please.

289

Delta Squad deployment,
hostage-drill scenario.

292
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,527
- So it can be done?
- We did it. But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.

293
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,946
And it was a drill, no explosions.

294
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,033
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.

295
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,242
Plus, you got another problem.

296
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,286
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,957
You see this? You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.

298
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,792
Now, your terrorists may have had

299
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,711
somebody stash a few guns behind a seat,

300
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,005
but not five parachute rigs.

301
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,341
Five rigs going through X-ray
and metal detectors

302
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,968
would raise holy hell with airport security.

303
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,428
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

304
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,931
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.

305
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,142
Mister, to even think about jumping
from a 747

306
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,561
you've either got to be very skilled
or dick-brained.

307
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,105
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?

308
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,151
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.

309
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,905
Dick-brained is his old partner,
Jess Crossman.

310
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,073
Where can I find them?

311
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,369
I don't think they jump together anymore,
but Crossman lives real close to here.

312
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,565
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.

313
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,779
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Oh, you must be with the class.

314
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,947

315
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,241

- No problem, dude.

330
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,951
Damn. And I really wanted
to get on that plane.

331
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,246

If you want to talk to me,
you're either a skydiver or a cop.

And, well, you definitely don't look
like any skydiver I have ever seen.

You know, cops, I don't like them.

has been right after you've broken the law.

Yeah.

338
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,152
Did I go out of state
without calling my parole officer?

339
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,154
Yes, I admit it. But it was an emergency.

340
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,364
Uh-huh.

341
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,116
You're not here about a parole violation?

342
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,576
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?

343
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,913
Yeah. Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!

344
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,082
What if it wasn't a screwup?

345
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,251
What if someone just wanted
to make it look that way?

346
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,129
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.

347
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,880
A jump.

348
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,510
A jailbreak from a 747? That's a cool idea.

349
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,554
No offense.

350
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,098
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?

351
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,683
Why do you ask?

352
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,562
Well, because people probably told you

353
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,315
that Jessie Crossman was the only person
skilled enough to jump from a 747.

354
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,527
Well, the actual phrase used
was "dick-brained. "

355
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,448
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.

356
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,951
Look, some yahoo pulled
a John Wayne on that flight

357
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,619
and got a lot of people killed, all right?

358
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,415
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.

359
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,709
Well, God. I'm sorry about that.

360
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,547
But if I'm not a suspect,
then I don't have to talk to you, do I?

361
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,176
You still haven't answered the question
about the jump.

362
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,262
See, the longer I stand here,
the broker I get. So...

right, Mr. Cop?

00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,636
Need for speed.

827
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,388
(WHOOPING)

828
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,475
That was great! That was great!
It was incredible!

829
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,143
How did I do?

830
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:05,481
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him. What's the deal?

831
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,816
I don't think he counts
what you just did as a jump.

832
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,902
He's kind of funny that way.

833
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,528
Well, what kind of other jump is there?

834
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:15,282
There's only one kind ofjump
and I did a sweet one, if I must say.

835
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,784
MILTON: My buddy, Luxem,
ran the lab on your nylon.

836
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,328
This is serious guacamole.

837
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:23,957
Look at this. He found C-4 explosive,
flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.

838
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,418
I mean, you ain't dealing
with a cat burglar, Pete.

839
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,714
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.

840
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,426
No need, I promised him
you'd paint his house this summer.

841
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,963
The chopper's aboard.

842
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,057
Good to see you.

843
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,600
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.

844
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,935
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

845
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,479
- Welcome. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

846
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,982
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample

847
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,483
and decided we want more.

848
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,694
There's only one way
you're gonna get more.

849
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,863
Your price is rather large.

850
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,615
So are the results.

851
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,827
Good evening, everyone. Welcome aboard.

852
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,872
I'm only interested
in long-term investments.

853
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,627
What happens when the DEA
replaces their dead agents? And they will.

854
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,214
You're buying a very sophisticated
data service.

855
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:59,052
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in,
and we'll update you whenever they do.

856
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:08,103
And the charge for this update?

857
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,190
$2 million a month

858
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,695
for the operations and names
of every undercover DEA agent in the world.

859
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,324
What can I say?

860
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,243
When do we see the list?

861
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:28,665
The day after Thomas Jefferson died,
July 5th. God bless America.

862
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,465
ANNOUNCER: All right, settle down,
everybody, settle down.

863
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,550
And welcome to DC.

864
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,218
ALL: Yeah!

The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna
tell your grandchildren about.

867
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,939
We're jumping
into the city's fireworks display

868
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,858
and coming right down in Potomac Park.

Everybody settle down.

872
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,493
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.

873
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,913
Got Jack in the center
surrounded by a nine-way star,

874
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,207
outside of that, a 24-way star.

875
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:13,335
The judges today determine who gets
to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.

876
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,463
You wanna be in a big fireworks show,
you'd better fly your butts off.

877
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,423
You need 10 points or better to qualify.

878
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,426
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!

SWOOP: Four hundred,
450. Something like that.

SELKIRK: No.

881
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,974
- What kind of competition is that?
- SWOOP: A vicious competition, man.

882
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,226
Ten points I gotta get?

883
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,436
Hey, Swoop,
how did you fix in with this group, man?

884
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,939
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right. It's all right.

PETE: So, what about this Ty Moncrief?

01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,922
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them
three years ago. Thanks.

01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,216
Is he good enough to be
one of the people I'm looking for?

If I find out that he killed Jagger,
it won't matter how good he is.

Well, why would he risk showing his face
around here?

I mean, what's so special
about this DC jump?

01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:09,649
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete,
it's the biggest thing in the world.

950
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,526
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.

951
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,654
Any other day,
it's the most restricted air space.

952
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,825
That's why every skydiver worth his ass
wants in on this load.

- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.

It's right there,
right by the Washington Monument.

PETE: You mean a jumper could put down
anyplace he wanted to?

I myself am going to make a landing
right in Abe Lincoln's lap.

Yeah, tell him, "Anytime. "
I enjoyed it.

961
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,274
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.

962
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,484
All right, see you, guys.

963
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,914
That's him. That's what
I've been trying to tell you all along.

964
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,373
- I know. I know.
- And I'm telling you,

965
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,833
we'd better take this son of a bitch out

966
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,418
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up. Shut up.

967
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,547
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.

968
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,009
We keep their team on the ground,
they'll never touch us.

969
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,347
- I see. So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.

01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,183
Crossman.

01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,064

Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.

01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,550
Have a nice trip.

974
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:08,518
Patrick, get this off to Chicago
and wait for the fax. It's number six.

PETE: Tom.

976
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,856

- I've got to talk to you.

01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,025
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.

Working undercover while on suspension
violates your sworn oath.

- I'm in the middle of them.

981
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,787
As a matter of fact,
I found one of the chutes from the 747.

- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

983
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,417
If you've got evidence,
make your case to the FBl.

984
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,588
You're going to have to do better than this
Ty Moncrief fellow. He's DEA. See that?

985
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,675
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.

986
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,138
I'll bring his service record up
so you can see it.

a washer-trolley signal, though.

- Roger. Yeah, thank you.
