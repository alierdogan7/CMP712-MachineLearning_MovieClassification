Though what I can't quite figure

00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,552
is why one of them would want
to kill your accountant.

an electrical accident.

282

Someone you worked with previously whose
name would presumably mean nothing

283
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,978

I need to know about?

the deal never changes.

a good soldier always does.

1054
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:17,141
You'll follow the orders.
So listen to me very closely.

1055
01:10:17,461 --> 01:10:21,192
If you ever wish to see your father alive
again, you'll do exactly what I say.

1056
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,293
(PHONE BEEPS)

1057
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,377
Son of a bitch!

(CAR APPROACHING)

1060
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:01,832
Couldn't stay away?

1061
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:02,952
There's a new deal.

1062
01:11:03,061 --> 01:11:04,032
I thought you said you never...

1063
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:05,702
That was before he took my dad.

1064
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:08,577
Listen, I'm in this shit because
of you and so is my dad.

1065
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:10,912
So whether you agree or not
we're going to see Karasov

1066
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,174
on his yacht right now with the ledger.

1067
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:15,420
I was all for you,
now I need you to do one for me.

1068
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:17,018
Do we have a choice?

1069
01:11:17,141 --> 01:11:18,372
Not really.

1070
01:11:19,181 --> 01:11:20,253
We'll help you.

1071
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,739
No more games. No more bullshit.

1072
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:27,699
Where's Gina?

1073
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,432
She left. Back to her family.

1074
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,512
Don't lie to me.

1075
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,432
Karasov assumes
that there is only three of us

1076
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,773
and that's what he is looking for.
Don't you think?

1077
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:37,577
This is why we always
kept someone separate.

1078
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:40,901
So one of us could get away.
That was our deal.

1079
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,663
Let's get your father back.

1080
01:12:28,101 --> 01:12:29,537
Welcome back, girls.

1081
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:17,138
Been a long time.

1082
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:18,777
Not long enough.

1083
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,741
Still upset about what happened?

1084
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,533
A little bit, yeah.

1085
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:26,832
I thought you John Wayne types
just let it roll off your back.

1086
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:28,263
That was the old days.

1087
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,302
Now we hold grudges and get revenge.

1088
01:13:33,261 --> 01:13:34,432
Revenge for what?

1089
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:38,072
That car of yours is a real step up
from driving a military convoy truck.

1090
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,952
You know, you brought this
on yourself, Frank.

1091
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:42,912
Everyone in your platoon played ball,
they made a lot of money.

1092
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:46,032
It would have been easier if you just
went along with the rest, you know.

1093
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:49,773
I wasn't there to make money.
I was there to fight a war.

1094
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:52,220
I don't play ball with people like you.

1095
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:53,992
Well, I can't speak to the arrangements

1096
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:56,459
your country's military
makes to get jobs done.

1097
01:13:56,661 --> 01:13:59,735
I'm just happy I was on the side
that profited from it.

1098
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,656
Well, let's just hope you get
what's coming to you.

1099
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:15,141
Qiao, Anna, Maria,
glad you could join us.

1100
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:18,872
Where's my dad?

1101
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:20,178
Did one of you bring the ledger?

1102
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:31,061
Now where's my dad?

1103
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,622
- I said...
- I heard you.

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

1105
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:50,456
I assume you have a plan, Junior.

1106
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:02,872
What is this?

1107
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:03,973
You tell us.

1108
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,832
What's that supposed to mean?

1109
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:06,872
You called the meeting.

1110
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:08,232
I didn't call anything.

1111
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:09,822
Cut this shit. What's this about?

1112
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:11,952
Well, for one, I found the people
who stole from you.

1113
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:13,872
Right. And he's right there.

1114
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,552
Listen, I'm getting pretty sick
of you both accusing me

1115
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:17,672
of something I didn't do.

1116
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:19,672
As a matter of fact, I brought
these people here to kill them.

1117
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,773
He's lying.

1118
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:22,672
Who the hell are you?

1119
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:24,297
I'm Anna and I work for him.

1120
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:26,258
He told me to rob you and I did.

1121
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:27,983
We called you here
because he has your money.

1122
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:32,933
Let her talk.

1123
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,312
ANNA: There's no way
we're taking the fall for this.

1124
01:15:39,421 --> 01:15:40,432
'Cause he robbed you. Not us.

1125
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,232
You lying bitch.

1126
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,653
Have him show you. Ask him
to show you the bank account.

1127
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:47,216
I'm not showing anybody shit.

1128
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:49,255
We've been friends for a long time.

1129
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,652
Maybe you should.

1130
01:15:58,141 --> 01:15:59,552
You'll see he has every penny.

1131
01:15:59,661 --> 01:16:00,632
Shut up!

1132
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:03,053
It's not part of your plan,
this, is it, Junior?

1133
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:19,053
I checked the account this morning.
I have just over 120 million.

1134
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:22,062
I'm gonna lower my gun.
Grab that tablet right there.

1135
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:27,792
Show you the account.
You're gonna see for yourself.

1136
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:28,939
That's a fair start.

1137
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:34,856
Come on, baby. Come on.

1138
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:43,933

1139
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:56,293

1140
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:01,173
Yes!

01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,376
$120 million. Just as I said.

1144
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:17,173
Give it to me.

1145
01:17:19,141 --> 01:17:20,338

1146

01:17:28,781 --> 01:17:29,819

01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:33,417

Come on.

1154
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:09,902
Say goodbye to your money.

1155
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:15,552
You think you can untie the boat
and get it started?

1156
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:16,653
I'll try!

1157
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:25,973
What?

1158
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:35,432
What's the plan, Junior?

1159
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,533
I'll hold them off.

1160
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:38,495
We meet back on the boat in two minutes!

1161
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:45,775

- Okay.

Why do you never carry a gun?

being less critical?
