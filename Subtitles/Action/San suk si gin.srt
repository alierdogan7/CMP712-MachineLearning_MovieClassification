1
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,555
Quickly!

2
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,631
What'd he say?

3
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,396
How would I know? Just run!

4
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,903
Hurry, run or we won't get away!

5
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,442
Leave that! Let's go!

6
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,746
Japan 90's

7
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:14,417
This is the third boatload of illegal immigrants
...

8
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:20,293
to land in Wakasa Bay in 6 months

9
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,006
Tokyo Shinjuku District

10
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,872
I'll take you to a nice restaurant

11
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,576
No, it's OK, maybe next time...

12
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,812
Come on, it's OK...

13
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,014
30,000 for both of you, OK?

14
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,524
No... you're so rich and still you haggle...

15
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:56,992
Stop, don't run!

16
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,866
You can't escape

17
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,470
Where do you think you're going? Oh no...

18
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,905
Let go, let me go!

19
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,045
Let go! Stop resisting!

20
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,911
Let me go!

21
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,772
Northeastern China

22
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,445
Hey, little brother-in-law Hi

23
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,523
Can I get through?

24
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,283
Yes

25
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,484
Don't fool me

26
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,289
I'm not, it's frozen solid!

27
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,275
You little rascal

28
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,744
Who's your brother-in-law? My sister hasn't
said yes to you yet!

29
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,576
Let's go, let's go...

30
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,015
Where are you running off to?

31
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,654
My tractor's been destroyed by you!

32
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,886
That's the one

33
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,757
No way, just from this scar

34
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,727
You can prove my wife is a Japanese orphan?

35
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,026
What do you know?

36
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,735
Those days, getting cowpox vaccination was a
big deal

37
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,431
Only the Japanese children could afford such
luxury

38
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,837
You're great Auntie

39
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,441
Just go along with it

40
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,577
and say they are your children

41
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,806
Then they can claim to be descendants of
Japanese orphans

42
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,077
And go to Japan legally

43
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,650
Goodness, that's not possible

44
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,051
It would be illegal Yes

45
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,722
It can work!

46
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,350
It can work? Oh, no way

47
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,520
Look, I can't have given birth to so many!

48
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,426
It's not like making buns you know!

49
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,228
Sure you can! Auntie Liu next door has 1 2!

50
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,996
Please auntie, say we are yours!

51
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,833
Let us have the chance to go!

52
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,033
Yes, give us a chance...

53
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,289
Steelhead

54
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,723
Are you romancing me, or that machine?

55
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,564
Come up

56
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,004
Come up

57
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,607
My aunt in Tokyo wants me to go over. Should
l?

58
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,885
Will you come back?

59
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,351
Why wouldn't l?

60
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,587
You're worried I won't be back? Can't bear to
see me go?

61
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,952
Shameless!

62
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,428
If you don't want me to...
Follow your dream!

63
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,459
Once I make enough money, I'll be back

64
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,370
Mail's here

65
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,947
No need to look, nothing for you

66
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,520
It's connected

67
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,656
Thanks

68
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,657
Jie, have you found her?

69
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,888
No, she has moved

70
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,520
How can she just vanish?

71
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,757
That's the thing

72
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,026
What about her aunt?

73
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,029
She died last month

74
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,534
Died? How did she die?

75
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,408
We are at the scene of the shipwreck

76
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,879
People of different nationalities are being
taken away by the police

77
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,846
That's it, he must have been caught

78
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,975
Another one, poor sod

79
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,896
Jie, I've walked for two days

80
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,399
Thank God, I thought you didn't make it

81
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,832
Come on in

82
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,801
Some tea, hurry

83
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,999
Let me introduce you

84
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,569
This is my brother from home, Steelhead

85
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,046
This is Lao Gwei, Dai

86
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,375
That's Auntie Hao and her daughter Mae

87
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,852
Also just arrived. Now helping us to clean and
cook

88
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,623
Hu and Fang

89
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,855
I said slow down... slower

90
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,731
Don't choke

91
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,934
God, he stinks

92
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,969
When he's eaten, take him for a bath

93
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,575
You have to hurry, we're closing soon

94
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,373
Understood

95
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,938
Come

96
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,938
I'm surprised they have bathhouses here, just
like home

97
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,042
This is the old area, some houses don't even
have toilets

98
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,788
Idiots! Shut up!

99
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,620
So sorry

100
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,385
Japanese mobsters, stay away

101
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,696
Why are there so many louts here?

102
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,699
Tokyo has really gone to the dogs

103
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,430
That's right! Ain't that the truth!

104
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,239
Damn it, if they had balls come to China

105
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,901
See if I don't chop him into pieces

106
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,739
How is life?

107
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,405
Fine, just tiring

108
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,917
She moved away

109
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,912
After her aunt died

110
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,948
I've looked everywhere

111
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,360
You should give up

112
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,889
We'll talk after you get some rest

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,469
Come on, get up Coming

114
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,545
Move faster, or you won't get work

115
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,277
Takadanobaba

116
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,510
How've you been?

117
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,645
Same as before

118
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,720
Is there any work?

119
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,721
I don't understand English

120
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,315
Big brother... Wait

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,685
Any work?

122
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,452
You're lucky, a foundation job

123
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,996
Guaranteed a week, 6,000 yen a day

124
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,531
Great!

125
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,294
Can my two buddies go with me?

126
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,391
Sure

127
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,935
But, 6 times 7 is 42,000

128
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,006
First, fork over commission of 4,200 each

129
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,672
Sure, sure, no problem...

130
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,833
Go on then

131
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,714
Plastics with plastics, glass with glass

132
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,548
Separate the flammable from the inflammable.
Don't be lazy!

133
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,280
Damn it, I thought it was foundation work

134
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,948
Isn't all the land here foundation?

135
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,583
In 20 years, this'll all be full of villas

136
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,662
Stop talking and get to work!

137
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,357
Separate them properly! Plastics with plastics!

138
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,592
What's that guy doing?

139
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,537
Treasure hunting!

140
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,934
Treasure hunting?

141
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,016
Hey, hey...

142
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,273
That's mine!

143
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,579
The crane!

144
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,659
Hey! Stop! You're crushing him! Hey!

145
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,523
Someone's trapped underneath

146
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,257
Quick, call the police!

147
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,423
They're calling the cops!

148
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,023
Illegal workers better run!

149
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,562
There's still someone there!

150
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,668
Run! Run!

151
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,295
Hurry up and help! Come on!

152
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,401
Run! They're calling the cops!
Thanks

153
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,545
Run! Run!

154
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,477
Brother Steelhead, eat while it's hot

155
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,353
I'm Hong Kong Boy

156
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,755
You saved my life, I'll repay you 10 times

157
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,848
I have a plumbing job in a few days

158
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,724
10,000 yen a day, I'll leave you a spot

159
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,524
Make sure you keep your word

160
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,731
A little token, please take it

161
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,066
Telephone cards

162
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,604
No, I can't

163
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,902
It's nothing

164
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,333
How do you sell these?

165
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,842
Very cheaply, at a tenth of the price

166
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,378
Get me 20 of those

167
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,913
No problem, coming right up

168
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,984
They're fake! You have to use them at green
pay phones

169
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,285
The red ones have a detection system. Never
use those

170
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,851
How are you, big brother?
Fine

171
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:45,430
Brother Tai Bo, please give me another 20
cards

172
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,495
Is 20 enough?

173
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,965
It's for a friend

174
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,031
Look at you, didn't I ask you to work with me?

175
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,968
There's a lot going on here! You can get
anything you want!

176
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,010
We are now at the Sanwa-kai headquarters...

177
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:12,046
...for the funeral of Mr lwaida Jiro

178
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,725
All major mob heads are here

179
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,319
Police are being very cautious...

180
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,591
and have sent a large contingent

181
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,326
We also hear from a reliable source...

182
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,962
that the mob leaders will...

183
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,336
sit down and elect...

184
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,932
a new head for Sanwa-kai today

185
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,671
Excuse me

186
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,525

188
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:05,739
Muranishi Koichi is the new leader

189
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,380
The new leader is here!

190
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,355
Boss... Boss...

191
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,829
Our new leader, Muranishi Koichi

192
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:36,463
Sub-head, Eguchi Toshinari Enter

193
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,979
Kurata

194
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,016
Do you know what I do?

195
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,381
I'm a police officer

196
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,426
You ask me to crawl down a sewer?

197
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,297
Don't you know lwaida Jiro is dead?

198
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,027
I haven't even had time to celebrate...

199
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,997
and you want me to do this?

200
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,067
We received a citizen's complaint

201
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,035
Then you should tell them

202
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,742
It's the illegal workers who clean the sewers

203
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,369
A Japanese would never do such a dirty job

204
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,072
If his toilet was blocked

205
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,512
Shit would just pile up to his ass

206
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,086
OK, all right

207
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,720
After this, I'll buy you some drinks
Lead the way

208
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,656
The number of illegals has gone up in the past
2 months

209
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,860
The brass needs to clean things up

210
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,993
He's the Chinese interpreter

211
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,435
I see

212
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,632
I studied some Chinese in college

213
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,539
But I'm not fluent. Can you understand me?

214
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,080
I can follow you

215
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,641
Because I'm also Japanese

216
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,311
Oh... he really does understand me?

217
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,618
Forget it

218
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,990
Watch your step

219
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,524
OK

220
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,976
Stay where you are!

221
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,173
Cops!

222
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,915
Steelhead, run! Go!

223
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,780
Cops! Run!

224
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,144
Don't run!

225
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,286
Stop!

226
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,599
Round them up for questioning

227
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,905
Show your lD

228
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,205
Take out your lDs

229
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,546
Keep quiet!

230
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,709
Can you speak Putonghua? Speak it!

231
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,819
What's happening?

232
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,945
I can't understand them

233
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,417
Aren't you the interpreter?

234
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,355
They are speaking in dialect

235
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,016
Besides Beijingnese, Cantonese, what else is
there?

236
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,754
Several hundred others!

237
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,090
Oh really?

238
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,044
How much do you earn a day?

239
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,285
8,000 yen

240
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,683
8,000?

241
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,184
He said only 8,000

242
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,190
What's your point?

243
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,319
This kind of work pays at least 1 5,000 yen

244
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,794
It's too little

245
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,363
Is my Chinese OK? Can you understand me?

246
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,601
Yes I can

247
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,673
Get them out of here

248
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,638
Don't arrest me, please

249
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,539
Run! Run!

250
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,617
No running!

251
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,922
Stay where you are!

252
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,656
Watch out! Over there!

253
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,000
Help... I can't swim

254
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,209
Give me your hand

255
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,491
Steelhead, run! Hurry!

256
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,194
Don't run

257
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,054
Wait

258
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,649
Run

259
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,427
Doesn't anyone guard the place?

260
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,697
The Japanese don't steal, so they think others
won't

261
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:08,873
Fools!

262
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,837
Come, take this

263
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,282
3,000 is too little!

264
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,443
This is worth nothing, get the LVs

265
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,782
and the Guccis

266
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,447
They're at department stores

267
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,520
Steal these, they're the hottest

268
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,496
I'll give you 20 percent of the market price

269
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,528
All these are stolen goods

270
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,694
The Southeast Asian buyers

271
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,397
All come here to buy

272
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,265
Some customers order in advance too

273
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,674
The harder it is to steal, the higher the price

274
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,181
Come, freshly grilled

275
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,752
Have it while it's hot So slow!

276
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,721
I'll tell you who they are

277
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,824
The crew cut is from Vietnam

278
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,624
The effeminate one behind you is from
Shanghai

279
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,801
Those on the other side... the loud ones

280
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,062
...are from Fujian

281
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,296
The people here...

282
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,872
...are capable of doing anything

283
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,906
Do they work with each other?

284
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,976
They're all in different gangs, so probably not

285
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,478
Don't listen to him

286
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,641
This year, everyone is under the same sky

287
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,914
Money is king! No money, no brethren

288
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,614
Get lost if you have no money!

289
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,816
Don't talk rubbish!

290
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,820
Let me show you something

291
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,451
Come over, come on

292
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,460
You eat first... come over

293
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,203
I'll show you a trick, just a slip of paper

294
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,019
You spend nothing, but you have cigarettes

295
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,978
And you have spare change

296
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,252
Steelhead

297
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,450
I see an aggressive streak in you

298
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,721
It'd be a waste if you don't take short cuts

299
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,193
I don't want to be deported

300
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,128
Deported... you scared? Stop the
nonsense

301
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,324
Just ignore him

302
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,764
I'll bring you back

303
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,667
Come back and play again, right?

304
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,182
I'll wait outside

305
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,992
Are you new?

306
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,098
Get yourself some food

307
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,767
Lily Yes

308
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,036
Go

309
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,537
Be careful

310
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,342
I'm drunk, Lily takes care of me

311
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:11,478
If you get drunk, I'll take care of you

312
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,346
Give me your money

313
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,425
I have no money

314
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,686
Hand over your money!

315
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,489
Let go... What are you doing?

316
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,163
Mito-san

317
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,731
Let me go...

318
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,763
What are you doing?

319
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,801
You... what are you doing?

320
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,177
Help! Help!

321
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,582
Help! Help! Run!

322
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,554
Help...

323
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,320
Thank you... thank you

324
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,397
Are you OK?

325
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,831
Oh, it's you

326
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,695
I hit the jackpot today

327
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,134
Mito-san

328
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,331
Sister

329
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:06,570
Mito-san, your head is bleeding! Come and
help

330
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,735
I'm pissed off

331
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,642
No, don't drink any more

332
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,443
Give me a drink! Sit down first...

333
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,684
I can't calm down without booze

334
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,381
Wang, bring the first aid box
Right away

335
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,215
Come... sit

336
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,019
Here's the box

337
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,633
I don't know how to thank you

338
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,670
Money's the most practical, please take it

339
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,330
I still need to return this money to you

340
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,304
Thanks

341
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,007
I'm looking to hire someone

342
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,649
Why not come and help me?

343
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,977
It's OK, I have work

344
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,215
Let me get you a drink

345
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,890
Wang, bring some food

346
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,688
What would you like? I'll go prepare it

347
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,625
Anything will do OK

348
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,260
No need to be curious

349
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,963
They're all working students

350
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,507
I purposely opened this bar at a quiet location

351
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,237
I wanted to keep things simple

352
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,109
Kabuki-cho is too uncivilised

353
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,480
Zunaku is a hostess bar

354
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,846
It's yours?

355
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,214
Yes!

356
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,288
If you're lonely or troubled

357
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,948
Just come here for a drink

358
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,761
This place is meant to sooth sorrows

359
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,801
I envy her

360
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,803
I too would like a man to search the world for
me

361
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,165
You don't have a man?

362
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,805
No good man!

363
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,316
Good men like good women

364
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:57,345
Wrong! Good men like bad women

365
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,120
So you're a bad woman looking for a good
man

366
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,524
Right! You're so right!

367
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,562
Ah, problems, everyone has their problems

368
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,761
Are you doing OK at work?

369
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,067
I'm doing OK

370
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,103
That's good. Don't rush yourself

371
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,077
When people are in a hurry, they stray from
the path

372
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,853
What do you want?

373
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,819
You're obstructing justice, you're under arrest

374
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:45,833
Reject the Anti-yakuza bill, protect our rights

375
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,404
Can you please elaborate on...

376
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,533
how the Japanese mafia can co-exist with
other legal organizations?

377
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,441
They don't exactly co-exist

378
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,312
It is a long and complicated story

379
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,408
Can you give us a simplified explanation?

380
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,646
It's rather difficult...

381
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,850
Tell the branches to burn all papers

382
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,984
And cease operations Yes

383
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:15,089
No one is to use any violence

384
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,067
Don't give the cops any excuse to hold us

385
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,067
Understood

386
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,798
Move out! Yes!

387
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,605
Hurry up! There's no time!

388
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,445
Hurry!

389
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,444
Sir, times have changed

390
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,382
Sanwa-kai cannot survive on old rules

391
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,756
We need radical changes

392
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,795
Togawa Taro from Togawa-gumi...

393
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,400
will never accept your suggestion

394
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:54,204
Perhaps, but Togawa-gumi is pushing things

395
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,366
The cops will use this as an excuse to arrest
us

396
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,978
We can't treat him as the enemy

397
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,674
We can't have Sanwa-kai in disarray

398
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:15,815
And we certainly cannot anger Togawa Taro

399
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,724
I understand

400
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,400
Welcome

401
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,844
Good evening, Eguchi-san

402
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,678
Please come in

403
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,385
Here you go

404
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,785
Who is that man?

405
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,988
Big shots!

406
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,492
Look, look

407
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,389
The one in red...

408
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,764
is Gao, the Taiwan gang's leader

409
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,428
The fiercest in Shinjuku

410
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,062
I think the tall guy beside him

411
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,937
is probably a mobster

412
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,113
Jie, is that her?

413
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,829
Surely not

414
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,665
Isn't it?

415
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,583
Hey, what are you doing?

416
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,516
Don't go

417
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,059
Nakajima, take the things in

418
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,598
I can take them

419
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,132
No need

420
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,437
Nakajima, do you need to move some stuff?

421
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,304
Thank you

422
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,782
If it's not enough, there's more inside

423
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,216
Thank you

424
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,553
That man just now

425
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,420
Seemed quite taken with you

426
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,604
He is from my village

427
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:24,079
Under the circumstances, I didn't dare greet
him

428
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,545
I didn't want to embarrass you

429
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,143
Yuko

430
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,649
We've been together so long

431
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:38,324
Why would I discriminate against the
Chinese?

432
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:51,240
Some people discriminate against foreigners

433
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,672
I think that's too extreme, and naive

434
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,948
Don't you agree, Nakajima?

435
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,385
Many Chinese have come to Kabuki-cho

436
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,184
They're creating a mess there

437
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,917
Actually, they are no different from us

438
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,989
Just trying to make a living

439
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,927
Do you know how many Chinese...

440
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,694
helped to build Kabuki-cho after the war?

441
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,702
Never mind

442
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,330
Yuko

443
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,343
If you meet your friends again

444
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,874
Just make contact with them

445
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,244
I won't mind

446
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,225
I've been keeping this for a special occasion

447
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,987
Tonight, it's bottoms up!

448
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,257
Come!

449
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,833
Ah... Enough, enough...

450
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,633
What's up?

451
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,644
Waiting is such torture

452
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,885
Now we have the answer, great!

453
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,256
Come, let's paint the town!

454
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,663
Good, paint the town!

455
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,259
Stop! What are you doing?

456
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,623
Don't run!

457
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,523
Come down!

458
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,068
Run!

459
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,738
My papers! My papers!

460
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,110
Squat down!

461
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,882
I can't go back

462
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,661
Since I'm on the road of no return

463
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,354
I should make life better for myself

464
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,596
I'll make some money and make myself legal

465
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,401
I can't live in the shadows forever

466
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,133
You mean...

467
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,109
You want to skirt the law?

468
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,676
What do you think?

469
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,947
My problem is I'm a coward

470
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,117
I just want a pushcart to sell Tianjin chestnuts

471
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,312
That's my biggest ambition

472
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,184
Every dream needs money

473
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,727
Excuse me, brother Tai Bo

474
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,629
My buddy Steelhead has a deal for you

475
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,564
Let's sit and chat

476
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,930
What's to talk?

477
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,627
20 cards? 50?

478
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,329
2,000 now, 1 0,000 next month

479
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,668
Can you move that much?

480
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,073
I have people

481
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,078
Good! Just show me the money!

482
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,646
Remember, it's 1,000 for 8 cards

483
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,182
If they bargain, just throw in a couple free

484
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,842
Phone cards... phone cards...

485
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,750
1,000 yen for 10

486
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:24,685
Phone cards... phone cards...

487
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,189
1,000 yen for 10

488
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:31,058
If you want to make more, sell fake cards!

489
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,721
To pose as tourists, you must behave like
them

490
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,991
What do you think? Beautiful?

491
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,961
Remember, look for the expensive stuff!

492
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,234
Hong Kong Boy, come over

493
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:41,805
This is good

494
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,032
Look at this, this one... it's good

495
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,608
PACHlNKO

496
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,439
I've secretly rigged this machine

497
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,742
I'll teach you a special way to play it

498
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,545
It will spit out tens of thousands of yen every
day

499
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,414
It's steady income

500
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,854
We've to get 600,000 yen to go into business

501
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,187
Is it risky?

502
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,591
Isn't being an illegal worker risky?

503
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,185
Let's go for it, here's 30,000

504
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,127
I'm in!

505
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,426
Here's my 30,000

506
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,965
Jie, go and change the presents
OK

507
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,470
Sorry... there's no problem

508
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,703
Let me do it

509
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,905
Calm down, why are you so flustered?

510
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,550
Thanks

511
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,999
Have you seen this kind of card before?

512
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,064
I think so

513
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,398
Sir, are you not well?

514
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,475
I'm fine... I'm fine...

515
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,374
Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine

516
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,945
Please wait Thank you

517
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,809
You can take a seat over there

518
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,814
It's fine... really

519
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,316
Why are you so nervous?

520
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,922
He's really unwell... Iet it go

521
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,320
All right?

522
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,385
Jie... Jie...

523
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,952
Come here

524
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,324
What's going on?

525
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,290
There's a delivery for you, go take a look

526
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,165
For me? What is it?

527
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,980
OK... quiet down

528
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,744
Jie, we all discussed it

529
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,756
You're too timid for a life of crime

530
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,655
We pooled our money and got you a cart

531
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,353
You can sell your chestnuts

532
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,024
Work hard Go have a look

533
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,372
Tasty chestnuts, sweet and fragrant!

534
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,636
Sweet and fragrant!

535
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,785
30 percent is Fate, the rest is a battle

536
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,915
You can only win if you love a good fight

537
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,795
Check it OK

538
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,275
Is this what you wanted? Yes

539
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,739
OK, I'll keep this one

540
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,175
Looks great

541
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,047
Such a coincidence... shopping?

542
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,214
My day off today, just looking around

543
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,425
I've been doing this recently

544
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,234
This is for you

545
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,704
For real?

546
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,500
Of course, it's for real. It's from Takashimaya

547
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,903
I mean are you really giving it to me?

548
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,977
Oh... boss, give me a bag

549
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,813
Thanks!

550
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,313
Don't put it here, over there!

551
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,245
Do you have it? Two twos, any takers?

552
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,118
No Three fours

553
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,526
Quiet... quiet...

554
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,458
Steelhead's brought a woman back

555
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,325
No way!

556
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,863
And she's quite pretty

557
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,057
They're coming

558
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,029
It's very lively in here

559
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,125
Let me help you

560
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,329
Thank you

561
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,042
What? Seen a ghost?

562
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,579
Yes, two in fact

563
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,706
A male and a female

564
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:46,915
You!

565
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,110
Can't ever say anything nice!

566
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,151
Let me introduce

567
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,915
She's Lily, a special friend of mine

568
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,185
How are you? Sister in law!

569
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,222
That's Auntie Hao How do you do?

570
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,420
Pleased to meet you

571
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,053
Miss Lily

572
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,167
You and Steelhead look like a couple!

573
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,231
Auntie Hao, what are you saying...

574
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,899
Attention! Marry now, bridal chamber next!

575
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,236
The banquet comes tomorrow
Hear, hear!

576
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,208
You people are impossible

577
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,574
Making noise all day long

578
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,980
You've destroyed my perfectly good place

579
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,883
Get out, all of you, or I'll call the cops!

580
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,512
Get out!

581
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,950
What did he say?

582
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,949
What did he say?

583
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,863
He... he said you're rude and noisy

584
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,125
He wants you to go, or he'll call the cops

585
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,928
Move? Are you kidding...

586
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,263
Lao Gwei It's new year and he
wants me to move!

587
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,338
Hush...

588
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,141
I'm sorry

589
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,982
Please...

590
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,684
What's this?

591
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,253
Please

592
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,018
This won't work next time

593
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,853
Remember, sort the garbage!

594
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,558
This is a broken shack, what's he so pissed off
for?

595
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,462
Don't you agree?

596
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,100
What did he say?

597
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,964
You must have got him in trouble...

598
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,196
...by not sorting the garbage

599
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,136
This place is a garbage dump! What do we
need to sort?

600
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,503
That's right! Hey!

601
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,840
You can't blame him for being mad, it's his
property

602
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,511
If we piss him off, he'll go to the cops

603
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,079
Who suffers? We do

604
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,384
Hey, we have to learn Japanese...

605
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,253
if we want to blend into their world

606
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,450
We're living in their home, we should build
links

607
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,755
We need to communicate more

608
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,193
You're right

609
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,796
Why don't I start a Japanese class

610
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,163
and teach you all for free?

611
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,702
Fantastic, count me in OK!

612
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,602
Me too... I want to as well...

613
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,799
OK, no more talk

614
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,704
It's new year, time to eat!

615
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,834
Yes, new year! Let's eat!

616
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,309
Lao Gwei, speak softer

617
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,438
You're the loudest, tidy up!

618
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,148
Why so late tonight?

619
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,381
Business has been good

620
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,990
Really? Look

621
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,289
Let me show you some magic OK

622
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,926
Which hand?

623
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,322
This one

624
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,295
Nothing

625
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,456
That... that one

626
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,465
Also nothing

627
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,262
Where is it? Where is it?

628
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,494
I think, it's in your ear...

629
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,333
How can it be? Let me see

630
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,665
It's really there

631
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,173
Really How would I know?

632
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,709
I'll give it to you OK

633
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,582
Who are you?

634
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,548
He's my father

635
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,914
How do you do?

636
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,416
I'm also Chinese! It's the New Year

637
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,889
A gift from me

638
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,654
You're also Chinese?

639
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,758
Come, have a cup of tea!

640
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,855
Come... Sure...

641
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,463
How about my cart? No worries!

642
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,474
Go on home

643
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,507
Why?

644
00:42:58,842 --> 00:42:59,934
Just go

645
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,102
I told you to go home! Why?

646
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,509
I said go! Go home!

647
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,876
Dad...

648
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,552
Who do you think you are?

649
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,518
You dare touch my daughter?

650
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,853
I didn't, we're just friends

651
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,685
Friends?

652
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,350
Weren't you just holding her hand?

653
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,926
Don't misunderstand
Misunderstand?!

654
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,188
We're just platonic friends

655
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,560
Teach him a lesson!

656
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,321
No, please listen to me

657
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,730
I really have no designs on her

658
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,994
Beat him!

659
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,666
Don't...

660
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,902
Jie

661
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,667
Dad, stop it!

662
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,073
Stop hitting him!

663
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,020
Is Jie back?

664
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,680
No Come... eat while it's hot

665
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,257
Give me the cold one, have the hot one...

666
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,156
Auntie, leave some for Jie

667
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,559
Of course... of course

668
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,467
Oh... mother!

669
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,696
What's wrong? Who?

670
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,930
He's bleeding

671
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,802
It's Jie! Jie!

672
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:04,771
What happened?

673
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,311
Come... sit here...

674
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,741
What happened?

675
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,252
Who beat you?

676
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:17,876
Uncle Tak...

677
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,284
Who is this Uncle Tak?

678
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,652
An old China hand

679
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,850
He has yakuza support

680
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,860
We always try to avoid him

681
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,486
and try to ignore him

682
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,791
I told you to leave his daughter alone

683
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:29,797
Why didn't you listen?

684
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,766
Where are your ears? Can you hear?

685
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,134
He's taken my cart

686
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,139
Let's go

687
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,076
Get the cart back!

688
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,341
Steelhead, don't mess with these people

689
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,744
He really has yakuza support

690
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,912
If we don't look after our brothers

691
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,253
Does that mean I should also look away...

692
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,914
if any of you are in trouble in future?

693
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,091
Those without balls can stay and eat!

694
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,655
I'll be back

695
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,000
What do we do now?

696
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,802
Steelhead...Steelhead

697
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,277
Which one?

698
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,008
The one at the back

699
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,846
What are you up to?

700
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,925
You don't understand? Are you a foreigner?

701
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,658
You looking for trouble?

702
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,528
Shouldn't be

703
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,327
Chinese are forbidden

704
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,398
You asshole

705
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,267
You want to die?

706
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,038
What's going on?

707
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,475
What's with the noise?

708
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,147
This guy

709
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,940
Are you Uncle Tak?

710
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,015
Who wants to know?

711
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,678
Give me back the chestnut cart

712
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,346
And you injured my friend, I want you to
apologise!

713
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,017
What? Say that again!

714
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,661
Apologise! Return the cart!

715
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,293
Beat him!

716
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,134
Hong Kong Boy!

717
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,575
Apologise! Return the cart!

718
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,304
Apologise! Return the cart!...

719
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,107
Quickly! No way...

720
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,620
Where is he? There!

721
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,357
Don't hit me... don't hit me...

722
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,427
Where's the cart?

723
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,330
The back alley...

724
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,129
The cops are here

725
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,869
Cops!

726
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,668
Stop... don't run!

727
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,869
Here

728
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,447
It's stuck Move that

729
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,485
Let's go!

730
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,052
The police!

731
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,751
Don't run, I'm not arresting you

732
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,019
Don't run!

733
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,891
You saved my life

734
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,364
I wanted to thank you

735
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,805

736

737
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,342
My cellphone number

739
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,875
Kitano-san

740
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,212
Go!

741
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,686
Not here, that way

742
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,096
It's been tampered with

743
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,967
Damn it!

744
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,674
Put it back

745
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:11,248
Delicious chestnuts!

746
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,816
Thanks

747
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,788
Jie Thank you for coming

748
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,620
Jie

749
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,717
Can you look after the pachinko for me?

750
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,125

You dare tamper with my machine?

756
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,434
I don't understand...

757
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,163
I said you've got balls!

758
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,839
Messing with my shop!

759
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,566
I didn't... you got it wrong...

760
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,407
I sell chestnuts

761
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,673
You look familiar, you come often?

762
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,114
I already told you I sell chestnuts

763
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,343
I think you're here to make trouble

764
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,383
I'm not!

765
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,885
You have a death wish

766
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,847
Do you have partners? Quickly!

767
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,788
Take him away!

768
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:22,857
I really don't know

769
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,052
Look, that's my cart

770
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:25,992
You really sell chestnuts?

771
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,029
Yes, I sell chestnuts Then there's
nothing to fear

772
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,496
Keep a look out

773
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,960
Take him inside

774
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,264
Don't run...

775
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,863
Don't be afraid!

776
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,399
Why are you crying?

777
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:39,873
Why try to run?

778
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,272
I really didn't...

779
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,777
Bring him inside...

780
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,058
Who's your leader?

781
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:24,883
Oh, he shit his pants?

782
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,958
Then answer quickly!

783
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,354
Who's your leader?

784
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,287
How many of you are there?

785
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,891
Where do you live? Tell me and I'll let you go

786
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,528
Just my luck... What?

787
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,829
I said I'm really ill-fated!

788
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,199
You?

789
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,772
I'm the unlucky one!

790
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,343
Keep him down!

791
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,418
Just your luck?!

792
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,227
You're ill-fated?

793
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,260
There's trouble

794
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,737
Jie's being held by the Taiwan gang!

795
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,668
What?

796
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,968
Let's go!

797
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,442
What? Still not talking?

798
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,883
No!

799
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,886
Fine then! Drag him over here!

800
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,321
Put him down!

801
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,661
I gave you a chance

802
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,858
Now you'll regret it!

803
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,407
Jie

804
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,847
There's quite a few of you!

805
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,025
You the leader then?

806
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,388
Tell your people never to step foot in Shinjuku
again

807
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,997
If I ever catch any of you again

808
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,460
I guarantee

809
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,126
It will be much worse than this

810
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,606
Jie... it's OK

811
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,072
How are you doing?

812
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,769
Hang on

813
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,437
Hand... give me back the hand

814
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,845
You want his hand?

815
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,616
Sure

816
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,561
You want the hand?

817
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,590
Here!

818
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,801
Quickly, let's go home

819
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,679
Let's go!

820
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,108
Let's go!

821
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,784
Go, quickly!

822
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:17,324
Perhaps... I should have killed him!

823
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,493
Auntie Hao, the doctor is here

824
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,430
Quickly... come in

825
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,292
The doctor is here

826
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,062
The doctor is here

827
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,581
This is unacceptable!
