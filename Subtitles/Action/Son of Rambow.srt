00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,714
"Eat your food," they say.
It's not fit for dogs.

336
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,718
And the screams at night.
There's folk screaming in their beds.

337
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,397
But I don't know if they're hurting
or just... afraid of something.

338
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,472
I'm rescuing you, Father!
We're going to escape!

339
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,028
I need to spend a penny first.

340
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,715
Lord have mercy! What are you doing?
I'll kill you! Get out of here!

341
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,588
They make you look so stupid! They
should be ashamed what they do to you.

342
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,557
The boy's taking me home.

343
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,189
The boys was just pretending.
You're not going nowhere, pops.

344
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,350
You're staying in your room.

345
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,471
Yes.

346
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,034
<i>(sniffs)</i> They're on our trails.

347
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,032
You'd better swing across the lake.
I'll get back up.

348
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,951
Meet you in the prison in one hour.

349
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,999
Don't worry, I'm trained to ignore pain
and live off the land.

350
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,798
Just go!

351
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,517
They're firing at us! Take cover!

352
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,909
<i>(gunshots /</i>
<i>"Ride Of The Valkyries"plays)</i>

353
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,797
OK!

354
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
Yeah, keep swimming to the other side.

355
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,317
I can't swim!

356
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,835
What do you mean, you can't swim?

357
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,311
Oh, shit!

358
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,158
<i>(both pant / cough)</i>

359
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,753
Thank you for coming to save me,

Will?

362
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,237
Will?

363
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,269
<i>(alarm)</i>

364
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,355
<i>(Will)</i> I'll just have to say I got
lost or something. I don't know.

365
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,479
If this film doesn't win <i>Screen Test,</i>
I'm gonna be a monkey's uncle.

366
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,074
Right, come on.
We're gonna be blood brothers now.

367
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,152
- What's blood brothers?
- Come here.

368
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,830
How long do we have to hold it
like this for?

369
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,559
Until we hear that wood pigeon again.

370
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,355
I gave your watch to my brother.

371
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,995
Oh, so I won't ever get it back, then?

372
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,196
No. He likes it.

373
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,874
Wasrt mine anyway. It was my dad's.

374
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,509
Is he pissed off with you?

375
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,750
He's dead.

376
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,630
Oh. Right.

377
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,315
- How did he die?
- Mowing the lawn.

378
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,832
It wasrt the mowing that did it,
you idiot.

379
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,911
He had a thing called an aneurysm.

380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,878
A little vein in his head popped,
and that was that.

381
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,110
He just, sort of, fell to the ground

382
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,829
and the lawnmower kept going
and tipped up and... into the fence

383
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,276
and made this really loud noise
as if it was hungry or something.

384
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,069
It kept going "Rrrr,"
until they switched it off.

385
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,791
- Jesus! I hope my veins don't pop.
- Me, too.

386
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,553
My brother said you can kill someone
with one punch.

387
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,074
Really?
Yeah. If you hit 'em right in the nose,

388
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,913
their bone goes up through their brain
and kills 'em.

389
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,309
Wow! Has he ever killed anyone
like that?

390
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,234
No. He could if he wanted to, though.
He's pretty skill at everything.

391
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,550
Do you like him?

392
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,632
Well, yeah, course I do.
He's my brother, isn't he?

393
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,597
What about your dad?

394
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,433
My dad? No.
He pissed off before I was born.

395
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,035
Then my mum met Colin, the bloke with
the big hair? He owns the care home,

396
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,634
so we all live there.
It's alright, I suppose.

397
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,110
But he lives in Spain, so my mum's
always over there with him.

398
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,430
She gets tons of duty-free and stuff,

399
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,557
which is kind of skill,
cos it's mostly just me and Lawrence.

400
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,030
We get to do what we want, muck
about. There's no-one to tell us off.

401
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,475
Seriously, though, parents...

402
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,519
You're pretty much better off
without 'em. That's what I say.

403
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,474
- Colonel Trautman.
- Yeah?

404
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,950
Not including the bit
about losing my dad's watch,

405
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,634
this has been my best day of all time.

406
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,553
<i>(wood pigeon calls)</i>

407
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,677
Oh! We've scabbed.

408
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,031
<i>(both)</i> O my God, I've come to say
thank you for your love today.

409
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,432
Thank you for my family
and all the friends you give to me.

410
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,559
Guard me in the dark of night
and in the morning, send your light.

411
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,437
Amen.

412
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,512
He's been lying, Mary.

413
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,160
He's confused.
He's trying to be a good Samaritan.

414
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
You've had more than your share
of loss in life,

415
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,713
and none of us wants to see you
lose your son to outsiders,

416
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,870
but you must speak with him now.

417
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,350
<i>(Joshua)</i> Warn him.
Let him know that the path he is on

418
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,831
can lead only to misery,
not just for himself but for all of you.

419
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,469
There's a group meeting tomorrow.
I thought it might do him good

420
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,516
to come along, get him back on track.

421
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,390
- Could you get him out of school?
- Of course. I'll make sure he's ready.

422
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,954
Well... good night, Mary.

423
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,232
And the Lord must greatly resent
the attempt to pursue a double life

424
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,709
that goes hand in hand with the world

425
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,839
and presuming to be fully brethren
at the same time.

426
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,876
Hear, hear.

427
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,988
God is faithful, who has called us
into the fellowship of his Son.

428
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,675
It works out that way,
instead of being enticed.

429
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,228
God doesn't entice anybody into evil.

430
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,713
We're enticed, led astray,
by our own flesh,

431
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,314
according to the scripture.

432
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,195
<i>(brakes squeak)</i>

433
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,431

434
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,390
- Come on, then!
- <i>(man)</i> Oi, you! Come back!

435
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,799
See ya!

436
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,513
My father won't send us to your school.
He said the pupils are a bad influence.

437
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,114
Is it true, Brother William?

438
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,911
I suppose so.

439
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,911
What are you looking at?

440
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,156
<i>(cow moos)</i>

441
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,232

<i>(explosions)</i>

443
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,671
Thank you for taking him, Joshua.

444
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,877
We all need a little guidance
from time to time.

445
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,236
I'd hoped he might see me
as a kind of father figure.

446
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,349
- You were hungry.
- Yes, very.

447
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,350
Well, I'd better be going.

448
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,639
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night. Good night.

449
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,675
- What was he saying?
- Come with me.

450
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,308
He thought you were great.
Really, he did.

451
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,391
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- Next!

452
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,270
Where have you been, eh?

453
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,033
If you didn't wanna make this film,
you should've said,

454
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,918
rather than leaving me on my own
covered in ketchup!

455
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,514
We're blood brothers,
or have you not remembered?

456
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,716
I had to go to a meeting!
It's our religion!

457
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,510
- Oh, my itchy blue beard.
- They made me go and it was all day!

458
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,956
- I'm not supposed to be your friend.
- What's wrong with me?

459
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,873
- I'm Plymouth Brethren.
- What is that supposed to mean?

460
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,269
- It's our religion.
- Bollocks, Will!

461
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,590
It's true.
If they find out we're friends,

462
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,831
I'll be in the worst trouble ever.

463
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,990
I didn't forget, Lee Can'ter.

464
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,675
They made me go.
I swear it, on my heart!

465
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,794
I'm not allowed to make the film
with you any more. It's forbidden.

466
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,553
Well, I didn't wanna make it with you,
anyway.

467
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,472
You, er, left your alarm clock in my
locker. You'd better go and get it.

468
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,278
OK.

469
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,756
Son of Rambo,

470
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,229
say, hello, to your new

00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,231
flying dog.

472
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,356
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

473
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,078
You made my flying dog!

474
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,549
We've got ten minutes before lessons.
Let's go.

475
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,951
- It looks just like my drawings!
- Alright, are you ready?

476
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,433
- Yep.
- OK. Three, two, one, go! Whoo-hoo!

477
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,355
Thank you, Lee Can'ter! It looks real!

478
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,670
Right, down, boy.

479
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,358
Non.

480
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,152
Thanks for coming.
Next, Lucy Rogers, monsieur.

481
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,270
Wait. Wait here, ladies.

482
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,673
- Do you want more Coke?
- Forget this.

483
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,036
- Forget this?
- Oui, forget this.

484
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,271
But there's lots more for you to
have a go on. I can get others.

485
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,989
St Mary's is just down the road,
and they're all Catholic. <i>(groans)</i>

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,990
He's bored. He's so bored.
I don't know what to do.

487
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,759
That... looks just like a flying dog.

488
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,709
Whoa! Whoa! Mind the trees!

489
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,956
- I can't control it!
- You're going towards the building!

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,951
- Hold on!
- I can't!

- At least we got the shot.

495
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,232
Alright, skills. Get my camera
and put it in your locker.

496
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,029
Don't let anyone see you or you'll be
in deep shit. Catch up with you later.

497
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,509
You'll get in trouble.
You'll be tortured again!

498
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,431
