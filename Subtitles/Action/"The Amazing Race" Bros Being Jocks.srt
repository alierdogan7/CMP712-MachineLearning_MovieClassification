PHIL: <i>Previously on
The Amazing Race...</i>

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,923
<i>..11 teams raced
to Cartagena, Colombia.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,909
<i>Darius and Cameron got
off to a rocky start...

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,379
Oh, we got the last flight.

5
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,189
<i>..but once in Cartagena,
it was Marty and Hagan...

6
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,469
I can't find the right one!

7
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:16,709
<i>..who sunk into last.

8
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,549
I never thought we'd be
at the bottom of the race.

9
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:19,829
Does not feel good.

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,469
<i>At a festive detour, Tyler
and Korey were all business.

11
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:24,669
Tyler, we're killing this!

12
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:25,669
We're going good.

13
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,749
<i>Passing leaders
Brodie and Kurt...

14
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,029
Oh, my God, is
this even possible?

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,309
<i>..to win the leg.

16
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,549
You are team number one.

17
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,869
Yeah!

18
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,949
<i>Scott and Blair overcame a fishy
Speed Bump to stay in the race.

19
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:39,589
Agh! It bit me!

20
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,549
<i>Marty and Hagan
cooked up a comeback...

21
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,029
Ah!

22
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,634
<i>..but one final mistake...

23
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,954
What?! Hagan and
Marty are running.

24
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:49,909
Yeah, I guess they left
their taxi over here.

25
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,549
<i>..cost them dearly.

26
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:52,949
You have been
eliminated from the race.

27
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,909
<i>10 teams remain.

28
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,714
<i>Who will be eliminated next?

29
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,789
Hey, dogs, do you want
some fish scales for lunch?

30
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,282
Do what you want to
do. Just do it quickly.

31
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:53,512
Like, it's a race.

32
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,402
You want to ask if this
guy has phone, ask him.

33
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,122
Not him.

34
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,042
Matt, you're going to
over-think us to death.

35
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,282
MATT: The last leg
was really difficult

36
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:03,922
and we got a little
bit worked up.

37
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,722
There's no-one over
here. -This guy...

38
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,202
What are you
doing to us, babe?

39
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,162
This guy. -My God,
you're so stupid.

40
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,082
Being chaotic
isn't helping us.

41
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:13,922
Sometimes you have to calm down
and hopefully we can learn that.

42
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:15,842
Indecision is the thing
that kills the race.

43
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:17,002
OK, calm down.

44
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,574
"Make your way on
foot to Plaza San Diego

45
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,094
"and search for
your next clue."

46
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:30,894
OK, Plaza San Diego,
make your way...

47
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:32,934
KOREY: We've been
friends for eight years

48
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,694
and it's only
ever been friends.

49
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,014
Although...

50
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,814
(LAUGHS)

51
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:40,374
..Tyler did have a
crush on me in college.

52
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,574
And then I met him and then
I realised nothing here.

53
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,454
So you thought I was good-looking
but my personality sucks?

54
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:46,734
Your words.

55
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:48,739
It's hot out.

56
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,694
You want me to splash you? -No.

57
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,414
Plaza San Diego?

58
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:55,094
Our biggest flaw
is going too fast.

59
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:56,134
Plaza San Diego?

60
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,299
He doesn't know,
he doesn't know.

61
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:01,134
Also, I'm constantly talking
and just spitting out ideas.

62
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:03,414
Hey, he doesn't know.
Kurt, he doesn't know!

63
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,534
If he doesn't know...
Kurt! -We're good.

64
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,774
Sometimes, it might be a little
annoying to Kurt but he's used

65
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,014
to me talking all the time
so it's nothing new for him.

66
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:12,214
Just straight and then left.

67
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,014
No, this way, Brodie. Listen
to me on the directions.

68
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,414
Just go, go, go, go!

69
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,054
Beautiful.

70
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:23,094
It's there in the hat,
in the hat, in the hat.

71
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,694
"Make your way to

79
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,814

80
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:46,614
Kurt, you're scaring him.

81
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:48,254
Plaza San Diego.

82
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:50,134
ASHLEY: As a gamer we
are used to trying again

83
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,654
if we don't get
quite the score.

84
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,059
We're looking for
the first time around.

85
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:55,574
You can't do that in the race.
You don't get a second go.

86
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:57,414
In games, checkpoints
are like save points.

87
00:03:57,414 --> 00:03:59,734
Here, checkpoints are how you
get eliminated from the game.

88
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,814
Let's go, this way.
-Burnie, please, your pace.

89
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:03,574
Just keep it in check
from the beginning.

90
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,454
Plaza San Diego?
-Yeah. Try left.

91
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,574
Are you sure?

92
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,099
Wait a second, don't just run.

93
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,974
It's just too hot for us to
make any mistakes and run extra.

94
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,694
Look at this.

95
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,494
"Search the catacombs

96
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:15,694
OK, let's go.

97
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,766
Is this it right here?

98
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:23,966
Wow!

99
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,786
I hear the trumpeter.

100
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:28,406
Ready? Holy shoot!

101
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,766
Korey, I don't want to
go down there, it's scary.

102
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,846
Breathe. -Now we
take deep breaths?

103
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,036
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,036
You look to the right,
I'll look to the left.

105
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,406
Look in every nook and cranny.

106
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:40,806
I'm looking.

107
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,201
Please, please, please.

108
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:43,886
Oh, my God! -Do you think
this way or that way?

109
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,476
Watch your foot,
it's super slippery.

110
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:47,206
Here we go.

111
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,286
"Detour. Tickets or Tejo."

Take a 3lb metal disc,

some gunpowder

123
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,286
and a clay target

124
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:21,166
and you've got this
country's national sport.

125
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:25,321
Tejo.

Muchas gracias, senor.

130
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,366
I hear the trumpeter.
Is that him?

131
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,686
Go, go, go!

132
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:39,646
Don't get lost once we get in.
-This is my nightmare.

00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:42,726
Clue box. -Where is it?

135
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,206
I don't know.

136
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:45,926
Make sure we look
down each one, Brodie.

137
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,326
Here it is, here it is.

138
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:48,646

139
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,046

Whoo!
-They're right behind us.

141
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,311
Plaza San Diego.

142
00:05:58,346 --> 00:05:59,546
Plaza San Diego. Let's go.

143
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,826
Let's just follow them.

144
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,026
Hopefully, they're right.

145
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:04,226
We're just following the
maroon team right now.

146
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:06,666
Zach's definitely more in the
spotlight way more then I am.

147
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,426
And I'm always kind of
thrown in the background.

148
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:10,906
Will you open this for me?

149
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:15,831
Thanks.

150
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,366
So I think the race is
more of a time for us

151
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,866
to be in the spotlight
together as a team.

152
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,106
We're trying to catch
up with the clever girls.

153
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,666
Just speed walk.

154
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,311
It'll look better
on camera anyways.

155
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,106
Keep a steady jog, it's
going to be a good little run.

156
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,906
Just do a steady
jog and I'll be good.

157
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,506
Hold on, Daddy.

158
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:34,506
You want me to carry your pack
for you? That might help you.

159
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,706
Can you? -Yeah.

160
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,266
"You must toss it underhand."

161
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,306
It's going to be like
cornhole. We've got this.

162
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,466
Dude, their whole shtick
is hitting targets!

163
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,866
I didn't even think of that.

164
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,906
If we don't do well at this,

165
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,306
I'm going to be probably be
getting a lot of Twitter hate.

166
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:50,266
Alright here. Follow
them, follow them.

167
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,626
Follow, follow,
follow! -OK, OK, OK.

168
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:54,106
I don't think they know
where they're going.

169
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:56,106
Tap him on the
shoulder and ask.

170
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,066
Senor?

171
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,066
Senor, do you know?

172
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,146
Here it is. -Yay!

173
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:06,506
Yes!

174
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,991
Oh, what is this?

175
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,546
Oh, we're watching.
One line, OK?

176
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,186
Oh, dang, that's hard.

177
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,426
So, we each have two.

178
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,986
Let's go this middle one.

179
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,186
Alright, here we go.

180
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,586
Way too much.

181
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:20,386
Soft.

182
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,351
There you go.

183
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:23,626
It's all about speed
once you get it.

184
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,186
There is.

185
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:26,346
Get in.

186
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,426
Whoo!

187
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,791
Let's go, baby! -That's one.

188
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:30,866
That was ridiculous.
-Let's go, let's go.

189
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,431
The catacombs.
-For your next clue.

190
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,146
"Search the catacombs for your
next clue." -Castillo San Felipe.

191
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:38,586
We're going to the catacombs.

192
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:40,911
Go left.

193
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:42,306
Hey, I've got a great idea.

194
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:45,906
You're not claustrophobic?
Hey, look what I found.

195
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,306
Oh, did you find it? -Yeah.

196
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,306
Let's go.

197
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,786
Up there. -I hear a trumpet.

198
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:52,926
Let's go. I'll follow you.

199
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:53,991
Keep those eyes peeled.

200
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:56,066
OK, you check the left
caverns, I'll check the right.

201
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,626
I think I grabbed,
like, a rat.

202
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:58,706
Go, go, go.

203
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,226
Stop it, Matt.
Don't "go-go-go" me.

204
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,306
We're searching for
something, stop yelling.

205
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,306
Oh, I found it. -Good job.

206
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:05,626
Nice.

207
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,911
I say we throw it.

208
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,146
Let's try to get down before
any other teams start coming up.

209
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,006
Yeah, Brodie.

210
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,246
Hit it, nail it.

211
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:14,346
Ooh, just short.

212
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:15,426
Come on, Kurt.

213
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:18,746
We essentially have to throw these
rocks into this little bullseye

214
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:21,546
and it explodes if you get it
in, so it's made a really loud...

215
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,346
Ah! Oh! No way!

216
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:26,226
Let's go, baby!
Let's go. Vamos!

217
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,906
We've gotten two. We need
one more and we're good.

218
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,986
OK, OK, OK.

219
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,026
Get it this time, baby.

220
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,631
(BOTH CHEER)

221
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,546
I told you! I told
you! -That was sick!

222
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:41,106
Gracias, senor.
Muchas gracias.

223
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,386
"Make your way to
Calle San Juan De Dios

224
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,106
"and search for the
marked mochila vendor

225
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,706
"along the wall of
Museo Naval del Caribe."

226
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:47,936
Taxi!

227
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:52,346
Hola. -So you're just trying
to get right in the middle.

228
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:53,626
(LOUD BANG)

229
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,626
Oh, my God!

230
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,706
I don't like that. -I love it.

231
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,586
Just a couple of
dudes being bros.

232
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,466
Just good couple
of bros being jocks.

233
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,176
TYLER: We went
to Michigan State

234
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,426
and we spent some
Sunday mornings

235
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,586
playing cornhole.

236
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,866
Except this was
with rocks and bombs.

237
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,866
So similar, a
little different.

238
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,466
Oh, sugar fudge.

239
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,296
We're the last team to lead today
but we're still feeling pretty good.

240
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,936
Hopefully we can
make a big comeback.

241
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,056
Plaza San Diego?

242
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,266
Being able to spend all
this time together is nice.

243
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,146
We want to go as far
as the race can take us.

244
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,626
Darius, slow down.

245
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,546
We need just three,
we're going to get three.

246
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:30,786
Blow it up, Kore.

247
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,146
Oh, my Go...

248
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,786
(LAUGHS)

249
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:36,176
Bam! That freaked me out!

250
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,706
I jump at any type
of... Like, anything.

251
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:40,826
We got this.

252
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,176
Ah! (LAUGHS)

253
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,471
He doesn't just jump.

254
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,166
He jumps and screams
for no reason.

255
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,826
I can't handle
that. It was a bomb!

256
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,146
We were safe.

257
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:52,506
Got two down, one to go.

258
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,866
Come on, Kore.

259
00:09:58,346 --> 00:09:59,666
Yeah! Gracias.

260
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:00,986
Museo Naval?

261
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,586
We've got to get three, babe.
-There you go. Get three bullseyes.

262
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:05,826
Oh, so close.

263
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,591
(CLANG!) Oops!

264
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:10,866
Don't sweat it.
-You got this, babe.

265
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,546
It's just like cornhole.

266
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,511
Got it.

267
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:17,986
Nailed it, OK. (LAUGHS)

268
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,346
I think I got it again. Oh!

269
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,546
Come on!

270
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,106
Look at you! You show-off.

271
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,296
I rimmed out!

272
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,466
"Search for the #catacombs
for your next clue."

273
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,226
Oh good, let's make
all that time up.

274
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,551
Search the catacombs.

275
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:37,026
Another cave. Are you
kidding me with this?!

276
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,936
I am so claustrophobic.

277
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:43,146
I really hate tight spaces.

278
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,226
You've got this.

279
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,026
I hear the trumpeter.
Do you hear him?

280
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,826
There he is. He's
up there. Nice hat.

281
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,466
Scary.

282
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,426
We're going to
go down. -Careful.

283
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:52,706
Oh, scary!

284
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:54,191
Come on, baby, you
know you hate caves.

285
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:55,866
You're doing awesome. Why
don't you get the clue?

286
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,626
Let's do Ticket. OK,
we're doing Ticket.

287
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,546
Oh, this way.
This way. Come on.

288
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:01,546
We have to get in here?

289
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,546
Oh, I'm so claustrophobic.

290
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,106
I feel light-headed. -It's OK.

291
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:09,066
No more underground!

292
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,151
(HEART BEATING)

293
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,431
Oh, my God, Jess,
I'm so afraid.

294
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,786
I don't how we get
to where we're going.

295
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:19,066
OK, OK.

296
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:22,026
Oh, my gosh. Anxiety attack.

297
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,146
Were going down. Be
careful, it's kind of steep.

298
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,906
Oh, more caves.

299
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:28,386
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,026
(SOBS)

301
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,106
I'm getting really claustrophobic.
Just keep breathing.

302
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,223
Right here. I've got
the clue box here.

303
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:42,503
Hurry, hurry.

304
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,623
Good job. (SOBS)

305
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,183
Breathe slow. Slow
down. -OK, I'm OK.

306
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,223
Slow, slow.

307
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,063
Anything to get us out of
here. I'll do whatever you want.

308
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:52,183
I'll cut off my left arm if
that's what you want me to do.

309
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,983
Gracias, gracias.

310
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,023
Thank the Lord
Jesus for sunshine.

311
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,823
What are we looking
for? -I don't know.

312
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,583
Right here.

313
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,268
We are choosing Tejo.

314
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,028
Reading that clue down
there was just hell.

315
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:06,223
That was even worse than the
cave, and that's saying something.

316
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,343
This is going to
be fun, though.

317
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,423
We're going to
get to interact.

318
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,503
It's going to be so fun and
we'll get to smile and laugh.

319
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,063
The name of the
game was catch-up.

320
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:15,543
We don't know where anybody
else is, so all engines ahead.

321
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,103
Catching up is what we do.

322
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,388
Trumpeter, trumpeter.

323
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,668
Are you sure the
trumpeter's up here?

324
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,383
Right there. You see
him? -Oh, they're coming.

325
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,783
Come on, baby, you got it.

326
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:28,148
It's right here, guys.
You got this, Sheri.

327
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,903
I can't believe I had to go in a
cave twice. -We're doing Tickets.

328
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:32,183
We're doing really good.

329
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,423
I say Tejo. Let's do it.

330
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,343
We're hoping that we
picked the right one.

331
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,263
I'll put on a show.
I'll twerk, I don't care.

332
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:41,703
That's not going to
make it. You're up, babe.

333
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:44,268
Yeah! -Yes!

334
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:45,783
Great job, baby!

335
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,263
Let's see that pop.

336
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:49,743
You did it!

337
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,223
That was so incredible!

338
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:52,703
I love you so much.

339
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,388
That was actually
a lot of fun.

340
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:55,783
Nobody else is here.
Is that good or bad?

341
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:56,823
It's probably bad.

342
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:59,263
We can do this, baby.
Let's make this baby pop.

343
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:04,383
Throw it like this, with
the flat, I think. -Shh!

344
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:08,343
Put your toe right on the line.
-Babe, don't tell me what to do.

345
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,463
Play your game.

346
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,463
OK, there's some
bus stuff over here.

347
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,983
Babe, it's over here. -OK.

348
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,743
Hola. -Hello.

349
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,668
I am the bus supervisor.

350
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:19,788
OK, today, you will
be the bus attendant.

351
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:23,103
RACHEL: For the Tickets Detour
we had to get people on the bus

352
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,143
and then collect their
fair until we got 20,000.

353
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,463
20,000 pesos.

354
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:31,743
After the person sits down,
they will pay 1,800 pesos.

355
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,303
Per person? -Yeah.

356
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:36,703
When we get the full
amount, we come back.

357
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:38,503
Remember the bus destination.

358
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:41,703
Zaragocilla Hospital,
Calamares and Campestre.

359
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,863
This is your bus. -OK.

360
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:45,663
OK, here we go riding
the bus. -Good luck.

361
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,503
Oh, wow, we are going
down some back roads here.

362
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,743
This is crazy. How
does the bus even fit?

363
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,423
Hola, hola! Hi.

364
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:54,823
It was really fun because we
got to really immerse ourselves

365
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,103
in some of the culture.

366
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,223
Race me.

367
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:59,343
Zaragocilla. -Zaragocilla?

368
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:00,983
Whoa!

369
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:03,583
Oh. Zaragocilla? Zaragocilla.

370
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,183
Calamares.

371
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,943
Campestre.
-Add a 'por favor'.

372
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,303
Add a por favor! -No.

373
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,503
Oh! (LAUGHS)

374
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,348
I want to get out and just go.

375
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,383
Cuantos kilometros,
senor? -500 metros.

376
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,703
500 metres.

377
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:17,903
Let's go. Gracias.
Get in, get out.

378
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:19,263
Let's take our time.

379
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:21,463
Slow and methodical. Make
sure you don't miss it.

380
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,643
Right here, right here!

381
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,183
Alright, here it is.

382
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:30,023
"Roadblock. Who's
left holding the bag?"

383
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:33,943
The indigenous people of
Latin America have been making

384
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:38,903
beautiful mochila bags like these
for as long as people can remember.

385
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,623
<i>One team member
must choose a mochila

386
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:45,423
<i>and then search the old city to find
two more bags by the same designer.

387
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:49,423
<i>Once they've found their matches,
they'll receive their next clue.

388
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,583
My gut feels, it
tells me you. -OK.

389
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,343
Alright, you're doing it.

390
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,543
Choose one of the
vendor's custom mochilas.

391
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,343
I'm taking this
one. -You got it.

392
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:02,263
Alright, "Two mochilas
by the same designer..."

393
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:03,463
Slow and steady.

394
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,343
It's going to be running so
fast in between, slow and steady.

395
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:09,223
We've got to find something that
matches this designer right here.

396
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:13,663
Disenos de Emelina.

397
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,703
Oh, my gosh.

398
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,183
Nothing here matches.

399
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,228
OK, got to find
other marked vendors

400
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:27,748
between Plaza Santa Teresa and
Plaza Santo Domingo. (SIGHS)

401
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:30,623
KURT: Basically what I needed to
do was run around the walled city

402
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:34,263
and find a vendor that had that same
handbag that matched the designer.

403
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:37,903
So I had to stop and ask couple of
people directions just to make sure

404
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,063
that I was in the
right vicinity...

405
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,743
Donde esta la
Puerta del Reloj?

406
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,103
Aqui?

407
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:43,188
..so the ability
to speak Spanish

408
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,143
was a definite,
definite positive for me.

409
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,183
Sabe donde esta la
Puerta del Reloj?

410
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,423
You got it, baby.

411
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:51,743
Whoo!

412
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,263
Yah!

413
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,583
Come on, come
on. You can do it.

414
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,823
Too hard.

415
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,503
Yes!

416
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,748
Yes? -Whoo!

417
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:06,223
Alright, let's go.

418
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,508
Trumpet.

419
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,383
Oh, man. You hit your head?

420
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,863
We're choosing Tejo.

421
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,063
Tight taxi.

422
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,668
I hit my head again.

423
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:16,943
Were hoping that other
teams took that bus detour.

424
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,303
Hasta luego! Gracias.

425
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,743
Hola!

426
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,943
The bus supervisor gave us a bag
of change and some directions.

427
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,463
Here is your bag. -OK.

428
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,343
Hola! -Whoo!

429
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:32,103
Whoo-hoo!

430
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:35,343
Joslyn, this is real life!

431
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,903
What is going on?

432
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:39,463
Hola!

433
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,903
Oh, my God, tree.

434
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:42,343
BOTH: Argh!

435
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,748
Whoo!

436
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,263
We have no idea where
the other teams are

437
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:50,543
but we're having a great time.

438
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,983
We're doing great.

439
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:53,703
Good luck.

440
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,543
Hola!

441
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:56,983
Hey, guys. Hola.

442
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,263
Whoo!

443
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,823
Go over here.

444
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,348
Pfft!

445
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,503
This is hilarious, I know.

446
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,503
OK, Don't worry about it,
it's going to take us a couple.

447
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:12,923
Broke a nail on that one.

448
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,503
Es el mismo aqui, no?

449
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:19,828
Esta?

450
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:21,823
Si, si. Gracias, senora.

451
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,013
Muchas gracias.

452
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:27,118
So it's the same designer.

453
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:29,223
Gracias. Muchas gracias.

454
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,143
OK, I need to find
one more mochila.

455
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:33,638
Roadblock.

456
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:34,738
I'll do it.

457
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:37,533
"Choose of the vendor's
custom mochilas."

458
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,423
OK, green.

459
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:40,773
Santo Domingo?

460
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,503
No! (SPEAKS SPANISH)

461
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:46,583
Muralla y El Reloj. -OK.

462
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,063
Y que es esto? La catedral?

463
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:50,983
Come on. Uh!

464
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,383
Where do I go?

465
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,503
We just hit rush-hour
traffic, babe.

466
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,463
Rache, we just hit
rush-hour traffic.

467
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:57,503
This is really bad.

468
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,773
Ugh! -It's crazy.

469
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,823
What's up? How are you?

470
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:01,823
Oh, boy.

471
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:04,463
Zaragocilla Hospital!

472
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:06,423
Calamares, Campestre.

473
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:07,788
I don't think people trust us.

474
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:09,903
Come ride, come
ride a little bit.

475
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,983
Zaragocilla
Hospital. Campestre.

476
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,583
Si, come on. Come,
come. Help us.

477
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,293
They think it looks weird that we're
hanging out the door, so I hope...

478
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:19,503
Si.

479
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,143
Para, para.

480
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,588
Si, si. Come. Come help us.

481
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:26,863
1,800. We need
1,800. Gracias, senor.

482
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:29,533
I saw your videos on YouTube.

483
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,063
Gracias.

484
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,983
We have fans in
Colombia, that's crazy.

485
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:35,823
On the streets of Colombia.

486
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,823
Zaragocilla Hospital.

487
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,343
Get on the bus, ride the bus.

488
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,183
Zaragocilla Hospital.

489
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:44,143
Come on, come on!

490
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:50,148
Si! Oh, Daddy, we got one.

491
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,228
I was able to coax
some people on.

492
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,383
I said, "Beso for peso,"
and they all came on.

493
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,293
We got another one! Oh,
my God, we got another one!

494
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,773
Whoo-hoo!

495
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:58,863
Yeah!

496
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:01,383
Oh, my God, yes.

497
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,943
Yes! Si, si.

498
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,773
Yeah! You want
to come? Come on.

499
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,623
Yeah!

500
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,943
Vamanos.

501
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,663
Yeah!

502
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:11,013
No-one asked me for a beso.

503
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:12,423
They gave dad the peso

504
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:14,283
and then I think they
might have thought,

505
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,143
"If I give you the
peso, do I get the beso?"

506
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:18,343
Beso, beso!

507
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,428
Yeah.

508
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,703
But I blew some kisses
to a lot of people.

509
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,309
That's as far as
that needed to go.

510
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,921
This is kind of fun.

511
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,081
Get ready for this.

512
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,366
Yes!

513
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,781
Yes, that's my girl!

514
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,241
OK, one more, one more.

515
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,561
Oh, someone's coming, Jess.

516
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,361
It's Cole and Sheri. -Hey.

517
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:43,721
The pressure's on now
we know someone's coming.

518
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:45,801
This one's on it.

519
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:48,366
Whoo!

520
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,541
Yes. Good one.

521
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:50,646
Thank you.

522
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,206
Bye, guys. Hasta luego.

523
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,641
Just got to pop
three combined.

524
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:58,561
Whoo! First one.

525
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,236
Oh. Lame.

526
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:03,081
So bad at this.
I'm very sorry.

527
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,511
Roadblock. OK.

528
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:07,681
"Who's left holding
the bag?" I can do it.

529
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,321
You can do it. -"Who's
left holding the bag?"

530
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,081
Hola.

531
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:12,741
Same designer?

532
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,401
Same designer.

533
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:18,271
Disenos de Eugenia.

534
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,081
Oh, no.

535
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,926
OK, gracias.

536
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,541
It's not the same one.

537
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,281
I'm looking for Eugenia.

538
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:26,841
OK I'm looking for...

539
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,921
..matching, this is a
little different though.

540
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:32,921
By the same designer.

541
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:35,976
This...

542
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,681
Ah, OK, OK.

543
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:38,751
I think this is a match.

544
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,161
Hold it.

545
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,921
"Who's left holding the bag?"

546
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,031
OK, I'll do it.

547
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:44,336
Come on, you got it.

548
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,641
Doubtful that's it.

549
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,161
No.

550
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:50,681
This is hard.

551
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:59,121
I don't see any
that match my bag.

552
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,401
Am I doing something wrong?

553
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:06,721
Shoot! There's a
tag inside here.

554
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,441
Designed by Ana.

555
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,031
That might be
what's going on here.

556
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,561
Hola.

557
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,566
Can I take this?

558
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,161
OK. -Good. Bueno, one more bag.

559
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,001
Ese ahi.

560
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,441
Como este, por favor.

561
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:22,881
Esta? -Si, senor.

562
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:28,321
Muchas gracias,
muchas gracias.

563
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,081
Este es el mismo...

564
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,361
Emelina. Awesome.

565
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,286
Muchas gracias, senor.

566
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,646
Muchas gracias. Vaya con Dios.

567
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:38,241
OK, let's go back,
let's get the clue.

568
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,606
Eugenia...

569
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,561
Can I take it? Gracias?

570
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:43,681
Gracias.

571
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,961
Got my third one.

572
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,031
OK, OK.

573
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,006
Yah! -That's two.

574
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,601
I want to give you
a hug. -No, just go.

575
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:52,126
I'm sweaty, I don't
want to hug you.

576
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,161
Take your time, you got it.
You'll get this final one.

577
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,241
Ooh, I thought I did
that there. -I know.

578
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,161
You popped it, you
popped it midair.

579
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,926
(BOTH CHEER)

580
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:04,801
Yeah! We got it, let's go.

581
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,641
Three by the same designer.

583
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,621
Muchas gracias!

584
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,166
Thank you so much.

Hey, good luck. Good
luck. Good luck, guys.

590
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,521
OK, I saw Tyler come
from this direction.

591
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,281
Hey, Kurt, up

Perfecto? -Yes. -Ah!

It's the old city wall.
-I think it's this way.

595
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:40,041
I'm ready to run when you are.

596
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,361
Come on, Kurt!

597
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,281
Wow. That's my boy.

598
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:48,886
How's that, Phil?

You have won a trip
for two from Travelocity

608
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:07,361
and you are going
to Mykonos in Greece.

609
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,601
Yes! Score!

amazing experience.

618

We want to keep
experiencing all that stuff.

619

Tyler and Korey, you
are to number two.

00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,321
Congratulations.

621
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:42,001
Did you expect
to do this well?

622
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,401
We had dreamed we
would do this well.

623
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,041
I knew Korey
could do this well.

624
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,521
I just wanted to
keep up with him.

Although every time you've done
the Roadblock, we've got in second.

626

Every time I've
done it, we've won.

It's true! -Rude.

628

I think I've won something.

629
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,141
You won America's heart.

630
00:24:00,281 --> 00:24:01,641
Hmm, that's what I won.

631
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,286
How many do we need to hit?

632
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,921
Blow the bullseye three
times. -Three times.

633
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,281
I play this on the weekends.

634
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,166
Oh!

635
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,121
Be loose.

636
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,006
Let's go. Whoo!

637
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,001
Come ride, come
ride a little bit.

bit. Gracias, gracias.

642

How much do we have, Rache?

643
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:30,041

Let me help you here.

651
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:46,486
Which aisle would
you like to sit in?

652
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,921
All of these seats have
been hand-washed by myself.

653
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,441
Hola!

654
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:52,366
I was so in the zone. -Mm-hm.

655
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,446
I was selling
this bus to people.

656
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:56,641
Erin, I feel like
this is our calling.

657
00:24:56,641 --> 00:25:00,401
I think I might just quit
my job and just run buses.

658
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,001
Only if I can it
do with you, Joslyn.

659
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,641
Only with you, baby.

660
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,241
Only with you. -Only with you.

661
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:10,761
Hola! Hola!

662
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,641
Daddy, another.

663
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,241
Zaragocilla.

664
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,401
She was bringing
the money in so fast,

665
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,961
I couldn't count the
money fast enough.

666
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:20,481
Whoo! -Muchas gracias,
muchas gracias.

667
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,041
You're so pretty.

668
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,961
Magnifique. Daddy,
another one, another one.

669
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,881
OK. Great. -Vamanos.

670
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,401
Come on, they're so cute,
Daddy. Blow them a kiss.

671
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,881
No, they don't want me to
blow them a kiss, Blair.

672
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,921
All this money is
your kiss blowing.

673
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:35,881
Oh.

674
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,361
You might be better
at this than me.

675
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:41,521
Can't hate the game.

676
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,441
We can't hate the game, we
can hate the player though.

677
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:45,841
With this game, I
don't know what to hate.

678
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,741
We blew up one tejo.
We got two more to go.

679
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:50,561
It took us a while
to get a stroke down.

680
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:53,801
Let's go.

681
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,566
Let's go, yes!

682
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,041
Thank you, thank you.

683
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,481
Alright, let's go.

684
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,441
We are blazing
through this. Nice!

685
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:06,761
BOTH: Hospital,
Calamares, Campestre.

686
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,841
(BOTH WHOOP)

687
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:13,601
This is one of the best
experiences of my whole life.

688
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,121
OK, Joslyn, are we
done? I think we're good.

689
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:16,641
Let me count it.

690
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,841
OK, we're way over.

691
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,241
O, let's go back. Gracias.

692
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,441
Calamares.

693
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,801
Campestre.

694
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,361
Hola! Daddy, another.

695
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:27,801
Thank you, thank
you. Muchas gracias.

696
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:28,801
We're done.

697
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,841
We're done, we're done!

698
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:30,921
Para.

699
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:32,366
Oh, my God. Para, para!

700
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:33,801
Oh, my God. Gracias, gracias.

701
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,721
Oh, er...

702
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,161
..hug? Hug.

703
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:41,006
Alright, let me do the math.

704
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,901
I think we're doing,
I think we're done.

705
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,761
Are you sure? Double-check,
count the money.

706
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:47,921
I have two 10s and we needed
20 so I think we're way over.

707
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:49,481
We got it, OK.
Gracias, senorita.

708
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,121
Let's get a taxi on the
other side of the street.

709
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,241
OK. It's crazy.

710
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,721
I think this is
very dangerous!

711
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,641
Taxi! Taxi!

712
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,241
Gracias, gracias!

713
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,541
Count the money. I
have two 10s right here.

714
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,081
Oh, OK, those aren't
10s, babe. Those are ones.

715
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:10,721
Oh, my goodness. You've
bean counting wrong.

716
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:12,801
Two, four, six...

717
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:15,606
11.

718
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:17,206
12, 13, 14...

719
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:19,761
Babe, we didn't do
enough. I'm so sorry, babe.

720
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,441
What do we do?
-We have to go back...

721
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,561
We have to...

722
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,086
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

723
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:26,201
The money is different
here. (BREATHES HEAVILY)

724
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:28,161
Those aren't thousands. -Oh!

725
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,606
I knew that was too
fast, it was too easy.

726
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:38,926
I'm so sorry.

727
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,246
We have to... -Get on
our bus and go back.

728
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:41,886
Get on a bus, a new bus.

729
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:43,286
Oh, my gosh.

730
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,046
Oh, baby.

731
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,211
This is not good.

732
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:47,806
And you're the
CFO of our company.

733
00:27:47,806 --> 00:27:49,286
It was so fun!

734
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:51,286
Hola!

735
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,491
We have all our
money right here.

736
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:55,726
Veinticuatro, veintiseis,
veintiocho... OK.

737
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:56,966
It's more.

738
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,851
Yeah! -Thank you!

739
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,206
We can run it, there's
the purple team.

740
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:02,166
Where is it? Back there?

741
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,846
Keep going, keep going.

742
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:05,846
How was it? -It was
wonderful, we had a ball.

743
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:08,006
Wonderful. -You count.

744
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,606
OK, the money is complete.

745
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,126

Ah-ha-ha!

746
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,486
Thank you, thank
you. Thank you.

747
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:14,686
Darn.

748
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:16,706
It was all my fault.
This is totally me.

749
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,726
We need to go on
another bus. -Ah, OK.

750
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:20,166
We're about 5,000 pesos short.

751
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,126
I mean, we are
dead last right now.

752
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:23,166
Here we go again.

753
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,386
Oh, I think I got
it, I think I got it.

754
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,046
Let's be smart.
Let's not go crazy.

755
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:33,131
OK. I got 'em.

756
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,966
Alright, three bags.

757
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,246
Hola. It's OK?

758
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,406
Sorry.

759
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,486
Lo siento.

760
00:28:42,526 --> 00:28:43,806
Come on, designed by Ana.

761
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,086
I know you're here.

762
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:48,131
It looks like these.

763
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,771
I really thought
it would be here.

764
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,766
I think I have to go
a little bit further.

765
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,406
I don't think it's here.

766
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:57,966

Ah-ha-ha!

767
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,446
Yes!

768
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,246
"Warning, last team to
check in may be eliminated."

769
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:02,566
Great.

770
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:03,966
Come on, Dana.
You're good, babe.

771
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,486
I've run, like, three miles.

772
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,051
I just can't find
the second one.

773
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:09,686
Ashley just finished.
You're doing good.

774
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,286
Babe, don't talk
to me! -OK, OK.

775
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,886
Go back into your own world.

776
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,406
Let me live my
life. -Right, right.

777
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,726
Burnie and Ashley, you
are team number three.

778
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,326
Yeah!

779
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,126
I don't think I've been here
yet. It's got to be here.

780
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:28,731
Ana, come on, Ana.

781
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,766
Yes! This is my second one.

782
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,406
I found it.

783
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,766
OK, we need to
tell Cole and Sheri.

784
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:37,966
It's right here,
it's this one.

785
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:39,651
You're doing it,
right? -I am, yeah.

786
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,406
I'm left holding the bag.
-Cole's left holding...

787
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,126
We'll just look down
each street as we pass it.

788
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:44,126
I see one right there.

789
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,806
Whoo!

790
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,726
I got it. -Good job, good job.

791
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,771
Gracias, senora.

792
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,366
"Last team to check
in...may be eliminated"

793
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:55,686
Or die.

794
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:58,726
Campestre, Zaragocilla!

795
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:01,046
Pesos. Oh, gracias, gracias.

796
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:04,326
We are trying really hard to get
our last amount of money here.

797
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:06,326
I'm starting to lose my
voice. This is really hard.

798
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,366
Gracias, senoras.
Gracias, senoritas.

799
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,846
Gracias.

800
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,366
Hey. Yeah, we're doing good.

801
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,006
Let's go back. -Taxi!

802
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,406
Here we go.

803
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,806
Come on, babe.

804
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:18,206
Give us a little dance. Give
us a little dance, come on.

805
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,251
MATT: The race
is a partnership

806
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:25,091
and weed to make sure that
we're on the same page.

807
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,606
DANA: Not only for the race but
for our relationship moving forward.

808
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,446
We have to try and stay a
little calmer, communicate better

809
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,446
and just make sure that we
remember to work together.

810
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,926
Here's some bags - these
are marked? Yes, these are marked.

811
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:42,366
I see one right
there. That's ours.

812
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,286
This is ours.

813
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:46,091
There's another one,
there's another one.

814
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:48,046
There's got to be. Is
that it right there, Cole?

815
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,606
You found yours...

816
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,126
No, Cole. I'm going
to run with you, Cole.

817
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,126
We're still ahead
of other people.

818
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,006
Let's go to another one.

819
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:57,446
JESSICA: Cole and I teamed
up because I trust him.

820
00:30:57,446 --> 00:31:01,326
I had all of my bags, Cole
just needed his last one

821
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,046
so I was going to run around
with him all the way to the end...

822
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,806
Oh, my God, nothing. Next.

823
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:10,046
If you're not the last team...
If you want to be nice, be nice.

824
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:12,286
Is this where we started?
Let's check it again.

825
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,646
Is Cole with her?

826
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,366
Yeah, they're together,
they're together.

827
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,686
Good. Oh, that's so good.

828
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:19,126
No. It's not it.

829
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:21,166
Cole, this isn't it. Come on.

830
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,326
How you doing? Are
y'all doing good?

831
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:24,926
I have them, I'm just
trying to help Cole.

832
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,206
Oh, you're so sweet.

833
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,846
You guys go ahead.
You've done really good.

834
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,606
Alright. Love you, Cole.

835
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:31,806
It's OK, Cole. You can do it.

836
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,886
Man, there can't
be many more left.

837
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:36,006
Gracias, senorita.

838
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:39,126
"The old city wall. Warning,
the last team may be eliminated."

839
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,006
I ran for a while with him.

840
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:43,931
OK, let's go.

841
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,786
OK, sir, we did
it right this time.

842
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:49,606
Diecisiete, dieciocho,
diecinueve...

843
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:52,126
Twenty. -Whoo! -Finished.

844
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:54,486
Gracias! -Arriba!

845
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,206
Come on, Cole.

846
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,826
You can do it, baby.

847
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,446
Could that be it?

848
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:03,326
Yeah. I got it.

849
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:08,846
Modelo?

850
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:14,126
Whoo!

851
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:17,006
Gracias. -Gracias.

852
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,686
Last team may be
eliminated! -Good job.

853
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:21,846
Maroon team.

854
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,166
They're right there.

855
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,011
Come on, let's do this.

856
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,446
Along the wall.
Could it be inside?

857
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,206
Is that marked right there?

858
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:30,406
Marked for the next clue.

859
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,766
You want to do this or do you
want me to do it? -It's up to you.

860
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,006
You do it, you do it.

861
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:35,046
Let's go over here.

862
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,486
You've got it.
Erin, be confident.

863
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,846
There's another one.

864
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:39,806
Designer...

865
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:42,006
This designer...

866
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:43,966
..is Carmen.

867
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:46,406
OK. (READS CLUE QUIETLY)

868
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,526
I'll do it, man.
-Alright, you got it.

869
00:32:48,526 --> 00:32:49,766
Oh, come on.

870
00:32:58,086 --> 00:32:59,846
Sheri and Cole, you
are team number six.

871
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:00,846
Yeah!

872
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,371
Congratulations.

873
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:03,606
Anyone speak English?

874
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:06,766
Anyone speak English?

875
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:08,486
English?

876
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,926
No. OK.

877
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:12,126
I'll just have to figure
out where I'm going.

878
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:14,206
Did you see Scott
and Blair here? -No.

879
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:15,406
Maybe they're coming.

880
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,906
Have you seen them?
I haven't seen them.

881
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:18,406
You haven't seen
anybody today? -No.

882
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:21,846
We've been by ourselves all
day. We could be first, last...

883
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:23,366
We have no idea.

884
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:26,846
I was hoping that there's some
teams still here at the Roadblock.

885
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:29,966
This is where Joslyn's Spanish
would come in very handy.

886
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,166
Adriana. Looking for Adriana.

887
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,246
Custom pattern.

888
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,766
There you go, let's go!

889
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,526
OK, one more.

890
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,446
Mochila?

891
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:45,246
That way! Oh, Daddy, come!

892
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:47,006
You're left holding
the bags. -OK.

893
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,646
This is taking so much time.

894
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:51,406
Where is it?

895
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,571
Is this marked?

896
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:58,446
There's no marker here.

897
00:33:58,446 --> 00:33:59,966
Oh, my gosh.

898
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:04,846
OK, that's not marked.

899
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,646
Need two like this.

900
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:11,126
No?

901
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,556
Nothing?

902
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,481
Same designer, yeah?

903
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,036
Designer. Person.

904
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:18,366
No tengo.

905
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:21,726
We're sitting in a lot of traffic
here and the sun is also going down.

906
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,926
It looks like it's going
to be night-time really soon

907
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:27,076
so we'll probably be doing the next
section of the race in the dark,

908
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:28,366
which makes it harder.

909
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,366
And we have to search
for a mochila vendor

910
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:34,126
and if it's getting dark on us
here, we're going to be in trouble.

911
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:35,686
How you doing?

912
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:38,486
I'm trying to find these streets.
The vendors between these streets.

913
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:40,406
Yeah, I've got a map and
it doesn't help, so...

914
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,886
So where are we
now? -I don't know.

915
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,076
That's a great question.

916
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:46,606
Let me help you
here a little bit.

917
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,886
Let's work together on it, OK?

918
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,366
It's getting dark out, which might
make this challenge a little harder.

919
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:54,726
If it is about
colours and matching.

920
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,076
It's kind of a long day.

921
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,411
SCOTT: We stopped,
we got a map.

922
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:00,926
We circled the three places
where we've got to go.

923
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,406
Let's keep going. -And now
we know where we're going.

924
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:04,926
This place is not
that big, it's just...

925
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,526
Marked mochila right here.

926
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:08,686
No, I've already looked here.

927
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,406
I need two like this.

928
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:11,626
You have to check the tags.

929
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:12,846
There are tags in here?

930
00:35:14,886 --> 00:35:16,366
Catalina. Catalina?

931
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,851
Catalina.

932
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,076
Does that match your bag?

933
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,286
This IS my bag.

934
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,726
Oh, my gosh, I've got to go.

935
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:25,366
I'm going to look
somewhere else.

936
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:26,686
Are you helping me?

937
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:29,036
Here it is.

938
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:31,606
Did she leave me?

939
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,126
Come on, babe. Go,
go. -Let's go, baby.

940
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:37,691
Can I have the map?

941
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:39,556
Can I have the map? -No,
you ran off without me.

942
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,686
No, I didn't!

943
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,451
OK. -Come on with me
if you want the map.

944
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:45,206
Scott, I'd already looked in
those bags earlier for my bag.

945
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,246
I understand.

946
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:47,966
That's why I ran, because
I can wait for you.

947
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:49,686
That must be it.
-There's Rachel and Zach.

948
00:35:51,286 --> 00:35:52,481
I'm left holding the bag.

949
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,806
Check over here.
I've been over here.

950
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:55,806
Oh, my goodness.

951
00:35:57,606 --> 00:36:02,766
Senor, sabe usted donde
esta la Plaza Santo Domingo?

952
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,406
Scott, Scott!

953
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,546
There's mine, there's mine.

954
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,286
Is that your bag? -It's mine.

955
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,206
OK.

956
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,026
Do you see mine?
Let me see yours.

957
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:15,846
Is that it? That's
not it right there?

958
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:17,166
No, my bag is not here.

959
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:19,126
Let's go.

960
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:20,516
I didn't mean to
leave you back there.

961
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:21,806
You got excited. It's OK.

962
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:24,406
The horse is beating me.

963
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,206
Come on, horsey.
I'll race you.

964
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:30,766
Oh, my goodness. Adriana!

965
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,691
OK, I've gotten all three.

966
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,886
Now I need to find
the right vendor

967
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,036
and she might be where
my brother's waiting.

968
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:40,246
Here.

969
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,931
Oh, my God. Thank you, Jesus!

970
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,041
Oh, my... Alright,
where do I go?

971
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,366
Wait, I've got to find
mine. Where is yours?

972
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:49,866
This one doesn't have
one in it. -I'm sorry.

973
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,286
It's alright. You need
to go, you need to go.

974
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,966
Mochila, mochila.

975
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:56,166
Ooh, good mochila.

976
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,646
Si?

977
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:00,126
Si. Mochila.

978
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:02,166
I found one. I need one more.

979
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,846
OK...

980
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,571
Was I here before?

981
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,246
Might have been
here before. Oh, man.

982
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:10,006
Oh, my goodness.

983
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:14,686
I thought I'd never find it.

984
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:15,886
OK, let's go.

985
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,646
This could be it. OK,
got the bag, got the bag.

986
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,606
I got it, I've finished.

987
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,926
Here he is. I got you.

988
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:28,726
You got it? Good
job. Got it, baby.

989
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:31,846
OK, now it says
find the vendor.

990
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:34,516
The name inside the
bag says Adriana.

991
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:35,806
So I've got to find Adriana.

992
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,806
Darius actually had already
finished but he didn't know

993
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:42,036
where the vendor was,
which was right next to us.

994
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,766
It was so close.

995
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,076
I do not see my vendor.

996
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,291
OK...

997
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:53,556
Don't worry, don't
worry. We got this.

998
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:02,623
Permiso. Se llama Adriana?

999
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:04,428
Adriana. Adriana, no es...?

1000
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:05,468
Alright, cool.

1001
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:06,858
Se llama Adriana, su nombre?

1002
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:09,228
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

1003
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:11,468
I'm looking for the
vendor. Her name is Adriana.

1004
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,668
Adriana? Adriana.

1005
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,748
Uh!

1006
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,988
OK, I think I'm in
the totally wrong spot.

1007
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:21,673
I hear drums.

1008
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,668
It's going to be the Pit Stop.

1009
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,188
Yeah, good?

1010
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,428
You got it, Daddy! Stay quiet.

1011
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:28,028
Thank you. Just go.

1012
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:30,108
Dad, hurry. -This
is so frustrating.

1013
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,308
Phil! Phil!

1014
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:36,108
Welcome to Baluarte
in Cartagena.

1015
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,308
BOTH: Thank you.

1016
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:38,788
I am Miss Cartagena.

1017
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:41,508
Of course you are.
You're beautiful.

1018
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:43,308
Are you crying again? Oh.

1019
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,188
Keep moving.

1020
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:50,753
Uh.

1021
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,028
It might be here.
It's this one.

1022
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:54,468
Si.

1023
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:56,028
Si?

1024
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:57,908
Si! OK, that's three.

1025
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,378
I'm going back.

1026
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,708
Hi, Phil!

1027
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:03,783
You're still here.

1028
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:05,203
You've completed three legs.

1029
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:06,588
I have to say
my dad carried me

1030
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,378
literally through
this leg of the race.

1031
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:12,378
OK.

1032
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:16,028
It's getting late.
I'm getting tired.

1033
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:20,268
I think I'm doing the right thing
by looking for somebody named Adriana

1034
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:21,338
but I'm going to make sure.

1035
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:24,028
I'm going to head
back to where I started

1036
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,948
because I really can't
think of anything else.

1037
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,668
You've got it? -Yeah, baby.

1038
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:29,628
Good job, baby. Good job,
good job. Read your clue.

1039
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:31,668
And I know where
the Pit Stop is.

1040
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,508
Here you go. Three mochilas.

1041
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:34,818
Thank you so much.

1042
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:35,783
I think it's where I just saw.

1043
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,308
There's a bunch of
drumming and noise.

1044
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,628
Let's go.

1045
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,268
Darius has all three.
It's a foot race.

1046
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:41,588
He has all three.

1047
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,788
I am not getting
out on this leg.

1048
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:51,068
Darius can't figure out where the
vendor is so I guess we're last.

1049
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,548
Hopefully, he
can figure it out.

1050
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:53,788
Babe, babe, slow down.

1051
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:55,188
Here, take your right.

1052
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:56,508
Hear that? -Yeah.

1053
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:00,423
Adriana? Adriana, su nombre?

1054
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,858
No? Your name isn't Adriana?

1055
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:06,188
Oh, my goodness. You've
got to be kidding me?

1056
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:07,748
Is that it?
-I think it's here.

1057
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,628
Do you see Phil? -No.

1058
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:11,228
What the heck?

1059
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,188
The clue to go here.

1060
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:15,788
This is El Museo Naval.

1061
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,308
Along the wall, Museo Naval.

1062
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:20,508
And that's where I was.

1063
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:23,688
I don't see Phil!

1064
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,468
OK, then I was wrong.

1065
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:27,113
This is not it. -Ask someone.

1066
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:30,148
Baluarte de Santiago!
Baluarte de Santiago

1067
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:31,148
Plaza?

1068
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:33,468
Baluarte de Santiago?

1069
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:37,108
Esta esquina, la
otra, la tercera.

1070
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,268
Just three...

1071
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:39,948
Si. Izquierda...

1072
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:41,668
Let's go. We are going
to be on a foot race.

1073
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:43,628
Oh, dear Jesus! -Go.

1074
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:45,428
Are you our vendor?

1075
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:52,113
Gracias.

1076
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:53,788
Cameron, that was messed up.

1077
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:55,428
We just don't
know where it is.

1078
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:57,068
Please be it.

1079
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:58,443
Shall we ask one more person?

1080
00:40:58,468 --> 00:40:59,783
Darius could have
caught up, no.

1081
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:02,068
Let's go. I don't blame...
-I'm running faster.

1082
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,033
We did well, huh?

1083
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:06,368
I love you. -I love you.

1084
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,668
Let's go! This way.

1085
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:08,988
There it is.

1086
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:13,713
Ah... alright.

1087
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,148
Zach and Rachel, you
probably know where you're at.

1088
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:18,338
Give us the bad news, Phil.

1089
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:22,988
The last team to
check in is behind you.

1090
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:24,428
What? -Oh.

1091
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:31,508
Darius and Cameron...

1092
00:41:33,148 --> 00:41:35,668
..unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive...

1093
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:38,433
..and I am very
sorry to tell you

1094
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:40,548
..that you have been
eliminated from the race.

1095
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:42,378
OK. Alright.

1096
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:43,548
Ooh!

1097
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:44,988
I know you guys gave
it everything you had.

1098
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:46,788
I can see it in your eyes.

1099
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:49,513
I feel like we gave
it our all, this leg.

1100
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,508
The last couple of legs,
we made some mistakes.

1101
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,548
A mixture of bad
luck, bad decisions.

1102
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,148
It didn't work out, you know?

1103
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:57,308
I mean, you lose
bit by bit but...

1104
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:02,668
I mean, I couldn't really
run it with anybody else.

1105
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:04,908
Yeah. If anybody,
this guy, you know,

1106
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,248
'cause we're the closest,
I know him the best

1107
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:09,588
and know he's capable
of doing amazing things.

Blair plus Brodie

1114
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,871
Blodie.

1115
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:47,756
<i>Teams do some bench work...

1116
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,191
Stop, move over. -Sit on
his lap, sit on his lap.

1117

switches gears.

1118

There they are, I saw them.

1119

Now hide!

1120
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,271
Can we have everyone
down, please?
