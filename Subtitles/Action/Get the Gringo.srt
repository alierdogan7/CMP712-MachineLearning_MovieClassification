Is this something
I can help you with?

Well, the thing is, two of
the cops that were with us

596
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:13,361
when we first met,
turned up dead.

Cops die all the time,
it's part of the trade.

fact they were tortured.

where you got the money.

We are just concerned that
someone might be looking for it.

we need to know who it is.

is a lot of money.

they'll be coming
to get you two first.

spending my fucking money.

go and hide yourselves. Okay?

687
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:15,144

I was. Um...

693
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:33,371
She ran off with a former
business associate of mine,

694
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:34,872
one Reginald T. Barnes.

695
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:37,458
We were doing a job,
I got away...

696
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,544
He got caught.

697
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:41,087
He ratted me out
for immunity,

698
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,880
and I did seven years
in the slammer.

699
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:44,757

shacking up with him.

on the door.
