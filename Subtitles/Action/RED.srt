fix this old thing.

182
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,450
Get a better picture.

183
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,620
- Try a little bit more to the left.
- Okay.

184
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah...

185
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,960
That's just perfect.

186
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,220
Thank you very much, Marna.

187
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,180
Unbelievable.

188
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,020
Should be ashamed of yourself.

189
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,270
[Both Laughing]

190
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,820
It's nice to see you, kid.

191
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,450
It's good to see you, too.

192
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,210
So what's up?

193
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,290
I met a girl.

194
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,840
No...

195
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Complicated.

196
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Got a visit from a wet team.

197
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,800
At my house, 24 hours ago.

198
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,890
Did you ID any of them?

199
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,390
Kind of.

200
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,400
This used to be a gentleman's game.

201
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,550
And you know I love you. Bye.

202
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,310
Independent South African hit team

203
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,270
Suspected of killing a
New York Times reporter.

204
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,230
Stephanie Chan. You know her?

205
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,690
No.

206
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,860
Somebody has a serious
hard on for you, kid.

207
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,160
Yeah.

208
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,280
But why now? I'm retired.

209
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,750
We'll just have to dig some more.

210
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,620
Watch your back, too.

211
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm 80 years old, I got stage 4 liver cancer.

212
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,920
- What the hell can they do to me?
- They can still shoot you.

213
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,090
Well...

214
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,220
I never thought this would happen to me.

215
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,560
What?

216
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,690
Getting old.

217
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,980
[Frank Chuckles]

218
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,780
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan.

219
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,950
Green Springs Rest Home?

220
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,870
[Both Laughing]

221
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,290
Go figure.

222
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,510
So Moses made 22 calls
to Pension Services

223
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,140
and that didn't stand out to you?

224
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,060
Unbelievable.

225
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,160
Hooray... ha...

226
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,330
Have Endercott intercept the girl
at the Hotel Capri.

227
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,250
Mike, change of plans.

228
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,460
She's just fine.

229
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
I can take you home.

230
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh.

231
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,550
I got to take you down to the
station first to get your statement.

232
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,560
Then there's a couple of federal guys
that are going to want to talk to you.

233
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,600
I got to say, I think you're
pretty amazing for breaking free

234
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,390
and keeping it together like you did.

235
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
That's impressive.

236
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,320
Um, I'm going to go back and get my purse...

237
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
Well, I can have somebody
bring it downtown for you.

238
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,280
- Get in the car!
- Ow!

239
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,530
Let me go! You're hurting me.

240
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,530
[Screaming]

241
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,030
[Endercott Grunts]

242
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,960
Am I going to die?

243
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,830
No. You just need some sleep.

244
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,580
I may vomit.

245
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,470
[SARAH]
Aww, that is just like "Loves
savage secret".

246
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,980
I am... high.

247
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
You have such beautiful green eyes.

248
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
[Woman Screaming]

249
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,050
Wow. You really are CIA.

250
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,850
Officer down.
Corner of North Peters and Conclese.

251
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,680
Suspect is a white male, 30s,
black suit and a tie,

252
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,310
driving a black Tahoe.

253
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,250
[Door Closes]

254
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,550
[Sirens Wailing]

255
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,650
[OFFICER] Freeze!
Put your weapon on the ground,
....Now!

256
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,440
Put your weapon on the ground now!

257
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,530
Get down, down right now!

258
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,830
[JOE] So you're saying
this was CIA sanctioned?

259
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,950
All right, Thelma, thanks.
I owe you one. Bye.

260
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,970
So it's like that, huh?

261
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,140
Yeah. It's like that.

262
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,280
Where are we?

263
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,290
Ho... How did we get to New York City?

264
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,960
Wow, I really hate you right now.

265
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,210
I...I was just hoping you'd be a little
more understanding of the situation.

266
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,260
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.
Or drugged.

267
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,680
I was hoping you'd have hair.

268
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,510
So it looks like none of our dreams
are coming true, at the moment.

269
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,970
I'm sorry about that.

270
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,060
Thanks for saving me. I guess.

271
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,480
No problem.

272
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,650
Not my best first date.

273
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,320
Not my worst, either.

274
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,990
Until we find out who's trying to kill us,
you're going to have to stay with me.

275
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,790
For how long?

276
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,870
I don't know.

277
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,040
Whoever's trying to kill us
also killed a New York Times reporter.

278
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
She used to live in Chinatown.

279
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,480
[FRANK] Okay. Here we go. Let's get in
here. Right here. Wait a second.

280
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,940
- You just hang onto this tape.
- Oh, no.

281
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,780
No, you said we were just going to talk to her.

282
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,570
We are. I know, this will help.

283
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
- The woman just lost her daughter.
- I know.

284
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,450
You can't just go around
duct taping everyone.

285
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,040
People are basically kind of decent.

286
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,620
That hasn't always been my experience.

287
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,630
Let me try and talk to her.

288
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,590
- What?
- Just let me, let me do it.

289
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,140
[MRS. CHAN] They told me to be patient.

290
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,140
The police have done nothing.

291
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,140
They said it was just a burglary,
but nothing was missing.

292
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,980
She was scared.

293
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,150
We're hoping we can do more.

294
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,950
You worked with my Stephanie?

295
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,870
She sent me this.

296
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,500
I got it in the mail on the day she died.

297
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,180
What does this mean?

298
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't know.

299
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,510
I tried dialing the numbers.

300
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,930
The Police have no idea.

301
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,690
Where did Stephanie go to college?

302
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,520
[SARAH] Why are we here again?

303
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,780
[FRANK] Those numbers
on Stephanie Chan's postcard

304
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,690
are actually a call number for a book.

305
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,360
Call numbers start with letters.

306
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,700
In the Library of Congress, yeah.

307
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,450
In Harvard Yenching, it's a 
classification for Asian literature.

308
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,000
How could you possibly know that?

309
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,120
[Speaking Mandarin]

310
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,380
You speak Chinese?

311
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,150
Unbelievable!

312
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,380
[FRANK] It's a hit list.

313
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
[SARAH] Hank Maestriano died 2 weeks ago.
Car crash.

314
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,580
Daniel McGinty. Heart attack. Last week.

315
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,120
[Whispering] But if this is a hit list,

316
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,540
why is this guy still alive? 
[Whispers] Gabriel Singer.

317
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,760
Flies cargo planes.

318
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,140
That's a good question.

319
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,930
[Buzzing]

320
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,610
Hell of a mess.

321
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,400
Come on ...

322
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,360
[Dialing]

323
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,040
Joe Matheson, please.

324
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,790
Hold on.

325
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Marna.

326
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,050
Hello?

327
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,650
What?

328
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Joe ...

329
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,760

[Cynthia's Secretary]
Sir... SIR!

331
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,340
Frank Moses was never a target analyst
He's never worked in the field.

332
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,800
This guy has a history.

333
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,860
[CYNTHIA] That's a file number.

334
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,780
You need to visit the back room.

335
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,320
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

336
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,960
I didn't even know this place existed.

337
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,880
It doesn't.

338
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,390
Ahh.

339
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,230
Frank Moses' file.

340
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
You got to be kidding me.

341
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,910
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black ops agent we've ever had.

342
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
He retired drug lords, terrorists.

343
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
hell he ..., he toppled governments.

344
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

345
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,050
Why was he retired?

346
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,430
He got old.

347
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,640
Then some thumb sucker came along
and tagged him "RED."

348
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,680
Red?

349
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,770
Yeah. RED. you know R..E..D
"Retired - Extremely Dangerous."

350
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah...

351
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

352
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,450
Thanks.

353
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm going to need a data haunt.

354
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,660
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

355
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,620
I want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition the whole goddamn ...

356
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,800
[FRANK] We have to find Marvin Boggs.
His name is on the list too.
354

357
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,220
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

358
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,220
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

359
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,970
Oh, can we have that one?

360
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,250
Wow. All we need is a banjo.

361
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,670
[Shushing] Shhh, shhh. 
[Whispers] Keep your voice down.

362
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't make any sudden moves.

363
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,010
Just stay close to me.

364
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,340
- Don't use your cell phone.
- You took my cell phone.

365
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,430
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

366
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,560
Seriously?

367
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,850
Why are you trying to kill me?

368
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,770
I'm not trying to kill you!

369
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,940
Oh, yeah. You are.

370
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,440
Why would I be trying to kill you?

371
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,070
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

372
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,360
That was a long time ago.

373
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,860
Some people hold on to things like that.

374
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,660
I'm not trying to kill you.

375
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,160
Okay?

376
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,370
So that makes us friends.

377
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,710
Right?

378
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Right.

379
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,880
Good.

380
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,460
You want to take that knife
out of my balls now?

381
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,800
Who is she?

382
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,470
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

383
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,890
Yeah... Hi.

384
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't stay in the open.

385
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Come on, I'll show you the house.

386
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,900
What's that?

387
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,070
Decoy.

388
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
He lives in a car?

389
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,080
Come on in.

390
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,590
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

391
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
So, Let's put it this way.

392
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,930
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

393
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,270
and I could feel their eyes on me.

394
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,070
Wet like peaches.

395
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,950
I have a list here...

396
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,070
It was written by a Herald reporter
who is now dead.

397
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,780
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

398
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,490
Well, almost everyone.

399
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,370
Frank, how many times have I told you?

400
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,630
You cannot trust the system!

401
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

402
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,760
Man, satellites, cell phones,

403
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

404
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,470
Marvin!

405
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,770
That list is the one we need help with.

406
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,310
Yeah, I got to check the files.

407
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,820
[FRANK] Of course you do. Thanks, man.

408
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,450
Wow.

409
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,490
[SARAH] This guy's insane.

410
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,750
[FRANK] Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

411
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,000
This'll take a minute.

412
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,460
Sure.

413
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,590
As it turns out,

414
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,010
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

415
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,350
- Well, in that case, he looks great. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

416
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,390
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

417
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,900
Five of the guys on this list
were there, not including us.

418
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,650
Uh, San Benito. Just outside.

419
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,150
Injun territory.

420
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,280
Yeah. It was a little village.
Uh, Everybody was killed civilians and ...

421
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,120
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up"...

422
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,990
"Make it look like it never happened."

423
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,750
You think everyone on this list was there?

424
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,500
Damn it.

425
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Damn it!

426
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,790
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

427
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,010
They're all trying to kill us?

428
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,550
Exactly!

429
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,550
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

430
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,640
Gabriel Singer.

431
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,010
Frank!

432
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,850
I never thought I'd say this again.

433
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,850
I am getting the pig!

434
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,360
Who's she talking to?

435
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,070
Just take it easy.

436
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,240
[MARVIN]
Frank, we got to get rid of this broad.

437
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,040
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

438
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,080
We're not getting rid of the broad.

439
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,040
I like her. Okay?

440
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,670
What's the angle?

441
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,960
No angle. I like her.

442
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,430
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

443
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,100
probably right now,

444
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,350
install the recognition software
and back trace it to Singer.

445
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,480
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

446
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
and we're fried with Y-rays.

447
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,270
How you doing?

448
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,280
Good, fine.

449
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,280
[Sounds Of Helicopter]

450
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,370
[Marvin Mumbles]
November niner 745.

451
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,000
Wow, Singer is going to be
in Mobile tomorrow.

452
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,790
But we can catch him at the 
airfreight terminal.

453
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,170
How about that?

454
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,100
[MAN ON PA.] The Sunset Limited
with service to New Orleans,

455
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,640
Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles
now boarding platform five.

456
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,060
It's the final boarding call
for the eastbound express...

457
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
[Screams]
Oh my God! Please don't...

458
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,160
No, please! No!

459
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,870
You smell like Washington.

460
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Who do you work for?

461
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,830
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Just take the money, Please, don't hurt me.

462
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,910
No, no. Who do you work for?

463
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,710
- What?
- Who do you work for?

464
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,750
Marvin! Whoa!

465
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,880
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

466
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,130
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm going to kill her now.

467
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,680
Wait a second, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please!

468
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,180
[FRANK]
Marvin, just wait, would you, please?

469
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,890
Marvin. Look. Marvin.

470
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,640
No camera in the bag.

471
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,520
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

472
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,940
Get a car.

473
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,700
Try not to kill anyone.

474
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,450
She was following us, Frank.

475
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,800
[FRANK] Sorry.
This is great.

476
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,720
"She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?"

477
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,810
Seriously?

478
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,600
See you in a minute.

479
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,740
Gabriel?

480
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,490
Right? Gabriel Singer?

481
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,200
What's this about?

482
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,040
Guatemala. 1981. San Benito.

483
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,200
I can't talk to you.

484
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,500
Pair beats ace.

485
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,260
I got one for you.

486
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,840
What did this twice decorated,
west Texas Jew boy Marine pilot...

487
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,140
say to the Chinese
New York Times reporter?

488
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,260
I give up.

489
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,310
Nothing. I didn't tell her a damn thing.

490
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,850
The reporter's dead now.

491
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,480
And everyone she spoke to is
either dead or a target.

492
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,860
And that includes you.

493
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh, Christ.

494
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,410
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

495
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,370
Hairy little airstrip in 
the middle of nowhere.

496
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,000
He was CIA, some dorky little
spook in a suit and tie.

497
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,250
Remember that guy?

498
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,040
- Black glasses.
- Yeah. He was giving the orders.

499
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,130
[GABRIEL] He picked up a package
and I flew him back out.

500
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,210
What was the package?

501
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,630
It wasn't a what.

502
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,880
It was a who.

503
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,090
Frank... Frank, FRANK!

504
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,800
It's that helicopter.

505
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,100
We're in an airport. So...

506
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,810
It's the same helicopter.

507
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,310
November Niner 748 Charlie.

508
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,230
November niner 748 Charlie.

509
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,780
See? Frank, November Niner 748...

510
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,910
[FRANK] Is that a 4?

511
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,320
This is a 4. Charlie.

512
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,450
Is that a 7? What is that?

513
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,080
[GABRIEL] I'll tell you what it is.

514
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,830
- [Gunshots]
- [Glass Shatters From Bullet Fired]

515
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,220
I told you she shouldn't
have made that phone call!

516
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,340
[Helicopter] We lost visual on target.

517
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,930
All right. Shake the tree.

518
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,260
- You'll pay for the breakage?
- Yeah, Roger that.

519
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,120
That's right, old man!

520
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,170
- Old man?
- No respect.

521
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,420
Can I kill her now?

522
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,060
She called me an old man.

523
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,020
Pig! Open the pig!

524
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,230
Okay, head down.

525
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,080
Grenade!

526
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,920
[MARVIN] Damn satellites!

527
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,300
Boop to that!

528
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,050
Yeah, you just stay right there.

529
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,220
This is going to be good.

530
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,860
[FRANK] You okay?
[MARVIN] Yeah.

531
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,120
Come on, come on. Hey. All right?

532
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,580
What are you doing?

533
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,200
Old man, my ass.

534
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,370
God damn it!

535
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,160
- Smoke and thermals. Obstructed view.

01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,070
Nuts.

899
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,030
Stop it. For the love of Christ, stop it!

Stop already!

901
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,660
Now you got something to say?

902
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,290
We extracted a young lieutenant

903
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,420
who is the son of the late Senator,

904
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,010
James Stanton.

905
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,340
Robert Stanton?

906
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,800
Vice President of the United States.

907
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,810
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

908
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,690
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.

909
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,810
And that New York Times reporter?

910
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,650
Did she pressure you?

911
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,230
Yeah. She called me. Twice.

912
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,400
So I called the V.P.

913
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:44,410
And what did you think
would happen then?

914
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,030
Oh, whatever.

915
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,200
I made him Vice President.

916
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,500
You kept your mouth shut
and the Stantons made you rich.

We have been working with

Okay.

922
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,220
I will pay whatever it costs

923
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,180
to get rid of this thing.

924

[JOE] We're not here for your money, home.

925
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,270
We're here because that New York Times
reporter had the list of names

926
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,690
of everybody who was in Guatemala.

927
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,980
And everybody on that list
has been ordered killed.

928
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,320
Except you.

929
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,610
I had nothing to do with that.

Don't you see?

931
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,790
He's trying to clean up his past
and get rid of me in one shot.

932
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,670
He's trying to cut me loose
before he runs for President.

01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,960
[Victoria On Walkie Talkie] We have some
major activity out here.

We're in position.

They're moving a team up the east side.

Are you going to let me talk to them?

Thanks, when we want your help,
we'll get out the drain cleaner.

those bastards out there
probably have orders to kill me, too.

I hope so.

943
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,260
Why? 'Cause I'm a bad guy?

01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:26,430
I'm scum?

945
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,090
Can I just shoot him now?

946
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,470
No.

947
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,140
You don't have people killed.

How's retirement, Frank?

954
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,660
It's been a real blast.

955
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,210
If we have to come in there and get you,
it's going to be messy.

956
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,090
You bet. Real messy.

957
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,090
I've got my orders, Frank.

958
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,010
They come from the Vice President.

959
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,970
He's ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he committed in Guatemala.

960
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,640
Well I find that hard to believe.

961
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,850
How did you know you'd find me here?

01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:16,270
Some anonymous untraceable tip?

Here's the deal, Frank.

You're going to walk out that front door
and give yourself up.

will shoot you.

I'll personally take you in and you will
get to tell your side of the story.

You got 60 seconds to decide.

We're running out of options.

Starting to come back to you now, is it?

1264
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,370
If you're looking for revenge...

1265
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,620
This is not about revenge.

1266
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:05,750

Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.
