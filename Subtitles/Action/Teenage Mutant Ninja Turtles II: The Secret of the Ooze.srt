you came into contact...

00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,375
with a green colloidal gel
down in a sewer...

905
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:57,545

918

Of course,

of the ooze was all just a big mistake?

of discarded chemicals...

was accidentally exposed
to a series of radiated waves...

926
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,868
and the resulting ooze, as you put it,
was found to have remarkable...

927
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:14,455
but dangerous mutanagenic properties.

when a mishap occurs.
