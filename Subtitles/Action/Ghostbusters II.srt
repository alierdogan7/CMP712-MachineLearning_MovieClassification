00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,620
Now, can you tell us
when it's gonna be, 

158
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,490
or do we have   
to buy the book?

159
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,059
Well, I predict          
that the world will end  
at the stroke of midnight

160
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,628
on New Year's Eve.

161
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,163
            This year?
Mmm-hmm.              

162
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,401
Well, that's cutting it      
a little bit close, isn't it?

163
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,269
I mean, just from a sales
point of view,           

164
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,071
your book is    
just coming out,

165
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,907
you're not gonna see
any paperback sales 
for at least a year.

166
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,342
It'll be at least
another year     

167
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,844
before you know   
whether you've got
that mini-series  

168
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,946
or movie of the week  
kind of possibilities.

169
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,814
I mean, just            
devil's advocate, Milty,

170
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,983
shouldn't you have said,

171
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,252
    "Hey, the world's  
    gonna end in 1992!"
Wait. Wait a minute.   

172
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,454
Or better yet, 1994?

173
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,491
This is not just        
some moneymaking scheme,
all right?              

174
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:51,798
I have a strong
psychic belief 

175
00:08:51,865 --> 00:09:00,607
that the world will end
on New Year's Eve.     

176
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,375
(SIGHS)

177
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,412
Well, for your sake,
I hope you're right.

178
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,681
Okay, but I think     
my other guest        
may disagree with you.

179
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,383
Elaine?

180
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,186
Now, you had         
another date in mind.

181
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,221
According to my source,

182
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,991
the end of the world    
will be on February 14th

183
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,394
in the year 2016.

184
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,830
Valentine's Day.

185
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,865
Bummer.

186
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,069
Where'd you get your date,
Elaine?                   

187
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,505
I received this information
from an alien.             

188
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
As I told my husband,

189
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,243
it was in               
the Paramus Holiday Inn.

190
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,647
I was having a drink
at the bar, alone,  

191
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,916
and this alien
approached me.

192
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,751
He started talking to me.

193
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,920
He bought me a drink,

194
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:51,124
and then I think  
he must have used 
some kind of a ray

195
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,992
or a mind-control device,

196
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,196
because he forced me      
to follow him to his room,

197
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,099
and that's where

198
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:05,605
he told me about     
the end of the world.

199
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:10,143
So, your alien had a room   
at the Holiday Inn, Paramus.

200
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,245
It might have been      
a room on the spacecraft

201
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,815
made up to look like      
a room at the Holiday Inn.

202
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,451
I can't be sure   
about that, Peter.

203
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,953
Of course not,

204
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,322
and that is      
the whole problem
with aliens,     

205
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,290
is you just can't
trust 'em.       

206
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,959
Occasionally,       
you meet a nice one.

207
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,161
Starman, ET.

208
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,698
But usually             
they turn out to be     
some kind of big lizard.

209
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,100
That's all the time      
we've got for this week  
on  <i>World of the Psychic.</i>

210
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,136
   (CAT MEOWS)      
Next week, though...

211
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,339
Give me, Ira. 
Hairless pets.

212
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,607
Weird.

213
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,743
Until then, this is 
Peter Venkman saying

214
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,379
<i>(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

215
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,716
see you then. Bye.

216
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,784
Norman, where do you
find these people?  

217
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,120
Weren't we supposed to have
the telekinetic guy        
who bends the spoons?      

218
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,223
He cancelled.               
This is the best we could do
with such short notice.     

219
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,092
Look, no respected psychic
will come on the show.    

220
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,260
They think     
you're a fraud.

221
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,128
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
  I am a fraud.    

222
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,531
Mr. Mayor?   
Lenny! Lenny!

223
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,666
Pete Venkman.       
     Can I help you?

224
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,434
Yeah, get        
your hand off me.

225
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,370
Thank you, I'm an old friend
of the mayor's,             

226
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,604
I wanted to say hello,
give him a kiss.      

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,940
I'm Jack Hardemeyer,      
I'm the mayor's assistant.

228
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,042
I know who you are,
Dr. Venkman, I just

229
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,711
(LAUGHS)                      
          don't see           
          any ghosts anywhere.

230
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,413
Well, that's why I wanted
to talk to his highness. 

231
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,682
See, we did a little job  
for the city a while back,

232
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,217
and we got stiffed
on the bill       

233
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,453
by some bureaucratic bookworm
like yourself.               

234
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,088
Look, you stay away
from the mayor.    

235
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,590
He's running           
for governor next fall,

236
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,458
and the last thing we need is
for him to be associated     

237
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,462
with two-bit frauds       
and publicity hounds      
like you and your friends.

238
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,298
You know, I'm a voter.

239
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:45,872
Aren't you supposed to lie
to me and kiss my butt?   

240
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,373
JANOSZ: All right, yes.

241
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,044
Now I want you 
to put the Vigo
in the arch,   

242
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,513
under the arch there.

243
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,748
Everything you're doing
is bad.                

244
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,384
I want you   
to know this.

245
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,454
You be careful there,
all right?           

246
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,425
No one listens to me.

247
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,827
Well, Dana,       
how are you doing?

248
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,896
How's this Bonington coming?

249
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,331
It's coming along fine.

250
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,366
This mixture you gave me
is working really well. 

251
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,737
Yes, well I make      
pretty good cocktails,
don't I?              

252
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,540
Yes, you're       
doing really quite
good work there.  

253
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,342
DANA: Thank you.              
              I think         
              it won't be long

254
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,112
before you can
assist me in  

255
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,781
more important
restoration.

a white thing.

             Janosz.

258
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,389
Janosz. Um,

259
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,358
I've enjoyed working here,

260
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,659
but now that my baby's
a little older,       

261
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,061
I'm gonna try to go back
to the orchestra.       

262
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,065
Oh, I'm sorry         
to hear that, that you
will not be not here. 

263
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,934
Well, could I
say goodbye, 

264
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,970
maybe bring you   
to a brunch today?

265
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,640
Well, I can't today,  
I have an appointment.

266
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,575
In fact, I better go. 
      I don't         
      understand this.

267
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,478
Every day, I say,
"Well, can you   
do something?"   

268
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,546
You say,      
"No, I can't  
do something."

269
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,782
Do I have a bad breath
or something?         

270
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,350
Of course not.

271
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:13,893
All right.      
Well, I give you
a rain check.   

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,862
I think that 
she likes me.

276
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,211
a flower cart           
took off by itself,     
rolled half a kilometer,

300 eyewitnesses.
 My best         
 to the coven.   

278
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,684
Berlin, huh?
You know,   

279
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,419
you should also check

280

on controlled psycho-kinesis.
  I pulled it.               

281
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,856
PETER: Uh, perhaps
you could help me.

282
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,959
I'm looking for      
a love potion aerosol

283
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,630
that I could spray
on a certain      
 <i>Penthouse</i>  pet   

284
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,333
  to obtain            
  her total submission.
Hello, Venkman.        

285
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,202
            Hi, Pete,      
            how's it going?
Very well. Hi, Egon.       

286
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,137
How's school?

287
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,207
Bet those science chicks     
really dig that large cranium
of yours, huh?               

288
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,343
I think                
they're more interested
in my epididymis.

(SCOFFS)

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,950
Ray, let's close        
this place up so you can
buy me a calzone.       

291
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,518
Oh, I can't really      
do that right now, Pete,

292
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,720
I'm working on something.

293
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,955
But your book came in.

<i>to Fortune and Power.</i>

295
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,692
Thank you.

296
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,128
Good luck          
with that, Venkman.

297
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,763
Will you put this      
on my account, please? 
                  Sure.

298
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,665

                     Oh, yeah.

working on?

 just kind of...

00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,037
I'm gonna be ready for it
this time.               

894
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,406
Mommy's gonna take 
her shirt off, too.

895
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:54,919
Yeah.

896
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:58,689
No!

897
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,126
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

898
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:06,397
     (BABY CRYING)   
DANA: Peter, it's me.
Please let us in.    

899
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:13,471
What the hell is this?

900
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,441
Peter, let us in, please!

901
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,143
I didn't know    
where else to go.

902
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,113
The most awful thing happened.

903
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,416
The bathtub...        
The bathtub was trying
to eat Oscar.         

904
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:26,884
(BABY CRYING)           
I was giving him a bath,

905
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,853
there was all this   
pink ooze everywhere,

906
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,055
and it was reaching for him.

907
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,924
       Okay, you're all right.
I'm not gonna let 'em         
get you.                      

908
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,093
All right,                
you're all safe now, okay?

909
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,862
         Everybody's fine now.
He's so terrified.            

910
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,265
             You guys sit down
             and relax, huh?  
Yes, darling, I'm so sorry.   

911
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,800
Come on, just sit down.

912
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:52,109
I'll get you guys    
a shirt or something.

913
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:56,280
Ray. Yeah,           
Dana's just come over
to my place.         

914
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,949
Well, actually,          
her tub tried to eat her.

915
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,819
RAY: What?      
Are you serious?

916
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:06,324
Well, that's great!     
I mean, that's terrible.

917
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,826
But it's great      
for what we would...

918
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:12,563
Yeah, I will.               
Sure, we'll get right on it.

919
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,966
Spengler.            
Major slime-related  
psycho-kinetic event.

920
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,569
      What happened?  
Something came        
out of Dana's bathtub.

921
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,905
Tried to grab                
her and the baby.            
          Are they all right?

922
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,374
Yeah, well,                
she got out of there       
and went over to Venkman's.

923
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,444
This is interesting, Ray.
Remember the painting    
Venkman mentioned?       

924
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,513
I ran the name             
Vigo the Carpathian through
the occult reference net.  

925
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,451
Look what came up.

926
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,853
Nice ugly history.

927
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,694
You think there's a connection
between this Vigo character   
and the...                    

928
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,496
Slime?

929
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:49,734
Is the atomic weight
of cobalt 58.9?     

930
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,369
Better get over     
to Dana's apartment.

931
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,104
I'd like to check out
that bathtub.        

932
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,906
It might be a good idea
to go to the museum    
in the morning,        

933
00:47:55,973 --> 00:48:00,010
get a look       
at that painting.

934
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,679
Ray's going to go    
on over to your place
and just take a look.

935
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:04,615
He is?              
               Okay.

936
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,852
I have been            
holding on to this     
for a long time, Oscar.

937
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,254
I got this 
from a girl

938
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:14,024
who got this                 
from Joe Willie Namath, okay?

939
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,559
We don't know how,  
we don't wanna know.

940
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,361
So I would appreciate it

941
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,797
if you would not     
hose this thing down,
you know?            

942
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:22,333
Give it your own
personal rinse? 
Thank you.      

943
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,834
It'd be an excellent time  
for you to start practicing

944
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,538
a thing we big guys       
like to call self control.

945
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,108
(LAUGHS)                    
            Get out of here.
            Oh, look at him.

946
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,378
Oh, look at his gut.
Oh, he's a coconut, 
this guy.           

947
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,347
Whoop!

948
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,717
You're going to be          
staying at Uncle Pete's     
until this thing blows over.

949
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,520
This is your place now.

950
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:51,295
(GRUNTING)

951
00:48:51,362 --> 00:49:00,171
Hi. Come on in,  
this is my place.

952
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,441
So, how are we gonna handle
the sleeping arrangements? 

953
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,476
Well, what's best
for me is        

954
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:08,646
if I lie on my side like this
and you spoon up beside me,  

955
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,214
your arm draped over me.

956
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,851
We do it the other way,

957
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,953
I get your hair     
caught in my throat,

958
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,955
and I choke  
in the night.

959
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:22,026
Well, how about you     
on the sofa and me      
and the baby in the bed?

960
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,396
It's a way to go.

961
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,499
It's so late.   
I really ought  
to put him down.

962
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,034
May I?

963
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,803
Yeah, if you want to.

964
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,540
You're short,      
your belly button  
sticks out too far,

965
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:50,087
and you're          
a terrible burden   
on your poor mother.

966
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,889
Find anything at Dana's?

967
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,592
Nah, nothing but mood slime
residue around the bathtub.

968
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,027
But I did get something
on that Vigo character 
you mentioned.         

969
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,797
Found it in Leon Zundinger's   
 <i>Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.</i>

970
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,699
  Dig that.         
Vigo the Carpathian,

971
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,301
born 1505, died 1610.

972
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,170
105 years old    
he hung in there,
didn't he?       

973
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,838
He didn't die      
of old age, either.

974
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,140
He was poisoned, stabbed,
shot, hung, stretched,   

975
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,476
disemboweled,       
drawn and quartered.

976
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,545
                 Ouch.      
WINSTON: I guess he wasn't  
too popular at the end, huh?

977
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,947
No, not exactly     
a man of the people.
Also known as       

978
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,683
Vigo the cruel,   
Vigo the torturer,
Vigo the despised,

979
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,486
and Vigo the unholy.          
               Wasn't he also 
               Vigo the butch?

980
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,121
And dig this.        
There was a prophecy.

981
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,090
Just before his head died,

982
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,993
his last words were, 
"Death is but a door,

983
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:37,768
"time is but a window.
I'll be back."        

984
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,571
Let's suck in the guts,      
guys, we're the Ghostbusters.

985
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,407
No! No,        
please go. You!

986
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,644
           Who's this wiggler?
He's yours, Ray.              
Sic him.                      

987
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,379
    I have discussed this
    with you...          
Hi, how are you?         

988
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,080
Ray Stantz            
from the Ghostbusters.

989
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,949
I tell you, and I told       
your friend.                 
 Beautiful art you have here.

990
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:55,152
 We're just doing             
 a routine spook check.       
Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.

991
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,788
   Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
So why are you came?          

992
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,090
Well, we got a report
there was a major    
creep in the area,   

993
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,159
we checked our list,
and you were        
right on the top.   

994
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,262
Johnny, where in the hell
are you from, anyway?    

995
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,164
The Upper West Side.

996
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,800
The whole room's     
extremely hot, Peter.

997
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,369
Ew, that's one
ugly dude.    

998
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,305
Well, that's Vigo.

999
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:18,008
Mr. Vigo, Veegs, would you  
look this way, please?      
         Please, no don't...

1000
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,443
No, no!                    
         Come on,          
         show me something!

1001
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,445
                   Mr. Vigo...
No photographs, please!       

1002
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:24,148
Slides are available 
in the gift shop, eh?

1003
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,117
(SHOUTS)                 
      Yeah, thanks.      
      Thank you, Winston.

1004
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,553
All right, I think...  
You know what?         
Give me angry, will ya?

1005
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,655
Will you give me angry,
you've had a bad day,  
you're cranky?         

1006
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,891
Yeah, thank you.
Good, good.     
Ooh, angrier.   

1007
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,260
Ooh, I'm scared.  
You're scaring me,
stop it.          

1008
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:39,330
Yeah, good! Okay,        
walk for me, talk for me.

1009
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,664
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1010
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,833
Okay, give me hot and sexy.

1011
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,569
Can you do it?   
You can. Oh, boy.

1012
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,004
Show me some teeth,
come on.           

1013
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,672
I bet the girls like ya, huh?

1014
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,008
Do the girls?
Do the guys? 

1015
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,944
Bet they both do.      
What about the animals?
They like ya?          

1016
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,447
That's it, more.       
Yeah, come on.         
You're big, you're big.

1017
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,450
All right, destroy me!
Destroy me now, yeah! 

1018
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,385
Destroy me!
Yeah! Yeah!

1019
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,387
                  Venkman...
Yeah, give it!              
Yeah! Yeah!                 

1020
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:07,358
We need to talk.
Come on.        

1021
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,393
I've worked with better.

1022
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,396
But not many.
Thank you.   

1023
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,531
John, thanks.

1024
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,434
Hey. Hey!               
                    Huh?

1025
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,069
Hey, you finished?

1026
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,938
Yeah, I'm     
finished here.

1027
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,374
Are you all right?           
                        What?

1028
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,242
I mean, you're not         
coming down with something?

1029
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:35,285
Me?

1030
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:44,962
Dana?       
Your prince.

1031
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,499
Oh, no.

1032
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,502
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

1033
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,637
She cleaned.

1034
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,140
Hi.              
              Hi.

1035
00:52:56,206 --> 00:53:01,645
Shh, he's asleep.
Come here.       

1036
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,180
So, what happened 
with my apartment?

1037
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:06,216
Well, the guys spent  
the whole night there.

1038
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,053
They went through   
all your things,    
your personal stuff.

1039
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,287
They tried on        
some of your clothes,

1040
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,322
made some                 
long-distance phone calls,

1041
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,624
cleaned out the fridge...

1042
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,226
Did they find anything?

1043
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,429
They found a little bit
of that pink slime.    

1044
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,964
Oh, God.

1045
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,866
Well, what am I    
supposed to do now?

1046
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,136
You are supposed to get
dressed and get crazy  

1047
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,006
      with me on the streets
      of Manhattan tonight. 
Peter, I don't think that...

1048
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,908
This is exactly
what you need. 

1049
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,177
I have got you
a baby-sitter.

1050
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,745
The whole thing's wired.

1051
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,947
Peter, I don't think       
we should go out on a date,
you know,                  

1052
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:40,884
and I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place     

1053
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,287
with a strange person.

1054
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,055
Strange person?

1055
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:49,226
Janine Melnitz
from my staff.

1056
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:52,996
Janine has experience
baby-sitting?        

1057
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,266
Here.

1058
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,402
Thank you.

1059
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,705
I've also           
brought some things 
from your apartment.

1060
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:05,242
Some wardrobe choices,
couple of provocative 
ensembles in here,    

1061
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,078
      I'll leave it up to you.
Okay. But after dinner,       

1062
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:11,815
don't put any of those        
old cheap moves on me, okay?  
                   No, no, no.

1063
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:17,821
               It's different.
I have all new cheap moves.   

1064
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,957
DANA: Hey, you!

1065
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,827
Hey, you!         
It looks like     
you're awake, huh?

1066
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,563
                 You're awake!
Yes, Osco.                    

1067
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,299
You're gonna             
have the whole place     
to yourself tonight, pal.

1068
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,101
It's gonna be
pretty neat. 

1069
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:35,005
I got some Laura Antonelli   
tapes if you wanna watch 'em.

1070
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:39,443
Dana, did you see some shirts
here in the floor-bed area?  

1071
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,712
Yeah, I put 'em
in the hamper. 

1072
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,815
I have a hamper?              
         It's in the bathroom.

1073
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,518
Neat.

1074
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,653
Will you tell me next time
you're gonna do that,     
though, please?           

1075
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,822
Well, I thought 
they were dirty.

1076
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,825
(CHUCKLES)                 
I have more than two grades
of laundry, okay?          

1077
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,426
There's not just
clean and dirty,

1078
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:02,099
there are many      
subtle levels, okay?

1079
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,034
You hang this outside     
the window for 20 minutes,

1080
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,470
it's perfectly fine.

1081
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:13,477
Interesting role model
for you, Oscar, huh?  

1082
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:18,949
Well, they couldn't get to you
until after the new year.     

1083
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,985
Well, just        
don't go in there.

1084
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:27,591
Louis, I'm closing up.

1085
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,861
I don't know,             
should I take the subway, 
or surface roads, or what?

1086
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:35,566
It's kind of busy out.        
            Well, I'm walking.
            Good night.       

1087
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:39,236
Well now, well, well,
well, hang on, now.  

1088
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,406
Do you maybe wanna...
Uh, no, no.          

1089
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:46,577
Do you wanna have        
something to eat with me?

1090
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,712
Yeah, I'd love that,
but I--I--I--I...   

1091
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:53,317
I told Dr. Venkman            
I'd baby-sit for him.         
                       Oh, oh.

1092
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:57,387
Do you want                   
to baby-sit with me?          
                Okay, I would.

1093
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,489
Great.            
His place at 8:00.
Bye.              

1094
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,159
His place at 8:00.         
All right. well, I can get 
his address from the W-2...

1095
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:05,896
(HONKING)           
    MAN: Hey, buddy,
    move it!        

1096
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:10,500
(HONKING)

1097
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,169
EGON:              
We were right, Ray.

1098
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,271
Multiplanar        
kirlian emanations.

1099
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,473
Yeah? Well, here's your   
next month's cover of  <i>GQ.</i>

1100
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,043
Check out the aura
on this sucker.   

1101
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,846
Now, there's definitely 
a living presence there.

1102
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,715
We should get 
a deeper look.

1103
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,251
Why don't I run        
this wider shot through
the spectronalyzer?    

1104
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:31,622
   Good, I'll try turning up
   the roentgens.           
Okay.                       

1105
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,790
So, what do you think?
Chinese?              

1106
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,158
How about Thai?

1107
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,861
No, too spicy.
Greek?        

1108
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,264
                Uh, Mexican?
Pizza.                      

1109
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:46,837
              Thin or thick?
Chicago.                    

1110
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:51,675
What the hell is that?

1111
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:55,512
I know what it is.

1112
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,348
I've seen it before.
             Where? 

1113
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:05,022
When you guys had me dangling 
like a worm on a hook         
100 feet below First Avenue...

1114
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,823
That's the river
of slime.       

1115
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,927
What the...

1116
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,596
Uh, Ray...

1117
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,898
We need a blanket      
or a hose or something!

1118
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,566
Let's get out.

1119
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,735
What the...    
This is closed!

1120
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,103
Winston!

1121
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,973
BOTH: Winston! Fire!

1122
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:43,393
RAY: What're we gonna do?   
Put our heads in the toilet?

1123
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:50,400
Taxi!

1124
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,601
Pete, it's great 
that you're here.

1125
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,637
We've got incredible news!

1126
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:56,106
Wait a minute.     
Can I have one try?

1127
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,709
All-you-can-eat   
barbecue rib night
at the Sizzler?   

1128
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,944
No, we analyzed the photos
you took of Vigo.         

1129
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,580
The spectrogram shows
a river of slime     
flowing behind him.  

1130
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,048
RAY: Just like    
I saw underground.

1131
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,516
Now we're going into       
the subway and sewer system

1132
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,118
to see if we can trace 
the source of the flow.

1133
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,820
Yeah, come on,      
change your clothes.
We'll wait for you. 

1134
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,322
Egon thinks there might even  
be a tremendous breeding surge

1135
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,790
in the cockroach population.

1136
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,693
Hi, boys. 
What's up?

1137
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,963
Hi.          
          Hi.

1138
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,700
Dana, the guys are going 
down into the sewer      
to check for slime stuff,

1139
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:27,971
and Egon thinks               
there may even be a huge surge
in cockroach breeding.        

1140
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:34,778
Wanna blow off   
this dinner thing
and go with them?

1141
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,615
Taxi!

1142

00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,234
I hate this.

1147
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,002
According to         
this old transit map,

1148
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,171
there should be      
an entrance anywhere 
along here somewhere.

1149
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,106
I'm not getting
anything yet.  

1150
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:07,377
Well, at least it's too dark
to see the cockroaches.     

1151
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:08,945
Forget about cockroaches.

1152
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,048
It's the subway rats     
you've gotta worry about.

1153
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,582
Big as beavers.

1154
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,584
Yeah, some of 'em     
go four or five kilos.

1155
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,520
Hey, hey!         
Enough, all right?

1156
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,923
Listen, you hear 'em,
behind the walls,    
scratching?          

1157
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,426
There must be    
thousands of 'em.

1158
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:27,898
Just shut up                  
about the rats.               
                   Okay, okay.

I thought that 
you might come.

You stay away   
from us, Janosz.
I mean it!

Don't worry.          
He will not be harmed!

of the spirit of Vigo!

1462

And you will be the mother
of the ruler of the world!

Doesn't that sound nice?

1464

No, it sounds
ludicrous.
