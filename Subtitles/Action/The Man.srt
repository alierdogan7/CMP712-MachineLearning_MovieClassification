00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,517
Man:
<i>Hello, Detroit.</i>

2
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:23,121
What a pleasure
to be here.

3
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,660
( Whirring )

4
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:34,232
Ladies and gentlemen,
we in the exciting field

5
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,300
of dental supply sales

6
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,536
are here in the motor city
for a reason...

7
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,106
To provide quality,
precision tools

8
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,108
to professionals

9
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,210
- who demand the very best.
- <i>( Applause )</i>

10
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,312
Thank you.

11
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:51,215
- <i>( Applause continuing )</i> -
Whoa-ho-ho, thank you very much.

12
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:53,018
Please be seated.

13
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,788
- Oh. ( Chuckles )
- <i>( Applause stops )</i>

14
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,057
I was just
going over my speech.

15
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,425
You've been going over
it for two weeks.

16
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:04,129
Honey, you know your speech.
I know your speech.

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,597
- The kids know it.
- It's a big one, Susan.

18
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:09,567
It's a speech for every sales rep
in the northeast United States.

19
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,402
It is a big one.

20
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:15,073
You've done very well
for yourself, Andy Fiddler.

21
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:20,879
Now get dressed.
Your plane leaves at 7:00.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,814
You know, Detroit's
quite a sports town, honey.

23
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,984
Maybe I'll bring you
back a piston.

24
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,954
Do me a favor,
just bring yourself back.

25
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,157
Detroit ain't Wisconsin.

26
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:37,361

<i>( police chatter over radio)</i>

52
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:17,395
60 ar-15s,

53
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:22,333
30 m-4s, 6,000 rounds
of 5-5-6 ammunition.

54
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,936
And three dozen m-16s, all
of it stolen from the vault.

55
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,605
In this building.

56
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:31,242
But that's not why I rolled you out
of bed at 5:00 A.M., agent vann.

57
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:34,045
<i>You wanna tell me how your
partner winds up a speed bump.</i>

58
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,747
On the 94 freeway?
I'll tell you how.

59
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:39,900
Your partner was
the inside man on the job.

60
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,069
Once they had the guns,
he became a loose end.

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,271
I'm gonna tell you
something else,

62
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:47,141
<i>something I've learned in 20
years with internal affairs...</i>

63
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:50,478
If a cop's dirty, nine times out
of 10, his partner's dirty too.

64
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,348
<i>Wouldn't surprise me if you
were the one who popped him.</i>

65
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:59,454
You got a bug up
your ass about me?

66
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,826
Well, let's get it out right
now, right here, you and me.

67
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,729
No, huh?

68
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,431
So step off,
stop wasting my time.

69
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,299
You don't seem too upset
about your partner.

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,803
You want to charge me with not being
upset, go right ahead. Be my guest.

71
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:18,606
Hell, I'll write a full confession
about how I don't give a shit.

72
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,076
If he was dirty,
he got what he deserved.

73
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,646
I'm not finished
with you.

74
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,716
Well, I'm finished with you,
and let me tell you

75
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,252
what I learned in all
my years on the job...

76
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:33,821
Don't trust anyone.

77
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,757
<i>That includes partners.</i>

78
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,993
And especially internal
affairs skid marks.

79
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,795
I'll be seeing you, vann.

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,902
I tried to keep
i.A. Off your back.

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,108
Booty. Mmm,
don't get into this.

82
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,610
I'm already into this.

83
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,479
You know those weapons will be
out of the city within 24 hours.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,883
- Yeah, well, you can't set up a buy in 24 hours.
- Watch me.

85
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,984
Vann, nothing stupid.

86
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:05,953
Yes, lieutenant.

87
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,297
Bye-bye, enjoy your stay.
Bye, hope you had a nice flight.

88
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:19,233
I had a wonderful flight, and I'm
wondering if you can do me a favor.

89
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,836
I was talking to one of the
stewardesses back there,

90
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:25,239
and we were discussing tongue scrapers.
I found one in my bag.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,241
I'm wondering if you
can pass this along.

92
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,343
- I'm a dental supply salesman.
- <i>Yes, I will.</i>

93
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:30,978
Sir, you might
have to step aside.

94
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,747
Just tell her it's
daily tongue scraping

95
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,549
and antibacterial
conditioning

96
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,651
which will assure her
the freshest breath.

97
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,600
See this right here?

98
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,537
This is a nickel-plated ladysmith
nine Mary-Mary chrome inlay. Go on,

99
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:00,107
- feel that.
- It's got a nice weight to it.

100
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:02,109
- Yeah, so do you, baby.
- What?

101
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,879
( Horn honks, tires screeching )

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,715
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, hold up... that's a cop car!

103
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,252
( Horn honking )

104
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,224
( Screaming )

105
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,562
Get your ass off
my car, Booty!

106
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:24,098
Come on!

107
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,134
Your ass is still
on my car, Booty!

108
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:33,407
Run faster, Booty! Pump those arms!
Get those knees up!

109
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:36,143
- Your form is all jacked up, dawg!
- What you want, man?

110
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:39,246
- I want to buy some guns!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

111
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:42,082
- I'm talking about a telephone pole.
- What?

112
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,319
( Screams, grunts )

113
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,802
Why do we have to
do this every time?

114
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,605
It's these repetitive ass-whippings
that cause guys like me

115
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:07,074
- to burn out on the job.
- Du... ah-ha... ah!

116
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,777
Somebody wiped out our vault last night.
Who was it?

117
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,747
- How the hell should I know?
- I'm gonna check the front of my car.

118
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,951
If it smells like ass, I'm gonna
beat you like a runaway slave.

119
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:18,686
- No no, all right, all right, all right.
- All right what?

120
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,956
- Maybe I heard something.
- Tell me what you heard.

121
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:24,291
Something about a lot of
merchandise in play. That's all.

122
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,294
Ooh. You know how
i can tell you're lying?

123
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,130
I can smell the bullshit
coming out of your mouth.

124
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,333
No, all right! Maybe i
know one of the guys, huh?

125
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:35,870
Well, hook me up.
Tell him you found a buyer.

126
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,672
Oh, man, he already got
a buyer. You're too late.

127
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,808
Tell him I'll double his price. I
can get 20 grand cash right now.

128
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:43,510
20 grand? Man, that'll only
get you a taste, dawg.

129
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:47,147
Taste is all I need.

130
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:50,851
Hook me up. <i>Now.</i>

131
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:53,821
<i>( Whistle blows )</i>

132
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,256
<i>( Turkish music playing )</i>

133
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,700
- $38.50.
- That was very nice drive in, Mr., uh...

134
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,902
- Is it bedwetter?
- <i>Bedwe-teer.</i>

135
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,605
I see you're from
Turkey, Mr. <i>budweeder.</i>

136
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,641
I've got $20, $40. There you go.
Keep the change.

137
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:17,645
- ( Humphs ) - I was in
Turkey recently, uh...

138
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,819
Santos,
what's cracking, dawg?

139
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,354
- Yo, I need 20 grand.
- Yeah, don't we all?

140
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:30,691
I need that in non-sequential
unmarked bills, and I'm in a hurry.

141
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,927
I'm not your
personal atm, man.

142
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,529
Come on, Santos. You know
you're gonna give it up,

143
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,101
- so cut the bullshit.
- Hey, I don't have that kind of cash down here right now.

144
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,038
Nuh-uh. See? You're lying. Now i
personally logged a million in cash

145
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,907
into that vault right over
there just last month

146
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,076
on a case we both know
hasn't gone to trial yet,

147
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:51,411
so you're still holding.

148
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,914
What happened
between us, Santos?

149
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,450
Where the love, dawg?

150
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:59,286
You realize it's my ass if
you come up short again.

151
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:01,722
It's just flash money. I'll
have it back this afternoon.

152
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,724
Come on, now go
and get that.

153
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,293
I'll have the paperwork done
by the time you get back.

154
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:10,531
All right, but I need that
money back here by 4:00.

155
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,066
You can trust me, man.

156
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,635
Come on now. I'm in a hurry.
Chop-chop.

157
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,671
( Claps )
Work that combination, baby.

158
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:25,546
Look, man, they'll give you a taste, then
they'll tell you where to bring the money.

159
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,782
They don't want the goods and
the cash in the same spot.

160
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,917
Booty, I do this
for a living.

161
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,553
Look, I don't know these guys.
They're from out of town.

162
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:35,489
What do you know, Booty?

163
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:41,962
This is the place, man. He'll
give you a gun and a phone now

164
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,165
and call you later
for the money.

165
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,200
Take the corner seat
at the counter

166
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,970
and be carrying a "usa today."
A "usa today," the newspaper.

167
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,573
Look, man, I did what you asked me to do.
I'm done with this.

168
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:56,711
You better hurry up, man. By this
time tomorrow, the guns will be gone.

169
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,888
- You want a taste?
- Pardon me?

170
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,158
- There's your taste.
- That's my taste?

171
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,593
( Phone beeps, clicks )

172
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,314
Wait for our call.

173
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,242
Hey!

174
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,717
- ( Screams )
- What?

175
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,685
He's got a gun.

176
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:15,055
No no, this is not... no
no no, it's not my gun.

177
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,225
It's the man that was sitting
here j... he just left.

178
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,427
Man: <i>Oh oh! He's got a gun, man!</i>

179
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,162
It's going back in the bag.
Back in the bag.

180
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,231
- Drop the gun!
- Ah!

181
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,399
- Drop the gun! Now!
- Yes.

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,468
- Yes, the gun's going down.
- Drop it!

183
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:31,005
The gun is going down.
Gun is down.

184
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,806
- Gun is down.
- Just shut up.

185
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,375
All right. Ah!

186
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:36,777
You picked the wrong day to
pull a stick-up, dickwad.

187
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,712
It's not my gun.
Some guy gave it to me.

188
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,748
- What guy?
- Some guy. He gave me a bag,

189
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,484
- and he said, "taste it. Taste it."
- He said what?

190
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,719
- Something about a taste.
- Tell me what he said,

191
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,122
<i>exactly</i> word for word
what he said.

192
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,858
He said, "that's your taste,"
but there was nothing to taste,

193
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,427
just a phone and a gun. Look,
i just went in for a cof...

194
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:56,464
- Oh shit. They think you're me.
- They think I'm black?

195
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,033
No, they don't think
you're... a.T.F.

196
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,901
You're coming with me.

197
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,970
What? I have done
nothing wrong!

198
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,415
- Well, Simon?
- It's coming.

199
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,419
All right, I got him.

200
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,222
<i>"Fiddler, Andy.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin."</i>

201
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,757
He's not federal, he's not
local, no law enforcement.

202
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:26,994
- No sheet. He's clean.
- Yeah, he's too clean.

203
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,730
- Screw him.
- No, wait a minute.

204
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:33,267
<i>"Istanbul, Turkey.
Customs.</i>

205
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:37,171
- "Trafficking."
- Turkey? He do any time?

206
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,508
- Interpol shows an outstanding warrant.
- He got away from the turks?

207
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,745
No shit. This guy's gotta be
smarter than he looks, huh?

208
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:48,182
Well, he can't be
any dumber than he looks.

209
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,585
So what's this guy
look like?

210
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:55,256
Well, he, uh...
He had very good teeth.

211
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,125
- What does he look like?
- He looks good. He looks good.

212
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,861
He had a very nice face,
very handsome face.

213
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,331
He was a very
attractive man.

214
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,199
N... not to me.

215
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,636
Uh, I mean, I am married
to a woman.

216
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:12,106
And even if I wasn't married, i
don't mean <i>that</i> kind of attractive.

217
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,776
- Personally, he was not attractive to me.
- Describe him to me.

218
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,712
Short hair.
Short hair

219
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,414
which made his head look
smaller than it actually is,

220
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:24,051
and I only mention that because I've
been told my head is somewhat large,

221
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,687
and when I looked over at his,
it's like... you know when you look

222
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,625
- through binoculars the wrong way, it-it-it looks...
- <i>( Cell phone ringing )</i>

That's you.
Answer it!

224
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:35,896
Hello.

225
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,565
- Turk.
- Just a moment, please.

226
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,334
- Can you believe this?
- He wants to talk to the turk.

227
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:41,869
- That's you.
- That's me?

228
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,004
- That's you.
- I'm the turk?

229
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,073
Look at you.

230
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,645
This is the turk.

231
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,514
Okay, listen, turk. When this
phone rings, you answer it.

232
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,849
- You understand?
- Yes, I answer it.

233
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,118
- You and you alone. Are we clear?
- Me and me alone, right.

234
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:01,121
Great. Now listen, you put
the package in the trash can

235
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:06,026
on the northwest corner of fort
and woodward in five minutes.

236
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:08,429
- Hello.
- So what did he say?

237
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,898
Something about
a package and a trash can.

238
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,201
Look, I have nothing to do with this.
I'm here for a convention.

239
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,203
I don't give a shit.

240
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,706
Now what trash can?

241
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:21,875
Fort and woodward.

242
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,577
Whoa!

243
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,697
Take this package,
put it in that trash can,

244
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,164
<i>and you can go.</i>

245
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,472
I should point out
to you, sir,

246
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,874
that I am taking
a mental picture of you

247
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,976
just in case there's...

248
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,312
Any... trouble.

249
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,260
Hey, you know what? Th-this...
This is not for you.

250
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:47,995
Who's it for?

251
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,163
Well, it's... it's,
uh, for somebody else.

252
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:53,601
- Who?
- Just someone. Someone you don't know.

253
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:57,805
- Try me.
- No, I'm not trying you. This is not garbage, okay?

254
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,807
This is business,

255
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:03,110
so just please
don't touch it.

256
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:05,279
All right,
give me the bag.

257
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,283
- <i>Give me the bag.</i>
- Oh, Jesus.

258
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,351
It's not your bag.
See what he's doing?

259
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,987
- He took my bag.
- Who is this guy?

260
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:17,057
- Andy: <i>This bag is mine!</i> It's not his.
- Damn!

261
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:20,628
Okay okay. What is
the matter with you?

262
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,731
- Just let me go. All right.
- Get up. Get up!

263
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,733
- Get in the car. Get in the car!
- I think we should...

264
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,469
We should look
for another can.

I ask you to do one thing
and you screw it up.

271
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,588
Yes, well, this was
not planned well.

272
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,623
No no, listen, turk.
You know what?

273
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:51,959
You just bring the package
to first and Bagley

274
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,027
and wait there.

275
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,666
So what did he say now?

276
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,601
Hey, get back here!

It was a training bullet.

Well, I'm bleeding, although you
might call it "training blood."

Here, use this.

Taco sauce?

Yes, it's a natural
antiseptic.

Sprinkle some of that on your ass
so you don't get an infection.

Yeah, well, I don't even wanna
know how you discovered that.

glove compartment and just

splash it on a salami sandwich and
then splash some on your behind?

- You wanna see my hands?

327
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:31,151
Here.

328
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:34,655
Federal agent.
Run my plates!

329
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:45,432
- The car is federal, sir. A.T.F.
- That's right.

330
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,501
Federal agent.

331
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:51,738
Federal prisoner.
Back in the car!

332
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:55,375
You are interfering
with a federal investigation.

333
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:58,111
Move your asses!

334
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,795
That was fun.

335
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,809
Give this to him
and walk away.

336
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:35,048
Hey. If you try
to run this time,

337
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,984
I'm gonna put a bullet in part
of the ass you really need.

338
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,874
Ooh-ooh! Oh!

339
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,354
So you like the merch?

340
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,759
- The merch?
- The merch.

341
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,060
Well, you know,
there are days

342
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,297
that I like it
and days that I don't.

343
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,133
It depends.
I'm on the fence.

344
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:31,438
- Do you like the merchandise, turk?
- Yes, I do...

345
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,306
Like the merchandise.

346
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:35,975
I, uh...
Thanks for asking.

347
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:38,478
So there's gonna be
20 grand in there, right?

348
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,014
In the bag.
Come on.

349
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:56,396
Good.

350
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,865
Good first step.
We'll be in touch.

351
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,401
And, uh,
one more thing, turk...

352
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,470
No more fruitcake
stuff, okay?

353
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:07,173
- Sure.
- Good. Goodbye.

354
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:09,309
( Tires screech )

355
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,244
( Grunts )

356
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,351
Get in the car.

357
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:20,821
- Why?
- I'm not done with you yet.

358
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:23,356
- You said I was done.
- I lied. I do that.

359
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:25,391
- Now get up. Get in the car.
- No.

360
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:28,094
Get up!

361
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,430
Hey... don't make me
chase you.

362
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,865
I'm tell...

363
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:33,767
- Hey!
- Stop!

364
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,234
- ( Horns honking )
- Stop! Help me!

365
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:36,937
- Hey!
- Help!

366
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,005
You're under arrest.
Hands on the car.

367
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,140
On the car!

368
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,211
Who the hell
is this guy?

369
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,546
Run that.

370
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:55,088
He's international.

371
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,091
- Ow!
- Watch your head.

372
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:11,371
Okay, that's it.
I am writing a letter.

373
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:15,609
- Number three.
- Number three.

374
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:20,313
Man: <i>Three, step forward.
Three, that's you.</i>

375
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,986
- That's him.
- You sure?

376
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,154
I'll never forget
that face.

377
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:30,557
- Carbone: <i>All right,</i> thank you. <i>You can go.</i>
- Excuse me.

378
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,259
I'd like to speak to
whoever's in charge, please.

379
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,962
All right, number three, stay.
The rest can go.

380
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:37,797
Thank you.

381
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,500
Boy, sometimes you
just have to speak up.

382
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:45,171
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, I am.

383
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:48,474
- Oh, boy, have I been waiting to talk to <i>you.</i>
- Really?

384
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:51,444
My name is Andy Fiddler.
I'm in dental supply sales,

385
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:54,014
and believe you me, I never
thought I'd be standing here

386
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,017
in a police station with a
bullet wound in the keister.

387
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,620
- Hmm.
- But I am extremely upset with this man here,

388
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:03,189
and I must confess with your
whole operation in general,

389
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,927
because quite frankly, I have
<i>nothing</i> to do with any of this.

390
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,962
Well, that's not what
it looks like, Mr. keister.

391
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,031
The weapon you used
in the diner,

392
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,700
stolen from a.T.F.'S vault...

393
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,702
The gun you're robbing
the cashier with.

394
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,771
Oh, no no no no.
No no, there's no robbing.

395
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:20,339
I'm not robbing, you see,
although I can certainly see

396
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,776
how you'd get
that impression.

397
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:27,313
We also got a red notice from
interpol when we ran your name.

398
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,883
There's an outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

399
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:33,519
- What?
- Istanbul, Turkey ring any bells?

400
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,657
Oh. Oh, yes.

401
00:24:37,658 --> 00:24:40,093
It does ring some bells,

402
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:43,663
and believe it or not, there is a
perfectly reasonable explanation

403
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:47,000
for that, and you will
find it very funny,

404
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,368
- 'cause it's quite a story.
- Tell it on the way.

405
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,172
- Place your left hand here.
- So I took the family to Europe

406
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:57,143
in the summer of '98, and one of
our stops was Istanbul in Turkey...

407
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:59,312
A must-see
if you've never been.

408
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:03,116
- Anyhoo, my wife has this thing about, uh...
- Yo, vann, phone call.

409
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:08,187
Persian rugs.
Okay, I'm not a complainer,

410
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,657
but that officer
was <i>very</i> abusive.

411
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:13,326
I mean, not only was
he physically violent,

412
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:16,596
but... but more disturbing to
me, he... he was just <i>rude.</i>

413
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:19,265
- Vann.
- Woman: <i>Your daughter</i> wants to know.

414
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,434
If you're coming
to her recital tonight.

415
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:24,337
Oh you know,
i can't.

416
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:26,740
Uh, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

417
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:31,544
Um, I gotta go. Would
you tell her for me?

418
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:34,881
You need to tell her.

419
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:37,651
<i>( Dial tone )</i>

420
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:42,388
So when we got back
to the hotel,

421
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,924
<i>we discovered the rug is
too big for the suitcase.</i>

422
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,926
So we decided to leave
the rug at the hotel

423
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:49,095
to be sent to us
when we got back home.

424
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:53,767
- Turn right.
- So we finally get home, but we never got the rug.

425
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:56,435
<i>Long story short, we get
a letter from the hotel.</i>

426
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:58,604
That said the rug had
been seized at <i>customs.</i>

427
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,007
Now <i>evidently</i>
this rug had been stolen.

428
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,810
It was a 1,000-year-old
prayer rug,

429
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:06,780
and... and it was stolen,
but how was I to know?

430
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:10,449
I didn't know, and I'm
the one that's out $230.

431
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,451
Yeah, it was
<i>all</i> very innocent,

432
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:15,922
- as I'm sure you can now understand.
- I see.

433
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:17,891
- Lock him up.
- What?

434
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:21,027
- Let's go. Let's go.
- What?

435
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:23,163
- Get him out of here!
- What? Wait a minute.

436
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,531
- Wait a minute! I have done nothing wrong!
- This way.

437
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:28,735
- Come on. Move it.
- I have... I... I...

438
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,437
I haven't...
I haven't done anything!

439
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:35,341
Yo, this is the number
to this phone.

440
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,376
I want you to put
a trace on it.

441
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:41,280
I want the owner and an address.
Call me when you got it.

442
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,216
Okay.

443
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:50,056
Lieu, you looking
for me?

444
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:52,525
Explain the Wisconsin kid.

445
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,560
I set up a buy
with the bad guys,

446
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:57,130
he got in the middle of it,
now they think he's me.

447
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:59,499
- So you're telling me the guns are still in play?
- Yeah.

448
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,601
- How do you know this isn't a setup?
- With this guy?

449
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:04,804
- Yeah, with this guy.
- Not with this guy.

450
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:09,009
- Okay, where is he?
- He's in holding, and he's gonna stay there.

451
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,945
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:21,388
Shit.
They ate him already.

453
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,061
Caucasian gentlemen.
Big glasses.

454
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:32,065
Oh yeah, didn't have the
heart to put him in there.

455
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:38,504
Ah-ah!

456
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:42,508
- Thank you.
- <i>( Buzzer )</i>

457
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:45,111
- Come on.
- So, am I free to go now?

458
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:47,981
Go? Oh, hell no. They're fixing
a shit sandwich upstairs,

459
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:49,983
and you're
the mayonnaise.

460
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,518
Possession of a stolen
weapon, armed robbery

461
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,456
and the turkish government wants to have a
little chat with you before we're done.

462
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:59,259
Okay, I want to talk
to an attorney.

463
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,561
I get one phone call, and i
want to call an attorney.

464
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,930
Let me lay your options
out for you here...

465
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:07,100
<i>You can come with me as a
suspect who's cooperating,</i>

466
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:11,371
<i>or</i> you can stay here
and get married tonight.

467
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:18,211
- So what's it gonna be?
- Okay, just so we're clear...

468
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:22,115
I am not <i>choosing</i>
to go with you.

469
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:26,086
I'm choosing not
to stay with them.

470
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,355
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

471
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,499
Man over radio:
<i>Lag escort, first-time session.</i>

472
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,900
Hang on.

473
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,476
This is one
screwed up crew.

474
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,313
All right, just so there's no
confusion, here's the deal...

475
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,315
You're in my world now,
not yours.

476
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,886
And in my world, your responsibilities
begin and end with me.

477
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,755
And what would those
responsibilities be?

478
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:04,790
Well, these guys think you
wanna buy guns from them.

479
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,792
I need you to meet 'em one
more time and set up a buy,

480
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:10,230
- so I can bust their ass.
- Okay, I am developing a slight phobia

481
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,999
about meeting these guys. The whole
meeting thing, quite frankly,

482
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,168
is getting irritating.
I have to be honest.

483
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,570
Look, I have done everything
you've asked me to do.

484
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:19,572
<i>Why can't I go?</i>

485
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:21,574
What does any of this
have to do with me?

486
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:24,511
Because every time these
guys meet somebody new,

487
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,247
they're on the lookout
for the man.

488
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,583
And <i>you</i> most certainly
do not look like the man.

489
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:34,187
Oh, I don't look
like the <i>man.</i>

490
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:37,524
Well, thank you, because that
clears up absolutely nothing.

491
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,659
Who... who is the man?

492
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,429
The heat, the pig,
the po-po, 5-0,

493
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,298
the undercover agent
that's gonna bust their ass.

494
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,368
You're such a white bread son of a
bitch, these assholes trust you.

495
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,003
Well, you know,
people do trust me.

496
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:54,340
- That's not a compliment, shit stain.
- Okay, you know what?

497
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,610
Why do you swear so much? Do you
think it makes you sound tougher

498
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,612
when you just swear
all the time?

499
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,482
- Fuck you.
- Okay, that's good. That's really good.

500
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:05,985
Really classy. You know, I could
go around all day saying,

501
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,354
"f-u. F this
and f that

502
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,656
and f-ing this,
you mother-f-er."

503
00:30:10,657 --> 00:30:14,927
But I don't because there has to
be some civility in the world.

504
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:20,567
Incidentally, there is a trick
you can use to curb that habit.

505
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,036
Every time you feel like saying the
"f" word, just go ahead and say it,

506
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:27,340
and then add,
"crying out loud."

507
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,009
Fuck crying out loud.

508
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,979
Fuck crying out loud.
Fuck crying out loud.

509
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,540
And before you know it, you're
saying, "oh, for crying out loud."

510
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:40,720
Andy:
Let's see here.

511
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:43,990
- Oh, boy. Well...
- Woman: You did make her a promise.

512
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,758
You always break
your promises to her.

513
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,027
You want your daughter growing up
like you, not trusting anybody?

514
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:50,563
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

515
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:54,834
- No, it's not.
- You promised her you'd be at her recital tonight.

516
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:56,802
Something came up.

517
00:30:56,803 --> 00:31:00,140
You know, my little girl's a ballerina
too, and she's exactly your age.

518
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,909
- Really?
- Yeah, I help her with her pirouettes all the time.

519
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,411
That's not
what this is about.

520
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:07,413
This is about
you not wanting to go

521
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:09,682
- because her stepdad's gonna be there.
- Oh.

522
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:12,118
Is he dancing
tonight, too?

523
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,020
Andy: <i>And with the right
feet positioning...</i>

524
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,890
There you go, okay. Well!
( Chuckles )

525
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:20,560
Yeah, that's good.

526
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,895
Daddy, can Andy come
with you tonight?

527
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:25,097
Um...

528
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:26,699
Look, honey...

529
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,936
Daddy can't come tonight.
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:34,740
But I promise I will be
there next time. I swear.

531
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,243
- I'm gonna make it up to you.
- <i>( Cell phone ringing )</i>

532
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:40,313
Oh, fuck...
Crying out loud.

533
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:43,049
<i>Hold on.</i>

534
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,018
Look, daddy's
gotta go, okay?

535
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,057
Go ahead.
Goodbye.

536
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,968
It was very nice
meeting you, Kate.

537
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:05,971
- You too.
- So what you got?

538
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:08,408
- The owner of that phone?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

539
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,077
- <i>It's Cortez.</i> Manny Cortez.
- Who?

540
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,379
- Katie.
- Thanks.

541
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:18,284
Come inside,
sweetheart.

542
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:20,253
Man:
<i>Hang on.</i>

543
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:25,191
Man ♪2: <i>Cortez's is back
elevator, second floor.</i>

544
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:30,129
Oh, shit.

545
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,798
- Don't get up.
- You scared me, man.

546
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,701
What are you still
doing here, Cortez?

547
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,770
You were supposed to meet us at the
warehouse over three hours ago.

548
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:41,674
Do you mind?
I'm, uh...

549
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,943
I'm in the middle
of something here.

550
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:46,011
I truly don't care.

551
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:49,815
Hey, look. There's too much
heat on those guns, all right?

552
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:52,685
I mean, you killed a cop.
That was not in the deal.

553
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,920
Yeah, well,
he became a problem.

554
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:58,124
Listen, we got
the merchandise.

555
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,126
You need
to pay us for it.

556
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:05,030
I'm out, all right? I cannot
do <i>shit</i> with those guns.

557
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:08,735
You know what, Cortez? That's your problem.
You got the money or not?

558
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,237
Find another buyer,
all right?

559
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:13,473
And you know what? I suggest
you get out of town

560
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,141
as quickly as possible.

561
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:19,279
Hey. Yo. Close the
door on your way out.

562
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,914
Sure.

563
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,719
- ( Gunshot )
- ( Cortez grunts )

564
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,790
- Well, I guess that just leaves the turk.
- I guess so.

565
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:37,330
Well, you've got
a very nice family.

566
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,366
You've just got a wonderful
daughter and a lovely wife.

567
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:44,270
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife, yes, well, she seems like a very nice person.

568
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:47,507
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so... so... so it just didn't work out, huh?

569
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,277
Well, whatever.

570
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,279
- Would you like to see my family?
- No!

571
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,214
Well, I would like
to see my family.

572
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,386
This is my oldest...
Hannah, she's 12.

573
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,055
I'm trying to get her interested
in the dental equipment game,

574
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:07,593
but I guess at that age, you
know, it's just not <i>cool</i> yet.

575
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,663
This is my little
ballerina right here.

576
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:16,902
And this is my wife Susan, holding
our newest addition... Emily.

577
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:19,605
Just turned two. Already
talking a mile a minute.

578
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:22,442
Just talk talk talk talk talk
talk talk talk talk talk

579
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:24,811
talk talk talk.
A regular little chatterbox.

580
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,780
- I wonder who she got that from.
- I think she got it from me.

581
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:30,249
- You think?
- Oh...

582
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:36,989
Well, I am, uh... I'm sorry
about your... situation.

583
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,958
What <i>situation</i>
would that be?

584
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,193
Well, you've got
people who love you,

585
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:44,129
and yet you seem like a
very sad and lonely man.

586
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,131
- I'm not lonely.
- Well, I think you're lonely.

587
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,501
- I'm not lonely.
- <i>Fine,</i> you're not lonely. You're alone.

588
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:51,170
Yes, I'm alone,
but I'm <i>not</i> lonely.

589
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,172
It's two different things.

590
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:57,243
Does the expression "no man
is an island" ring any bells?

591
00:34:57,244 --> 00:35:00,112
Does the expression "shut
your ass up" ring any bells?

592
00:35:15,996 --> 00:35:18,631
What now?

593
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,199
I have to go visit
a friend of mine.

594
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,535
- Can I go with you?
- No.

595
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,771
Oh, well, I would really
like to go with you.

596
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:28,274
Look, everybody in this
neighborhood knows my ride.

597
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,810
- Nobody messes with it.
- Okay.

598
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,600
- <i>%% big Booty bitches, well,</i>
i like to touch... %% - oh!

599
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,036
<i>%% like to Dutch, another
one bites the dust... %%</i>

600
00:35:57,037 --> 00:35:58,604
( music stops )

601
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:09,348
( Yelling ) Cortez.

602
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,855
Manny, where you at?

603
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:18,157
You hiding under
the bed again?

604
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:23,629
Woo! Manny.

605
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:38,410
- Man: <i>A.T.F.</i>
- Yeah, this is vann.

606
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:41,848
Would you send a bag wagon over
to Manny Cortez's place?

607
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,116
- <i>The gun dealer?</i>
- Yeah, he took the deluxe cruise.

608
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:46,151
Up shit's creek...

609
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:49,088
Compliments of
a .45 to the chest.

<i>( Engine revving )</i>

611

- No.

<i>( Tires screech, cars honking )</i>

614
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:28,561
Good afternoon.
Out of the car.

00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,666
- Oh! Oh! Oh-ah!
- Man: <i>Whoa! What are</i> you doing?

616
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:37,737
Ooh.

617
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:52,451
- Oh!
- Hey!

618
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:54,921
- This was not a good idea.
- <i>( Horn honking )</i>

00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,557
Oh boy! Oh!

620
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,562
Oh!

621
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,244
Oh!

622
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,321
Drives pretty good.

623

624

Man:
<i>You idiot! Moron!</i>

625
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:45,237
Well, you left the keys
in the ignition.

626
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,842
Not the smartest thing
to do for a policeman.

627
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,580
This would be a good time
for you to be quiet.

628
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,882
<i>I know that's nearly
impossible for you,</i>

629
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:59,919
but if I hear the sound
of your voice right now,

630
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,188
I can't be responsible
for my actions.

631
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:07,960
So this would be a very good
time for you to <i>shut up!</i>

632
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:24,610
I have
a small question.

633
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,102
I still have
a question,

634
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:52,437
- and I think I'm entitled...
- What?

635
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:55,875
- Do you have a plan?
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

636
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:58,778
<i>If</i> you fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

637
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:02,247
Just a little constructive
criticism, okay?

638
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:05,117
- That's how two people working together help ea...
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

639
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:08,721
We're not <i>working</i> together, so get
that thought out of your mind.

640
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:11,590
- <i>Nobody</i> said we were working together.
- Excuse me.

641
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,592
<i>You</i> dragged me
into this,

643
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:18,430
- so the sooner you start treating me like partner...
- Hey!

644
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,934
We are <i>not</i> partners. Ain't no way
in the world that can happen.

645
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,571
Well, what am i
then? Hmm?

646
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,472

My own personal bitch.

<i>I pulled you out
of lockup as an s.W.C.,</i>

which means "suspect
who's cooperating,"

651
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:43,155
which means
i own your ass,

652
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:46,525
which means when I pull
the strings, you dance.

653

Till then, you sit there,
keep your mouth shut

654

and don't say a word
like the puppet you are.

655
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:00,606
Man:
<i>Hey, yo, Booty.</i>

656
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,507
Hey, Booty,
what's up, man?

657
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,610
Let's go, come on.

658
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,447
- Pass the ball, yo.
- What up?

659
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,956
- Booty!
- ( Honking )

660
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:20,159
Oh damn, man!
Hey! Come on, man!

661
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,261
Ah! Ah... ah... hey!

662
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:24,230
( Screaming )

663
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,166
- <i>( Men laughing )</i> - Booty, we
never finished our conversation.

664
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,835
<i>Man, I told you
everything I know, man!</i>

665
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,104
( Screaming )

666
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:38,710
I will cheese-grate your
ass through this fence.

667
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:43,582
Oh, come on, dawg. Look, i
don't know no more! Wha... ah!

668
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,252
All right, all right, all right!
Shit, all right!

669
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,454
Would you get that phone
book over there for me?

670
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,127
- Who's this guy?
- Man, I don't know his name.

671
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:57,362
Look, would you get your car
out of my ass, please...

672
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:58,730
- Thank you.
- Dawg. Ow!

673
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,234
Now who are those guys you
hooked me up with? I need names.

674
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,603
Man, they gonna kill me, dawg!
They gonna kill my whole family!

675
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:06,338
- Names!
- Ow!

676
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,073
- Hey, just give him the name. Give him the name.
- Name!

677
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:10,342
- Look, I can't!
- Just... just let's have a name.

678
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:12,511
- Look, I can't! Ow!
- You know what? Make up a name!

679
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:15,181
- Give him something! Look, there's no name here.
- No, they'll kill me.

680
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,216
He doesn't have
the name, uh...

681
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,718
Look, all right, all right! Look, the
dude in the picture, his name is, uh...

682
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,621
- <i>Joey Trent, man.</i>
- Good, good name. That's a good name.

683
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,790
- <i>That's a good name.</i>
- No no no, that's... that's a real name!

684
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,026
- All right, keep talking.
- Look, I didn't know nothing about no cop getting killed.

685
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:28,460
Yeah, right.
Well, who's Joey's boss?

686
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,296
I don't know. Some
dude from out of town.

687
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,899
- Then give me an out of town name!
- I don't know his name, man!

688
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,135
- Oh, shit! Uhn!
- I'm out of it. I'm out of it.

689
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,037
Look, the dude's
named Kane!

690
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:40,739
The crew boss name is Kane, man.
Now that's all I know,

691
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,042
<i>other than he have
a bad rep.</i>

692
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:45,444
- Dawg, look, I swear on my moms on that.
- Who hooked you up with Joey?

693
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:48,413
Man, Cortez, dawg.

694
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:51,317
Ooh, not a good sign.
Cortez is dead.

695
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,719
- Man.
- <i>( Cell phone ringing )</i>

696
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,689
Excuse me. Hello.

697
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:02,494
Okay.
Well, that was him.

698
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:05,731
You lucked out, Holmes,

699
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:08,467
- but we will continue this conversation.
- Shut up, man.

700
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,836
- Oh, and, Booty...
- ( Screams )

701
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:13,572
Watch your ass.

702
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:19,178
Man, you broke
my gold tooth, dawg!

703
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:30,589
- Where we going?
- Uh, lucky's bar and grill in one hour.

704
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,927
- Is that all he said?
- No. No, there was something else.

705
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:37,096
- What did he say? What did he say?
- You're not gonna like it.

706
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,331
- You're gonna get mad.
- Tell me what he said.

707
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:41,533
- He wants me to bring money. A lot.
- How much? How much?

708
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:43,869
- Look, I'm just the messenger.
- How much money?

709
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,470
- Half a million dollars.
- What?

710
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:48,740
- I know. It was a heart thumper.
- Shit!

711
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,045
- Where we going?
- My atm.

712
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,820
- Yo, Santos.
- Thank god.

713
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:03,855
I need that
20 grand back.

714
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,991
I.A. Wants to look
at my books.

715
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:08,460
I need some more.

716
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:11,397
Are you out of your mind? You
think there's any way in hell

717
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,399
I'm gonna give you
another $20,000?

718
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,634
I need a half mil.

719
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,772
It's just show and tell. I'll
have it back in an hour.

720
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,243
Go away.

721
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,345
Santos, open up. I got
something to tell you.

722
00:44:26,346 --> 00:44:28,680
- What?
- Open up and I'll tell you.

723
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:31,250
What?

724
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,086
Look, here's the thing.

725
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:37,022
You give me the half mil, I bust
the bad guys and make this right.

726
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:39,058
<i>You don't, you lose
the 20 grand,</i>

727
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,060
<i>and you take a shit bath
for coming up short.</i>

728
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:44,029
At least this way, you do
what I ask, you got a shot.

729
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:48,334
Why you doing this
to me?

730
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:50,235
You trusted me.

731
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:52,071
<i>Come on.</i>

732
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,006
( Snaps fingers )

733
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:07,586
- I'm hungry.
- You'll live.

734
00:45:07,587 --> 00:45:09,688
No, no, no.
I... I... I'm really hungry.

735
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:12,691
- Come on, man.
- No, my blood sugar is low,

736
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:15,527
and I'm feeling faint.
I haven't eaten all day.

737
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:18,897
- I would like some food.
- Okay, I'll get you a burger.

738
00:45:18,898 --> 00:45:21,967
- I would rather have something else.
- It's a tasty burger.

739
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:23,735
Red meat...

740
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:26,805
Quite often
doesn't agree with me.

741
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:43,989
Am I gonna make it to my
speech tomorrow morning?

742
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,393
I don't know, man. That
ain't a priority to me.

743
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:50,296
You know what?

744
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:52,298
You're not
a very nice person.

745
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:55,634
You don't care about anyone,
you don't trust anyone.

746
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:57,836
Trust can
get you dead.

747
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,639
"Trust can
get you dead."

748
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,309
Well, there's not
one person

749
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,611
- in this world that you trust?
- Nope.

750
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:08,280
- Your mother?
- Oh, hell no.

751
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:12,084
How can you <i>not</i>
trust your mother?

752
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:14,253
- She could be playing me.
- How can a person

753
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:16,255
go through life
like that?

754
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:18,357
Hey, at least
I'm honest about it.

755
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,526
What, you trust
everybody you meet?

756
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,095
I give everybody the
benefit of the doubt, yes.

757
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:26,965
- And what happens when they screw you over?
- Who's gonna screw me over?

758
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:29,301
What, do you think people are just
waiting to screw people over?

759
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:31,737
You think the world
is one big screw over?

760
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:34,873
I couldn't live my life like that.
I never met anyone

761
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:36,942
I wasn't friends
with eventually.

762
00:46:36,943 --> 00:46:40,579
Well, I never met anyone whose
ass I didn't kick eventually.

763
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,649
Well, you must
be very proud.

764
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,552
Guns and shooting
and kicking ass.

765
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:50,522
You know, problems can be solved
without ever touching a gun.

766
00:46:50,523 --> 00:46:53,392
Situation: You're walking down
the street with your wife,

767
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,394
a guy comes up out of nowhere,
grabs you from behind,

768
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,796
puts a gun to your wife's head.
What do you do?

769
00:46:57,797 --> 00:47:00,799
- Bite him.
- Bite him?

770
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,969
Do you have any idea how
powerful the human <i>bite</i> is?

771
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,971
The masseter muscles
in the jaw

772
00:47:05,972 --> 00:47:08,206
can exert 600 lbs.
Of pressure per inch,

773
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:10,242
and I'm not even
discussing bacteria.

774
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,943
Masseter muscles?

775
00:47:11,944 --> 00:47:14,346
- It's Latin.
- It's bullshit.

776
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:19,485
Come on, finish this shit.
Let's go.

777
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,122
You can afford this,
right?

778
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:32,264
<i>( Stomach growls )</i>

779
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,199
You all right?

780
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,868
I told you I have
a problem with red meat.

781
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,109
You've gotta admit that was a
good burger, though, right?

782
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:43,275
<i>( Stomach growls )</i>

783
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:45,577
You sure
you're all right?

784
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:47,879
Yeah, it doesn't
last long.

785
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,649
( Farts )

786
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:57,389
( Sniffs )

787
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,293
Oh! Oh oh, damn!
Let the window down!

788
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:05,364
- Oh, it's just a little flatulence.
- Oh, "a little flatulence"?

789
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:08,434
An elephant could take a shit in the back
seat, and it wouldn't smell that bad.

790
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,502
Can we just
let it go?

791
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,676
- ( Farts )
- Oh oh!

792
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:20,912
Oh, man!

793
00:48:22,114 --> 00:48:24,450
Oh! ( Coughs )

794
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:28,854
Oh! ( Gasps )

795
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:39,331
All right,
let's do this.

796
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:55,080
This is real simple.

797
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:57,616
Show 'em the cash,
get a time and a place,

798
00:48:57,617 --> 00:49:00,085
and you're back at the hotel
giving your speech tomorrow.

799
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:04,122
Uh, quick question. Uh, you
can't just go in there

800
00:49:04,123 --> 00:49:07,025
and arrest him
because why?

801
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:10,195
I want his boss and the
guns in the same place

802
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:13,432
at the same time. That's what
this dance is all about.

803
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,567
Here, now go.

804
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:20,639
Remember, this is
strictly flash cash.

805
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,710
Show it to him, close
the bag, bring it back.

806
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,879
Now what if something
goes wrong?

807
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,881
- Nothing will go wrong.
- Yeah, but what if it does?

808
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,450
- Nothing will go wrong.
- Uh, yeah, but what if it does?

809
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:34,720
What if something goes wrong
and the deal doesn't happen?

810
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:39,124
- I'm gonna be doing this for the rest of my life!
- Nothing will go wrong.

811
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:45,130
Hey, remember...
Time and a place.

812
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:48,266
A time and a place.

813
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:53,672
- ( Farts )
- Oh! Son of a bitch!

814
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:16,027
Hello.

815
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,736
- Ah! Excuse me.
- Hey, just checking for a wire, mate.

816
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:27,873
- Okay.
- Oh, you're good.

817
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:31,877
- Well?
- Yes.

818
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,553
- Born lucky. Yeah, am I good?
- Okay.

819
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:45,591
Oh, I would think.
I would think. Okay.

820
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:48,360
Great.

821
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,264
Good.

822
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:55,901
Now...

823
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:58,203
All we need is
a time and a place,

824
00:50:58,204 --> 00:51:00,205
and we have
ourselves a deal.

825
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:03,742
And we have ourselves
a little problem.

826
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:05,377
What?

827
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,713
Nobody...
Nobody comes up

828
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:10,315
with half a million dollars
in cash in an hour.

829
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:12,818
So you tell me...
Who are you?

830
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,890
- I'm a businessman.
- <i>Businessman, right.</i>

831
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:21,092
And what kind of business
is that exactly?

832
00:51:21,093 --> 00:51:22,427
What business?

833
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:29,167
I provide quality
precision tools

834
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:32,103
to professionals
who demand the very best.

835
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:34,006
<i>Period.</i>

836
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,341
Now are we
gonna do business?

837
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,476
Look, turk.

838
00:51:38,477 --> 00:51:40,445
I need to speak
to my boss.

839
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:45,183
Well, why am I talking
to you, Joey?

840
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:46,952
How do you
know my name?

841
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:50,822
Because...
I know your name.

842
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:52,691
<i>I... I know names.</i>

843
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,295
Let's just say
i was born lucky, okay?

844
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:58,830
You're lucky, huh?

845
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:02,968
And another thing, from now
on I only talk to Kane.

846
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:06,304
Look, turk, you know, I... i
can't just go and tell Kane

847
00:52:06,305 --> 00:52:08,306
he should walk away from a
deal he already has in place

848
00:52:08,307 --> 00:52:10,341
just 'cause some guy
that he doesn't know

849
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:12,243
flashes some cash at me.
You understand?

850
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:16,648
Keep the money. I don't
care about the money.

851
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:19,417
You think I care about the money?
Don't care about it.

852
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:23,088
I can get money. Just consider
that a good faith deposit.

853
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:25,724
And you tell Kane there's a lot
more where <i>that</i> came from,

854
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,227
but only if he stops
wasting my time.

855
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:35,500
Oh, one more thing...

856
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:37,502
From now on...

857
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,938
I call you.

858
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:43,174
<i>- Comprende?
- Comprende.</i>

859
00:52:43,175 --> 00:52:46,244
Excuse me.

860
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,658
- Where's the money?
- I gave it to him.

861
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:03,495
I told him I'd call him with a time
and a place, and I walked out!

862
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:07,065
- You should have seen it!
- You gave a half million dollars in cash

863
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:10,702
- to some gun-running killers?
- Correct.

864
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:12,804
- God damn you! - <i>( Chattering</i>
over police radio )

865
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,174
Asshole!
Son of a bitch!

866
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:19,044
I've never seen anyone
that pissed off before.

867
00:53:19,045 --> 00:53:20,578
- Okay.
- God damn it!

868
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,915
You said nothing unexpected
would happen, and guess what...

869
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,951
Something unexpected
happened!

870
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,087
What's to stop them from
taking my money and running?!

871
00:53:29,088 --> 00:53:32,624
Because they know they'd be giving
up a lot more where that came from.

872
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:35,927
He was about to walk. I had
to change the game plan,

873
00:53:35,928 --> 00:53:40,265
- so I'm... I'm now calling the shots.
- Oh, so you in charge now?

874
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:42,400
- I am indeed.
- You the man!

875
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:44,369
Yes. I am the man.

876
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,972
Well, what are we
supposed to do now, <i>man?</i>

877
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,842
Well, I think we just
let them stew for awhile.

878
00:53:50,843 --> 00:53:52,744
You know what I mean?
And then we call them

879
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:55,080
- in, you know, a couple of hours.
- <i>Well, what do we do.</i>

880
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:56,882
In the meantime, <i>man?</i>

881
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:01,553
We go to your
daughter's recital.

882
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:04,455
<i>( Soft piano music playing )</i>

883
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:19,304
<i>( Woman gasps ) Oh no.</i>

884
00:54:46,331 --> 00:54:50,034
- Daddy!
- Hey, star. ( Grunting )

885
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,806
- I knew you'd come.
- ( Chuckles )

886
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:57,308
Thanks for reminding me
about tonight.

887
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:59,611
That's the first time

888
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:01,979
I've heard you say thank
you in a long time.

889
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,553
- I'm sorry. - "Thank
you" and "I'm sorry"?

890
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:11,623
- I think your new partner is a good influence.
- You have no idea.

891
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:14,125
- Andy, this is mark.
- How you doing?

892
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:16,327
- Nice to meet you.
- Vann.

893
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:18,029
Mark.

894
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,198
Well, we better go.

895
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,535
- Come on, Katie.
- Come on. Come on, baby.

896
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:25,470
( Grunts )

897
00:55:27,706 --> 00:55:30,041
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, honey.

898
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,811
- Can I say something?
- No.

899
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:35,346
I think you're still
in love with her.

900
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:37,649
And if you don't get
over this,

901
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,351
you may lose the other
woman in your life.

902
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,955
Just a thought.

903
00:55:47,993 --> 00:55:50,294
- You were so pretty.
- Well, Barney bunny

904
00:55:50,295 --> 00:55:53,331
should be in the bottom
dresser drawer, honey,

905
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:56,300
because that's his
very own bed. Oh.

906
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:59,103
Oh, good, sweetheart,
don't you feel better?

907
00:55:59,104 --> 00:56:02,173
Okay, honey,
is mommy there?

908
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:08,045
Hi, Susan. Oh, no no,
things are fine, yeah

909
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:10,482
yeah, convention's
going great great great.

910
00:56:10,483 --> 00:56:13,217
You know, I'm...
I'm the man.

911
00:56:13,218 --> 00:56:15,954
<i>( Chuckling ) Yes, I'm going
to be home tomorrow night,</i>

912
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,789
<i>so I'll, uh...
I'll see you then.</i>

913
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,792
I love you too, hon.

914
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:22,727
Bye.

915
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:26,531
Thanks.

916
00:56:26,532 --> 00:56:28,566
Why don't we go ahead
and do this thing

917
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,635
- so you can get back to your family?
- Really?

918
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,704
Just do this one thing,
and you're done.

919
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:35,640
Okay. Question:

920
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:38,710
<i>When you say "done," do you
mean "done" as in finished,</i>

921
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:42,714
as in no more,
nothing else, "done"?

922
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:47,351
- Make the call.
- ( Dials )

923
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:01,499
I've a question.

924
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,735
Um, isn't it normal

925
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,938
to have, uh... you know, some...
Some kind of backup, uh,

926
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:08,940
for a situation
like this?

927
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:12,977
- I didn't hear you call for any backup.
- That's right.

928
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:16,548
- Oh.
- Here we go.

929
00:57:21,587 --> 00:57:24,121
My hands are sweaty.

930
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:25,890
Just be the man.

931
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:37,969
Who's this?

932
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,172
Well, I came to meet
your associate.

933
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:44,842
- <i>This is my associate.</i>
- Well, you know what? He looks like a cop.

934
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:48,279
He does. He does
look like a cop,

935
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,848
but he is most
definitely not a cop,

936
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:53,051
so let's put that to bed
right here and now.

937
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,486
- So like I said, turk, who is he?
- Who is he?

938
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:59,490
He's, uh... my bitch.

939
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:01,225
Your bitch?

940
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:04,629
He's my own personal bitch.
Hey, bitch, come here.

941
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:09,734
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

942
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:12,804
I pull the strings,
and he dances.

943
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,839
Is that right?
You his bitch?

944
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,541
Why don't you
answer the man?

945
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,543
You can talk, bitch.

946
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:21,545
I want to hear
you say it.

947
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:24,115
Who's my bitch?

948
00:58:30,522 --> 00:58:33,157
- I am.
- I didn't hear that. Did you hear that?

949
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:36,293
- No.
- I couldn't hear anything. We can't hear.

950
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:38,663
( Emphatically )
Who's my bitch?

951
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:46,403
- I'm his bitch.
- Attaboy.

952
00:58:46,404 --> 00:58:50,708
All right,
well, get in... bitch.

953
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:52,844
Why don't you get
in the back, bitch?

954
00:58:54,246 --> 00:58:56,280
Crotch grabbing time?

955
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:59,283
- Yeah yeah, we'll take care of it. Get in.
- All right.

956
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,301
- Andy: <i>So where's your guy?</i>
- He's here.

957
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:21,039
- Where?
- You're looking at him, asshole.

958
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,208
I am Kane. Eh, you can
still call me Joey,

959
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:27,611
I answer to both. The real
question is... who are you?

960
00:59:27,612 --> 00:59:29,613
I'm the man
with the money.

961
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:32,650
Better yet, I'm the <i>only</i>
man with the money.

962
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,786
There's just one small
problem, moneyman.

963
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,555
- What's that?
- I think you're a cop.

964
00:59:37,556 --> 00:59:39,791
Oh. Yeah, I am.

965
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:43,061
- Huh.
- My name is vann. Wade was my partner.

966
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,663
<i>I've been tracking what he was
doing from the very beginning.</i>

967
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:48,733
Could have busted him,
you, your whole gang,

968
00:59:48,734 --> 00:59:50,768
<i>but I was waiting
for the right time.</i>

969
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:52,770
I want in.

970
00:59:52,771 --> 00:59:57,641
It's true.
He's a.T.F.

971
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:59,677
- So you knew about the heist, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

972
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:02,146
Think I don't know
what my partner's doing?

973
01:00:02,147 --> 01:00:04,916
How do I know you're not here to settle
the score for your dead partner?

974
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,585
Please. He played
in the rain, he got wet.

975
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:09,486
So you just wait for your
moment and this is it?

976
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:13,324
I can take the heat off you from the
inside and I can move the guns.

977
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:15,727
You know I got the money,
'cause my man here

978
01:00:15,728 --> 01:00:18,662
just gave you that half million
dollars like it wasn't nothing.

979
01:00:18,663 --> 01:00:21,065
You're not the only one
with connections, agent vann.

980
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:25,703
- I have a buyer.
- You <i>had</i> a buyer.

981
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:29,406
Manny Cortez. Unfortunately,
somebody put a .45 slug in him.

982
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:33,144
The same kinda bullet they
took out of my partner Wade.

983
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:35,379
Now, some people might
call that a coincidence,

984
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,882
but I don't believe
in coincidences. Do you?

985
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:39,383
Not really.

986
01:00:39,384 --> 01:00:41,352
See, I figured you'd
take my deal over Manny's

987
01:00:41,353 --> 01:00:42,920
because you're greedy.

988
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:44,989
But now I see you're
just plain desperate.

989
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,192
You're stuck with a truckload
of guns and no buyer.

990
01:00:48,193 --> 01:00:49,693
( Snickers )

991
01:00:49,694 --> 01:00:53,197
So what's it
gonna be, Joey... Kane?

992
01:00:53,198 --> 01:00:56,033
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you, agent vann?

993
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:05,276
We'll see.
Let's go.

994
01:01:05,277 --> 01:01:07,211
Enjoy your swim, ladies.

995
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:18,856
Tell me you didn't
pee in the pool.

996
01:01:24,696 --> 01:01:26,297
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

997
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:28,532
We gonna make
a deal with this cop?

998
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:30,534
Get in. Vin.

999
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,569
Go. Now.

1000
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,371
( Tires squeal )

1001
01:01:50,555 --> 01:01:52,924
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

1002
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:55,059
You can go back to the
world of dental supply.

1003
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,894
Oh, ho-ho yeah.

1004
01:01:56,895 --> 01:01:58,729
Yeah.

1005
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,898
Listen, if you want to
show up tomorrow, you know,

1006
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:03,767
- I can make it happen.
- No, I'm still in the middle of this thing.

1007
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:05,402
Oh, yeah yeah
yeah, well, sure.

1008
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:07,504
<i>Aw, just a thought.</i>

1009
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:11,608
It's been interesting.

1010
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,215
Yeah, well...

1011
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:25,656
Hey, maybe next time I'm
in town I'll look you up.

1012
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:29,727
Or not.
It doesn't, uh...

1013
01:02:29,728 --> 01:02:31,729
<i>D... boy.</i>

1014
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,232
I hate
these long goodbyes.

1015
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,933
<i>So, uh...</i>

1016
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:40,171
Well... see you later.

1017
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:42,974
- Yeah, you take it easy.
- Okay.

1018
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:04,695
Andy: <i>We in the exciting field
of dental supply sales.</i>

1019
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:08,032
Have been on the cutting edge
of technology and science

1020
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:10,968
for many years,
and especially today,

1021
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:13,404
be it porcelain veneers,

1022
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:15,472
be it dental implants

1023
01:03:15,473 --> 01:03:17,474
that are fast eliminating

1024
01:03:17,475 --> 01:03:19,510
the use of dentures
and Bridges

1025
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:21,578
in patients' mouths,

1026
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:24,448
be it the use
of carbamide peroxide

1027
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:27,118
in combination
with ultraviolet light

1028
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,486
<i>that has cut
teeth bleaching down.</i>

1029
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:33,424
To a one-hour-
one-time visit.

1030
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,128
Yes, we pledge

1031
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,564
another year of excellence
in the field.

1032
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,133
And finally, we are here...

1033
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:45,803
All: "To provide quality,
precision tools."

1034
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:49,507
To professionals who
demand the very best!"

1035
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:51,842
- Thank you!
- <i>( Applause )</i>

1036
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:53,777
Thank you!

1037
01:03:56,848 --> 01:03:58,616
Thank you!

1038
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,386
Thank you.

1039
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,690
Oh, you killed them!

1040
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:08,626
- You killed, Andy.
- You think? Yes!

1041
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:12,029
- Oh! Yes?
- Mr. Fiddler.

1042
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,964
Come with us.

1043
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:21,739
- Where are you taking me?
- Watch your head.

1044
01:04:31,116 --> 01:04:33,717
He said I was done.
Uh, what is going on?

1045
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:35,786
We're hoping you might
tell us, Mr. Fiddler.

1046
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:37,788
Look, I don't know who
you people think I am.

1047
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:40,224
We know exactly who you are.
What we don't know

1048
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:43,528
is how a guy like you
could go so wrong so fast.

1049
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,966
<i>Here you are meeting
a gunrunner from overseas.</i>

1050
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:50,034
<i>Name of Joey Trent.</i>

1051
01:04:50,035 --> 01:04:51,502
And here you are
doing the 411

1052
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:54,772
with Hector Babcock,
aka Booty,

1053
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:58,108
a gun dealer who we just found
in the trunk of his own car.

1054
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:59,843
<i>You've been running
with a rough crowd,</i>

1055
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:02,146
but you might be confused about
who the real bad guy is...

1056
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:04,282
Agent Derrick vann,
your new best friend.

1057
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:06,284
He's the one that put the
bullet through Booty's head.

1058
01:05:06,285 --> 01:05:08,352
( Gasps )
Oh, no.

1059
01:05:08,353 --> 01:05:09,820
- He wouldn't do that.
- No?

1060
01:05:09,821 --> 01:05:11,755
- No.
- Check out Manuel Cortez.

1061
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:15,660
<i>Another gun dealer
vann paid a visit to.</i>

1062
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,196
Last but not least,
his own partner,

1063
01:05:18,197 --> 01:05:21,365
<i>or ex-partner
i should say.</i>

1064
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:23,267
So you have
a dead a.T.F. Agent,

1065
01:05:23,268 --> 01:05:25,336
a dead snitch
and a dead gunrunner.

1066
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:27,071
The only connection?
Agent vann.

1067
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:29,940
Yeah, well, i-i...
I don't believe that.

1068
01:05:29,941 --> 01:05:31,742
<i>Why not? 'Cause he's
such a nice guy?</i>

1069
01:05:31,743 --> 01:05:34,345
Why do you think
he never called for backup?

1070
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:37,481
He didn't
want cops around.

1071
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,018
( Gasps ) I don't know anything.
I... I... -

1072
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:42,920
- that's bullshit!
- I don't know anything!

1073
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:44,689
That's bullshit! You're up
to your neck in it, pal.

1074
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,191
- What do you want from me?
- You're gonna wear a wire

1075
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,093
and get vann to admit
he was in on the heist

1076
01:05:49,094 --> 01:05:51,229
and he killed
his partner.

1077
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,831
- Oh, is that all?
- You don't have a choice.

1078
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:56,934
Really? What if I just
say "no, thank you"?

1079
01:05:56,935 --> 01:05:58,669
Then the U.S.
department of justice

1080
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,404
will take
a giant shit on you.

1081
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:02,340
H... how very pleasant.

1082
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,509
Believe me, Mr. Fiddler,
your best option

1083
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:07,945
is to go along with this
s.W.C., that's "suspect..."

1084
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:10,281
"Suspect who's cooperating."
I know, I've been that.

1085
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:12,216
It, uh, didn't
work out too well.

1086
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,986
Uh, let me get
this straight.

1087
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:18,789
You sprung him from holding,
gave him half a million dollars,

1088
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,524
<i>then you let him go?</i>

1089
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:22,092
The guy's a salesman
from out of town.

1090
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:24,462
Oh, really? You think
it was a coincidence

1091
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,096
that he showed up at
exactly the right place

1092
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:28,198
at exactly the right
time in the diner?

1093
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,935
I don't believe in coincidence. For all you
know, he could be an undercover I.A. Agent.

1094
01:06:31,936 --> 01:06:33,604
<i>Did you ever check
him for a wire?</i>

1095
01:06:33,605 --> 01:06:36,474
I didn't have to. The guy was
scared shitless half the time.

1096
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:39,677
I can't believe that you
of all people bought his story,

1097
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:41,178
Mr. i-don't-trust-nobody.

1098
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:43,180
<i>How'd you get
so stupid so fast?</i>

1099
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:44,715
Now they got you
tied to the heist,

1100
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:47,351
your partner's murder
and your snitch.

1101
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:49,587
Booty's dead.

1102
01:06:51,356 --> 01:06:53,357
Peters: <i>Remember, this
guy is a stone killer.</i>

1103
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:55,626
If he senses anything wrong,
he'll toe-tag your ass.

1104
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:58,028
I just need to
get a sound check.

1105
01:06:58,029 --> 01:07:00,230
- You want me to say something?
- Good, I got it.

1106
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,999
- Good, I got it.
- I got it.

1107
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,702
- I got it.
- Hey. Hey, I said I got it.

1108
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:06,704
I don't think
i can do this.

1109
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:08,906
Just do this one thing
for us and you're done.

1110
01:07:08,907 --> 01:07:12,009
Okay, you know what? You guys
have got to stop saying that.

1111
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,644
The guy helped
me set up a buy

1112
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,780
that's gonna go
down any time now.

1113
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,749
What I need from <i>you</i> is an
assault unit to back me up.

1114
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,251
Forget it. I want your badge and your gun.
You're on suspension.

1115
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:23,020
( Laughs )
Bullshit.

1116
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:25,122
Your badge
and your gun now!

1117
01:07:25,123 --> 01:07:28,025
- You're serious?
- I'm trying to protect you.

1118
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:31,261
We got a dead agent on our hands and
i can't account for one damn thing

1119
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:33,197
you've done for
the past 24 hours

1120
01:07:33,198 --> 01:07:35,966
except lose a lot of money and make
best friends with the I.A. Agent

1121
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:38,101
<i>who's gonna
bust your ass.</i>

1122
01:07:38,102 --> 01:07:40,404
And that look
does not scare me.

1123
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:43,541
I am one inch away.

1124
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,410
An inch too far, okay?
Gun and badge.

1125
01:07:57,188 --> 01:07:59,990
You're wrong.
The guy's at a convention

1126
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:01,726
right now, giving a speech.

1127
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:05,162
Really? Then who's
that standing behind you?

1128
01:08:12,103 --> 01:08:14,472
Guess who?

1129
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:17,241
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I knew you were gonna ask.

1130
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:19,943
I, uh, just
finished my speech,

1131
01:08:19,944 --> 01:08:22,079
and I had a little
time before my flight

1132
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,849
and thought I would just stop
by and see how you're doing.

1133
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,084
Chit-chat?

1134
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,787
- Is... is there someplace we can talk?
- <i>( Cell phone rings )</i>

1135
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:35,926
- Yeah?
- Kane: <i>Avenue a,</i> warehouse three, right now.

1136
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:37,828
<i>Don't forget the money.</i>

1137
01:08:39,264 --> 01:08:42,165
Why don't we, um,
talk in my car? Come on.

1138
01:08:44,302 --> 01:08:47,004
In the car?
We're going to the car.

1139
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,539
Over.

1140
01:08:54,312 --> 01:08:56,714
Pilot: Mission one, vehicle
leaving Michigan and first.

1141
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,982
Okay, I read you,
air support.

1142
01:08:58,983 --> 01:09:02,119
Stay above audible range
but <i>don't</i> lose them.

1143
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,054
Pilot:
<i>Uh, copy that.</i>

1144
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,090
So, where are we headed?

1145
