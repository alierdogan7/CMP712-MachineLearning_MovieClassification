( Chuckling )
You all signed on for a percentage.

177
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,980
But you never figured
l'd bring you this, did you ?

178
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:14,454
A ship abandoned
in international waters.

179
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,287
Maritime law says
she's a derelict.

180
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,955
All we have to do is tow her to safety,
slap a salvage lien on her,

181
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,434
and the Russian government has to pay us
10o/o of her value to get her back.

182
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,971
Richie, put a number
on her for me.

183
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,734
Well, let's see. There's
three parabolic satellite dishes.

184
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,003
One of them's
kind of fucked up.

185
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:40,037
Forty-two labs all primed with,
uh, state-of-the-art stuff.

186
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,675
Let's see. We're talking...

187
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,878
two hundred ?

188
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,187
- Three hundred million ?
- $300 million.

189
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,458
$300 million !
Ten percent of that is $30 million.

190
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,863
That's what's comin' our way.

191

if we play our cards right.

192
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,793
That's what, about 30 grand apiece ?

193
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:06,568
- Three hundred G's apiece.
- Three hundred G's !

194
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,269
That's at one percent ?

195

196
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,907

197

- What ?

- There's no such thing
as easy money, Squeaky.

206

l'll take that as a yes, Foster.

207
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,443
Baker, find the ship's generator.
We need power to the bridge.

208
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:52,044
See if you can get
the main engines running.
Squeaky, you go with him. Richie ?

209
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,816
Throw a line down to the tug.
We're gonna have to turn
this ship into the wind.

210
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,654

of this navigational equipment started ?

211

about maritime law.

213

lf there's anybody alive on this ship,
you can't claim her.

214
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,964
- Then let's not find anyone alive.
- What does that mean ?

215
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:13,004
Just that. l hope
we don't find anyone alive.

lt just doesn't add up. You know ?

219
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:32,822
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere,
dead in the water, crew vanished ?

220
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,762
- l mean, why would they abandon ship ?
- l don't know.

221
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:39,130
And another thing. Who the hell
do you think we can trust here ?

We're talkin' about an awful lot
of goddamn money, right ?

223

that we can trust is just
you and me, Stevie. That's it.

224

from the captain.

you couldn't pull a pin
out of his ass with a tractor.

what the hell Hiko is.

he just might be there for us.

( Woods )
What the hell is this all about ?

340
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:44,939
( Richie )
Bingo.

341
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:50,715
Put him up here.
Come on, Hiko.

342
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,719
- ( Groans )
- All right. Tighten that down.

343
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:55,551
( Hiko )
Yeah.

344
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,454
( Sniffs )

345
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:07,365
- All right. This is gonna hurt.
- lt's all right. Just get on with it.

346
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:10,563
( Gasps )

347
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:15,274
- You have a high pain threshold.
- Yeah, l usually do it myself.

348
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:19,035
No, really.

349
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:22,412
Hey, Hiko.
Some dry clothes.

350
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,884
- Yeah, thanks.
- ( Foster ) Oh, man.

351
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:28,149
All right. Here we go.

352
00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:31,386
Ah, come on, Richie.
lsn't that enough guns ? Damn.

353
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,485
Woods, let me tell you three things.
You can never be too rich,

354
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,360
too thin or too well-armed.

355
00:32:37,432 --> 00:32:39,593
- Yeah, let's go.
- ( Shotgun Cocking )

356
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,769
Oh, man.

357
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:48,068
Get the green bag.

358
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:51,009
( Groaning )
Green bag ? Oh, man.

359
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,845
Goddamn, l'm carrying too much.
l got a bad latissimus, Richie.

360
00:32:56,684 --> 00:33:00,313
l'm tellin' you, Richie. My back
isn't gonna let me do this anymore.

361
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:03,755
l can't deal with it.
l get hung up on everything.

362
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,418
l'm tellin' you,
l'm gonna get rid of some of this crap.

363
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,168
Hey, Woods,
what do you make of this ?

364
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,636
l have no idea.

365
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:28,976
Tactical short-range
surface-to-air.

366
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,018
( Chuckling )
This is beautiful, man.

367
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:33,246
Oh, l'm thrilled.
Can we go now ?

368
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:36,017
- ln a minute. Look around, man.
- Damn !

369
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:43,730
Hello, Mr. Cable.

370
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,669
- Hey, Woods. Look at this.
- What ?

371
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,604
lt looks like some kind
of ejection seat or escape vehicle.

372
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:00,270
Oh, launch buttons. Cool.

373
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,275
- Richie.
- Yeah.

374
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,286
Look at these doors, man.

375
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,620
That's an awful lot
of blood, Richie.

376
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:21,832
- Now can we go ?
- Yeah, yeah.

377
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:25,605
- ( Captain ) Oh, Foster.
- Yeah ?

378
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:27,664
What are you gonna do
with your three million ?

379
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:30,836
( Scoffs )
l don't have it yet.

380
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:33,574
What about you, Hiko ?

381
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:36,845
Uh, three million ?
Probably open a school.

382
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,443
A school ? For what ?

383
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,750
Uh, Kura Kaupapa.
lt would be choice.

384
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:45,224
- Lots of little kids
reading, writing, learning Maori.
- That's sweet.

385
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,262
Yeah, it's a dream thing.

386
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:52,698
- How about you, Baker ?
- Oh, l don't know.

387
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:57,204
Always loved the sea.
Probably buy an island.

388
00:34:57,271 --> 00:35:00,638
Oh, yeah ?
Does it have a beach ?

389
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,542
Beautiful white sand.
Hammock, sailboat.

390
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:07,103
- What about a house ?
- How about a villa ?

391
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:10,617
Thatched roof,
overlooking a lagoon.

392
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:12,152
( Foster )
lt sounds nice.

393
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,381
Yes, lovely.
When you two gettin' married ?

394
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:17,515
- Hey !
- ( Yelps ) Gee ! Take it easy, mate !

395
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:19,560
( Foster )
No, you take it easy, mate.

396
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:32,395
( Hiko )
Aah ! Get off my leg !

397
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:34,600
Geez !

398
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:54,959
ls she dead ?

399
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:00,257
- No.
- ( Gun Uncocks )

400
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:07,400
What's this shit, Richie ?

401
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:11,104
Somebody doesn't
like electricity, Woodsy.

402
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:13,113
Come on.

403
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:17,208
Well, it looks like somebody
tried to rewire the ship.

404
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,488
- You okay ?
- Yeah, l'm all right.

405
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:25,686
- ( Foster ) So that's done.
- ( Hiko ) What's all this weird stuff
in her bag ?

406
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:30,361
She's got videotapes,
cigarettes. What's this ? Hair spray ?

407
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:33,025
Hey, watch out ! Watch out, watch out !
Thermite grenades.

408
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:36,036
- What ?
- Thermite.

409
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:39,631
One of those things blows, burn a hole
right through the deck. Be careful.

410
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:43,507
- Be careful, really careful.
- What's she trying to do ?
Sink the ship ?

411
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:46,445
- Squeaky, talk to me.
- How does it feel ?

412
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,074
- lt's good. Thanks.
- Are you gonna be able to walk ?

413
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,641
Yeah. l-l'll be okay.

414
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,249
Squeak, que pasa, buddy ?

415
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:00,060
Where the hell are you, man ?

416
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:02,962
Shit.

417
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,032
Richie, Woods, come back.

418
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,261
( Richie )
Steve, this ship's got a missile rome.

419
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,304
( Steve )
l don't give a damn about any missiles !

420
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:13,067
l left Squeaky in the engine room
and he's not answering,
so get the hell down there.

421
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:17,578
- Yeah, yeah. We hear you.
- We've got a crew member up here
who just unloaded an Uzi on us,

422
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,806
- so you better watch your ass.
- Yeah, copy that.

423
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:25,044
- l'm goin' to the engine room.
- We'll see you on the bridge.

424
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,145
Steve ? Watch your back.

425
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,807
Hey, Woods, you comprehend
this Cyrillic crap ?

426
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:53,643
lt's like chicken scratches to me.

427
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:57,206
- ( Chittering Loudly )
- ( Woods )
Oh ! Richie, Richie, help me !

428
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,953
( Woods Yelling )

429
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,226
Here, Woods.

430
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:13,294
( Sniffs )
Oh !

431
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,665
That thing smells
like dog shit, Richie.

432
00:38:15,736 --> 00:38:17,727
Ugh ! What is it ?

433
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:21,535
lt's robotic, Woodsy.
High-tech robotics.

434
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:28,046
( Foster )
Where'd you learn how to sew ?

435
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:30,379
- ( Hiko ) My grandfather.
- Yeah ?

436
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,179
( Gasps )

437
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:38,219
lt's all right. lt's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

438
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:42,661
Power. Turn off the power.
Shut down the ship.

439
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,095
- You're all in danger.
- What's she going on about ?

440
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:47,258
l don't know.
l don't know.

441
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:55,832
Captain, please.

442
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,278
What's your name ?

443
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,414
What's happened on this ship ?
Where're the rest of your crew ?

444
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:09,614
- Dead.
- Dead ?

445
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,624
Good.

446
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:15,025
You must turn off the power.
lt needs power to move through the ship.

447
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,361
What... needs... power ?

448
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,726
- lt. From the MlR.
- The MlR space station ?

449
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,567
- Yes.
- She's a fruitcake.

450
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,972
- Come on, Captain.
- She's a nutter, which is perfect.

451
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,779
Hiko, come on !

452
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,807
( Panting )

453
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,051
- ( Clank )
- Drop it.

454
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,793
Drop it !

455
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:36,671
- lt's okay.
- You don't understand.

456
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:40,008
Look. l'm not gonna hurt you.

457
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:44,039
( Coughing, Panting )

458
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:48,110
My name's Kelly Foster.
l'm a navigator.

459
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:51,157
l'm Nadia.

460
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:53,852
Nadia Vinogradova,
Chief Science Officer.

461
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:59,125
Nadia, what happened ?
Where's your crew ?

462
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,264
l told you.
Dead or deserted.

463
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,169
Three hundred crew members are gone ?

464
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,969
What happened ?

465
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:12,910
Eight days ago, during a transmission
from the MlR space station,

466
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,447
something came onto the ship.

467
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,246
We thought our transmitters
and receivers were malfunctioning,
so we shut them down.

468
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:24,154
( Panting ) lt took control
of computers, scanned all information.

469
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,251
Language, encyclopedias,
medical data. lt was learning.

470
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:31,058
Learning what ?

471
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,065
( Whispering )
How to kill us.

472
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:39,165
My captain, Alexi, and me
were the last to survive.

473
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,401
We cut their cables,
smashed them--

474
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:44,603
Wait a minute.
You just said ''them.''

475
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:48,739
Before you said ''it.''
Who's ''them'' ?

476
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:52,307
Mm. Machine.
Uh, machines.

477
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,583
Machines. Ah.

478
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:01,360
- l'm telling you the truth.
- l-l know. l--

479
00:42:01,428 --> 00:42:03,521
- ( Captain ) Foster ?
- Yeah, l'm in here.

480
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:10,568
lt's okay. Nobody's going to hurt you.
lt's okay. lt's okay.

481
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,974
She's nuts.

482
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,203
But something scared
the hell out of her.

483
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:22,674
l say we get her
up to the bridge. Hiko.

484
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,410
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me the flashlight.

485
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:27,180
You're gonna be okay. lt's okay.
We're gonna get you something to eat.

486
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:31,088
Come on. Come on.
Watch your head. lt's okay.

487
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,294
- Are you okay ?
- Yes.

488
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:37,660
- Go !
- No ! ( Grunts )

489
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:42,358
- You got her ? Okay, go.

490
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,764
l'm not a threat !

491
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,772
l used to go turkey huntin',
you know, with my dad.

492
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:54,007
- lt beats the shit outta this, man.
- Shh.

493
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,014
- ( Machinery Whirring )
- You hear that ?

494
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:59,017
( Woods ) lt sounds like
somebody's working down there.

495
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,054
What-- uh--

496
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,350
Hey ! Anybody in here ?

497
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,659
( Woods )
Shh ! Quiet, man. Be quiet.

498
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,961
Stay down.
There might be somebody.

499
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:20,905
- ( Chittering )
- Hey, Woodsy, there's
another one of those things, man.

500
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,608
( Power Switch Turns Off )

501
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:31,611
- ( Robotics Stop Whirring )
- Let's go, man !

502
00:43:31,685 --> 00:43:33,619
- Shh.
- l'm outta here.

503
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:37,890
( Chittering )

504
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:45,631
Richie, Woods,
where the hell are you two ?

505
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:50,568
Hey, Steve, listen. There's
a machine shop down here with, uh,

506
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:55,233
- state-of-the-art robotics.
- l already told you twice
to get your asses to the engine room !

507
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:59,540
- You hear me ?
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:01,547
We're comin'.

509
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:16,057
( Robotics Whirring )

510
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,596
Come on, Woodsy.

511
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:38,250
l'm not--
l'm not comin'.

512
00:44:57,837 --> 00:44:59,896
Hey, little buddy.

513
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,874
- Richie, let's go.
- Hey, hey, Woodsy.
Did the other one bother you ?

514
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,009
Huh ? No, it didn't.

515
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:23,653
Richie.

516
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,891
Richie ?

517
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,125
( Squeaks Rapidly )

518
00:45:30,203 --> 00:45:32,194
- ( Shooting )
- Hey !

519
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:34,570
Goddamn, Richie !

520
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,836
( Screams )

521
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,804
l'm sick of this !

522
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:04,576
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is Richie.
There's another Russian down here.

523
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,619
The son of a bitch shot at us !
And Woods is hurt.

524
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,881
- So watch your ass. You copy ?
- Copy that. How is he ?

525
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:13,584
- ( Panting )
- Just tell him it's bad. Ow !

526
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,890
- Bad !
- He'll live,
but he ain't in a good mood, man.

527
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:20,329
Just get him to the damn engine room.
And no more sightseeing, all right ?

528
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,697
Yeah. Copy, copy, copy.
All right.

529
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:25,328
- ( Groans )
- Get up. Get up.

530
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:35,243
Squeaky ? Squeak ?

531
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:41,643
Holy shit. What the hell ?

532
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,881
Oh, my God.

533
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:46,823
Jesus Christ ! Squeak ?

534
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:51,622
( Pounding On Door )
Squeak ? Open up !

535
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:53,824
( Grunts, Yelps )

536
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:57,027
- Don't shoot ! lt's us !
- Where the hell have you two been ?

537
00:46:57,102 --> 00:46:59,036
Back from your holiday ?

538
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,576
- Jesus Christ. Woods, you're a mess.
- Thank you.

539
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:10,013
-You said a Russian did this ?
-No, a machine did that with a nail gun.

540
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:13,108
Yeah, that's right. You're not
gonna believe it till you see it.

541
00:47:13,185 --> 00:47:15,517
There's some really weird shit
goin' down on this ship, man.

542
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:18,489
- Weird ain't the word.
- l'm in need of some
proper medical attention.

543
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:21,890
- Shut the fuck up !
- l don't belong on this ship.

544
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:24,623
- Somebody just welded
the engine room door shut.
- lt's welded ?

545
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:27,222
- Squeaky's still missing.
- Weird.

546
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:29,790
( Sniffing )
R-Richie ?

547
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:34,306
( Sniffing )
Richie, it's that smell again.

548
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:42,071
- Squeak ?
- Hey, Squeaky !

549
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:44,911
- ( Speaking Russian )
- Squeak, man.
- ls that you ?

550
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:48,312
Shit !

551
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:58,557
- Go !
- That bastard shot at us !

552
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:09,700
You're all going to die.

553
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:11,936
You hear that, Foster ?

554
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,845
We're all going to die,
because there are aliens on this ship.

555
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:18,543
( Chuckles )
That's all the grounds l need.

556
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:24,919
One of my men is missing.
And l want some answers !

557
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:28,050
And no more
of this Twilight Zone stuff.

558
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:31,988
l don't know anything
about your man.

559
00:48:32,064 --> 00:48:36,467
Rubbish.
l'm gonna give you five seconds,

560
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:38,469
and then l'm gonna
blow your brains out.

561
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:41,938
- One--
- She couldn't possibly know
where Squeaky is.

562
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:47,240
- She was hiding in sick bay.
- She knows. She dropped
an anchor on my tug.

563
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:49,247
She fired at us. Two.

564
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:51,545
Captain !
Hiko, come on !

565
00:48:51,617 --> 00:48:55,053
- That anchor nearly killed me.
l'm not feeling too sympathetic.
- Me neither.

566
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,489
- Three.
- Shoot me. l don't care.
Just shut down the power to the ship.

567
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:04,087
( Gun Cocks )

568
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:07,064
Captain, she's not gonna
tell you what you wanna hear.

569
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,828
Hey, Captain. l'd like to hear
what she has to say about this.

570
00:49:10,903 --> 00:49:13,633
Up here on the chart table, Richie.

571
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,733
Fake bastard !

572
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,745
What the bloody hell is that ?

573
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:23,043
lt beats the hell out of us.

574
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,141
lt's Alexi, my captain.

575
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:29,654
Hell, whatever it is,
it tried to kill us.

576
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,224
Squeaky's still AWOL, and somebody
welded the engine room door shut.

577
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:39,764
We're not alone here.

578
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,766
She's got another friend down there.

579
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,927
Can someone explain
what the hell is goin' on ?

580
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:49,603
Finish your story, Nadia.

581
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,604
The energy that came
from the MlR...

582
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,616
infested all of the ship's
electrical systems.

583
00:49:58,684 --> 00:50:01,744
Mainframe computer,
the labs, the machine shops.

584
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,551
lt activated fire extinguishers.

585
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:07,956
Sixty-seven died
from halon gas poisoning.

586
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,291
Quarter of the crew.

587
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:15,265
lt cut us off from machine shops
and started building.

588
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:18,497
The little ones first--
the gatherers.

589
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,505
Yeah. We saw a whole room full of them.
That's what nailed Woods.

590
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:26,907
Then came something...
more dangerous.

591
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:31,612
Half man, half machine.

592
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:35,142
A biomechanism. Engineering
beyond our comprehensions.

593
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,453
The rest of the crew deserted,
taking their chances in the sea.

594
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:43,962
Only Alexi and me stayed,
cutting cables.

595
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,759
What does cutting cables
have to do with it ?

596
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,826
The machines are controlled by
the electrical energy in the computer.

597
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:56,636
lf we can cut their source
of power, they'll die.

598
00:50:56,709 --> 00:51:00,145
We cut these to get him here.
What the hell are you talking about ?

599
00:51:00,212 --> 00:51:04,273
What is this thing that's
inside the computer, huh ?

600
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,113
lt's a life-form
unlike anything we know.

601
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:10,553
Not cellular but electrical in nature.
Extremely intelligent.

602
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:12,783
You mean it's like
lightning that can think.

603
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:15,622
lt has no form, no shape,
but it's giving itself what it lacks.

604
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:18,963
lt's creating
a new life-form...

605
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:21,056
using parts of the ship and crew.

606
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:25,931
Blood is still pumping
through this brain.

607
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:27,938
There's been
no decomposition at all.

608
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:35,444
Yeah. Here, right here.
See ? There's...

609
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:39,314
some kind of coil or self-contained
power supply built right into it.

610
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,477
Amazing.

611
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:45,216
- This brain is still alive.
- ( Faint Electronic Whirring )

612
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,691
- ( Woods Yells )
- ( Richie ) Hello ?

613
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,094
Stop fucking around
with the damn thing, Richie !

614
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:54,098
( Chuckles Nervously )
l'm just looking at it, Steve.

615
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:57,158
( Faint Whirring Continues )

616
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:10,071
Alexi ?

617
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:22,090
( Shuddering, Crying )

618
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:26,393
Touch it again,
l'll cut your hands off.

619
00:52:26,465 --> 00:52:28,592
l can respect that.

620
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:32,000
( Sobbing )

621
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:35,198
lt's still Alexi.
lt's Alexi.

622
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:39,574
Rubbish ! You're listening
to a pile of Russian rubbish.

623
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:44,105
And l for one won't listen
to any more of it. There's no alien.

624
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:46,174
Something their government cooked up.

625
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:50,915
lt all went wrong, didn't it ?
You're afraid the rest of the world's
gonna find out about it.

626
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:54,750
Dr. lgor Fuckin' Frankenstein there.

627
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:03,353
Alexi was no medical experiment.

628
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:06,952
- He was my husband.
- Rubbish.

629
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:11,398
Could someone please come and take
a look at the nails in my shoulder ?

630
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:15,369
Woods, stop whining !

631
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:18,770
( Yelps )
Ow ! God ! Ow !

632
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:30,217
Oh, my God. Captain !

633
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:34,313
( Rumbling )

634
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,120
Brace yourselves !

635
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:58,037
We gotta turn her into the wind !

636
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:04,743
The steering doesn't answer.

637
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,916
We could steer the ship
from the engine room.

638
00:54:10,993 --> 00:54:13,689
-l thought you said the door was welded.
-We'll cut the damn door.

639
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:17,493
Right. Bring her.
l wanna keep her in my sight.

640
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:35,048
l gotta get off this ship.

641
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:55,002
- All clear ?
- Clear.

642
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:01,372
- ( Ship Shudders )
- Did you feel that ?

643
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:10,511
The ship's turning.

644
00:55:13,088 --> 00:55:16,546
We just turned 20 degrees into the wind.
The ship's steering itself.

645
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:21,688
- Ships don't steer themselves.
- She's altered her course.

646
00:55:23,732 --> 00:55:28,601
- Let's go. Come on.
- Engine room's one deck down.

647
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,503
- ( Clank )
- What the hell was that ?

648
00:55:31,573 --> 00:55:33,973
- ( Steve ) Could be Squeak.
- ( Woods ) l don't care who it is !

649
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,237
l said it could be Squeak !

650
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:39,747
Steve.

- ( Banging )
- ( Gasps )

653
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:50,625
- ( Banging Continues )
- Careful, Richie.
- Yeah.

654
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:53,752
lt's too weird, man.
You can't open that door.

655
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:56,696
- What is it, Steve ?
- l don't know. What you got, Richie ?

656
00:55:56,765 --> 00:56:01,134
- l don't know. lt could be Squeaky.
- Let me see. Let me see !

657
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:04,195
What the hell is that ?

658
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:08,767
- Open the door !
- Steve !
- Don't open the damn door !

659
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:22,785
( Steve )
Squeak ?

660
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:25,292
Steve.

- Out this side !
- ( Foster ) Go ! Go ! Go !

- ( Nadia ) Come on. This way !
- Steve.
