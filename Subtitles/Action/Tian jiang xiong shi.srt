Brother, stop fighting.

My Hun brothers, I come in peace!

22

What does this have to do with
the Silk Road Protection Squad?

23
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,248
Our mission has always been

24
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,751
to turn foes into friends

25
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,294
and to attain peace for all races.

26
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,671
Whatever our friends
on the Silk Road need,

27
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,924
it's our responsibility to help.

28
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,093
Survival of the fittest
is the only truth on the Silk Road.

You want to control all 36 nations here
with your pathetic little band?

We'll follow the code.

The Protection Squad
follows the laws of our country.

I didn't mean to remove your veil.

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,722
You dropped it yourself.

55
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,682
I know.

56
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,184
It was fate.

57
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,145
Actually, I'm here because...

58
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
Drink.

59
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,902
I'm ready.

60
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,995
I just wanted to return your veil.

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,705
I didn't see anything.

62
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,541
Nothing happened between us.

73

For the past few months,
I've been giving my wages

74
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
to my injured brothers.

75
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,070
I know.

76
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,697
You take such good care of your men.

77
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,199
We'll manage.

78
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,620
I know people laugh at you
for marrying a Huns man.

79
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,580
There you go again.

80
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,957
I love you because we're the same.

81
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,293
We believe in equality for all races.

82
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,837
You preach peace among
the different races on the Silk Road,

83
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,298
and I teach peace to children
from different tribes at school.

84
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,467
We're bound to succeed.

85
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
(knocks on door)

86
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,687
- Captain!
- Yin Po.

87
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,397
The Protection Squad is in trouble.

88

The Prefecture Chief's army

89
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,112
found four boxes of gold coins
outside the border.

90
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,454
There's a customs clearance
document inside.

91
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,580
Signed by who?

92
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,335
The Protection Squad.

93
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,016
Men: Captain.

94
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,064
Lieutenant.
What crime have we committed?

95
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,440
Why have you locked up my men?

96
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,444
The Protection Squad is under
the Prefecture Chief's jurisdiction.

97
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,655

98
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,156
Don't move!

99
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,375
This has nothing to do with them.

100
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,668
Take me.

101
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,213
By order of the Prefecture Chief,

102
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,301
Huo An and his Protection Squad
are under arrest for gold smuggling.

103
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,848
They will be sent to Wild Geese Gate
tomorrow morning to rebuild the city.

104
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,451
Man: What a crook.

105
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,412
Sending us to the border

106
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,456
so they can blame
the smuggled gold on us.

107
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,249
We've been exiled!

108
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,752
Wild Geese Gate is for prisoners
serving life sentences.

109
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,713
Once you go in, there's no way out.
This is so unfair.

110
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,090
What are you going to do about it?

111
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,800
Look, brothers.

112
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,554
We were once rescued by General Huo
from the Wild Geese Gate.

113
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,391
We should take this opportunity
to pay our respects to him.

114
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,977
Right.

115
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,005
- (shouts in Mandarin) Move!
- (chattering)

116
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,126

- Move! Next!

123
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,608
Captain, are you all right?

124
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,734
I'm fine.

125
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,278
Help them!

126
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,196
Help them.

127
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,990
It's all their fault! Get them!

128
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,074
Stop!

129
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,868
Come on! Fight!

130
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,996
What are you doing?

131
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,215
Stop!

Stop fighting!

135
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,445
(grunting)

136
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,240
Stop!

137
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,164
Guards: Stop!

138
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,458
Everyone stop fighting!

139
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,834
Get back to work!

140
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,794
Stop now!

141
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,671
Protection Squad, come here.

142
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,227
I don't care
about the Protection Squad.

143
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,146
This is the Wild Geese Gate.

144
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,569
Huo An,
under the Prefecture Chief's orders,

145
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,696
we have to finish rebuilding the city,

146
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,824
so you bunch of losers need to hurry up.

147
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,162
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

148
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,892
(dramatic music playing)

149
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,747
(in English) Legion!

150
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,332
We stop!

151
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,503
What do you think, General?

152
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,716
What is our current condition?

153
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,509
Close to 800 soldiers.

154
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,846
Three thousands bows
and crossbows altogether.

155
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,348
- Horses are thirsty and near exhaustion.
- Yes.

156
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,233
If we're gonna have a chance, we need
to take them as soon as possible.

157
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,997
Lucius. Lucius.

158
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,709
- Lucius.
- Yes, I'm here.

159
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,882
Falco says that
you are going to take the city.

160
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,970
Yes, but their captain is very weak,
and he doesn't look too bright,

161
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,139
so it won't take long.

162
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,557
Let's have a drink.

163
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll wait for your good news
when you return.

164
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,151
We're at a new city, place to rest.

165
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,333
(in Mandarin) Intruders.

166
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,222
Listen to me if you want to live.

167
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,936
This way.

168
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,360
(shouting)

169
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,821
Sound the drums!

170
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
(in English) Halt!

171
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:12,048
I'm Lucius, Commanding General
Black Eagle Corps, Roman Empire.

172
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,842
Huo An.

173
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,763
General, is there any way no fight?

174
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,974
No. Go there.

175
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,519
No.

176
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,920
(both grunting)

177
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,176
General Lucius is fighting
like a real demigod today.

178
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:42,138
I don't think there's a man alive that
could stand against our mighty general.

179
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,311
(both grunting)

180
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,312
(in Mandarin) Look!

181
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,396
Sandstorm!

182
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,273
(in English)
Look out! Sandstorm!

183
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,069
It's a sandstorm!

184
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,654
(whimpers)

185
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,259
General!

186
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,561
(in Mandarin)
Hey, listen to me.

00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:13,971
Forever brimming with glory

371
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:20,519
(Romans singing in Latin)
A land of beauty

372
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:25,190
Home of the courageous

373
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:30,487
Our eternal Rome

374
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:37,077
The might of enemy ships

375
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,250
Threatens us in vain

376
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:48,338
It is a hopeless quest

377
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:53,468
Turn away from deceit

378
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,140
And sweet delusions

379
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,939
For the trumpets of war

380
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:10,110
Will call our legions soon

381
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,782
And across the fatherland

382
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:22,706
A victory song will ring

383
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,962
And across the fatherland

384
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:34,009
Our song will resonate

385
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:38,347
A time of joy and pride

386
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:45,437
For eternal Rome

387
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,405
(man crying)

388
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,956
Lucius: I served under
Consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives.

389
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,667
He moved his troops
to the Parthian Empire,

390
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,669
formed an alliance with the Queen,

391
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,880
who is the sister of our Lady Crassus.

392
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:15,884
Consul Marcus's elder son, Tiberius,
is a vicious and treacherous man.

393
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:20,264
The Consul was planning on naming
his youngest son Publius

394
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,307
to be his heir and successor.

395
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,685
He entrusted me to keep the child alive.

396
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,975
The young lord started having
problems with his eyes.

397
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:32,276
The Parthian queen kindly sent medicine
to heal his vision.

398
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,363
Tiberius laced it with poison,

399
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,657
blinding his brother
so he could never become Consul.

400
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,076
He then killed his father.

401
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,536
I had no choice

402
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,789
but to take my soldiers and the child,

403
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,332
become a fugitive.

404
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,335
Until I reached the Wild Geese Gate...

405
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,798
I've been a man without a country,

406
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,092
marked for death.

407
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,432
The deputy I sent to the Parthian Empire

408
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,976
is meant to restore the peace treaty

409
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,395
and to prove Tiberius's
vicious intentions.

410
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,449
I'm orphan.

411
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,159
Hun raids.

412
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,703
My parents killed by enemy.

413
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,041
Me and my sister run away.

414
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,917
- (girl crying)
- And she cried.

415
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,961
I used my hand

416
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,505
cover her mouth.

417
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,641
She die.

418
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,401
General Huo save my life.

419
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,738
He said, "War destroy family.

420
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,033
"Only peace can save Silk Road."

421
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,745
We are same.

422
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,123
Soldier: General!

423
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,507
Dessamiss has returned.

424
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,029
Ah!

425
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:42,781
(grunting)

426
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,227
- We will meet him.
- Black Eagles: Yes, General!

427
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,605
- Lucius, no.
- Huo An.

428
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,484
If you stand with us,
you will be butchered.

429
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,988
The city we built is a dream.

430
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,739
It only lasts 15 days.

431
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,161
I cannot be further in your debt.

432
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:33,206
Think, if Tiberius want to catch you,

433
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,459
why he need 100,000 men?

434
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,378
He can take over the entire Silk Road,
even China.

435
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:42,174
I think Tiberius working with the Chief.

436
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,342
It's our duty to protect Silk Road.

437
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,137
I can borrow a soldier
from my friend Yin Po.

438
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,055
Hopefully, we can stop them.

439
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,603
Hya!

440
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,315
Hya, Hya!

441
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,108
Publius: Captain Huo?

442
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,780
Falco?

443
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,324
Young Master.

444
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,331
On behalf of the Roman Empire,

445
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,836
I commission you

524
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,977
Welcome home.

525
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,647
So nice to have you
hanging around again.

526
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,364
Everyone in Rome,

527
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,241
including my father,

528
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,287
thought you were the finest warrior
in the Empire.

529
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,998
(chuckles)

530
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,416
No, no.

531
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,628
I think of you more as a chess piece.

532
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,172
Think about it, Lucius.

533
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,926
If I hadn't purposely let you escape...

534
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,302
Purposely.

535
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,431
Do you really think you and Publius
would get this far?

536
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,976
Who could blame me for pursuing you?

537
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,896
I mean,

538
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:27,276
thank you for the perfect excuse
to bring my troops here.

539
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:33,116
I had already plotted this
with Huo's subordinate, Yin Po.

540
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,748
Yin Po gave me
the customs clearance document

541
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,667
and the Commander's seal.

542
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,588
As soon as my army settles in
at the borders,

543
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,133
the entire Silk Road region

544
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,262
belongs to the Roman Empire.

545
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:56,973
Spare the child.

546
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,852
He's no further threat
to your ambitions.

547
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,146
Show mercy.

548
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,112
Let me tell you.

549
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:14,907
No one felt the pain

550
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,702
more than I did

551
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,913
when I had to blind my own brother.

552
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,624
I beg of you.

553
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,834
Spare him.

554
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,294

His crime...
His crime...

557
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,305
is that he took the place in your heart
that belonged to me.

this was never our business to start
with. Why should we get involved?

Captain Huo!
We are not as heroic as you are.

599

How do you expect us
to protect this place

600

when we can't even protect ourselves?

601
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,572
The Romans are right.
We all have families.

602
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,741
This way we can just take the gold
and go home.

603
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,745
Huo An, if you don't give yourself up,
we'll all die because of you.

604
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,205
We've been slaves all our lives.

605
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,792

to make our own decision.

Huo An,
are these people

609
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,071
worth it?

610
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,948
We should leave.

611
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,826
They need me now more than ever.

612
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,793
General Huo once said,

613
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,588
"A person who only laments the past
is a coward,

614
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,674
"whereas a person who can
change the future is a true hero."

615
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,677
Nonetheless, I have to admit

616
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,847
that the fate of the Silk Road can't be
changed by the Protection Squad alone.

617
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,517
Still, I'm truly thankful.

01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,903
that harmony between the races
can be achieved.

622
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,243
During that precious time,
it felt as though

623
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,787
we were giving birth
to a newborn child of hope.

624

But his life

625
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,752
has been cut so short

626
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,424
that I won't have the chance
to see him grow up.

627
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,646
My brothers on the Silk Road,

628
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,941

with the truth.

If I can satisfy you by giving my life,

631
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,996
I will die with no regrets.

632
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,293

Please raise the flags
that we made together.

Raise them for me,

at our child.
