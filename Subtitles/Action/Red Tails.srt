863
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,574
to the last minute,
to the last man, we fight!

864
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,304
- [ALL]: We fight!
- We fight! We fight! We fight! We fight!

865
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,450
Anybody got eyes on the bombers?

866
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,146
Uh...

867
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:34,450
we are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.

868
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:38,886
Right on target, and according
to my reckoning, 32 seconds early.

869
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,519
We're here. They're not.

870
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:43,061
Maybe the bombers turned back.

871
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,261
Damn! Maybe they went on without us.

872
01:05:47,996 --> 01:05:49,472
Red One, there they are.

873
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,335
Nine o'clock low.

874
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,945
Junior, head on over to the bomber leader.

875
01:05:58,139 --> 01:05:59,515
Let him know We Te friendlies.

876
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:00,948
Roger that.

877
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:07,621
Bogies! Three high.

878
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,021
[CAPTAIN]:
Everybody, an your guns.

879
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:12,592
Counting' close to 70 chicks,
We got one coming down,

880
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:18,434
Hold your fire. They're ours.

881
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,396
Red tails? I don't recognize the markings.

882
01:06:22,196 --> 01:06:23,674
He's colored.

883
01:06:23,764 --> 01:06:25,069
[CAPTAIN]: Yeah, right.

884
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,134
Hell if I'm joking! Look.

885
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:32,184
[CAPTAIN]: Jesus Christ.
They can't all be colored.

886
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,944
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!

887
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,823
What the hell do we do?

888
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,056
Tacoma One to all planes.
Everybody's eyes open.

889
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:45,251
I don't think our fighter escort
is ganna be much help this trip.

890
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:54,059
(IN GERMAN)

891
01:06:54,127 --> 01:06:56,698
Flying Fortresses! At least a hundred!

892
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,935
Decoy Squadron, move in
and draw off those fighters.

893
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,779
Fighters, four o'clock.

894
01:07:10,642 --> 01:07:12,281
[EASY]: They're not attacking.
Let them go.

895
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:13,414
Let them go?

896
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,651
Our orders are to stay with the bombers.

897
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:18,593
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.

898
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:22,526
You heard Colonel Bullard.
Forget the prize, save the lives.

899
01:07:22,825 --> 01:07:24,996
God, I hate this war.

900
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:30,069
[LEAD BOMBER]: Look at that.
Those Red Tails are staying put.

901
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,639
[CAPTAIN]: They're giving up glory
to save our asses.

902
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:34,367
(IN GERMAN)

903
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:35,468
We'll have to do this the hard way.

904
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,738
Break!

905
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:45,047
[EASY]: Here we go, Lightning.

906
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:46,145
Right behind you.

907
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:54,363
Where'd this jackass come from?

908
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,004
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!

909
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,009
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.

910
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:11,513
Stop fooling around! Damn it, I'm coming.

911
01:08:11,638 --> 01:08:12,946
[LIGHTNING]: No, you're not, stay put,

912
01:08:16,408 --> 01:08:18,822
I'm gonna show him
a little trick I learned.

913
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:29,489
Whoo! Ha-ha!

914
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:34,000
Lightning, when are you gonna learn
this is not a game?

915
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:38,502
Coming up on anti-aircraft guns.

916
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:42,136
(IN GERMAN)

917
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:43,647
Back off! We'll get 'em on the way back...

918
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:44,773
Break! Break!

919
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:56,118
Those Jerries are hightailing it
out of here.

920
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:57,561
Flak's getting thick.

921
01:08:57,653 --> 01:09:00,596
Break off. Circle clear of the flak
until the bombers return.

922
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,195
Good luck, bombardiers!

923
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:26,383
All bombs away!
Let's get the hell out of here.

924
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:31,231
Here they come. Form up.

925
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:34,858
(IN GERMAN)

926
01:09:35,224 --> 01:09:36,258
Move in...

927
01:09:36,324 --> 01:09:37,393
concentrate on the stragglers!

928
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:43,576
Hey, Junior!
You got a bandit on your left!

929
01:09:43,877 --> 01:09:45,277
Get outta there.
I'll take him.

930
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:47,274
Junior, get outta there!

931
01:09:47,504 --> 01:09:49,273
Where is he?
I can't see him!

932
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:54,077
Ah!

933
01:09:55,977 --> 01:09:57,751
Junior, where are you? Are you all right?

934
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,347
I'm all right!

935
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:01,350
Junior, you ire on Ere!

936
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:04,092
Junior, get out of the plane!

937
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:05,560
Junior!

938
01:10:09,892 --> 01:10:11,098
Come on, Junior, bail!

939
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:18,409
Geronimo!

940
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:49,273
We didn't lose a single plane.

941
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,206
Well, that's a first.

942
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,346
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!

943
01:10:56,506 --> 01:10:58,144
Don't look good.

944
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:01,684
Deke, talk to me. What's your status?

945
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:04,114
I'm all right.

946
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:08,021
I got gas spraying everywhere,
but I think I'm gonna be okay.

947
01:11:08,318 --> 01:11:12,526
I'm a little dizzy,
but other than that, I'm fine.

948
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,465
All right, listen up.

949
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,937
I'll give escort to Deke.
Everybody else head back to base.

950
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:19,972
No, I'll stay. I'm his wingman. I'll stay.

951
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:23,069
Let me take him, Easy.
God, I hate this mask!

952
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:25,774
It's my call, Lightning.

953
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,382
Your calls have been a little off lately.

954
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:30,317
What? What are you talking about?

955
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:31,780
Junior shouldn't have been up here.

956
01:11:33,643 --> 01:11:35,143
You got a problem with
the way I'm running this squad,

957
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:37,056
you talk to Bullard about it, all right?

958
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:38,854
Until then, I'm in control.

959
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:41,395
And my order for you right now
is to head back to base.

960
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:44,991
Damn!

961
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:48,625
All right, Deke, you'll be all right.
I'll see you back at the ranch.

962
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:50,138
You got Black Jesus with you, boy!

963
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,828
Thanks, Smokey.

964
01:12:00,706 --> 01:12:02,685
Well, get me home, Easy.

965
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:05,343
No, sir.
You're going to get yourself home.

966
01:12:09,447 --> 01:12:11,551
What the hell put the Captain
in such a bad mood?

967
01:12:11,749 --> 01:12:13,889
He gets like that sometimes.

968
01:12:13,952 --> 01:12:16,725
He knows good and well
he shouldn't have let Junior fly.

969
01:12:16,785 --> 01:12:17,821
That boy was half blind.

970
01:12:20,426 --> 01:12:21,765
[CAPTAIN]: We're almost home.

971
01:12:21,824 --> 01:12:24,135
I hope we meet up
with those Red Tails next time.

972
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:27,307
Listen, boys,
the bombers have passed their safe point.

973
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:30,001
Our mission is over.
Let's head back to base.

974
01:12:42,847 --> 01:12:44,088
You guys are taking the long way.

975
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:47,059
I'm going to take a shortcut
down the coast.

976
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:49,792
Come on now, Lightning.
Ain't no need to get all crazy.

977
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:51,131
You know you got to stay
with your squadron.

978
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:54,634
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.

979
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:56,140
And what if you turn up missing?

980
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,841
Then I'll have to break it
to Major Stance.

981
01:12:59,031 --> 01:13:02,408
- Well, break it to him gently.
- [JOKER]: Great, great, great!

982
01:13:02,934 --> 01:13:06,005
One's a drunk, and the other one
does whatever the hell he wants to do.

983
01:13:06,069 --> 01:13:07,983
Smokey, stay with him.

984
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,613
And keep him out of trouble.

985
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:12,085
Don't worry. I'll stick with him.

986
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:19,754
My head, it hurts.

987
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:22,087
We're almost there, Deke.

988
01:13:22,388 --> 01:13:23,663
Stay with me.

989
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:31,233
Easy, I got blood all over me,
but I'm not bleeding.

990
01:13:31,431 --> 01:13:34,205
[EASY]: You're gonna be okay,
I'm right above you,

991
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:37,709
Captain, I'm getting real dizzy.

992
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:40,082
I need to rest a minute.

993
01:13:41,305 --> 01:13:44,253
No, no. Stay alert, Deke.
I'm here with you.

994
01:13:44,575 --> 01:13:46,986
I can't really see anything!

995
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:50,954
Everything's all blurred!
I got double vision.

996
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,424
You're slipping, Deke!
Deke, you're slipping! Steady up!

997
01:13:57,457 --> 01:13:58,800
All right.

998
01:13:59,993 --> 01:14:01,400
All right.

999
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:14,977
You're diving, Deke.
You need to pull back on your stick.

1000
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:19,487
Pull up, Deke, pull up!

1001
01:14:22,182 --> 01:14:24,353
Deke, listen to me!
Pull back on your stick now!

1002
01:14:24,616 --> 01:14:26,564
Pull up, Deke, pull up!

1003
01:14:26,654 --> 01:14:27,893
Pull up?

1004
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,063
Oh, I'm pulling up! I'm pulling up!

1005
01:14:33,024 --> 01:14:34,297
Come on!

1006
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,173
I must have passed out!

1007
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:48,386
I need you to stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

1008
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:50,851
- Just keep talking.
- All right.

1009
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:07,737
Lightning, look!
German destroyer, moving to the north!

1010
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,237
I still got ammo. How about you?

1011
01:15:14,799 --> 01:15:18,680
Nah. You need about a 500-pound bomb
to put a dent in that thing.

1012
01:15:19,303 --> 01:15:22,149
Plus, that baby got very, very big guns.

1013
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:24,513
Just watch me.

1014
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:27,522
Lightning, no, all right? Don't be crazy.

1015
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,685
If the big guns don't kill you,
your plane will get messed up,

1016
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:32,525
and Coffee is gonna kill you.

1017
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:36,023
Relax, Smokey.
Worrying too much will kill you.

1018
01:15:42,026 --> 01:15:43,027
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

1019
01:15:58,544 --> 01:15:59,715
(SCREAMING)

1020
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:06,521
All right! That was fun!
Okay, come on now, time to go home.

1021
01:16:06,888 --> 01:16:08,095
Just one more pass.

1022
01:16:18,831 --> 01:16:19,901
(LAUGHING)

1023
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:21,844
How do you like that, Mr. Hitler?

1024
01:16:22,069 --> 01:16:25,050
Lightning, you a damn fool!
But I love you! Come on.

1025
01:16:36,147 --> 01:16:38,321
Ramitelli to Subsoil Red One. Do you read?

1026
01:16:38,383 --> 01:16:41,200
[EASY OVER RADIO]: I got Red Four with me,
he's busted up pretty bad.

1027
01:16:43,358 --> 01:16:45,770
Stay alert, Deke. Stay alert.

1028
01:16:46,128 --> 01:16:48,332
Ramitelli,
have a fire truck standing by.

1029
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:51,033
He's leaking fuel.
I repeat, he's leaking fuel.

1030
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:55,345
This is Major Stance.

1031
01:16:55,404 --> 01:16:58,408
Circle a half-mile out
and have Red Four bail.

1032
01:16:58,538 --> 01:17:00,519
Flight surgeons will be there waiting.

1033

[EASY]: Copy that.

1034
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:07,126
You're gonna put it into a left bank,
and you're up and out. All right?

1035
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,623
I can't get the canopy open!

Easy!

1037
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,362
Listen, Deke, the only thing between
you living and dying is that canopy.

1038
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,566
Now, get it open!

1039
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:23,534
I can't open it!

1040
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,543
I can't open it!

1041
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:30,406
Red Four cannot open his canopy.
I repeat, he cannot open his canopy.

1042
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,917
I'm gonna have to bring him in.

1043
01:17:32,741 --> 01:17:34,184
[AIR CONTROLLER]: Roger that.

1044
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:39,150
Sweet Jesus,

1045
01:17:39,881 --> 01:17:42,020
don't let this happen to me.

1046
01:17:44,217 --> 01:17:46,253
Okay. Okay.

1047
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:48,766
[EASY]: All right, Deke.

1048
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:50,396

I'm coming around behind you, Deke.

1055
01:18:16,019 --> 01:18:17,618
All right, now get your gear down.

1056
01:18:27,196 --> 01:18:29,369

1057

I don't want to die! I'm not ready!

1058
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:36,344
Just relax. Level off, Deke.

You don't think that's Deke, do you?

1070
01:20:40,097 --> 01:20:41,802
- Who was it?
- Deke.

1071
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:44,513
It was Deke.

1072
01:20:45,135 --> 01:20:47,082
- Oh, shit.
- An engine fire.

1073
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:49,515
Gas leak must have caught on the landing.

1074
01:20:49,572 --> 01:20:51,678
But I talked to the medics,
they said he's gonna be all right.

1075
01:20:51,742 --> 01:20:53,049
Must have been a spark.

1076
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:54,583
What?

1077
01:20:56,347 --> 01:20:58,156
You've been drinking.

1078
01:20:58,382 --> 01:21:01,054
- You're going to blame this on me?
- Tell me you haven't been drinking.

1079
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:02,791
- I got him down!
- Say it!

1080
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:06,357
I got him down alive!
You don't blame this on me!

01:21:06,622 --> 01:21:08,468

All ba ck, Colonel.

1084
01:22:06,519 --> 01:22:09,623
The good news is Lieutenant Watkins
survived the fireball landing.

1085
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,201
He's in critical.

1086
01:22:11,257 --> 01:22:12,961
Do they think he's gonna make it?

01:22:13,057 --> 01:22:14,330
Yes, sir.

1088
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:18,970
With 60% third-degree burns.
We're sending him back home.

1089

I brought the background on
the captured flyer, Lieutenant Ray Gannon.

His mother's name is Dorothy.
Father is Thomas.

His wife's name is Thelma.
They have a little girl, Adele.

1092
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:35,322
In particular, Ray loved to fly.

1093
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:39,855
More than any pilot we have,
he loved to be in the air.

You're the first of your kind
we've had here.

Sit down.

1106
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:04,304
So, I bet you're wondering
why I picked you to bunk with us.

1107
01:24:05,004 --> 01:24:07,816
It's not something I care to think about.

1108

Don't worry.

1109
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:13,516
It's not so we can hang you or anything.

1110
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,955
I chose you because I know
you can't be a German spy,

being colored and all.

1112

We're in the middle
of a rather delicate operation,

and we don't need any new white faces.

1370
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:54,975
[EASY]: Fuel-wise,
we're looking good.

1371
01:44:55,305 --> 01:44:56,850
But I'm guessing
the hours there and back,

1372
01:44:57,051 --> 01:44:59,151
it'll definitely be one
for the record books.

1373
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,119
Come on, Easy. it's Berlin.

1374
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,249
Let's go. We can make it.

1375
01:45:11,187 --> 01:45:15,257
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.

1376
01:45:16,258 --> 01:45:17,672
Yeah! We fight!

1377
01:45:17,926 --> 01:45:20,837
Ha-ha! Watch out, Hitler, here we come!

1378
01:45:20,892 --> 01:45:24,070
Just remember, we're here
to protect the bombers.

1379
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,113
Under all circumstances,
we stay on mission.

1380
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,180
What's that about?

1381
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,583
I think we've got the Red Tails
for the duration.

1382
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:45,030
[WINKY]: By my reckoning,
we're deep into Germany.

1383
01:45:45,087 --> 01:45:47,327
It's a little creepy
we haven't seen any fighters yet.

1384
01:45:48,557 --> 01:45:51,332
Maybe they found out
we were flying escort...

1385
01:45:51,395 --> 01:45:53,430
and decided not to show up.

1386
01:45:53,663 --> 01:45:55,199
That'd be nice.

1387
01:45:55,264 --> 01:45:57,470
Wouldn't mind that, would you, baby?

1388
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:08,280
Colonel! it's from Mission Control.

1389
01:46:08,744 --> 01:46:12,589
The 52nd didn't make the rendezvous.
They didn't join up with the 5th.

1390
01:46:13,682 --> 01:46:15,221
Did our boys turn back?

1391
01:46:15,384 --> 01:46:17,297
No, sir. They're headed on to Berlin.

1392
01:46:17,889 --> 01:46:20,300
I gave Captain Julian the option.

1393
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:24,296
Headquarters wants to know
if we're gonna call them back.
