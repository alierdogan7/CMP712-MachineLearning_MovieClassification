the Vice President here

He knocks down another one.

around the ice.

64
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,921

line. He shoots.

You can't stay.

out to dinner.

84
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,387

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,476
You know what
that means?

87
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,891
DARREN: Not a clue.
It means "I love you."

88
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,815
I love you, too.

I'll get you
a new one at the game.

91
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,908
Darren, you can't
just show up here

92
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,610
and take them without
talking to me first.

93
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,445
Besides, you
only have two tickets.

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,905
I'm working at the arena.

Kathi tells me
it's only temporary.

He was trying to
save a little girl...

102
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,972
Are we going to the game?

103
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,056
Don't do this again.
I mean it.

104
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,556
It's not fair to
the kids or me.

105
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,936
I promise.

unless this man
says it's okay.

If he doesn't know them,
they don't get
in that elevator.

this kitchen is closed,
and everyone goes home.

Are you working tonight?

Yeah, after I take
Tyler into the locker room.

136

Could you give
Emily a look at Icey?

137
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,215
Icey always loves company.
Come on, Emily,

138
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,183
I'm gonna show you
where Icey is, okay?

139
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,681
Icey. Big deal.

140
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,933
Some fat guy in
a ratty penguin suit.

141
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,308
That blonde
you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

142
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,363
What's he doing?

143
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,607
Shaping the blade.

144
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,200
They're like horseshoes.
You get them hot enough,

145
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,027
you can bend them.

148
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,831
He waved at me.

00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,880
You see that, Dad?
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

150
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,548
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

151
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,799
Luc, this is Tyler McCord
and his father, Darren.

152
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,421
Hi, Tyler, how are you?

153

155
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,643
Dad, what
did he say?

156
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,233
He thinks they're
gonna win.

157
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,686
That's Brad Tolliver!

158
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,737
Dad, he doesn't
have a rocking chair.

159
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,109
A what?

160
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,782
My Dad said you
should be sitting
in a rocking chair,

161
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,984
instead of on the ice.

162
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,159
Oh, is that so?

163
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,657
You play hockey, Tyler?

164
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,990
No, but my dad played.
He was a goalie.

165
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,327
A little semi-pro in Canada.
It was a long time ago.

166
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,581
Come by some afternoon.

167
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,413
I'll show you
the difference between
the game you played

168
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,590
and the one I play.

169
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,709
I can see the difference.

170
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,487
I got this one, man.

00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,982

Yes.

Did you boys have fun?

173
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,410
Luc Robitaille talked to me,

174
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,332
and we saw Brad
Tolliver close up.

175
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,456
Your friends are gonna
be so jealous of you.

176
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,536
I wanna go with Icey.

177
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,000

the three periods
of the game.

period's end,

the deposits are behind,
one of you will die.

and we are gonna
make it work or
we're gonna die trying.

the Secretary of State

of the Treasury.

will begin to move.

Maybe you'll do
better in the third period.

00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,563
They're moving some.

877
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,486
They're way behind.

878
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,238

the end of the first period,

one-third at the end
of the second period.

even close to that.

No, please!

888
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,314
They're moving more.

to come down here?

and I followed them.

they are?

if I wanted to
bring this place down.

Looks like you
marked 1 5 or 20.

the places that would cause

01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,324
the most structural damage.

Yeah, but where?
Check the codes.

965
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,860
$400 million to
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Madrid.

966
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,445
That's one
of the counter banks.

967
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,453
And $300 million
to Banco Popular,
Virgin Islands.

968
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,455
You know, these
transfers are being tracked,

969
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,458
no matter what happens here,
you'll never get
your hands on the money.

970
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,666
Not all of it.
The money will be transferred
again to 1 2 more banks.

971
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,876
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

972
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,051
So once it's transferred,

973
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,380
it's transferred
again and again,
all in a matter of minutes.

974
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,557
With each stop,
cash is
siphoned and rerouted,

975
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,805
some converted to
foreign currency,

976
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,099
some to
negotiable instruments.

977
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,557

and complicated
world of banking

to such advantage,

979
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:54,656
about $500
million will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

980
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,910
And the other $1,200,000,000
is just a diversion.

I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

982
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,831
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information

to kill everyone here.

guesser.

996
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,604
Is he alone?
Yeah.

997
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,806
Why didn't you kill him?

998
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,610
'Cause two of your goons
started firing at us.
He ran off.

my own ass shot off.

I would've had him if you
had a little more
control over your men.

1002
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,446
The only problem my men had
is they didn't hit what
they were shooting at.

thing to the fireman.

come and get you.

got invited to sit
in the owner's box,

and plenty to eat.

even if
the building fell down.

invited me over

My mom and dad
don't live together.

01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,279
He didn't mention that.

1032
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,822
He just said
bring you upstairs.

1033
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,699
Now don't you think,
you should do
what you're told?

01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,956
Come on! Down in front!

1039
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,509
I'll scream.

1040
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,048
I told you,
I'm with the Secret Service.

1041
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,255
And I'm a little kid.

1042
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,090
Hey, fella,
I didn't pay to watch you!

1043
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,012
Down in front!

1044
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,318
MIKE: Steve Smith
finds the lane.

1045
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:20,778
He'll skate ahead.

1046
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,696
Coming to the Penguin line.

1047
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,103
How many did you get?

1048
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,901
Four, so far.

1049
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,574
Is that all?
Christ, I'm just one guy.

1050
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,777
How many did you get?

1051
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,070
Just one.

1052
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,957
You are all alone,
aren't you?

1053
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,416
You must be real proud.

1054
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:24,921
I'm gonna be real rich.

1055
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,549
Now, very slowly,
I mean very slowly,

1056
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,926
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

1057
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,565
What are you
gonna do, drown me?

1058
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,025
No.

1059
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,733
(SCREAMING)

1060
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:13,758
(SCREAMS)

1061
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,234
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1062
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,395
(PHONE RINGS)

1063
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,317
Yeah?
DARREN: Hallmark's dead.

1064
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:13,989
Who's this?

1065
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,071
Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

1066
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,247
Tom Castillo.

1067
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,744
How you doing, Tom?

1068
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,375
I hope you were
gentle with Hallmark.

1069
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,577
How many hostages

1070
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,128
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

1071
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,456
Oh, now, that's
a personal question, Tom.

1072
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,416
Ever been
involved in an AOP, Tom?

1073
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,671
I didn't call
for conversation.

1074
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,010
How many are still alive?

1075
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,258
You'd probably
think I was lying,

1076
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,593
no matter what I
told you, so...

1077
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,177
I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

1078
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,522
Hello?

1079
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,525
Hello?
Emily.

1080
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,232
Don't let him know it's me.
I'll get you out.

1081
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,938
I'll take you home,
I promise.

1082
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,950
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

1083
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,116
1 2.

1084
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,334
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

1085
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,377
She included me, Tom.

1086
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,455
Now, you tell me
what an AOP is,

1087
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,583
or I'm gonna shoot
this cute little pumpkin.

1088
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,918
Listen to me. Listen good.

1089
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:15,255
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed,
you lose.

1090
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,635
(LAUGHING) How do you
figure that, fireman?

1091
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,720
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

1092
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,645
You've got hostages
and you've got your bombs,

1093
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,098
so you can get your money.

1094
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:28,810
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1095
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,315
You stop me, you win.

1096
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,899
I get your bombs, I win.

1097
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,607
That's the game
we're gonna play,
you piece of shit.

1098
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,533
Now, if you touch her,
the game's off.

1099
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,157
Then I'll come after you.

1100
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,410
You'll have to kill me
in front of everybody
in this arena.

1101
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,489
There will be panic.

1102
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,498
The Secret Service, SWAT,
the fucking navy will
have to come in here.

1103
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,871
Then you don't
get your money.

1104
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,167
You lose, pal.

1105
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:53,547
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.
Oh, by the way,

1106
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,175
in the Secret Service,
AOP is
an "assault on principle."

1107
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,802
In this case,
our esteemed Vice President.

1108
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,053
I don't give a shit.

1109
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,806
Ooh, now, Tom, come on.

1110
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,601
If we're gonna play,
you got to play nice.

1111
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,807
So you go run
your little ass off.

1112
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,984
I know where the bombs are,
so I know where you're going.

1113
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,652
Then come and get me.

1114
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,822
Would you like
a glass of wine
or a cigarette?

1115
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:22,701
It's customary to
offer these minor vices
to someone before they die.

1116
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,546
I'm not afraid of you.

1117
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:38,221
Sure you are.
I'm the scariest
person you've ever seen.

1118
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,797
You're the meanest.

1119
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,052
Am I, now?

1120
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,345
How do you
suppose I got that way?

1121
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,600
Maybe when you were born
you had something
wrong with your brain.

1122
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,393
Don't you know any
little boys like me?

1123
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,571
If there were
any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

1124
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,240
I can assure you
there are one or two.

1125
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,817
I'm gonna kill your daddy.

1126
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,652
What do you think about that?

1127
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,780
He promised
he'd take me home.

1128
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,786
He always does what he says.

1129
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,371
So do I.

1130
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,967
(LAUGHS)

1131
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,003
MIKE: We're in the third
period of this dramatic game.

1132
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:22,215
The Penguins on the rush.
Tamer brings it in.

1133
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,763
He puts it in!

1134
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,094
Ron Erancis!

1135
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,098
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one, too!

1136
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,341
Chicago desperately
trying to get back
into this game.

1137
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,840
Sutter cuts in
around the net,
fires and scores!

1138
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,137
Chicago does
get the third goal!

1139
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,631
PA UL: I tell you,
Mike, I don 't think

1140
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,637
Tolliver looks like
himself right now.

1141
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,059
I guess we shouldn 't
be surprised.

1142
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,762
He had a 1 04-degree
temperature earlier today.

1143
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,849
Right now,
he looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

1144
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,058
Yo, Ref.

1145
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,563
Right now,
he's calling for the referee.

1146
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,645
Looks like he might
wanna go to the bench.

1147
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,814
MIKE: Tolliver is
gonna head that way.

1148
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,945
Backup for
the Penguins is Ken Wregget.

1149
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,321
What's the matter?

1150
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,868
Coach,
I really feel like shit.

1151
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,536
I don't think I can goal.

1152
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,869
Go to the locker room.
Wregget!

1153
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,326
Get in there.
PLAYER: Let's go, Kenny.

1154
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:40,631
MAN ON PA: Now in goal
for Pittsburgh, Number 31,
Ken Wregget.

1155
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,631
(PHONE RINGS)

1156
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,518
Hey, fireman,
where are you?

1157
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,266
You don't call,
you don't write.

1158
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,817
I'm not far away.

1159
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:57,984
How many have you found?

1160
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,528
How many what?

1161
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,571
I could detonate
all 1 0 right now.

1162
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,280
Go ahead. Then you lose.

1163
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:06,693
(BANGING)

1164
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,324
Nervous stomach, fireman?

1165
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:18,498
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

1166
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,050
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep.

1167
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,219
A shot off the stick!

1168
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,942
Section B. Now.

1169
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,145
Chelios guns it
ahead to Bernie Nicholls.

1170
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,481
Here he comes! Look out!

1171
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,358
He shoots and scores!
Bernie Nicholls

1172
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,277
carried it into
the Penguins inn,

1173
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,108
coming right down the slot.

1174
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,283
He wrapped a heavy slap shot.

1175
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,711
MIKE: An old-fashioned
shoot-out here

1176
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,831
at the Stanley
Cup competition.

1177
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,437
Up the alley,
now to center circle.

1178
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,484
Lines it up to the Penguins...

1179
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,936
Murphy plays to the board...

1180
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,692
He'll beat
the puck out of there.

1181
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,990
Leroux shakes his stick
because he wanted
that puck right there.

1182
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,159
Mike, they're making
some noise down here
in the corner

1183
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,282
and I'm not really
sure why.

1184
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,534
I don 't believe this.
Brad Tolliver is actually

1185
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,783
coming back into the game,
right now.

1186
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,583
MIKE: This is unbelievable.
This is a guy that once

1187
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,419
finished a game
with a broken ankle.

1188
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,918
Takes a lot of guts
to come back in at this

1189
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,920
point with
Chicago leading 4-3.

1190
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,763
They're on
the verge of winning

1191
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,632
their first
Stanley Cup since 1 960.

1192
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,640
Now he's just
sitting on the bench.

1193
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,605
Feeling better?

1194
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,437
Then get the fuck in there.

1195
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,605
MIKE: And here he comes.

1196
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,495
MAN ON PA: Now back in goal
for Pittsburgh,

1197
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:41,451
Number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing Number 31,
Ken Wregget.

1198
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,253
PAUL: This is amazing.
I don't know what he did

1199
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,412
when he went to
the locker room,

1200
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,043
if he just recharged
his battery or what.

1201
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,962
But this is the guy
who was really sick

1202
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,260
and he's gonna go back in
and try to finish the game.

1203
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,053
I wonder if he
can he can make
the big saves to keep

1204
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,971
the Penguins from
within striking distance.

1205
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,927
One thing we do know,

at the Civic Arena,

on their feet.

for a lift here

back into this game.

1210
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,023
Here we go!
Chicago will control

1211
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,987
the face-off and
they'll dump it quickly

1212
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:12,531
towards the Penguin end.

1217

... sweeps in,
they're trying
to get some Hawks

1218
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,791
and get the puck back,
and they do just that

1219
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,749
as they scramble now
and deliver up
the right side.

on the offense

1221
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,423
and Tolliver's not challenging
the shooters at all.

1222

He hasn 't challenged
much all night.

1223

head on the ice,

but play continues.

1229

still trail by only one.

that his kids

within a goal.

What's amazing to me, Paul,
the fact that he's been sick.

1240

in this game tonight.

he comes up with
the save of the year.

biggest save ever.

a little move out,
in front of the net.

What's he doing?

a game misconduct and a fine.
