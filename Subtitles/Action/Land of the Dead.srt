Booze ain't essential.

172
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,705
A jug of good Kentucky
goes for $1,500 back in town.

173
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,073
You've got to
get out of there. Cholo?

174
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,308
God damn it!

00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,529
All right, Foxy,
shop till you drop, baby.

[Chuckling]

179
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:42,462
You know it, brother.

180
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,530
(Cholo) Yeah, 'cause
getting them stinking drunk...

181
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,667
is the only way
you're gonna get laid.

182
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:48,041
[Foxy laughing]

183
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,245
(Foxy) When's the last
time you got laid? I forget.

184
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,839
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.

185
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,974
That's all I want, baby.

186
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,811
Yes.

187
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:57,875
[Growling]

188
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:00,184
Foxy!

189
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,587
[Yelling] I can't
get a shot. Cholo, hold on.

190
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,927
I got him. Cholo, I got him!

00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,141
Bro, do me a favor, will you?

196
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:33,217
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.

197
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:36,412

Stop being a pussy, man.

199
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:39,881
(Cholo)
Yeah, I got what I need.

200
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,664
A little something extra, too.

201
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:53,700
Nice.

202
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,765
Here, kid, pick that up.

203
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,669
[Screaming]

204
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,501
I'm bit.
Yeah, you're bit.

205
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,839
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?

206
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,936
No. I will not become
one of those things.

207
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,037
Riley, step aside.

208
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,708
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.

209
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,911
I said put it away.

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,845

[Motorcycle engine starting]

213
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,171
This is Riley. Cease fire.
Repeat, cease fire.

214
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,407
Let's pack it up.
We're going to call it a night.

225

[Engine starting]
Only if you let it, Charlie.

226
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,509
(male announcer on TV) Life goes on
at Fiddler's Green... 

227
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,640
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities. 

228
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,214
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers... 

229
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:52,687
Fiddler's Green offers luxury living
in the grand old style. 

230
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,918
Dine at one of
six fine restaurants. 

231
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,783
Look for that perfect gift in our fully-stocked
shopping mall. 

232
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,089
Man, they sure did
used to make it sound nice.

233
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,890
Still sounds nice to me.

234
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:06,229
(male announcer on TV) There is a difference between
our place and other places. 

235
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,064
If you can appreciate
that difference... 

236
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,967
(Anchor) You're not
going to be around no more?

237
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,667
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.

238
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,510
I hate going under the river.

240

Cholo.

241
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:22,041
(Anchor) Shit. Let's
get out of here, Foxy.

242
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,639
(Foxy) Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.

243
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,776
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.

244
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:28,411
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.

245
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,012
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.

246
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,115
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?

247
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,183
It's to bring things in
that people need.

248
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,424
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.

249
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:39,861
What, you're talking
about this?

250
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,956
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.

251
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,898
That's what that's for.

252
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:46,334
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...

253
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,531
so that you can
fucking celebrate.

254
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:53,207
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.

255
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,976
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.

256
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,242
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.

257
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,978
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.

258
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,747
My own goddamn place.

259
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,746
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.

260
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:10,054
They wouldn't let me in there.
We're the wrong kind.

261
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,787
Yeah, well, we'll see.

262
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:13,884
(male announcer on TV)
Isn't it time?

263
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,123
Isn't it your time?
For Fiddler's Green?

What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.

267
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,276
For Kaufman.

268
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,648
(woman on PA system)
Mark your calendars. 

269
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:49,318
Mr. Kaufman
cordially invites... 

270
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,386
residents of the Green
to a masked ball... 

271
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:53,055
on the eve of Allhallows. 

272
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:55,930
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are. 

273
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,866
It's expensive. Look at that.

274
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:58,925
You like it?

275
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,360
I could tell.

Quitting time, Deke.

280
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,514
You're going to need this
to get back in.

281
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,321
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.

00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,368
(Charlie) So, Riley, you
want to go get a drink?

286
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:38,736
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.

287
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:42,468
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?

288
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,807
I'll catch up.
Where are you going?

289
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,979
I got to see a man
about a car.

290
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,747
A car?

291
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,394
All right.
Here's the deal.

292
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:12,601
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.

293
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,805
The only overland access
is here, called the "Throat."

294
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,341
And these fences
go all the way across?

295
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,376
[Electronic beeping]
Half a mile, both ways.

296
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,238
Stench. High noon.
Shit.

297
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,747
(soldier) They don't
come around here much anymore.

298
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,412
It's like they've learned
they can't get in.

299
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,882
Take his fucking face off.

300
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,624
(Mulligan) How long are you going
to let Kaufman push you around?

301
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,227
You like shining his shoes,
pressing his pants?

302
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:52,704
He didn't build that place.
He just took it over.

303
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:56,072
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.

304
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:59,271
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...

305
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,778
we could make this
a fit place to live in.

Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.

309

And food and other stuff,
for all of us.

Come in with us, Riley.
Both of you.

311

You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?

314
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:26,697
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.

That.

They should be here.

All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.

332
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:02,857
Who are you? Are you Security?
No, I'm not Security.

333
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,950
Then, who the hell are you?

334
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,257
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.

What are you doing with that?

what I have to do. I'm sorry.

Remember you said we should talk
when I was less excited?

I'm a lot less excited
right now.

What do you want, Mr. DeMora?

572
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,856
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...

573
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,869
so I didn't get a chance
to take my money out of your bank.

574
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,063
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.

575
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:48,073
With interest: $5 million.

576

Well, unfortunate for you,
perhaps.

I want you to put that money
on a boat...

are returning to life...

you can tell it was bad.

can I offer you a drink?

designed, Mr. Denbo.

612
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,117
It'll do
a great deal of damage...

613
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:52,312
if they're aimed
at this city.

614
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:54,322
Why don't you just
send out your troops?

615
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,449
I can send 50 men
against that thing...

616

to do what has to be done.

of here, but it disappeared.

didn't want me to leave.

You're a very popular man.

623
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:24,578
How much are your services
going to cost me?

624
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,211
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.

625
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:31,646
But there's nothing up north.
That's the idea.

leave me here alone too long...

me know if we're rich or not.

Riley would never do that.

It's too late
to send me back.

Take a look at this.

the man, aren't you, Riley?

to take care of me?

Yeah.

904
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:07,929

right in the front, doesn't it?
