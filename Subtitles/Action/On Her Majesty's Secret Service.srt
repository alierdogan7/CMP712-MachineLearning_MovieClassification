00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,458
<i>Her mother was an English girl-
romantic -</i>

170
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,332
<i>who had come to Corsica
to look for bandits.</i>

171
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:37,462
<i>Rather like those women who ventured
into the desert looking for sheikhs.</i>

172
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,635
<i>She found me in the mountains.</i>

173
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,513
<i>Hiding from the police at the time.</i>

174
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,465
<i>I came to love this girl.</i>

175
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,472
<i>We married. The result: Teresa.</i>

176
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,641
<i>Twelve years later my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland</i>

177
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,148
<i>- No, thanks. I prefer my own.
-to finish her education.</i>

178
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:00,481
<i>Unfortunately I didn't give her a proper
home. She was without supervision.</i>

179
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,237
<i>O</i>

180
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,037
<i>she joined the fast international set.
One scandal after another.</i>

181
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,287
<i>When I disapproved,
cut off her allowance,</i>

182
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,703
<i>she committed some greater folly.</i>

183
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,714
<i>To spite me.</i>

184
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,846
<i>Yet, behind her bravado,
something was eating away at her soul.</i>

185
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,424
<i>This can happen to men and women.</i>

186
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,477
<i>They burn the heart out of themselves
by living too greedily.</i>

187
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,646
<i>And suddenly,</i>

188
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,892
<i>-all is finished.
- Why are you telling me this?</i>

189
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,982
<i>Without telling me, she married. An Italian
count who killed himself in a Maserati</i>

190
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,238
<i>with one of his mistresses.</i>

191
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,161
<i>I gave her too much,
and it brought her nothing.</i>

192
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,123
<i>Now, why did I tell you all this?</i>

193
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,459
<i>I have been informed of everything
you have done for my daughter.</i>

194
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:01,088
<i>- Everything?
- Don't worry, don't worry about that.</i>

195
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,387
<i>What you did, the way you behaved,
might be the beginning</i>

196
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,385
<i>of some kind of therapy.</i>

197
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,558
<i>She needs help.</i>

198
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,270
<i>Your help.</i>

199
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,849
<i>I find her fascinating,
but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.</i>

200
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,856
<i>What she needs is a man to dominate her.</i>

201
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,406
<i>To make love to her enough
to make her love him.</i>

202
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,784
<i>A man like you.</i>

203
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,445
<i>You overestimate me, Draco.</i>

204
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,498
<i>She's very attractive,
but what you ask is not for me.</i>

205
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,789
<i>Mm.</i>

206
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,714
<i>Listen to me. On the day you marry her,</i>

207
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,794
<i>I'll give you a personal dowry
of one million pounds</i>

208
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,629
<i>in gold.</i>

209
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,806
<i>That's quite an inducement.</i>

210
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,556
<i>- But I don't need a million pounds.
- Stupido!</i>

211
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,888
<i>And I've a bachelor's taste for freedom.</i>

212
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,690
<i>Please, just see her some more.</i>

213
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,860
<i>Who knows what will come of it?</i>

214
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,063
<i>I'm sorry, Draco,
but in my profession, I can't...</i>

215
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,241
<i>- What?
- You have connections not open to me.</i>

216
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,281
<i>Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?</i>

217
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,455
<i>Blofeld?</i>

218
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,542
<i>Some of my men
have recently defected to him.</i>

219
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,666
<i>- I don't know where he is.
- Can you find out?</i>

220
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:24,125
<i>If I could, I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

221
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,011
<i>But I might tell my future son-in-law.</i>

222
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,598
<i>Go on.</i>

223
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,934
<i>Next week is my birthday.</i>

224
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,684
<i>For that,
Teresa always comes back to me.</i>

225
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,654
<i>- You understand?
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.</i>

226
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,855
<i>You do that.</i>

227
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:53,454
<i>- James! Where have you been?
- Much too far from you, darling.</i>

228
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,657
<i>Oh, same old James!</i>

229
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,833
<i>Ooh! Only more so.</i>

230
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,671
<i>Heartless brute! Letting me pine away
without even a postcard.</i>

231
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,840
<i>Pine no more.</i>

232
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,095
<i>{whispers) Cocktails at my place,
eightish, just the two of us.</i>

233
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,263
<i>Oh, I'd adore that!</i>

234
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,141
<i>If only I could trust myself.</i>

235
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,720
<i>Same old Moneypenny.
Britain's last line of defence.</i>

236
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,853
<i>You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.</i>

237
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,268
<i>{clears throat)</i>

238
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,999
<i>I'm relieving you
from Operation Bedlam, 007.</i>

239
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,752
<i>But, sir, Blofeld's
something of a must with me.</i>

240
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,050
<i>You've had two years to run him down.</i>

241
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:52,301
<i>- Have you lost confidence in me?
- I'm well aware of your talents, 007.</i>

242
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,849
<i>But a license to kill is useless,
unless one can set up the target.</i>

243
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,677
<i>- Sir...
- I'll find you a more suitable assignment.</i>

244
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,058
<i>- Under the circumstances...
- That's all!</i>

245
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,149
<i>That was a quick conference.</i>

246
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,282
<i>- How can a girl keep herself alluring...
- Take a memo, please, Moneypenny.</i>

247
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,450
<i>Ready, James.</i>

248
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:25,413
<i>Sir, I have the honour to request
if you'll accept my resignation</i>

249
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,589
<i>effective forthwith.</i>

250
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,294
<i>- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.</i>

251
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,425
<i>And kindly present it
to that monument in there.</i>

<i>Two weeks' leave!</i>

263
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,645
<i>Well, you didn't really
want to resign, did you?</i>

264
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,156
<i>Moneypenny,
what would I do without you?</i>

265
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,784
<i>My problem is that
you never do anything with me.</i>

266
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,079
<i>It's a date. The moment I get back.</i>

267
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,078

<i>Mr Bond, may I introduce
my daughter? Teresa.</i>

<i>Contessa.</i>

288

<i>I didn't know Mr Bond knew Papa.</i>

295

<i>There are many things
about Mr Bond one does not know.</i>

296
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,122
<i>It would be interesting
to attend night school perhaps.</i>

<i>Your father loves you very much, Tracy.</i>

<i>Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.</i>

<i>Oh, allow me.</i>

<i>What are you doing here?</i>

310
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,545
<i>Yes, wasn't it kind
of your father to invite me?</i>

311
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>Mr Bond and I are discussing business.</i>

312
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,963
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hm.</i>

313
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,471
<i>No woman would waste excellent
champagne discussing business.</i>

314
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,894
<i>Unless, of course, she happened
to be part of the arrangement.</i>

315
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,642
<i>Olympe, what have you said?</i>

316
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,565
<i>Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.</i>

317
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,735
<i>I detect a certain family resemblance.</i>

318
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,188
<i>I suggest you revise the terms
of your contract, Mr Bond.</i>

319
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,946
<i>- You'll find your liability too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.</i>

320
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,277
<i>'Papa.
- Yes?</i>

321
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,580
<i>- Mr Bond wants information.
- What are you talking about?</i>

322
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,909
<i>You always taught me
a good host supplies his guest's needs.</i>

323
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,710
<i>- Uh-huh.
- And without obligation.</i>

324
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,883
<i>- And then?
- I'm not sure obligation is the right word.</i>

325
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,585
<i>Tell him, Papa.</i>

326
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,636
<i>Tell him what he wants to know.</i>

327
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,840
<i>- Now!
- Please, please, Teresa.</i>

328
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,346
<i>It's only a possibility, nothing definite.</i>

329
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,224
<i>Tell him, Papa,
or you'll never see me again.</i>

330
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,904
<i>All right.</i>

331
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,281
<i>All right.</i>

332
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:31,078
<i>There may be a connection between

<i>- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold?</i>

335
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,961
<i>- Bern, Switzerland?
- Yes, Gumbold.</i>

336
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,916
<i>So, now Mr Bond need have
no further interest in me.</i>

337
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,218
<i>Another mistake.</i>

338
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,387
<i>She always was a headstrong child.</i>

339
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,177

<i>Tracy.</i>

345
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,570
<i>I was always taught
that mistakes should be remedied.</i>

346
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,956
<i>Especially between friends.</i>

347
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,000

<i>Only love</i>

368
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,667
<i>I'll see to this appointment,
then catch up with you.</i>

369
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,501

- Just keep my martini cool.</i>

<i>Ich hab noch ein paar Sachen zu kaufen.</i>

373
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,979
<i>Such things should be left to a girl's
father, who knows what is best for her.</i>

374

<i>But what can be better than being in love?</i>

375
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,481
<i>Mr Bond, he's... He's in love with you?</i>

376
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,649
<i>That may come too some day.</i>

377
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,528
<i>Life's too short for "some day", Teresa.</i>

378
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,332
<i>Tomorrow I will speak to him alone,
man to man.</i>

379
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,658

- Why not?</i>

00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:55,712
<i>No talk. Whatever happens,
there'll be no regrets.</i>

<i>Please.</i>

00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,926

<i>Good afternoon, James.</i>

00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>- Afternoon. ls the Admiral in?
- Certainly.</i>

<i>-{knock at door)
- Hm?</i>

390
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,177
<i>Excuse me. Commander Bond to see you.</i>

391
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,597
<i>- Right, show him in.
- Aye aye, sir.</i>

392
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,766
<i>- If you please, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

<i>Unusually small
for a Nymphalis polychloris.</i>

394
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,946
<i>I wasn't aware that your expertise
included lepidoptery.</i>

395
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,119
<i>Anyway, what are you doing here?</i>

396
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,743
<i>Genealogy, sir. Fascinating subject.</i>

397
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:03,167
<i>Came across a letter from Gebrﬂder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland</i>

398
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,086
<i>to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.</i>

399
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,291
<i>- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of "Blofeld".</i>

400
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,554
<i>You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, 007. Remember?</i>

401
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,506
<i>I assumed you'd reassign me, sir.</i>

402
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,138
<i>This is a Photostat copy of a letter</i>

403
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,891
<i>to our College of Arms
in the City of London</i>

404
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,566
<i>with the request they try to establish
de Bleuchamp's claim to the title,</i>

405
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,066
<i>and Sir Hilary Bray
has replied to Gumbold</i>

406
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,489
<i>suggesting that he should meet
de Bleuchamp in person.</i>

407
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,159
<i>I've taken the liberty, sir,
of working with the college on this,</i>

408
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,205
<i>using an examination
of my own family tree as cover.</i>

409
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,374
<i>I've also been reading up
on the technical side of heraldry.</i>

410
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,918
<i>Sir Hilary Bray, please. Commander Bond.</i>

411
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,245
<i>Ah, yes, sir.</i>

412
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:52,380
<i>So that, should he consent to meet, I can
act as a representative of the college.</i>

413
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,926
<i>{man) Come.</i>

414
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,172
<i>- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Sir Hilary.</i>

415
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:03,183
<i>Have a look at this: arms of Sir Thomas
Bond. Baronet of Peckham. Died 1734.</i>

416
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,138
<i>Argent on a chevron sable.</i>

417
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,689
<i>Three bezants.</i>

418
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,233
<i>Good motto, eh?
"The world is not enough."</i>

419
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,608
<i>- You're doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, Mr Sable Basilisk.</i>

420
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,440
<i>We've traced your line
back to Sir Otho le Bon.</i>

421
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:21,201
<i>Held the manor of Wickhambreux by a
knight's fee from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.</i>

422
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,952
<i>We're in luck.</i>

423
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,456
<i>Gumbold's telephoned from Bern
to say his client has consented to see me.</i>

424
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,412
<i>- You mean me?
- Yes, you.</i>

425
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:34,042
<i>But, Commander Bond, I am only able
to countenance this deception</i>

426
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,628
<i>if the matter is of national importance.</i>

427
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,760
<i>I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.</i>

428
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,310
<i>All right, then. I've arranged to lose myself
amongst the churches of Brittany.</i>

429
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,638
<i>I want to do brass rubbings there anyway.</i>

430
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,601
<i>- Where do I go for this meeting?
- Well, they want a description of myself.</i>

431
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:54,313
<i>- Tactfully adjusted to favour me.
- Yes.</i>

432
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,274
<i>They will send the time and place
from where I am to be</i>

433
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,404
<i>"collected", as they put it.</i>

434
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,862
<i>It's not our sort of thing,
but under the circumstances...</i>

435
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:07,746
<i>- Sounds as if they're suspicious.
- No, no, no, not suspicious. Just discreet.</i>

436
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,500
<i>There was no objection to my fee
of a thousand guineas.</i>

437
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,755
<i>- Could their claim be genuine?
- Hard to say. Our methods are exacting.</i>

438
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:20,930
<i>We never speak until we're absolutely
certain there's no error on our side or</i>

439
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,726
<i>-forgery on anybody else's.
- I hope I live up to your high standards.</i>

440
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,057
<i>One helpful physical point may be that the
real de Bleuchamps are without ear lobes.</i>

441
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,643
<i>It's not the sort of thing we rely on,
but it could help.</i>

442
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,479
<i>- No ear lobes.
- Invite him to Augsburg.</i>

443
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,736
<i>The de Bleuchamps have been
coming from there for generations.</i>

444
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,819
<i>Yes, I'd like to get him
away from Switzerland.</i>

00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,876
<i>I'm Fréulein Irma Bunt,
personal secretary to the Count.</i>

450
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:40,176
<i>- Have you had a good journey?
- No, intolerable. I'm not a good traveller.</i>

451
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,128
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

452
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,885
<i>- Grunther will take your luggage.
- I can manage.</i>

453
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,841
<i>- I take it.
- Oh, very well.</i>

454
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,597
<i>You know Switzerland?</i>

455
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,644
<i>- I'm afraid not, Fréulein...
- Bunt.</i>

456
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,519
<i>Bunt. Interesting name for a genealogist.
Are you from a naval family?</i>

457
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,066
<i>Naval?</i>

458
00:48:56,142 --> 00:49:00,067
<i>It's a nautical term, you see, meaning
the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.</i>

459
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,649
<i>- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.</i>

460
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,200
<i>- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.</i>

461
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,529
<i>- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?</i>

462
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,864
<i>You will not be disappointed. Please?</i>

463
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,086
<i>Like the bugs in the rug, yes?</i>

464
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,086
<i>- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, Fréulein.</i>

465
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,884
<i>- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.</i>

00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,595
<i>So, we are halfway.</i>

469
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,546
<i>Now we will have a little flight.</i>

470
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,260
<i>- I've never been in one of these before.
- You must your pipe knock off.</i>

471
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,436
<i>Knock out, you mean?</i>

472
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
<i>I hope.</i>

<i>Now up into the Alps.</i>

476
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,706
<i>That is avalanche damage.</i>

477
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,889
<i>You enjoy the skiing
or the bobsleigh perhaps?</i>

478
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,145
<i>I'm not a sporting man, Fréulein.</i>

479
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,352
<i>Even when I'm at my best.</i>

480
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,863
<i>Do you feel the airsickness?</i>

481
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,796
<i>Up to there is for the public, and
from here upwards it is strictly private.</i>

482
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,098
<i>No one, no one at all</i>

00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,302
<i>may come through
without permission from the Count.</i>

484
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,357
<i>There is the Bleuchamp Institute
for allergy research.</i>

485
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,519
<i>- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.</i>

486
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:30,823
<i>Like the hay fever,
or the sickness caused by the oysters,</i>

487
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,071
<i>or inability to eat meat.</i>

488
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,278
<i>The Count is a specialist in this field.</i>

489
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,416
<i>- I'll be glad to get my feet on the ground
- Not ground. Ice.</i>

490
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,372
<i>Fréulein, I should warn you,
guns make me very nervous.</i>

491
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,628
<i>They're to keep away the spies
from the chemical companies.</i>

492
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,212
<i>Many times already
they have tried to steal our discoveries.</i>

493
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,888
<i>Yes, we live in a world
of avarice and deceit.</i>

494
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,843
<i>- Here, at least, there's no avarice.
- Really?</i>

495
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,520
<i>The Bleuchamp Institute
is not for profit, Sir Hilary.</i>

496
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,479
<i>The Count does his work
for the sake of mankind.</i>

497
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,435
<i>Mm, I'm very happy to hear it.</i>

498
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,522
<i>He wants to leave his mark
on the entire world.</i>

499
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,528
<i>- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?</i>

500
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,701
<i>- Of a true humanitarian.
- Ah!</i>

501
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,117
<i>Formerly it was a sports club,
open to the public.</i>

502
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:06,123
<i>Now it belongs to the Count,
who has given it to scientific research.</i>

503
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,000
<i>Josef, Sir Hilary Bray
will take number four.</i>

504
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,300
<i>I will show you there after Grunther
has taken you for a medical examination.</i>

505
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,801
<i>- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honoured guest, Sir Hilary.</i>

506
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,508
<i>And after your experience
in the helicopter,</i>

507
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,219
<i>we must make sure
that you are well again.</i>

508
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:27,102
<i>- Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr von Sant.
- Ja, Fréulein.</i>

509
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,692
<i>Direktor, bitte.</i>

510
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,365
<i>{phone rings)</i>

511
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,703
<i>- Yes?
- Der Englénder ist gekommen.</i>

512
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,531
<i>- Provide him with the usual comforts.
- Ja.</i>

513
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,750
<i>You have ten minutes.</i>

514
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,578
<i>- And then take them to number four.
- Ja.</i>

515
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,759
<i>If you wish anything for your comfort,
you must ring this.</i>

516
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,926
<i>{beeping)</i>

517
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,267
<i>- And the attendant will come.
- Very considerate. Thank you.</i>

518
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,387
<i>You must also ring for him
to open the door</i>

519
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,561
<i>-when you wish to leave.
- A complicated arrangement.</i>

520
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,934
<i>To stop patients leaving their rooms</i>

521
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,063
<i>and disturbing each other
when they should be resting.</i>

522
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,566
<i>The Count believes very strongly
in undisturbed rest.</i>

523
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,910
<i>Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have a lot to discuss.</i>

524
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,655
<i>He will send for you, Sir Hilary,
when he's ready.</i>

525
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,618
<i>Meanwhile, I should like you to join me
in the Alpine room before dinner.</i>

526
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,833
<i>- Alpine room?
- Yes.</i>

527
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,711
<i>Grunther will come for you.
Shall we say seven?</i>

528
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,258
<i>Thank you.</i>

529
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,796
<i>{helicopter engine)</i>

530
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,024
<i>Fréulein Bunt will receive you.</i>

531
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,574
<i>{dice rolling)</i>

532
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,999
<i>{laughing)</i>

533
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,182
<i>Tomato juice with lots of lemon.</i>

534
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,386
<i>Hm-hm!</i>

535
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,978
<i>Ah, Sir Hilary!
Please, come to meet our patients.</i>

536
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,110
<i>Ladies, this is Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet.</i>

537
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,984
<i>- How do you do?
- He's a famous genealogist.</i>

538
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,446
<i>- You will have a drink, yes?
- Please, come and sit down.</i>

539
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,038
<i>How do you do?</i>

540
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,787
<i>Thank you.</i>

541
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,581
<i>- What is a baronet?
- It's a kind of inferior baron.</i>

542
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,921
<i>- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well, er...</i>

543
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,916
<i>Oh, I don't mean you're inferior,
I mean the title is.</i>

544
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,839
<i>Yes, but what's a gynae... genealogist?
What is that?</i>

545
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:29,424
<i>- Pommy word for an old people's doctor.
- Ah! So he's here to cure Fréulein Bunt.</i>

546
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,051
<i>Watch out. She has ears like an elephant.</i>

547
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:36,389
<i>- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whisky and branch water, please.</i>

548
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,145
<i>I'm sorry I was so rude
about what a baronet is.</i>

549
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,769
<i>You gave a very accurate description.</i>

550
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,939
<i>- Sir.
- Thank you.</i>

551
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,904
<i>It's a treat having a man here for once.</i>

552
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:52,489
<i>- Er, you mean there aren't any others?
- Only the staff, and you can't count them.</i>

553
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,990
<i>We will not discuss affairs of the clinic.</i>

554
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,039
<i>But what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?</i>

555
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,871
<i>- It would be a pleasure to tell you.
- Well?</i>

556
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,878
<i>Genealogy is all about
ancestors and families.</i>

557
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,302
<i>I mean, it could easily be
that any one of you here</i>

558
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,467
<i>is related to a royal house.</i>

559
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,512
<i>If only we could go back
far enough to find out.</i>

560
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,259
<i>If you tell me your names...</i>

561
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,642
<i>We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.</i>

562
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,016
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know that.</i>

563
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,984
<i>Come, it's time for dinner.</i>

564
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:27,072
<i>Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.</i>

565
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,697
<i>Sir Hilary, if you would sit there,
between Helen and Ruby.</i>

566
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,946
<i>{Bond) I'm afraid I've never had
much to do with young ladies.</i>

567
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,748
<i>I have ordered you a steak "Piz Gloria".</i>

568
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:40,168
<i>- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.</i>

569
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:51,134
<i>- Are you here for Christmas, Sir Hilary?
- Er, well, I might be.</i>

570
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:55,343
<i>- Oh, good! Then we can have a party.
- That sort of thing's not quite in my line.</i>

571
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,594
<i>Delicious!</i>

572
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,556
<i>I used to hate chicken.
Used to make me break out.</i>

573
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,024
<i>It was all over.
You'd be surprised where.</i>

574
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:07,191
<i>- Potatoes did it to me. Now I adore them.
- No medical histories, please.</i>

575
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:15,325
<i>Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like to tell
us about the College of Arms in London.</i>

576
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,872
<i>Go on, Sir Hilary, please tell us.</i>

577
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,539
<i>- If you'd really enjoy that.
-{girls) Please. Yes!</i>

578
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,412
<i>Would you?</i>

579
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,045
<i>- Fascinating!
- Tell us all about it.</i>

580
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,634
<i>The Herald's College,
or College of Arms,</i>

581
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,963
<i>consists of 13 members
of the royal household,</i>

582
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,641
<i>appointed by the sovereign
to run armorial, genealogical,</i>

583
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:40,311
<i>-ceremonial and other matters.
-{women) Mm-hm.</i>

584
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,106
<i>The 13 members
are divided into three categories:</i>

585
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:47,186
<i>kings, heralds and pursuivants.</i>

586
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:50,398
<i>Their titles and offices
are of great antiquity.</i>

587
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:56,745
<i>...when I tell you the first Clarenceux,
King-of-Arms, was created in 1334</i>

588
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:01,287
<i>and the first Somerset herald in 1448.</i>

589
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:07,173
<i>Now, when we authorise a coat of arms,
it can include all sorts of funny things.</i>

590
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:11,468
<i>Crescent moons, portcullises,
beasts couchant and rampant,</i>

591
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,428
<i>bars, bezants...</i>

592
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,422
<i>Please, what is bezant?</i>

593
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,474
<i>Gold balls.</i>

594
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:24,314
<i>I brought a book on the subject. There's
a picture of my own coat of arms,</i>

595
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,559
<i>which includes four of them,</i>

596
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,359
<i>{women gasp)</i>

597
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,563
<i>if you'd care to see them.</i>

598
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,773
<i>I'd love to. I'm in room...</i>

599
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:38,246
<i>No, no! He will give the book to me.
I will pass it to everyone in turn.</i>

600
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:43,455
<i>- It is fairer like that, yes?
- Of course. If you think so, Fréulein.</i>

601
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,595
<i>Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?</i>

602
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,434
<i>Just a slight stiffness coming on
in the shoulder.</i>

603
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,015
<i>Due to the altitude, no doubt.</i>

604
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,902
<i>Der Graf will ihn jetzt sprechen.</i>

605
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,230
<i>The Count will see you now.</i>

606
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,816
<i>Thank you. Please excuse me, ladies.</i>

607
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,322
<i>May all your allergies be swiftly cured.</i>

608
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,830
<i>{woman) What a nice man!</i>

609
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,000
<i>{woman #2) Sweet!</i>

610
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:34,176
<i>Of course, I know what he's allergic to.</i>

611
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,004
<i>Bezants.</i>

612
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,641
<i>{bell)</i>

613
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:08,535
<i>{high-pitched buzz)</i>

614
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,163
<i>Antisepsis.</i>

615
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,249
<i>{bleeping)</i>

616
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,686
<i>Please wait here.</i>

617
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,907
<i>{high-pitched buzz)</i>

618
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,375
<i>- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.</i>

619
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,583
<i>Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.</i>

620
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,885
<i>If you'll forgive me,
that's what I'm here to find out.</i>

621
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,964
<i>To confirm, Sir Hilary.
There can be no doubt of the truth.</i>

622
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,715
<i>Please, sit down.</i>

623
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,098
<i>If there were no doubt,
the college would not have sent me.</i>

624
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:11,439
<i>Well, since you are here,
I'll make everything very plain to you.</i>

625
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,812
<i>To begin with,
I was born without ear lobes.</i>

626
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,816
<i>A well-known congenital
distinction of Bleuchamp ancestry.</i>

627
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,945
<i>Like the Hapsburg lip,
or the hawknose of the Medicis.</i>

628
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,415
<i>Granted, but the fact
you're of de Bleuchamp ancestry</i>

629
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,743
<i>doesn't make you the reigning count.</i>

630
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,702
<i>I feel it in my blood and in my bones.</i>

631
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,756
<i>The college will require
more concrete proofs.</i>

632
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,049
<i>And it shall have them.</i>

633
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:43,381
<i>I have all the relevant documents:
title deeds, certificates of birth and death.</i>

634
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,057
<i>They'll be sent to your room
for authentication.</i>

635
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,932
<i>And you've only to ask Fréulein Bunt
for anything at all you may require.</i>

636
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,390
<i>- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.</i>

637
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:58,946
<i>Well, the methods of the great pioneers
have often puzzled conventional minds.</i>

638
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:03,321
<i>I have devised a cure for allergies
which depends on holding</i>

639
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:07,287
<i>an unusual and rather delicate
psychological balance.</i>

640
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,832
<i>So, you see, I must impose
special conditions on my patients.</i>

641
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,668
<i>And, erm, your laboratories?</i>

642
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,880
<i>The cure is not entirely
psychological, Sir Hilary.</i>

643
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,044
<i>There are vaccines to be prepared.</i>

644
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,715
<i>Vaccines which must be modified
to suit each individual case.</i>

645
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,713
<i>So, you see, I'm a very busy man.</i>

646
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,967
<i>I might not be able to spare you
as much time as I might wish.</i>

647
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,350
<i>If you wish to be confirmed as the Count,
you must give me some of your time.</i>

648
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,940
<i>I need details of living relatives,
your parents and grandparents.</i>

649
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,861
<i>- The documents you will see...
- Can answer many questions, but not all.</i>

650
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,605
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

651
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:45,283
<i>- Could you accompany me to Augsburg?
- Augsburg?</i>

652
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,827
<i>The ancestral home
of the de Bleuchamp family.</i>

653
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:52,578
<i>There are notable Bleuchamp tombs, and
important records in the city archives.</i>

654
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,168
<i>If you yourself were there to assist...</i>

655
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,462
<i>That may not be convenient
for some time.</i>

656
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,211
<i>But I'm determined
my title shall be recognised.</i>

657
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:04,381
<i>- Proceed with your preliminary research.
- I'll be happy to start straightaway.</i>

658
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,511
<i>Thank you, Herr Grunther.</i>

659
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:44,604
<i>{Fréulein Bunt) ...al/e eingeschlossen
sind. Der Gast darf nicht gestért werden.</i>

660
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:48,486
<i>Du hast zwar nichts gefunden,
aber bleib wachsam.</i>

661
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,368
<i>- Sir Hilary!
- Shh...</i>

662
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,707
<i>{whispers) I've brought you the book.</i>

663
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:43,249
<i>- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.</i>

664
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,498
<i>- I want to see the pictures.
- But you're a picture yourself.</i>

665
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,084
<i>And twice as lovely in the firelight.</i>

666
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,428
<i>You are funny
at pretending not to like girls.</i>

667
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,674
<i>Well, I don't usually, but you're not usual.</i>

668
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,769
<i>That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.</i>

669
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,934
<i>Oh, Sir Hilary!</i>

670
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:05,021
<i>Call me Hilly.</i>

671
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,726
<i>Hilly.</i>

672
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,732
<i>- What's your name?
- Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.</i>

673
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,450
<i>- Morecambe Bay actually.
- How did you get here?</i>

674
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,287
<i>Do we have to talk about that now?</i>

675
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,380
<i>Ooh!</i>

676
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,386
<i>{laughing) It's true!</i>

677
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,433
<i>How did you get here?</i>

678
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,228
<i>I had this awful allergy about chickens.</i>

679
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:55,780
<i>My family's got a chicken farm and every
time I did something on it, I nearly died.</i>

680
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,451
<i>The specialist said there was a wonderful
Swiss clinic where they cured you free</i>

681
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,824
<i>because they were researching.</i>

682
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,165
<i>Go on.</i>

683
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,584
<i>- No, about the clinic, I mean.
- Oh!</i>

684
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:14,507
<i>Well, the specialist had me
meet Fréulein Bunt in London</i>

685
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,471
<i>and she said I had
a very interesting case.</i>

686
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,307
<i>How right she was.</i>

687
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,348
<i>Oh, Hilly!</i>

688
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,516
<i>-{alarm)
- Oh, bother!</i>

689
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,019
<i>No, Hilly.</i>

690
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,521
<i>It's part of the cure.</i>

691
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,484
<i>Cassette number seven.</i>

692
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,493
<i>Number eight.</i>

693
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,466
<i>{Blofeld) Do you remember
when you first came here,</i>

694
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,464
<i>how you hated chickens?</i>

695
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,463
<i>How you were sick
when you even saw one?</i>

696
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:04,516
<i>But all that is over now,
for! have shown you how foolish it was</i>

697
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,888
<i>And your cure is nearly done.</i>

698
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:10,104
<i>I have taught you to love chickens.</i>

699
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,528
<i>To love their ﬂesh, their voice.</i>

700
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,231
<i>Yes, your cure is nearly done.</i>

701
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,735
<i>- And soon you will go home
- Ruby!</i>

702
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,487
<i>- To look after the chickens,
- Ruby, wake up!</i>

703
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,664
<i>Which you love so much.</i>

704
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,959
<i>You do love me just a little,
don't you, Hilly?</i>

705
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,286
<i>Ruby?</i>

706
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:33,089
<i>I must teach you
how to give them special care</i>

707
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,841
<i>I will tell you what to do.</i>

708
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,716
<i>- Ruby, wake up!
-/ will tell you when.</i>

709
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,930
<i>I will tell you how.</i>

710
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,767
<i>And after you've done what I teach you,</i>

711
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,554
<i>you will forget it for ever.</i>

712
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,897
<i>For ever.</i>

713
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,039
<i>Hilly, you old devil.</i>

714
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,921
<i>It is me, yes?</i>

715
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,718
<i>Quite undeniably, yes.</i>

716
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,138
<i>How did you get out?</i>

717
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,803
<i>With a fingernail file.</i>

718
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,555
<i>It's so easy!</i>

719
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,107
<i>Mm, I wouldn't know.</i>

720
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,941
<i>I come to see the book.
The pictures, yes?</i>

721
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,815
<i>Oh, jolly good idea.
Now, where did I put it?</i>

722
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:44,069
<i>Mm, I had it a few moments ago.</i>

723
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:47,288
<i>- Perhaps if we turn on the light.
- No!</i>

724
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,333
<i>You're a picture yourself.</i>

725
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,952
<i>And twice as lovely in the firelight.</i>

726
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,751
<i>- But, Sir Hilary...
- Hilly.</i>

727
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,549
<i>But I think you do not like girls, Hilly.</i>

728
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,594
<i>Usually I don't, but you're not usual.</i>

729
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,966
<i>Coming here like this
was an inspiration, and so are you.</i>

730
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:07,974
<i>Mmm!</i>

731
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,436
<i>- You'll need to be.
- What you say?</i>

732
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,357
<i>I said a miracle our meeting like this.
I don't even know your name.</i>

733
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,647
<i>I tell you all about myself later.</i>

734
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:20,780
<i>In the morning.</i>

735
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,204
<i>{music on radio)</i>

736
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,313
<i>Hey!</i>

737
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,273
<i>What about a lift to the top?</i>

738
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,780
<i>It is not permitted. All is private.</i>

739
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,239
<i>Surely there's a restaurant, a sports club
up there. I've seen them advertised.</i>

740
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,164
<i>- It's all closed down.
- Since when? I've seen them advertised.</i>

741
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:18,416
<i>You are mistaken, sir.
For many weeks now they are finished.</i>

742
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,631
<i>I'd still like to get to the top.</i>

743
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:24,506
<i>From here upwards now is forbidden!
Private! Closed!</i>

744
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,381
<i>All right.</i>

745
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,407
<i>{woman) Hey!</i>

746
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,581
<i>It's my go now.</i>

747
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,751
<i>Let go! {laughing)</i>

748
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,587
<i>- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.</i>

749
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:07,884
<i>Good morning, Sir Hilary.
Your stiffness of last night, it is all gone?</i>

750
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,800
<i>- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.</i>

751
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,177
<i>- Won't it be frightfully energetic?
- No.</i>

752
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,604
<i>-{Bunt) We will show you.
- You can teach me.</i>

753
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,572
<i>Come on, Sir Hilary.</i>

754
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,779
<i>We expect great things of you.</i>

755
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,746
<i>{laughing)</i>

756
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:42,126
<i>- We're leaving very soon. I must see you.
- Eight o'clock tonight.</i>

757
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,628
<i>{crows cawing)</i>

758
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,353
<i>And the man was alone?</i>

759
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:07,484
<i>- Ah! Good morning, ladies.
-{all) Morning!</i>

760
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:10,529
<i>Good morning, Sir Hilary,
and how's your research?</i>

761
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,402
<i>Riveting. And very promising too.</i>

762
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,205
<i>{man) I've never heard
anything so ridiculous.</i>

763
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,575
<i>Since when is climbing
a criminal of fence?</i>

764
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:24,130
<i>- Excuse me. Piz Gloria's private property.
- The whole bloody Alp?! Ridiculous!</i>

765
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:28,005
<i>There are many signs,
and my servant warned you at the station.</i>

766
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,086
<i>Your throw, I think it is.</i>

767
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:33,343
<i>No, Fraulein! I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.</i>

768
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,717
<i>That didn't count. You can throw again.</i>

769
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,060
<i>- Yes! Go on!
- Very civil of you.</i>

770
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,350
<i>That doesn't entitle you to shoot at me.</i>

771
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:44,351
<i>- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the director of this institute.</i>

772
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,693
<i>Oh!</i>

773
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,909
<i>You'll be sent down by cable car
and you will not trouble us again.</i>

774
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,951
<i>What about my clobber? My belongings?</i>

775
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,576
<i>- They'll be sent down later.
- But they're mine!</i>

776
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:01,326
<i>We have certain rules
which must be observed.</i>

777
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,874
<i>- The authorities'll hear about this.
- Good day, sir.</i>

778
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:14,430
<i>- Director, or Count, as I think I can say.
- Yes?</i>

779
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,180
<i>I'd like the afternoon off,
so if the cable car's going down...</i>

780
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,387
<i>But you've already had the morning off.</i>

781
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,482
<i>I must have some fresh air.
Your ancestors are very hard work.</i>

782
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,106
<i>And the College of Arms
is being very well paid.</i>

783
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,983
<i>- Well, if you put it like that...
- I do put it like that.</i>

784
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,942
<i>Let me show you what I've achieved,
then we can go to Augsburg.</i>

785
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,411
<i>Not over Christmas.
The archives will be closed, no?</i>

786
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,536
<i>Come, girls. Time for our massage.</i>

787
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,708
<i>{Bunt) Girls, that is
enough curling for today.</i>

788
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,914
<i>{murmurs of disappointment)</i>

789
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,798
<i>- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?</i>

790
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,473
<i>Ten?</i>

791
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,642
<i>Well, back to work.</i>

792
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,932
<i>You've no idea how it's piling up.</i>

793
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,749
<i>Ruby? It's me.</i>

794
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,497
<i>Hilly.</i>

795
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,377
<i>- Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.
-{giggling)</i>

796
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,333
<i>Has that old cow told you...</i>

797
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,093
<i>Fancy meeting you here, Fréulein!</i>

798
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,733
<i>Merry Christmas, 007.</i>

799
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,993
<i>- I'm Sir Hilary Bray.
- Oh, no, no, no, Mr Bond.</i>

800
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:08,124
<i>Respectable baronets from colleges
do not seduce female patients in clinics.</i>

801
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:12,252
<i>On the other hand, they do get
their professional details right.</i>

802
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:15,505
<i>The Bleuchamp tombs
are not in the Augsburg Cathedral,</i>

803
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,382
<i>but in the St Anna Kirche.</i>

804
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,968
<i>Sir Hilary Bray would have known.</i>

805
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,471
<i>A small slip.</i>

806
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:25,428
<i>Takes more than a few props
to turn 007 into a herald.</i>

807
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:29,186
<i>It'll take more than cutting off
your ear lobes to turn you into a count.</i>

808
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,770
<i>I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid
that you have no surprises left for me.</i>

809
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,696
<i>I know all about your mission, Mr Bond.</i>

810
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,399
<i>Your colleague:</i>

811
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:43,738
<i>such a keen climber, such a brilliant
conversationalist. Before he left us.</i>

812
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,161
<i>- He reported where I am.
- I doubt that.</i>

813
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,585
<i>In any case,
no one's coming to your rescue.</i>

814
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:55,042
<i>In a few hours, the United Nations
will receive our yuletide greetings.</i>

815
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:59,550
<i>The information that I now possess
the scientific means to control,</i>

816
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,757
<i>or to destroy, the economy
of the whole world.</i>

817
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,014
<i>People will have more important things
to think of than you.</i>

818
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,596
<i>- If they believe your threat.
-{chuckles)</i>

819
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:13,067
<i>Oh, they will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.</i>

820
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,817
<i>Remember that disagreeable outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease</i>

821
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,989
<i>in England last summer?</i>

822
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:26,121
<i>I shall instruct them, in very convincing
terms, exactly how I arranged that.</i>

823
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:29,120
<i>And my capacity has improved since.</i>

824
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,206
<i>Allergy vaccines?</i>

825
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,960
<i>Bacteria.</i>

826
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,714
<i>- Bacteriological warfare.
- With a difference.</i>

827
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,215
<i>Our great breakthrough
since last summer</i>

828
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:45,266
<i>has been the confection
of a certain virus omega.</i>

829
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:49,603
<i>- Infertility.
- Total infertility. In plants and animals.</i>

830
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,434
<i>Not just disease in a few herds, Mr Bond
or the loss of a single crop.</i>

831
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:59,317
<i>But the destruction of a whole strain
for ever, throughout an entire continent.</i>

832
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:03,151
<i>If my demands are not met,
I'll proceed with the extinction</i>

833
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,533
<i>of whole species of cereals
and livestock all over the world.</i>

834
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,952
<i>Including, I suppose, the human race.</i>

835
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,330
<i>I don't think, do you, Mr Bond,</i>

836
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,628
<i>the UN will let it come to that.</i>

837
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:19,459
<i>Not after their scientists analyse a sample
of virus omega they have received.</i>

838
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,635
<i>Epidemics of sterility.</i>

839
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:25,590
<i>Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.</i>

840
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,139
<i>- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!</i>

841
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,391
<i>If I give them enough time.</i>

842
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,317
<i>They'll have time. Once they're warned,
you'll have problems dispensing the stuff.</i>

843
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,111
<i>That problem has already been solved.</i>

844
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:43,191
<i>I have been training
my own special "angels of death".</i>

845
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:47,153
<i>- Those girls?
- Those girls. And many others like them.</i>

846
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,872
<i>But exactly how?</i>

847
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,367
<i>That will remain my secret.</i>

848
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,084
<i>And how many millions do you
want for your services this time?</i>

849
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,631
<i>This time?</i>

850
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:03,461
<i>This time the price is different. You'll be
more amused when you know what.</i>

851
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,047
<i>Meanwhile, I will
keep you here as my guest.</i>

852
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,350
<i>You'll be useful in helping
to convince the authorities</i>

853
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,598
<i>that I mean what I say</i>

854
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:13,771
<i>and I'll do what I claim.</i>

855
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:16,982
<i>Come, let me show you
to your new quarters.</i>

856
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,988
<i>You're likely to be with us
for some time, Mr Bond.</i>

857
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,736
<i>So first,</i>

858
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,568
<i>a little therapy
to soothe your restless nature.</i>

859
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:28,903
<i>Oh,</i>

860
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:31,705
<i>poor fellow. He was restless, too.</i>

861
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,626
<i>You perverse British,
how you love your exercise.</i>

862
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:40,207
<i>Every year, dozens of amateur climbers,
they wind up in the same predicament.</i>

863
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:43,793
<i>A kind of waxwork show
for morbid tourists.</i>

864
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,174
<i>{tuts) Dear, dear me.</i>

865
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:58,649
<i>Now, now, now, now, Mr Bond,
you must learn to be absolutely calm</i>

866
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,694
<i>before we can accept you back
into polite society.</i>

867

<i>- I want to open mine now!
- Oh, no!</i>

873
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,417
<i>It is more fun
to open them all together, yes?</i>

874
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,344
<i>Please sit down.
We will wait for the others.</i>

884
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:52,341

885
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,002

- Or of someone saying thank you.</i>

01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:55,692
<i>Thank you, Tracy.</i>

<i>Now I have a new interest in life.</i>

992
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:07,951
<i>- Winter sports? Very wholesome.
- Just one winter sportsman.</i>

993
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:10,161

<i>Sorry about the accommodation,

<i>We should have rung ahead and booked.</i>

<i>If only I'd got through to London.</i>

<i>Mm-mm. Her Majesty's Secret Service
is still my job.</i>

1037
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:49,394

1039

<i>I'm not.</i>

1041
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,421
<i>I'm thinking about us.</i>

1042
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:19,257
<i>Tracy, an agent shouldn't be concerned
with anything but himself.</i>

1043
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,432
<i>I understand.</i>

1044
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:28,391
<i>- We'll just have to go on the way we are.
- No.</i>

1045
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,898
<i>I'll have to find something else to do.</i>

1046
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,116
<i>Are you sure, James?</i>

1047
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,870
<i>I love you.</i>

1048
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,123
<i>I know I'll never find another girl like you.</i>

1049
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:49,787
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

1050
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:02,971
<i>D'you mean it?</i>

1051
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:04,559
<i>I mean it.</i>

1052
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,659
<i>Mr and Mrs James Bond.</i>

<i>Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.</i>

01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,328
<i>Mm. How about Belgrave Square?</i>

1055
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:30,002
<i>Or the Via Veneto, Rome?</i>

1056
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:33,501
<i>Paris. Convenient for Le Touquet.</i>

1057
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:36,299
<i>Monaco. Handy for the Rainiers.</i>

1058
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,846
<i>I wonder how much
they're asking for this place.</i>

1059
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:44,016
<i>{Tracy laughs}</i>

1060
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:49,017
<i>The proper time for this
is our wedding night.</i>

1061
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,687
<i>And that's my New Year's resolution.</i>

1062
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:55,690
<i>- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.</i>

1063

<i>Good night, Tracy.</i>

1064
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:07,156
<i>Good night, James.</i>

01:53:24,172 --> 01:53:27,221
<i>- Oh!
- It's not New Year yet!</i>

1066
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:20,775
<i>- James!
- Keep going!</i>

1067
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:01,737

<i>Tracy, cling on to me!</i>

1076
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:11,168
<i>A grave deep enough, I think,
to prevent even 007 from walking.</i>

1077
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:16,673
<i>Get the girl.</i>

<i>Yes, we're standing by as instructed.</i>

1082
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:01,893
<i>I understand.</i>

1083
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:06,015
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

1084
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:08,396
<i>No decision has been announced yet.</i>

1085
01:59:08,516 --> 01:59:13,568
<i>Of course, there's a total news blackout,
but my informant was very plain.</i>

1086
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:17,033
<i>- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.</i>

1087
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:21,413
<i>Sit down.</i>

1088
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:24,745
<i>- And the price?
- Amnesty.</i>

1089
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:27,335
<i>A full pardon for all past crimes.</i>

1090

<i>Official recognition of his title

<i>as Count de Bleuchamp.</i>

1092
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:37,929
<i>He seems to set a great store by that.</i>

1093
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:41,183
<i>A very curious thing, snobbery.</i>

1094
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:43,180
<i>When will they conclude the deal?</i>

1095
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:46,763
<i>Blofeld wants a decision
by midnight the day after tomorrow.</i>

1096
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:50,518
<i>Sir, that gives us time
to get to Piz Gloria first -in force.</i>

1097
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,194
<i>No, 007. My instructions are clear.</i>

1098
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:56,443
<i>Sir, destroy the institute
and Blofeld's virus with it.</i>

1099
01:59:56,564 --> 01:59:58,783
<i>It's been rejected as too risky.</i>

1100
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,369
<i>Those girls.</i>

1101
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:04,118
<i>God knows how many, let alone where.</i>

1102
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:08,289
<i>Sir, if we destroy the centre of
communication that controls the girls,</i>

1103
02:00:08,368 --> 02:00:10,211
<i>the girls can do nothing.</i>

1104
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:13,631
<i>I have my orders, 007.
You have yours. Forget it.</i>

1105
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:16,085
<i>And the girl who helped me
We just leave her?</i>

1106
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:20,468
<i>This department is not concerned
with your personal problems.</i>

1107
02:00:20,588 --> 02:00:23,637
<i>This department owes her a debt.</i>

1108
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:26,477
<i>- She saved my life.
- Operation Bedlam is dead.</i>

1109
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:30,565
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1110
02:00:31,141 --> 02:00:33,235

<i>- Hello, Draco.
- Who is it?</i>

1114
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:41,989
<i>- Bond. James Bond.
- Thank God, James.</i>

1115
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:46,616
<i>I'd like to interest you in a deal requiring
certain aerial activity to install equipment.</i>

<i>Are you sure we're going to find Teresa
when we get up there?</i>

1117
02:00:57,125 --> 02:01:00,755
<i>I'm pretty certain.
There's a good reason for going anyway.</i>

1118
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:03,181
<i>So you've explained. Quite a crusade.</i>

1119
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:09,521
<i>It is a time for celebration.</i>

1120
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,936
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1121
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:15,360
<i>- If they agree.
- They can do nothing else. You know it.</i>

1122
02:01:15,477 --> 02:01:17,525
<i>And they know it.</i>

1123
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:22,450
<i>I shall be able to offer you
anything your heart could wish for.</i>

1124
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:25,453
<i>Paid for with how many lives?</i>

1125
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:29,704
<i>Oh, come now, Tracy,
don't be so proud.</i>

1126
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,795
<i>Your own father's profession

Information. Land at Ziirich and report.</i>

1150
02:03:03,334 --> 02:03:06,838
<i>I say again,
land at Ziirich and report, over.</i>

1151
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:11,142
<i>Do you wish to commit murder?
I told you, this is a mercy flight</i>

1152
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:15,438
<i>carrying blood plasma
and emergency equipment</i>

1153
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:19,609
<i>for the victims
of the Italian flood disaster at Rovigo.</i>

1154
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:23,272
<i>I repeat, mercy flight!</i>

1155
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:25,027
<i>D'you understand me?</i>

1156
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:27,942
<i>- Golf Sierra?
- Yes?</i>

1157
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,779
<i>Ziirich. Very well, you may proceed, out.</i>

1158
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:32,910
<i>You see, it is nothing.</i>

1159
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:34,866
<i>That's settled it.</i>

1160
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:39,830
<i>In case one of us is delayed on the way
home, it's better to have a rendezvous.</i>

1161
02:03:39,913 --> 02:03:43,668
<i>Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.</i>

1162
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,218
<i>I've been thinking</i>

1163
02:03:45,293 --> 02:03:47,387
<i>about your proposition.</i>

1164
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:51,591
<i>Please tell me more.</i>

1165
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:55,304
<i>This is military air control.
There is no record of your mission.</i>

1166
02:03:55,386 --> 02:03:57,263
<i>Alter course to Ziirich and land.</i>

1167
02:03:57,347 --> 02:04:00,066
<i>Fighters have been dispatched
to intercept you.</i>

1168
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:03,862
<i>I suggest you check your records again.</i>

1169
02:04:03,937 --> 02:04:05,610
<i>Carefully. Over.</i>

1170
02:04:05,688 --> 02:04:08,282
<i>I repeat, return to Zrjirfch and land, over.</i>

1171
02:04:08,358 --> 02:04:11,953
<i>Check with Geneva.
Check with the Red Cross in Geneva.</i>

1172
02:04:13,196 --> 02:04:15,745
<i>Meanwhile, call off your air force.</i>

1173
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:17,917
<i>It is making my passengers sick.</i>

1174
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:21,087
<i>Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
you are carrying passengers?</i>

1175
02:04:21,162 --> 02:04:23,256
<i>Of course I am.</i>

1176
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:27,795
<i>Distinguished representatives
of the world press.</i>

1177
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:31,635
<i>They've had enough
of your nonsense. So have I.</i>

1178
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:33,808
<i>Over and out.</i>

1179
02:04:38,262 --> 02:04:40,310
<i>There's a lot more to tell,</i>

1180
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:42,939
<i>but there'll be plenty of time later.</i>

1181
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:45,562
<i>- Take me to the Alpine room.
- Oh?</i>

1182
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:47,522
<i>Are you unhappy here?</i>

1183
02:04:47,605 --> 02:04:50,734
<i>Oh, I want to see the dawn.</i>

1184
02:04:50,817 --> 02:04:54,572
<i>Ah, so poetic a pleasure.</i>

1185
02:04:55,488 --> 02:04:58,958
<i>What were all the world's charms
to mighty Paris</i>

1186
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:02,708
<i>when he found that first dawn
in the arms of his Helen?</i>

1187
02:05:04,414 --> 02:05:08,169
<i>And when do you expect the signal
accepting your terms?</i>

1188
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:11,095
<i>Any time before midnight tonight.</i>

1189
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:16,059
<i>"Thy dawn, O Master of the World,

<i>James, wait!</i>

1211
02:08:31,078 --> 02:08:34,082
<i>- Guns make me nervous.
- You've done your share.</i>

1212
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,259
<i>Get her to safety!</i>

1213
02:08:41,172 --> 02:08:43,345
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

1214
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,676
<i>YOU.</i>

1215
02:08:44,759 --> 02:08:47,478
<i>Get the circuits set up now. Let's go!</i>

1216
02:08:51,182 --> 02:08:52,900
<i>Argh!</i>

1217
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:29,269
<i>- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.</i>

<i>five minutes, ten seconds.
The place will be sealed off for ever.</i>

1222
02:10:33,659 --> 02:10:36,708
<i>Will that give the Englishman
time to get out?</i>

1223
02:10:36,787 --> 02:10:38,460
<i>He knows the schedule.</i>

1224
02:10:49,967 --> 02:10:52,061
<i>- Where are you going?
- Where's James?</i>

1225
02:10:52,136 --> 02:10:53,604
<i>He'll join us soon.</i>

1226
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,182
<i>- We can't leave him!
- He doesn't need you.</i>

1227

- You'll have to.</i>

<i>Spare the rod and spoil the child, eh?</i>

1229

<i>Ah!</i>

1233
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:05,431

<i>Ah! Oh!</i>

1235
02:15:30,873 --> 02:15:33,672
<i>Never mind that!
Go and get the brandy, huh?</i>

1236
02:15:34,335 --> 02:15:36,429
<i>Five-star Hennessy, of course.</i>

<i>- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.</i>

1244
02:16:40,275 --> 02:16:42,369
<i>Anyway, it is a pleasure</i>

1245

<i>to meet the man who cost me
three of my best operators.</i>

1246

<i>Yes. November '64 -the bullion job.</i>

1247
02:16:49,368 --> 02:16:52,372
<i>You even got away with
quite a chunk of the haul.</i>

1250
02:16:59,586 --> 02:17:03,966
<i>Congratulations, 007. I must confess
I've sometimes thought you a little, erm...</i>

1251
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:07,849
<i>- Irresponsible?
- Exactly! That's the word. Thank you!</i>

1252
02:17:07,928 --> 02:17:11,307
<i>- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.</i>

1253
02:17:13,434 --> 02:17:14,686
<i>- Teresa.
- Yes, Papa?</i>

1254
02:17:14,768 --> 02:17:17,942
<i>Look, James, I know that
we haven't always exactly seen...</i>

1255
02:17:18,021 --> 02:17:20,865
<i>Well, don't forget,
if there's anything you need...</i>

1256
02:17:20,941 --> 02:17:24,491
<i>Thank you, but this time I have
the gadgets and I know how to use them.</i>

1257
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:26,447
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1258
02:17:26,864 --> 02:17:30,869
<i>Remember, obey your husband
in all things. You promise me?</i>

1259
02:17:30,951 --> 02:17:32,828
<i>But of course I will.</i>

1260
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:35,005
<i>As I always obeyed you.</i>

1261
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:39,885
<i>Of course.</i>

1262
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:42,133
<i>Well, James, lwish you luck.</i>

1263
02:17:42,212 --> 02:17:44,931
<i>For the first and last time, remember?</i>

1264
02:17:45,382 --> 02:17:47,055
<i>An old proverb.</i>

1265
02:17:47,134 --> 02:17:50,729
<i>"Her price is far above rubies",
or even your million pounds.</i>

don't forget my birthday next year.</i>

- Both of you, or maybe all of you!</i>

1268
02:18:00,397 --> 02:18:02,491
<i>Come on, James!</i>

1269
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:05,823
<i>Very happy. Be happy, my darling.</i>

1270
02:18:07,404 --> 02:18:09,498
<i>Come on.</i>

1271
02:18:09,573 --> 02:18:11,291
<i>On your way.</i>

1272
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:13,243
<i>- Au revoir.
- G ood bye!</i>

1273
02:18:13,327 --> 02:18:15,204

<i>Miss Moneypenny,
what would you do without me?</i>

1276
02:18:29,384 --> 02:18:31,478
<i>I always cry at weddings.</i>

1277
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:34,648
<i>O07 never had any respect

<i>{beeps horn}</i>

<i>I haven't given you a wedding present yet.</i>

1280
02:18:42,105 --> 02:18:43,982
<i>I had an idea about that.</i>

1281
02:18:44,066 --> 02:18:46,444
<i>Three girls, three boys.</i>

1282
02:18:46,527 --> 02:18:49,201
<i>- Pleased?
- Mm, not bad for a start.</i>

1283
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,202
<i>But, darling,
now we have all the time in the world.</i>

<i>He's got a point, we do
look like an ad for a flower shop!</i>

1288

<i>And that reminds me,
I didn't even send you ﬂowers.</i>

1289
02:19:16,932 --> 02:19:19,856
<i>Anyway, you have given me
a wedding present.</i>

<i>And don't eat it all at once.</i>

<i>- He loves me.
-Instinctively.</i>

-Indubitably.</i>

She's having a rest.</i>

1305
