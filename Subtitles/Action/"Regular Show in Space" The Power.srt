00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,130
Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,530
to take back what you said about my mom!

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,770
I'll kill you!

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,750
Tag up! Tag up!

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,660
What?!

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,860
Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,130
I think he wants me to put the hurt on him!

9
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,830
I think he wants you to put the hurt on him!

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,460
You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?!

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,400
Yes, I do!

12
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,380
Did you see how awesome it was
when I hit the trampoline?

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,210
Yeah, I did!

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,720
But it wasn't as awesome as
when you punched that hole in the wall!

15
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,060
I can't believe I listened to you!

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,730
I knew I should've got out to do some work,

17
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,830
but no. Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,270
But it WAS fun!

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,240
Well, yeah. But, now there's a big hole in the wall!

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,510
Dude, we're 23 years old,

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,640
we shouldn't be busting holes in walls.
We're gonna get fired for this!

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,580
You mean, YOU'RE gonna get fired for this.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,480
What?

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,410
You're the one who threw me too hard, ya hole!

25
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,280
Don't call me a hole! You're the hole,
you're the one who wanted to wrestle!

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,890
Let's not blame anyone! Now,
how in the "h" are we gonna fix this "s"?

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,190
I don't know man.

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,490
We can't fix it, and we definitely can't
pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money!

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,730
Unless, you have some money.

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,570
No. Besides, I don't even know
how much it costs to fix a hole like this.

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,770
Probably a ton.

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,670
Exactly.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Which leaves us with only ONE possible solution:

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,640
We convince Benson to give us raises

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,980
so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,050
Dude...you are a GENIUS!

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,480
Of COURSE raises!

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,250
-Okay, dude, here's-
-Let me stop you there

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,320
because I already know what you're going to say!

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,390
HAAAAMBONING.

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,490
What?

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,670
No, man! Stop it!

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,170
We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all the-

46
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,240
No, no, NO, that's not gonna work!

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,340
What are you, 65?

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,840
"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,910
COME ON!

50
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,610
I'm telling you, dude! HAAAMBONIIIING.

51
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,780
Noooooo.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,610
Hamboning will save your LIFE someday!

53
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,020
It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,690
No! We're not doing that, okay?

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,790
OKAY?!

56
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,120
Fine...

57
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,560
I know what to do!

58
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,860
Are you ready for raises?

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,970
How did you get that?

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,300
I have my methods.

61
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,450
I don't know, dude.

62
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,090
How's that gonna get us raises?

63
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,320
Aw, come on, man! Look.

64
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,890
Just come check it out.

65
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,100
This is the answer to ALL our problems.

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,270
Have you named her yet?

67
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,540
Actually, I thought YOU could do the honors.

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,270
Really?

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,080
Ya know, I've always wanted to
date a girl named: The Power.

70
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,040
The Power?

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,780
I like it.

72
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,890
Cool...!

73
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,190
Alright, this time with feeling.

74
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,590
Ready?

75
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,460
Give us a raise, loser!

76
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,530
Hey, it's Pops.

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,300
Hello.

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,400
Hey Pops, what's up?

79
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,070
Is that the sound of music I hear?

80
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,810
Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.

81
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,580
I don't know,

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,740
Pops is kind of weird.

83
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,210
Exactly.

84
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,720
At least we can test it out on him,

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,450
and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work. 

86
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,520
Ok.

87
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,820
But let's not call him a loser. 

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,390
Why not? 

89
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,290
He's sensitive.

90
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,220
I don't want him to cry,

91
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,490
I just want him to give us a raise. 

92
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,690
Ok, let's do it.

93
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,690
Hey Pops! Check it.

94
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,700
Give us a raise, Pops!

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Good show,

96
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,310
jolly good show!

97
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,480
A pay increase, yes yes of course.

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,910
Just let me get my billfold. 

99
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,150
Butterscotch Ripple?

100
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,250
 Dude, I think that just worked. 

101
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,990
Yeah, I know. 

102
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,790
 I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird

103
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,660
he might have given us actual money. 

104
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,490
Totally. 

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,770
Hey, Benson.

106
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,180
What are you doing? 

107
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,410
Give us a raise, loser. 

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,650
You know, you guys have been working harder.

109
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,190
I think you deserve a raise.

110
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,560
We can negotiate your new rates later in the week,

111
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,190
but for now,

112
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,760
how's 20 bucks sound?

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,430
Keep up the good work.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,700
Do you realize what this means? 

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,970
We can fix the hole? 

116
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,700
No,

117
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,770
No, we can do everything we ever wanted! 

118
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,280
You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did. 

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,810
What, the flying or the hole? 

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,740
What hole? 

121
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,810
Dude, get to The Power, he knows. 

122
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,750
Knows what?

123
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,680
Nothing Skips,

124
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,420
we were just getting back to work.

125
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,950
Dude, kick it to max power. 

126
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,090
Using the Power in your face,

127
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,130
sending you back to your place.

128
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,360
Don't look at our crotches

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,730
while we synchronize our watches. 

130
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,240
Synchronized.

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,010
Go away Skips,

132
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,850
it's time for you to go away. 

133
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,650
It's time for you to go your room. 

134
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah Skips,

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,920
it's time for you to go to the moon. 

136
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,190
Where'd he go? 

137
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,790
Did you just send Skips to the moon? 

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,030
-Isn't that what you said? 
-No!

139
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,690
room!

140
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,630
I sent him to his room,

141
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,130
not the moon you idiot!

142
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,330
Dude, wish him back. 

143
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,700
But it doesn't work that way. 

144
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,430
What do you mean? 

145
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,170
I can't see him, can I? 

146
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
Then we have to go get him. 

147
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,970
But he's going to be pissed! 

148
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,410
Better than him being dead. 

149
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,080
Hey, have you two seen Skips? 

150
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,580
Rigby sent him to the moon. 

151
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,180
Wait, what? 

152
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,380
We accidentally sent Skips to the moon with this keyboard

153
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,550
and now we have to get him back. 

154
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
I love the moon. 

155
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,220
Come on,

156
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,820
where's Skips? 

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,990
Look, we'll show you. 

158
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,990
Come on, let's go!

159
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,730
You take forever. 

160
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,300
Sorry,

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,660
Pops had to go to the bathroom. 

162
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,730
Twice.

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,270
So what do we do? 

164
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,070
Don't worry,

165
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,940
we got it. 

166
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,100
Take us to the moon!

167
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,970
Won't you take us to the moon? 

168
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,610
Very fun- 

169
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,860
What is all this junk? 

170
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,860
Um, don't get mad at me guys,

171
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,060
but, uh, I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon

172
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,330
while you guys were in the house. 

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,600
A bunch of baby ducks,

174
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
send 'em to the moon!

175
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
Soda machine, that doesn't work,

176
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,730
send 'em to the moon! 

177
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,740
You drillbit!

178
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,970
What else did you send?! 

179
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,310
Look, it's Skips!

180
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,340
There he is! 

181
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,710
Oh great,

182
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,040
it had to be a monster.

183
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,680
What is that? 

184
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,550
Rigby, you guys go get Skips.

185
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,250
We'll pick you up.

00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,150
Ok, ok.

187
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,280
Pops, help me with this. 

188
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,520
Let's go, let's go!

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,690
Give me a break,

191
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,060
I have to come up with the words you know.

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,030
Ok, I got it.

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,130
What? 

196
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,170
Dude, I think the batteries just died. 

197
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,800

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Hurry up dude! 

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,810
The batteries are dead! 

200
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,710
What?! 

201
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,810
Hamboning will save your life someday,

202
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,150

203
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,410

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,820

205
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,720
I know what to do!

206
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,680
Hold this.

207
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,350
Nooo! 

208
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,870
HAMBONING! 

209
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,900
I can't believe you just did that. 

210
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,510
Use your keyboard! 

211
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,710
The batteries are dead. 

212
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,850
Play it! 

213
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,180
TAKE US HOME!

214
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,130
We did it!

215
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,800
Hey, that's mine! 

216
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Nope,

217
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,900

218
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,000
so the least you can do is give him your keyboard,

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,870
right Skips?

220
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,540
Right.

221
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,940
And let's have it. 

222
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,470
What? 

223
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,010
THE 40 DOLLARS YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME

224
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,080

225
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,780

226
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,880

229
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,920
Can you believe this?! 

230
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,820
No!

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,690
Dude this sucks!

232
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,130
The hole's still there!

233
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,430
Do you think Benson noticed it? 

234
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,870
He won't now! 

235
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,540
Dude, you're a genius!
