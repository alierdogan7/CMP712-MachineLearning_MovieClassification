186

This is a Waterman 402.

191

DOLAN THE 36TH: It's very rare.

193
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,654
Probably lowered the value quite a bit.

194
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,623
Not to me.

195

you'll like my successor.

I'm leaving you in more modern hands.

198

What about the vow you took?

199
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:14,238
I vowed to face death at your side.

200
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,074
Not to work until I keel over.

00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,644

whose advice I ever listened to.

204
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,618
Only to ignore it.

205
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,222
But I always listen.

206
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,023

210
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:38,195
But it won't be.

than I can ever imagine,

217
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:53,811

But you'll be fine.

245

Do you know how the elders

00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:30,774
of The Axe and Cross refer to him?

249

They call him "The Weapon."

When I put in my reports,

251

How many witches I've
turned over for detention.

Can you blame them? What
he does is so important.

Yes, that's true, but
he isn't just a weapon.
