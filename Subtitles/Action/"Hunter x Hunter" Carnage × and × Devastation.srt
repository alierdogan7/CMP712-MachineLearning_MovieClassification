1
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,470
I'll kill you!

2
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,110
Ko!

3
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,390
She left herself wide open.

4
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,700
I'm not nice enough to overlook that.

5
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,890
Her attack didn't hit him...

6
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,010
No, she sent a little aura with that swing.

7
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,850
Feitan's idea to use <i>Ko backfired.

8
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,660
After focusing his aura into one point, 
he didn't expect to deal no damage.

9
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,350
The miscalculation left him a second 
late guarding with his <i>Nen.

10
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,910
In other words, he was basically defenseless.

11
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,960
A puny Emitter attack could 
have dealt serious damage.

12
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,020
She knows how to use her aura.

13
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,370
She has good reason to call herself Queen.

14
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,370
This body has no weaknesses!

15
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,120
Shouldn't we help him?

16
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,120
Huh? Why?

17
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
This is a race...

18
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,680
If he loses, the next person gets to try.

19
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,040
Who's up next?

20
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,280
We use order of arrival.

21
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,850
That's me, then.

22
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,040
Wait...

23
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,260
We both arrived at the same time.

24
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,170
Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.

25
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,940
Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.

26
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,940
S-Something's...

27
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,030
wrong with them!

28
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,340
Heads.

29
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,620
Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.
