Then your hands, perhaps.

545
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,792
No, it wasn't my hands,

546
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,960
it was my...

547
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,630
My misunderstanding.

548
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,007
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

549
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,052
MAHARAJAH: I have heard
the evil stories of the Thuggee cult.

550
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,136
(MUSIC STOPS)

551
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,306
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

552
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,060
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

553
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,479
and did of unspeakable things.

554
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,566
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,

555
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,984
and I assure you

556
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,155
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

557
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,908
If I offended you,

558
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,619
then I am sorry.

That's all you better do.

567
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,714
Tell me later what happened.

568
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,465

569
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,061
I've got something for you.

570
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,399
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

571
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,942

00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,790
You're a very nice man.

574
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,543
Maybe you could be my palace slave.

575
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,847

576
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,974
Yeah.

577
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,102
And nothing else.

578
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,104
That shock you?

579
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,856
Nothing shocks me.

580
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,525
I'm a scientist.

581
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,404
So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?

582
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,865
Always.

583
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,451
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

584
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,456
Nocturnal activities.

585
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,584
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

586
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,336
what position I like to sleep in?

587
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,879
Mating customs.

588
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,005
Love rituals?

589
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,008
Primitive sexual practices.

590
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,802
So you're an authority in that area?

591
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,553
Years of fieldwork.

592
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,649
I don't blame you for being sore at me.

593
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,402
I can be hard to handle.

594
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,113
I've had worse.

595
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,949

I don't know.

597
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,956
As a scientist,
I don't want to prejudice my experiment.

598
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,707
I'll let you know in the morning.

599
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,378
Why, you conceited ape.

600
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,713

601

I'm not that easy, either.

602
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,553
Trouble with you is, Willie,

603
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,847
you're too used to getting your own way.

604
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,932
And you're just too proud to admit

605
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,185
that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones.

606
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,730
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

Yes, I understand its power now.

1097
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,617
You could've kept it.

1098
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,619
Ah! What for?
They'd just put it in a museum.

1099
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:52,121
It'd be another rock collecting dust.

1100
01:51:52,206 --> 01:51:55,750
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

1101
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:57,585
Anything could happen.

1102
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:59,879
It's a long way to Delhi.

1103
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,047
No, thanks.

1104
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,382
No more adventures with you,
Dr. Jones.

1105
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:07,053
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

1106
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:11,224
If you think I'm going to Delhi with you,
or anyplace else

1107
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,309
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

1108
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,102
think again, buster!

1109
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:17,605
I'm going home to Missouri
where they never feed you snakes,

1110
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:20,399
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

1111
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:23,986
This is not my idea of a swell time!

1112
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,948
Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

1113
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,425
(TRUMPETING)

1114
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:48,511
(LAUGHING) Very funny.

1115
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,018
Very funny.

1116
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,481
Uh-oh!

1117
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:08,114
(ALL CHEERING)
