ALL FOR A DAY
OF SNOWBOARDING ?

184
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,985
THE BLOOD TEST WAS AGONY.
SERIOUSLY, I WAS SCREAMING.

YOU KNOW, I COULD
TAKE CARE OF DRUCKER.

202
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,046
THAT WAY, YOU COULD HAVE
TIME TO GET OLIVER CLONED.

203
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,548
I'M NOT GETTING THE DOG CLONED.
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK IT OUT.

204
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,551
I KNOW, BUT ONCE YOU SEE IT,
YOU'RE GONNA SAY YES.

205
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,553
I KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU'RE A SOFTY.

206
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,558
UM, THEY SPECIFICALLY
ASKED FOR ADAM BY NAME.
I KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY MEANS.

207
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:21,063
I ALSO KNOW THAT THE BODYGUARDS
CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
THEY NEVER GOT OUR NAMES.

208
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
OH !
THAT'S TRUE.

209
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,067
I KNOW THAT
I SCREW AROUND A LOT.

210
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,570
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FLYING,
YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS.
I COULD DO IT.

WE CAN CLONE YOUR
FOUR-LEGGED LOVED ONE
IN JUST A FEW SHORT HOURS.

242
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,729
HOW CAN WE DO IT ?
IT ALL BEGINS WITH
THE GROWING OF BLANKS,

243
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,232
ANIMAL DRONES
STRIPPED OF ALL
CHARACTERISTIC D.N.A.,

244
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,235
IN EMBRYONIC TANKS
AT THE REPET FACTORY.

245
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:17,739
IN STAGE TWO, YOUR PET'S D.N.A.
IS EXTRACTED FROM A LOCK OF FUR
OR DROP OF BLOOD...

246
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,743
AND THEN INFUSED
ON A CELLULAR LEVEL
INTO THE BLANK.

247
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,247
IN THE FINAL STAGE,
USING REPET'S PATENTED
CEREBRAL SYNCORDING PROCESS,

248
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,250
ALL OF YOUR PET'S THOUGHTS,
MEMORIES AND INSTINCTS...

249
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,752
ARE PAINLESSLY TRANSPLANTED
VIA THE OPTIC NERVE.

250
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:35,757
STILL CAN'T MAKE UP
YOUR MIND, HUH ?

251
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,260
YOU LOST A DOG, RIGHT ?

252
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,763
YES.  MY DAUGHTER'S.
OH, WHAT A HEARTBREAK.

253
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,766
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS AGAIN ?

254
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:50,772

WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL
THIS WEEK, 20% OFF.

255

SOMETIME THIS MORNING.

256
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
THAT'S PERFECT.
WE CAN STILL DO
A POSTMORTEM SYNCORDING.

257
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,281
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ACT FAST.
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY A 12-HOUR
WINDOW ON DECEASED BRAINS.

258
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,783
I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT WHOLE IDEA.

259
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,786
I MEAN, SUPPOSE
THAT CLONES HAVE NO SOUL,
OR THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

260
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:10,292
CLONE PETS ARE EVERY BIT
AS SAFE AS REAL PETS.
PLUS... THEY'RE INSURED.

261
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:15,297
IF IT IS SO SAFE,
THEN WHY IS IT AGAINST THE LAW
TO CLONE HUMAN BEINGS ?

262
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,300
BECAUSE THE HUMAN BRAIN
IS MUCH TOO COMPLICATED
TO SYNCORD.

263
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,302
NOW, YOU REMEMBER THAT
EXPERIMENT THEY DID, RIGHT ?

264
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,306
YES.
THAT'S WHY THAT DIDN'T WORK.
NOW IT'S ILLEGAL TO EVEN TRY.

265
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
BUT WITH PETS,
IT'S A TOTALLY PROVEN
TECHNOLOGY.

266
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,313
YOUR REPET, OLIVER, WILL BE
EXACTLY THE SAME DOG.

267
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,817
HE'LL KNOW ALL THE
SAME TRICKS YOU TAUGHT HIM,
WHERE THE BONES ARE BURIED.

268
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:40,822
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A CLONE.
AND, DID I MENTION ?
THEY'RE INSURED.

269
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,824
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE INSURANCE.

270
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,328
I CARE ABOUT IF I CAN TRUST
MY DAUGHTER WITH A LARGE ANIMAL
WITH SHARP TEETH.

WE CAN MAKE HIM SMALLER

YOU CAN ?

00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,337
