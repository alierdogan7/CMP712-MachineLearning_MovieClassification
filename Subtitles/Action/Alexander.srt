in Macedonia, married, raised a family.

1878
02:45:58,115 --> 02:46:01,202
He'd have died a celebrated man.

1879
02:46:03,579 --> 02:46:06,332
But this was not Alexander.

1880
02:46:06,707 --> 02:46:12,588
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

1881
02:46:12,755 --> 02:46:18,928
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

1882
02:46:20,304 --> 02:46:24,266
The freest man I've ever known.

1883
02:46:25,935 --> 02:46:30,940
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

1884
02:46:31,107 --> 02:46:34,860
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

1885
02:46:35,236 --> 02:46:37,863
And if his desire...

1886
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:42,952
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

1887
02:46:45,496 --> 02:46:48,624
What failure!

1888
02:46:48,874 --> 02:46:55,047
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

1889
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:01,470
I've lived--

1890
02:47:01,679 --> 02:47:04,056
I've lived long life, Cad mos...

1891
02:47:04,265 --> 02:47:06,559
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

1892
02:47:06,767 --> 02:47:11,689
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

1893
02:47:12,148 --> 02:47:17,403
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

1894
02:47:18,571 --> 02:47:22,491
...Megas Alexandros.

1895
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:27,163
The greatest Alexander of them all.

1896
